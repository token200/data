Linus Neumann was a brilliant and reclusive programmer who spent most of his days holed up in his small apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty textbooks and flickering computer screens. Despite his introverted nature, he was the go-to expert for all things encryption and cryptography.

One fateful evening, as Linus Neumann sat hunched over his keyboard, typing away at a new algorithm, he received an unexpected visit from a government agent. The agent, dressed in a crisp black suit, introduced himself as Agent Thompson and claimed that Linus Neumann's work was being watched closely.

Linus Neumann raised an eyebrow, skeptical of the stranger's intentions. "What makes you think I'm doing anything illicit?" he asked, his voice laced with a hint of defensiveness.

Agent Thompson smiled blandly, producing a folder full of classified documents from his briefcase. "We've been tracking your work, Mr. Neumann," he said, using Linus's full name for the first time that evening. "Your encryption methods are unparalleled, and we believe they could be used to breach even the most secure systems."

Linus Neumann snorted in derision, shaking his head. "I'm not some sort of spy or mercenary, Agent Thompson," he said firmly. "I simply enjoy solving problems, and cryptography is my passion. I've dedicated my life to advancing this field, not serving any particular agenda."

Despite his protestations, Linus Neumann couldn't shake the feeling that Agent Thompson was hiding something. The agent's words were laced with a subtle undertone of urgency, as if the government truly believed Linus Neumann's work could be used against them.

As the evening wore on, Linus Neumann found himself walking Agent Thompson out of his apartment building, the cool night air a welcome respite from the tension that had built inside him. "Just remember, Mr. Neumann," Agent Thompson said as he departed, "your work is being watched, and you'd do well to be cautious."

Linus Neumann watched him disappear into the darkness, his mind whirling with possibilities. He knew that his full name – Linus Neumann – would soon become synonymous with intrigue and danger, but for now, he just wanted to get back to his coding, where the only threats were those of the digital realm.
