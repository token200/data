Linus Wei-lun was a young and ambitious journalist who had just landed her dream job at a prestigious news organization. With a passion for uncovering hidden truths and telling stories that needed to be told, she was determined to make a name for herself in the industry.

As she settled into her new role, Linus couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and nervousness.

With her heart racing and her mind racing with possibilities, Linus Wei-lun took a deep breath and steeled herself for the long road ahead. She would follow the trail of clues, no matter where it led, and bring justice to those who needed it most. The fate of this story - and of her own career - hung in the balance.
