Linus Straume stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the quaint station that had been his home for the past few years. As the estranged son of a wealthy industrialist, Linus had grown up with every privilege imaginable - but he'd never felt like he fit in.

After a falling out with his father over their differing views on social responsibility, Linus had struck out on his own, traveling the world and learning new skills to make a difference. He'd settled in this small town, where everyone knew each other's names and faces, and he could blend into the crowd.

But as much as Linus tried to keep to himself, he couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching him. He glanced around at the familiar faces of the townsfolk, but none of them seemed out of place. Shrugging it off, he grabbed his bag and headed into town.

At the local diner, Linus spotted a familiar figure sitting in the corner - Emily, the kind-hearted waitress who always managed to make him feel welcome. She smiled as he took a seat at the counter, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "Hey, Linus! How's life?"

Linus shook his head good-naturedly. "Just trying to stay out of trouble, Em."

Emily chuckled and slid a cup of steaming coffee in front of him. As he sipped it, she asked about his plans for the day - hiking in the nearby woods, perhaps? Linus agreed, feeling a sense of peace wash over him.

As he finished his meal and prepared to leave, Emily leaned in close. "Hey, Linus Straume?" she whispered, her voice conspiratorial. "I think I saw someone lurking around your house last night. Maybe you should be careful?"

Linus's gut tightened - who was following him? He thanked Emily profusely for looking out for him, and made his way back to his small cabin on the outskirts of town.

That evening, Linus sat by the fire, watching as the shadows danced across the walls. He knew he couldn't stay hidden forever - but for now, it was enough to feel safe in this quiet corner of the world. And with Emily's watchful eye looking out over him, Linus Straume felt like he might just make it through okay after all.
