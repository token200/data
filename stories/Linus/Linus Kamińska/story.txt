One day, Linus received a cryptic message from an anonymous source claiming that a string of high-profile robberies was connected to a former convict who had been released on parole.

The more she learned, the more convinced she became that this was no ordinary robbery spree – it was a carefully orchestrated scheme designed to distract from something much more sinister.

Linus's investigation led her to a seedy underground nightclub on the outskirts of town, where she suspected the former convict might be hiding out. With caution and precision, she staked out the club, watching as the suspect slipped in unnoticed.
