Linus Khan sat alone in the park, his long black hair blowing gently in the breeze. He was known to be a bit of an outcast among his classmates, but he didn't mind. Linus liked being different. As a child of Indian descent living in the United States, he had always felt like an outsider trying to find his place in the world.

As he sat on the bench, lost in thought, Linus's eyes wandered back to the Muggle artifact that hung around his neck - a small golden snitch. It was a gift from his best friend Ron Weasley, who had known Linus since they were kids at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

Just then, Hermione Granger sat down beside him, her long blonde hair tied back in a neat ponytail. "Hey, Linus, what's on your mind?" she asked, noticing the faraway look in his eyes.

Linus sighed and turned to face her. "I just feel like I don't quite fit in anywhere," he admitted. "At Hogwarts, people always seemed to find their place - Ron was a Quidditch star, Hermione was the smartest one in the class, even Harry was destined for greatness as 'The Chosen One'. But me? I'm just... Linus Khan, the kid who's always been invisible."

Hermione smiled kindly. "That's not true, Linus," she said gently. "You're an amazing wizard with a unique perspective on the world. Your passion and creativity are qualities that make you stand out in a crowd."

Linus looked at her, his eyes moistening with gratitude. He knew Hermione always saw beyond the surface level to understand him truly.

"Thanks, Hermione," he said softly, feeling a sense of belonging wash over him for the first time in weeks.

As they sat together in comfortable silence, Linus realized that sometimes being different wasn't a weakness - it was a strength. And with friends like Ron and Hermione by his side, he knew he could face anything life threw his way.
