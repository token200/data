Linus Chih-chieh was a quiet and introspective person who had a way of making everyone feel seen and heard. As a child, he had been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), but that never stopped him from pursuing his passions.

Growing up in Taipei, Taiwan, Linus spent most of his childhood surrounded by the vibrant streets and markets of the city. He was fascinated by the way people interacted with each other, observing how they navigated complex social situations with ease. Linus longed to understand this phenomenon, and so he began to study human behavior.

As Linus grew older, he became increasingly interested in photography. There was something about capturing moments in time that resonated deeply with him. He spent hours taking pictures of the city's architecture, people-watching, and experimenting with different techniques.

One day, while exploring a local market, Linus stumbled upon a small stall selling traditional Taiwanese snacks. The vendor, an elderly woman named Ah-Mei, took notice of his interest and struck up a conversation. They talked for hours about everything from food to philosophy, and Linus found himself feeling more at home than he had in years.

Ah-Mei took Linus under her wing, teaching him the art of traditional Taiwanese cuisine and introducing him to the rich cultural heritage of Taiwan. As Linus delved deeper into this world, he discovered a sense of purpose and belonging that he had never known before.

Years went by, and Linus Chih-chieh became a renowned photographer, using his lens to capture the beauty and diversity of Taiwanese culture. His work was showcased in galleries around the world, but more importantly, it brought him joy and fulfillment. For Linus, photography had become a way to express himself, to connect with others, and to find meaning in a complex world.

As he looked through his camera lens, Linus felt at peace, knowing that he had found his calling. His unique perspective and talents had allowed him to share the beauty of Taiwan with the world, one frame at a time. And though he still struggled with social anxiety and sensory overload, Linus knew that he was exactly where he was meant to be.
