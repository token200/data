Linus Alexander Hill was a young and talented artist who had always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and art. Growing up in a small town surrounded by rolling hills and farmland, Linus spent most of his childhood exploring the outdoors and collecting scraps to use in his art.

As he grew older, Linus's passion for art only intensified, and he began to explore new mediums and techniques. He spent countless hours honing his skills, teaching himself everything from digital painting to 3D modeling.
