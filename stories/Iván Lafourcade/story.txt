Iván Lafourcade was a man shrouded in mystery, with eyes that seemed to hold a thousand secrets. As a detective, he had an uncanny ability to read people and uncover hidden truths. His reputation as one of the best in the business was well-deserved.

It started with small cases - missing persons, burglary, and thefts. Iván would show up, question the victim or the perpetrator, and voilà! The truth would unravel before his very eyes. Word spread quickly, and soon he found himself dealing with more complex cases: murder mysteries that had left the police baffled.

One day, a wealthy businessman approached Iván, requesting his assistance in finding his daughter who had gone missing. Iván agreed to take on the case and started by examining every possible lead. He spoke to friends, family members, colleagues, anyone connected to the girl. The more he dug, the more elusive the clues seemed.

Suddenly, a mysterious note arrived at Iván's office - an old notebook with cryptic messages scrawled across its pages. One message stood out: 'They're watching you'. Iván knew he was onto something and started investigating his own life for hidden enemies or motives.

After days of tireless work, Iván finally uncovered a shocking truth. The daughter was alive, but not where anyone expected her to be. She had been in witness protection all along, her parents' lives under threat from someone close by. Iván returned the girl safely to her relieved family and collected his hefty fee.

But as Iván sat back in his office, sipping a glass of fine wine, he couldn't shake off the feeling that 'they' were still out there - watching him, waiting for their next opportunity to strike. He felt like an old, abandoned doll with strings cut loose. Would the mastermind behind it all reveal himself now?

And so Iván Lafourcade's life became a game of cat and mouse once again.
