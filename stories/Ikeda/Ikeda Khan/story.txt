Ikeda Khan, a cunning and resourceful young thief, had always been a thorn in the side of the wealthy elite of Azura's Night Market. With her quick wit, agile body, and charming smile, she could talk her way out of (or into) almost any situation.

Born Ikeda Akira to a family of modest means, Ikeda Khan had grown up on the streets, learning survival skills from a young age. She had honed her craft as a thief under the guidance of a wise old mentor, Master Kaito, who had recognized her prodigious talent and taken her under his wing.

As she navigated the crowded stalls of Night Market, Ikeda Khan's eyes scanned for targets – intricately carved gemstones, rare silks, or precious artifacts that could fetch high prices on the black market. Her target tonight was a valuable artifact known as the Starlight Seren, said to grant immense power to its owner.

With her trusty lockpicks at the ready, Ikeda Khan slipped into the mansion of wealthy collector, Lord Arin, through an open window. She moved with precision, avoiding creaking floorboards and silent guards. As she reached for the Starlight Seren, she heard a faint noise behind her – Lord Arin's private security guard had caught wind of her presence.

Without hesitation, Ikeda Khan drew a small dagger from her belt and held it up, deftly distracting the guard with a clever trick of misdirection. Meanwhile, she snatched the Starlight Seren and made a hasty exit through the window.

Once outside, Ikeda Khan swiftly transformed into her "respectable" persona – that of a high-society lady named Lady Luna. She smiled brightly at the waiting carriage driver, who knew exactly which address to take her to next.

As she vanished into the night, Ikeda Khan couldn't help but feel a thrill of satisfaction. Another successful heist under her belt, another victory for her and Master Kaito's mysterious organization. The Night Market would never be the same with Ikeda Akira – or Ikeda Khan – on its streets.
