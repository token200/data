Ikeda Yumi stepped out of her small apartment, taking a deep breath of the crisp morning air. As a renowned detective in Tokyo's underbelly, she had seen it all - from high-stakes heists to gruesome murders. But nothing could have prepared her for the phone call that would change everything.

A young woman, barely out of her teens, was frantic on the other end. She claimed to be being stalked by a man who would stop at nothing to keep his secrets buried. Ikeda Yumi listened intently as the girl described the strange occurrences - the eerie feeling of being watched, the unexplained messages scrawled in chalk outside her apartment.

Ikeda's gut told her this was more than just a prank gone wrong. She agreed to take on the case and set out into the rain-soaked streets of Tokyo to unravel the mystery. As she walked, the neon lights of the city seemed to blur together, casting long shadows that seemed to move of their own accord.

At the girl's apartment, Ikeda found a mess of cryptic clues left by her stalker - a torn piece of fabric caught in the door handle, a faint scent of lavender on the windowsill. It was clear someone was trying to send a message, but what did it mean?

As she delved deeper into the case, Ikeda discovered that the girl was not as innocent as she seemed. Her brother had been involved in some shady dealings, and it seemed his reputation had attracted unwanted attention. But who was behind it all - and why were they targeting this young woman?

The night air closed in around her like a shroud as Ikeda pieced together the puzzle. It wasn't just about the stalker; it was about a web of deceit that went far beyond anything she could have imagined. The rain drummed against her umbrella, casting a hypnotic rhythm over the city.

With each new revelation, Ikeda felt herself drawn into a world where nothing was as it seemed. Her instincts screamed at her to act fast - before the stalker claimed another victim. As she stood outside the girl's apartment building, a chill ran down her spine. The game was far from over.
