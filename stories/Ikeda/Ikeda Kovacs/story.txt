Ikeda Kovacs was known for her enigmatic smile and piercing green eyes that seemed to see right through you. As a renowned intergalactic detective, she had solved cases from the farthest reaches of the galaxy, earning her a reputation as one of the most brilliant minds in the cosmos.

Kovacs' latest case had brought her to the lawless planet of Xeridia-IV, where a wealthy merchant had been murdered and his vast fortune stolen. The local authorities were stumped, but Kovacs was undaunted by the challenge. She spent hours poring over the evidence, searching for any thread that might lead her to the killer.

As she walked through the dusty streets of Xeridia-IV's capital city, Kovacs' eyes scanned the crowds, taking in every detail. She had a sixth sense for sniffing out clues, and today was no exception. A small tattoo on a bystander's wrist caught her eye - a symbol she recognized as belonging to a notorious crime syndicate.

Kovacs' mind racing with possibilities, she made her way to the local underworld hub, where rumors of the merchant's murder were spreading like wildfire. The air was thick with tension, and Kovacs could feel the weight of expectation on her shoulders.

She approached the hub's leader, a burly man named Vraxx, who eyed her warily from beneath his black helmet. "What do you want, Kovacs?" he growled.

"I'm looking for information," she replied, her voice even and calm. "The merchant who was murdered - what do you know about it?"

Vraxx shifted uncomfortably in his seat, but something in Kovacs' gaze stayed his hand. "I don't know anything," he lied.

Kovacs smiled again, this time a cold, calculating smile. She knew she had him right where she wanted him. As she turned to leave, Vraxx's voice called out behind her - "You'll need more than just luck to solve that case, Kovacs."

She turned back, meeting his gaze once more. "I've never relied on luck in my career, Vraxx."
