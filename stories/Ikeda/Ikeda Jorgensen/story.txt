One evening, while strolling through the neon-lit alleys of Shinjuku, Ikeda Jorgensen stumbled upon an old antique shop tucked away in a forgotten corner. Out of curiosity, he pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside. The shop's proprietor, an elderly man with wispy white hair, looked up from behind the counter and smiled.

"Welcome, young artist," the old man said, his eyes twinkling with warmth. "I've been expecting you."

Ikeda Jorgensen raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the unexpected greeting. "Expecting me?" he repeated.
