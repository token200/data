Ikeda Szabo was a man shrouded in mystery, known only to a select few in the city's underbelly. His real name was rumored to be nothing more than a myth, but those who claimed to have crossed paths with him swore that his full name - Ikeda Szabo - was etched into their memories forever.

A master thief and con artist, Szabo had an uncanny ability to blend in with his surroundings, making it impossible for anyone to pinpoint his exact location. His methods were always calculated and precise, leaving a trail of baffled victims in his wake.

One rainy evening, as the streets emptied and the city's neon lights cast long shadows, Szabo set out on one final heist. He had received a cryptic message from an anonymous source, hinting at the location of a highly valuable artifact hidden within the city's museum.

Szabo navigated through the deserted alleys, his eyes scanning the rooftops for any sign of surveillance. As he approached the museum's rear entrance, he spotted a lone security guard patrolling the perimeter.

Without hesitation, Szabo activated his wristwatch, which emitted a high-pitched frequency that disrupted the security system's signals. The guard froze, momentarily disoriented, allowing Szabo to slip inside unnoticed.

With seconds to spare, Szabo snatched the artifact from its glass case and vanished into the night. As he disappeared into the shadows, the security guard regained his composure, frantically searching for any sign of the thief.

The city awoke the next morning to find the museum's display case shattered, but Szabo was nowhere to be found. The only clue left behind was a small note bearing the signature "Ikeda Szabo" - a haunting reminder that some secrets were better left unspoken.

As news of the heist spread, whispers began circulating among the city's underworld about the elusive thief known only as Ikeda Szabo. His true identity remained a mystery, but one thing was certain: whenever Szabo struck, chaos and intrigue followed in his wake.
