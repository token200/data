François Kai was a man of mystery, with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair that always seemed to fall perfectly in place. He was a master thief, known for his daring heists and ability to escape detection. But what set him apart from other thieves was his unique talent - the ability to erase his own memories.

François had discovered this gift by accident, after a botched heist left him with amnesia. He woke up in a hospital bed, with no recollection of who he was or how he got there. At first, it seemed like a curse, but as he explored his newfound abilities, he realized that he could use them to his advantage.

He started small, erasing the memories of minor transgressions and using them as an excuse for his behavior. But soon, François began to take on bigger jobs, knowing that with each successful heist, he would erase another piece of himself.

His latest mark was a priceless diamond necklace, hidden away in a high-security museum. François spent weeks casing the joint, studying the guards' routines and timing their patrols. He finally got his chance, sneaking into the exhibit hall under the cover of darkness.

As he made his way to the display case, François felt a thrill of excitement mixed with a dash of nervousness. This was going to be his biggest score yet, and he knew that if he succeeded, he would erase an entire chapter of his life.

With swift precision, François cracked the glass case and snatched the necklace. But as he turned to leave, something caught his eye - a photograph on the wall, depicting a young woman with piercing green eyes. For a moment, François felt a jolt of recognition, but it was fleeting.

He erased the memory, of course, but it left him feeling unsettled. Who was this mysterious woman? And why did she seem so familiar?

François didn't have time to ponder these questions as he made his escape. He disappeared into the night, the diamond necklace clutched tightly in his hand, and a sense of unease creeping over him.

As he gazed at his reflection in a nearby window, François caught a glimpse of himself - the piercing green eyes that seemed to hold a secret, the jet-black hair that framed an enigmatic face. And for a moment, he wondered if he was more than just a master thief. Was he something else entirely?
