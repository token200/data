François Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus was a man shrouded in mystery. His name, though Roman, seemed to belong to a bygone era. He wore a black coat with a crimson lining, its intricately embroidered hem bearing the emblem of his family crest - a serpent devouring its own tail.

Drusus was no ordinary man; he possessed an uncanny ability to navigate the shadows. A master thief and forger, he could weave a tale as convincing as it was plausible. His skills were sought after by those with the deepest secrets, those who required his unique talents to conceal their crimes.

One fateful evening, Drusus received an offer from a wealthy patron, known only as 'The Patron.' The message arrived in the dead of night, slipped under the door of Drusus's humble abode. A lone coin, adorned with the image of a serpent, lay alongside the note. The words, penned by an unseen hand, read: "Meet me at the old windmill on the outskirts of town. I have a proposition for one such as yourself."

Drusus donned his coat and set out into the darkness. He navigated through alleys and backstreets with ease, his instincts guiding him toward the appointed meeting place. As he approached the windmill, the wooden blades creaked ominously in the night breeze.

Upon entering the musty space, Drusus found The Patron waiting for him - a man with sunken eyes and skin as pale as alabaster. "François Claudius," The Patron began, his voice low and hypnotic, "I have an opportunity that requires your unique skills. A rare gemstone, one said to grant immense power, is hidden within the city's museum. I need you to retrieve it for me."

Drusus listened intently as The Patron outlined the plan, weaving a web of deceit and misdirection. He accepted the challenge, driven by the promise of gold and the thrill of the unknown. With his signature snake emblem emblazoned on his coat, Drusus set out into the shadows once more.

The night was young, and the city awaited.
