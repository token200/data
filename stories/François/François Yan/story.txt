As word of his masterpiece spread, people from far and wide flocked to witness the incredible transformation for themselves. They stood in awe as François Yan stepped back, eyes fixed on the wall as if beholding a creation both familiar and yet completely new. The crowd roared in approval, and though he took no credit for their praise, François Yan knew that this was what it all meant – creating something truly beautiful that would leave an indelible mark on the world.
