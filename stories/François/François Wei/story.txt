François Wei was a man of mystery and intrigue, shrouded in an air of quiet confidence that commanded respect from those who met him. A renowned art dealer and connoisseur, he had spent his life tracking down rare and valuable pieces, amassing a collection that rivaled the greatest museums.

Born to Chinese parents in Paris, François Wei had grown up surrounded by the city's vibrant art scene. He had always been drawn to the works of Claude Monet, whose impressionist masterpieces seemed to capture the very essence of light and color. As he grew older, his passion for art only intensified, leading him to pursue a career as an art dealer.

Over the years, François Wei had developed an uncanny ability to sniff out hidden gems in the market. His extensive knowledge of art history and his network of contacts allowed him to stay one step ahead of the competition. He was the go-to guy for collectors looking to invest in rare pieces, and his reputation preceded him wherever he went.

One day, François Wei received a tip about a long-lost Monet watercolor, hidden away in a small estate in the countryside. The painting, titled "La Rivière de Giverny," was said to be one of the most valuable pieces of art in existence. Intrigued, François Wei set out to track down the painting and make it his own.

After weeks of searching, he finally found himself standing in front of the small estate, his heart racing with excitement. As he entered the mansion, he was greeted by the owner, an elderly woman who revealed herself to be a distant relative of Monet's. With great trepidation, François Wei made his offer: 10 million euros for the painting.

The old woman hesitated for a moment before nodding her head in agreement. And with that, "La Rivière de Giverné" was sold, ensuring François Wei's place among the most respected art dealers of his time. As he left the estate, painting in hand, François Wei couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment – another masterpiece had found its way into his collection.
