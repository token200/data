François Jhih-hao, a brilliant and reclusive scientist, had spent his entire career studying the mysteries of time travel. His colleagues often referred to him as "the master of chronology," but François was more concerned with unlocking the secrets of the universe than with seeking fame or recognition.

One day, while working late in his laboratory, François made a groundbreaking discovery. He had managed to create a stable wormhole that could transport people through time and space. Excited by his find, François decided to test the theory by sending himself back in time to witness historical events firsthand.

As he materialized in ancient Egypt, François was struck by the sheer scale of the pyramids and the vibrant culture of the pharaohs. He spent hours observing the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza, marveling at the ingenuity and skill of the workers who built it.

But as the sun began to set, François realized he had to return to his own time. He activated the wormhole device once more and found himself back in his laboratory, surrounded by diagrams and equations scrawled across the walls.

Overjoyed by the success of his experiment, François spent the next few weeks refining his technology and preparing for another journey through time. As he delved deeper into the mysteries of chronology, he began to realize the immense power and responsibility that came with wielding such knowledge.

"François Jhih-hao, you have unleashed a force upon the world," his colleagues warned, their voices laced with concern. "Be careful how you use this technology, for time travel is a double-edged sword."

François nodded solemnly, aware of the risks but also driven by a sense of wonder and discovery. He knew that he had only scratched the surface of the universe's secrets, and he was eager to explore further.

As the days passed, François continued to work tirelessly in his laboratory, pouring over ancient texts and conducting experiments with the aim of unlocking even more of the mysteries of time travel. His name became synonymous with bravery and genius, but François knew that true greatness lay not in recognition, but in the pursuit of knowledge itself.
