François Kowalski was a French-Canadian jazz pianist and composer, known for his distinctive playing style that blended classical and improvisational techniques. Born in Montreal in 1955, François grew up surrounded by the vibrant music scene of Quebec's city center.

As a child, François was captivated by the sounds of Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk, which led him to begin studying piano at the age of six. His father, a retired accountant, recognized his son's passion for music and enrolled him in the prestigious Jeanne d'Arc School of Music.

François's natural talent and dedication earned him a coveted spot at the Montreal Jazz Festival's prestigious program. Under the guidance of renowned pianists, he refined his skills and developed an idiosyncratic style that blended the complexity of classical music with the spontaneity of jazz.

His band's eclectic sound, characterized by complex chord progressions and improvisational flair, earned them a reputation as one of the most innovative ensembles in contemporary jazz.

François's compositions were marked by their lyrical beauty and intricate rhythms, often inspired by Quebecois folk music. Songs like "Le Chemin de l'Amour" and "Les Légendes de Montréal" became anthems for French-Canadian culture and have since been widely performed around the world.

Throughout his career, François collaborated with an impressive array of musicians, including trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and saxophonist Joshua Redman. His unique blend of styles and influences made him a sought-after guest artist on numerous albums.

Despite his success, François remained humble and dedicated to his craft. He was known for his intense practice sessions, often playing for hours on end until the wee hours of the morning. This unwavering dedication earned him a reputation as one of the most respected pianists of his generation.

In 2005, François was awarded the prestigious Prix de Jazz Francophone, an honor recognizing his lifetime contributions to French-Canadian jazz. He continues to tour and compose music with his quartet, inspiring new generations of musicians and enthusiasts alike.
