One drizzly evening, François Ozoliņš received a visit from the enigmatic aristocrat, Comte de Saint-Georges. The Count's usually composed demeanor was laced with concern as he presented François with a peculiar case: his prized family heirloom, a rare gemstone necklace, had been stolen during a charity gala.

François Ozoliņš listened intently, his eyes narrowing as he absorbed the details of the crime. He knew that this case would require all his skill and cunning to unravel. As he accepted the challenge, François's thoughts turned to the labyrinthine streets of Paris, where secrets and lies lurked around every corner.
