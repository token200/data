Artur Eben was a man of mystery, shrouded in an air of quiet confidence that commanded attention without ever demanding it. As a private investigator, he had built a reputation for himself as one of the most skilled and tenacious detectives in the business.

One drizzly evening, Artur Eben sat in his office, puffing on a cigarette as he pored over the latest case file that had walked through his door. The client was a young woman named Sarah, who claimed to have been threatened by her ex-boyfriend. She handed him a stack of letters and photographs, each one more disturbing than the last.

Artur Eben's eyes scanned the documents, taking in every detail. He noted the way the handwriting changed from bold to shaky, the way the words seemed to shift from threats to declarations of love. It was clear that Sarah had been playing with fire, trying to manipulate her ex into believing she still cared for him.

As he delved deeper into the case, Artur Eben began to notice a pattern. Each letter was signed with an initials, always in the same order: S.E. He sensed a game of cat and mouse, where the writer was trying to taunt Sarah without revealing their true identity.

Determined to uncover the truth, Artur Eben decided to pay a visit to Sarah's ex-boyfriend. Over a cup of coffee, he asked pointed questions about his relationship with Sarah and his feelings towards her. The ex-boyfriend shifted uncomfortably in his seat, avoiding eye contact whenever possible.

It wasn't until he left the caf√© that Artur Eben noticed something peculiar on the wall. In small letters, etched into the surface, was the signature S.E. It seemed clear now that this was more than just a game - it was a carefully constructed ruse to distract Sarah from her own true intentions.

Artur Eben's mind whirled with possibilities as he made his way back to his office. The name on the letters had become all too familiar - S.E. would be etched into his memory for a long time, a symbol of cunning and deception that he would never forget.
