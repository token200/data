As the sun set over the bustling streets of Tokyo, Artur Sten stood atop a sleek skyscraper, gazing out over the city he had sworn to protect. His mind was focused on the task at hand: infiltrating the heavily guarded headquarters of the notorious crime lord, Victor LaGraine.

For the first time in years, Artur Sten felt a twinge of doubt – but he pushed it aside, focusing on the task at hand.
