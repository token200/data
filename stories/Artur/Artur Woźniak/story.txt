One day, Artur was approached by a prominent museum in Warsaw with an offer to create a large-scale installation for their upcoming exhibition on Polish modernism. The theme, "Identity and Heritage," resonated deeply with Artur, who saw it as an opportunity to explore the complexities of Polish culture through his art.
