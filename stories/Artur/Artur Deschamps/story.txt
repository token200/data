Artur Deschamps was a man of mystery, shrouded in an air of quiet confidence. A retired detective with a keen mind and a passion for whiskey, he spent his days lounging in his favorite armchair, lost in thought.

It had been years since Artur solved the case that would define his career: the murder of wealthy businessman Richard Langley. The victim's wife, Sarah, had been found dead in their mansion, with no signs of forced entry or struggle. The police were stumped, but Artur had seen something they hadn't – a small, almost imperceptible scratch on Sarah's hand.

Months later, the scratch was revealed to be a signature from an old flame, who had turned out to be Sarah's accomplice in a web of deceit and embezzlement. The case was closed, but Artur knew that he had only scratched the surface.

As he sipped his whiskey, Artur's mind wandered back to the case. He thought about the way Sarah's eyes had sparkled when she talked about her husband's business dealings, the way her voice had dropped to a whisper when she spoke of her own financial struggles. And then there was Richard himself – a man with many secrets, but one whose smile seemed genuine enough.

Artur leaned forward, his eyes narrowing as he recalled a snippet of conversation with Sarah on the day of the murder. "I'm so sorry, Artur," she had said, her voice trembling. "Richard's been making me an offer I couldn't refuse."

An offer? What kind of offer?

As the memories swirled in his mind, Artur reached for his cigar box and pulled out a small notebook. He flipped through the pages, stopping at a scribbled note that read: 'Richard's wife was involved.' The words jumped off the page, igniting a spark of curiosity.

Artur rose from his chair, padding over to the window. Outside, the night air was cool and crisp, but he felt a warmth spreading through his chest as he pieced together the puzzle once more.

He knew then that this wasn't the end of the case – just the beginning. Artur's eyes locked onto the city below, his mind racing with possibilities. He would dig deeper, following the trail until it led him to the truth. The game was on, and he was ready to play.
