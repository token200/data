I couldn't find any information on a person named Artur Puccini. It is possible that this is not a real historical figure, but rather a fictional character.

However, I can suggest some famous individuals who were related to the well-known Italian composer Giacomo Puccini. 

Giuseppe Verdi and Gaetano Donizetti are two famous Italian composers.
