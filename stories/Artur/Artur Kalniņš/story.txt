Artur Kalniņš was an ordinary man living in a small Latvian town surrounded by vast forests and rolling hills. He worked as a woodcarver, crafting intricate wooden figurines that seemed to come alive in his skilled hands.

Despite his humble profession, Artur had a secret passion - he loved to build clockwork machines. Every night, after completing his work for the day, he would sneak away to his small workshop and tinker with gears, springs, and pendulums. He dreamed of creating something truly remarkable, something that would surpass his ordinary life.

One fateful evening, as Artur was working on a particularly intricate mechanism, he received an unexpected visit from a mysterious stranger. The man introduced himself only as "Korvus" and revealed to Artur that he had been watching him for some time. Korvus claimed to be an inventor, one who had created incredible clockwork devices that could change the world.

Intrigued, Artur listened intently as Korvus shared his vision of a future where machines and humans coexisted in perfect harmony. He spoke of intricate automatons that could perform complex tasks with ease, freeing humanity from mundane labor. Artur's mind was racing with possibilities - could he really build something like this?

Over the next few weeks, Artur worked tirelessly alongside Korvus, learning the intricacies of clockwork engineering and construction. Together, they built a small automaton that could walk, dance, and even play music. It was a marvel, and Artur felt his dreams were within reach.

But as their collaboration deepened, Artur began to suspect that something was not quite right. Korvus seemed...off, his eyes gleaming with an otherworldly intensity in the dark. And the more time they spent together, the more Artur realized that he had made a pact with a force beyond human understanding.

Was Korvus truly an inventor, or was he something more sinister? Artur wasn't sure, but one thing was certain: his ordinary life would never be the same again. The clockwork machines he built now seemed to hold secrets and mysteries beyond his wildest imagination.
