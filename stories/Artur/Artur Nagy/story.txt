Artur Nagy stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit café, shaking the water from his coat. He took a seat at the bar, ordering a whiskey on the rocks as he scanned the room. A Hungarian journalist by trade, Artur had a reputation for being fearless in his pursuit of truth.

As he sipped his drink, Artur's eyes landed on a familiar face across the room - that of his old colleague and friend, György. They hadn't spoken since their last assignment together, but Artur knew it wouldn't take long for them to reconnect.

György made his way over, his eyes locking onto Artur's with a mix of curiosity and wariness. The two men exchanged pleasantries, catching up on old times before diving into the purpose of György's visit.

Artur had been working on a story about corruption in the Hungarian government, and he suspected that György might have some information to share. As they talked, Artur learned that György had indeed stumbled upon some disturbing evidence, involving high-ranking officials and lucrative bribes.

Intrigued, Artur pressed György for more details, his journalist's instincts on high alert. The two men huddled in the corner of the café, their conversation growing more intense as they delved deeper into the subject matter.

As the night wore on, Artur knew he had to get back to work - or rather, back to writing. He jotted down some notes, his mind racing with possibilities and plot twists. It was clear that this story would be one of the most significant of his career, and he was determined to see it through.

György, sensing Artur's excitement, smiled knowingly. "I knew I could trust you, Nagy," he said, using Artur's full name for the first time all night. "You've always had a nose for sniffing out the truth."

Artur grinned back at him, his eyes gleaming with determination. "That's why they call me Artur Nagy, György - not just any journalist, but one who won't be silenced."
