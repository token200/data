Artur Michielin stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station. As he had suspected, it was a typical Wednesday morning in Krakow - people rushing to and fro, carrying coffee cups and backpacks. Artur Michielin pulled out his own cup of coffee from his backpack and took a sip, savoring the bitter taste.

Artur Michielin was a man with a plan, or at least he thought he was. His real name, Artur Michielin, had been changed by his mother when he was a child - she wanted him to have a more "respectable" surname, and "Michielin" it was. But Artur Michielin knew the truth: his father's family had once been poor farmers in rural Poland, not some aristocratic lineage as the name might suggest.

As he made his way through the station, Artur Michielin spotted a familiar face - his old friend, Jakub. The two of them had grown up together on the outskirts of Krakow, exploring the city's hidden corners and getting into all sorts of mischief. Now, Jakub was working as a tour guide, showing visitors around the historic streets of Krakow.

"Artur Michielin!" Jakub exclaimed, spotting his friend. "What brings you to town?"

"Just passing through," Artur Michielin replied, shrugging. "I've got some business to attend to."

Jakub raised an eyebrow, but said nothing more. Artur Michielin knew he wouldn't pry - not yet, at least.

As they walked through the station, Jakub asked about his friend's work, and Artur Michielin told him about his latest venture: a small restaurant in the heart of Krakow. It was going to be a challenge, but he was confident it would pay off.

Artur Michielin's thoughts turned to his mother, who had always pushed him to succeed. He knew she had done it for him, changing his name and encouraging him to pursue a "respectable" career. But Artur Michielin was determined to make something of himself, no matter what his surname said.

As they parted ways, Jakub called out, "Good luck with the restaurant, Artur Michielin!" Artur Michielin smiled, feeling a sense of pride and purpose. It was time for him to make a name for himself, no matter what it took.
