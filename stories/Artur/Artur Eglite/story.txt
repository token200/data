His colleagues began to worry about his fixation, but Artur was undeterred. For him, this was the discovery of a lifetime.

One fateful night, as he was analyzing a particularly intriguing dataset, Artur stumbled upon an astonishing breakthrough. The Echoes were not just a random signal – they were, in fact, a map leading to a hidden portal. With trembling hands, Artur entered the coordinates into his console and activated the machine.

The laboratory erupted in a blinding flash of light, and when the dust settled, Artur found himself standing at the edge of an extraordinary vista. Before him lay a shimmering expanse of stars, stretching out to infinity like a celestial canvas. The Echoes had led him here – to the threshold of a new universe.
