I couldn't help but chuckle as I remembered my childhood nickname - "The Kid". Growing up in Los Angeles, California, I was always the youngest one in the room. My parents, George and Irmelin DiCaprio, would often joke that our little family was a mini-Titanic on land, with me being the makeshift iceberg of the group.

As I grew older, my nickname stuck. People would still call me "The Kid" when I was 20, 30, or even 40 years old. My agent would roll his eyes good-naturedly, saying something like, "Oh boy, here we go again." But I knew it was affection; I just happened to be the little guy in a big world.

I started acting at a young age, landing my first role on a TV show when I was 12. That's when things took off for me - or rather, didn't quite take off, as I'd always say with a grin. It wasn't until I met Martin Scorsese that the magic happened. He saw something in me that no one else did â€“ a spark of intensity and passion.

Our collaboration on "Gangs of New York" was a turning point for me. That film showcased my range and earned me critical acclaim, which helped open doors to bigger roles. I went on to star in movies like "Catch Me If You Can", "The Aviator", and, of course, the infamous "Titanic".

Looking back, I realize that my nickname was more than just a joke. It reminded me of where I came from - the struggles and the hardships that made me who I am today. My parents instilled in me a strong sense of work ethic and resilience, which have carried me through even the most turbulent of times.

But as "The Kid" grew into "Artur DiCaprio", I also faced new challenges. The spotlight can be overwhelming at times, but it's moments like those when you know everything was worth it. When I stepped onto that stage for my Oscar win or accepted my Golden Globe award, I felt like a small-town boy from Los Angeles who had somehow managed to climb the highest mountain.

I still wear "The Kid" with pride, though. It reminds me of where I came from and how far I've come. And if people still call me that today, well, that's okay by me.
