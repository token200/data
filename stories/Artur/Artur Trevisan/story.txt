Artur Trevisan stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room with a practiced air of caution. He had been in situations like this before – always on the lookout for potential threats, never knowing who might be watching him from across the room.

As he made his way to the counter, the barista greeted him with a friendly smile. "The usual, Artur?" she asked, nodding towards the cup of black coffee that had been waiting for him since morning.

Trevisan nodded curtly, his eyes darting around the café once more before settling on a booth in the corner. He slid into the seat, feeling a familiar sense of unease as he took in his surroundings.

The café was small and unassuming, with only a handful of patrons scattered about. But Trevisan knew that appearances could be deceiving. In his line of work, you learned to trust no one – not even those who seemed friendly and welcoming.

As he sipped his coffee, Trevisan's mind began to wander back to the case he had been working on for weeks. A wealthy businessman had gone missing, leaving behind a trail of cryptic clues and whispered rumors. Trevisan had been tracking leads for days, but so far, nothing had panned out.

Just as he was about to give up, his phone buzzed with an encrypted message from an unknown number. Trevisan's heart quickened as he read the words on the screen: "Meet me at the old warehouse at midnight. Come alone."

Trevisan knew that this could be it – the break in the case he had been searching for. He made a mental note of the address and began to mentally prepare himself for the potential dangers that lay ahead.

For a man like Trevisan, there was no such thing as a safe meeting place. But he couldn't shake the feeling that this might be the one lead that would finally crack the case wide open.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the café in a warm orange glow, Trevisan finished his coffee and stood up, his eyes never leaving the booth where he had sat just moments before. The game was on – and Artur Trevisan was ready to play.
