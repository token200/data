Martyna Palmas was a free-spirited artist who had always felt most alive when lost in her own world of colors and patterns. Born to a family of creatives, she grew up surrounded by canvases, paint-splattered easels, and the ever-present hum of artistic expression.

As she made her way through life, Martyna Palmas found herself drawn to the streets of Barcelona, where she discovered a community of artists who shared her passion for self-expression. She spent countless hours honing her craft, experimenting with bold brushstrokes and vibrant hues that seemed to dance across her canvases.
