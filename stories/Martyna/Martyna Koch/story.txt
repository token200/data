Martyna Koch, or "Marti" as she was affectionately known to her friends and family, had always been a free spirit. Growing up in a small village on the outskirts of Krakow, Poland, Marti spent her days exploring the rolling hills and forests surrounding her home. She was fascinated by the way the sunlight filtered through the trees and cast dappled shadows on the forest floor.

As she grew older, Marti's love of nature only deepened. She became an avid hiker and backpacker, venturing into the Tatra Mountains to camp and climb. Her friends would often joke that she was more at home among the peaks than in her own village.

But Marti's greatest passion was music. She had grown up playing the traditional Polish folk instruments of the kijórką and the fiddle, and as a teenager, she began writing her own songs. Her music was a fusion of folk, rock, and electronic elements, with lyrics that spoke to the struggles and triumphs of everyday life.

After completing her studies in Krakow, Marti set out on her own, traveling through Eastern Europe and performing at folk festivals and small clubs. She met musicians from all walks of life - Romani gypsies, Ukrainian nationalists, and Roma musicians from Bulgaria, among others - who shared her passion for preserving traditional music.

One evening, while playing a gig in a dusty cafe in Bucharest, Marti was approached by a local record label owner who offered her a recording contract. The producer told her that he had discovered her music through online streaming platforms and was impressed by its energy and depth. With the help of this new partnership, Marty set out to create an album that would bring Polish folk music to a wider audience.

The result was a stunning fusion of traditional and modern sounds, featuring Marti's soaring vocals on the song "Noc Podwyszszą" ("Night Under the Stars"). It received critical acclaim in Poland and soon spread throughout Europe. When asked about her musical style, Marti simply smiled - "It's Polish blood and Eastern European roots," she said with a hint of mischief.
