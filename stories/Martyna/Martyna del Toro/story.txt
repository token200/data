Martyna del Toro was known for her razor-sharp wit and unapologetic honesty. A seasoned journalist, she had made a name for herself by asking the tough questions and never backing down from a fight. Her sharp tongue and quick mind had earned her the respect of her peers, but also the ire of those who felt threatened by her relentless pursuit of truth.

Martyna's latest assignment had brought her to the city of Madrid, where she was investigating a string of high-profile scandals involving some of Spain's most powerful politicians. Her sources had told her that one man in particular, Minister of Finance Enrique López, was at the center of it all.

As she sat down for an interview with Lopez himself, Martyna couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. She knew that this was it - her chance to finally expose the truth and bring López's corrupt dealings to light. But as she began to ask her questions, she noticed something strange.

López seemed...different. His usual confident demeanor was nowhere to be found, replaced by a nervous twitching in his eyes and an uncomfortable fidgeting of his hands. It was as if he knew that Martyna had uncovered something big, but didn't know how to respond.

Undeterred, Martyna pressed on, asking Lopez about the allegations of embezzlement and cronyism that her sources had told her about. López's responses grew increasingly evasive, and Martyna could sense that she was getting close to the truth.

Just as she was about to ask her final question, López's phone buzzed on the table in front of him. He excused himself to take the call, but Martyna noticed something peculiar - it was a phone number she had seen before, one associated with some of the same shady figures she had been investigating.

Without hesitation, Martyna reached out and grabbed the phone, her heart racing as she listened to Lopez's hushed conversation on the other end. The words sent a chill down her spine: "You're not safe, Martyna...they'll come after you..."

López returned to the table, his eyes wide with fear. For the first time in years, Martyna saw a glimmer of vulnerability behind his usual mask. She knew then that she had found what she was looking for - proof of López's corruption and a potential threat to her own life.

With the evidence in hand, Martyna left the interview room, determined to expose López's wrongdoings to the world. But as she walked out into the bright sunlight, she couldn't shake off the feeling that she had just become the one being watched...
