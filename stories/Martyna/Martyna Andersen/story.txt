Martyna Andersen stepped into the crowded café, scanning the room for her friend Emma. She spotted her, sitting at a small table by the window, sipping on a cup of coffee. As she made her way over, Martyna couldn't help but notice the eclectic mix of patrons. There was the young artist with the vibrant hair, the retired professor with his worn leather briefcase, and the group of rowdy students laughing and chatting.

Martyna slid into the seat across from Emma, feeling a wave of relief wash over her as she settled in for their much-needed catch-up session. They spent the next hour discussing everything from school to their favorite TV shows, sharing stories and giggling together like they always did.

As they chatted, Martyna's mind began to wander back to the project she'd been working on – a photography portfolio showcasing her experiences traveling through Eastern Europe during her gap year. She was determined to submit it for an upcoming exhibition, but the pressure was starting to get to her.

Emma noticed Martyna's distraction and reached out to put a reassuring hand on her arm. "Hey, are you okay? You seem a bit preoccupied," she said softly. Martyna smiled weakly, feeling a little self-conscious about her struggles with anxiety. She'd always been open with Emma about her feelings, and she knew that her friend would be there to offer support whenever needed.

As they finished their coffee and prepared to part ways, Martyna felt a renewed sense of determination. With Emma's encouragement and support, she was more confident than ever that her photography portfolio would shine at the exhibition. She tucked the folder under her arm, feeling a surge of excitement for what lay ahead – and knowing that with Emma by her side, she could tackle anything.

As Martyna stepped out into the crisp morning air, she felt invigorated, ready to take on the world. Or at least, the art world.
