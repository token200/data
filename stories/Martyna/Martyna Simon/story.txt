Martyna Simon stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar station. She had never been to Krakow before, but her aunt's letter had been cryptic enough to pique her interest. As she made her way through the crowded station, a small voice called out from behind.

"Kocham cię, Martyna!"

Martyna turned to see a young woman with a mop of curly hair and a bright smile. "Aunt Kasia? Is that you?"

The woman nodded enthusiastically, throwing her arms around Martyna in a warm hug. "I've been waiting for you, little one! Come, let's get some tea and I'll tell you all about your family's secrets."

As they walked through the cobblestone streets of Krakow, Martyna asked questions about her ancestors, who had lived in the city during World War II. Aunt Kasia told stories of hidden Jewish communities and brave resistance fighters, their faces etched on photographs in worn, yellowed frames.

At the café, where Martyna had never been before, they sat sipping tea from delicate china cups. "I've got something to show you," Aunt Kasia said, rummaging through a dusty trunk beside her.

She produced an old photograph, its surface cracked and faded. The image showed Martyna's great-grandmother, a beautiful young woman with piercing blue eyes, standing in front of a ruined building.

"This is where your family lived during the war," Aunt Kasia explained, pointing out various landmarks on the outskirts of Krakow. "We were lucky to have escaped, but not everyone was so fortunate."

As Martyna listened, her mind whirled with questions and emotions. She had always known that her family's history was complex, but hearing it from someone close to her made it feel more real.

"Thank you for telling me this," she said, turning to Aunt Kasia. "I want to know everything about our family."

Aunt Kasia smiled, her eyes shining with pride. "We have so much to tell, Martyna. And I'm happy to share it all with you."
