"Your work speaks to me on multiple levels," the artist said. "I see echoes of Taiwanese history in your pieces yet also something more universal â€“ a longing for unity and understanding."

Martyna smiled softly, pleased that her art had resonated with another creative mind. As the night wore on, she mingled with the guests, discussing art, politics, and life.
