Martyna Toth stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar streets of Prague. As a journalist, she had spent years traveling the world, but there was something about this city that drew her in. Maybe it was the Gothic spires that seemed to stretch towards the sky like skeletal fingers, or maybe it was the feeling of being a stranger in a crowded place.

Martyna Toth had always been drawn to stories of mystery and intrigue, and Prague was rumored to be one of the most haunted cities in Europe. She spent her days researching and interviewing locals, searching for any hint of truth behind the legends that surrounded her.

One evening, as she sat in a tiny café sipping a cup of coffee, Martyna Toth noticed an old man sitting across from her. He was dressed in worn velvet, his eyes sunken into deep creases on his face. Despite his age, there was something about him that seemed... off.

"Excuse me," Martyna said, approaching the table. "I couldn't help but notice you sitting here alone. Are you waiting for someone?"

The old man looked up at her, his eyes glinting in the dim light of the café. "Just enjoying the view," he said, his voice low and gravelly.

Martyna Toth felt a shiver run down her spine as she pulled out her notebook and pen. There was something about this man that seemed... important. She spent the rest of the evening interviewing him, piecing together a story that would change everything she thought she knew about Prague.

As the night drew to a close, Martyna Toth thanked the old man for his time and bid him goodnight. But as she walked back to her hotel, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. And when she turned around, the old man was standing on the sidewalk behind her, his eyes fixed intently on hers.

Martyna Toth smiled to herself as she quickened her pace. She had a story to tell, and it was just beginning.
