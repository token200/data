Barbara Andersson was a woman with a passion for puzzles and mystery novels. She spent most of her free time solving crosswords, playing chess, and indulging in Agatha Christie's detective stories. Her colleagues at the local library often joked that she could unravel any literary enigma with ease.

One day, while browsing through an old bookstore, Barbara stumbled upon a rare edition of "The Seven Per Cent Solution". She had always been fascinated by the story of Dr. Gregory House and his eccentric patients, but what caught her attention was the book itself – its yellowed pages, worn leather cover, and cryptic notes scribbled in the margins.

Intrigued, Barbara decided to take a closer look at the manuscript. As she flipped through the pages, she noticed strange symbols etched into the corners of each page, accompanied by cryptic messages that seemed to point to hidden meanings within the text. It was then that Barbara realized that this book wasn't just any ordinary novel – it held secrets.

The next few weeks found Barbara consumed by deciphering the codes and unraveling the mysteries concealed in "The Seven Per Cent Solution". She poured over detective novels, studied cryptography techniques, and even consulted with experts from local universities. The solution began to take shape – a web of clues pointing to an author who had hidden their own true story within the book.

Barbara's obsession became all-consuming. Her colleagues began to notice that she spent most of her time researching and scribbling notes by herself, leaving little space for actual work. They worried about Barbara's increasing isolation but couldn't help being drawn into her fervor.

Weeks turned into months as Barbara unraveled the mystery layer by layer. Finally, on a cold winter morning, she discovered that the book was penned by none other than Dr. Gregory House himself – and more specifically, it was written from his own mind while recovering in an Austrian clinic for a rare illness.

As Barbara finished reading her own solution, a sense of accomplishment washed over her. The thrill of solving the puzzle had been so great that it felt like she'd discovered something far greater than just a literary enigma.
