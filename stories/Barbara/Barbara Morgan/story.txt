Barbara Morgan was not the first person to come to mind when thinking of astronauts, but she certainly belonged in the same pantheon as her colleague and friend, Neil Armstrong. Born on March 28, 1936, in Long Beach, California, Barbara grew up with a passion for engineering and flying. She earned a degree in mechanical engineering from San Diego State University and worked as an engineer at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory before being selected as an astronaut candidate in 1963.

However, fate had other plans. Due to a bout of polio that left her paralyzed from the waist down, Barbara was forced to withdraw from the astronaut training program after just one day of classes. Devastated and feeling like she'd been dealt a cruel hand, Barbara considered giving up on her dreams of space travel.

But Neil Armstrong, with whom she had become close friends during their time at NASA, refused to let Barbara's polio stop her. He encouraged her to continue pursuing her passions and offered his support whenever she needed it. With Armstrong's backing, Barbara began working as a flight controller for the Gemini program, using her skills to help plan and execute space missions.

As the years passed, Barbara's contributions to NASA became increasingly significant. She worked on several high-profile projects, including the Apollo 11 mission, which put Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon in 1969. When Armstrong prepared for his historic lunar landing, he asked Barbara to be part of the team that would control the spacecraft from Houston.

On July 20, 1969, as Armstrong stepped onto the moon's surface, Barbara was among the hundreds of people watching from Mission Control in Houston. She had played a crucial role in ensuring that the mission went off without a hitch, and her presence in the room added an extra layer of authenticity to the moment.

But it wasn't just Armstrong who owed his success to Barbara's talents. As a flight controller, she had helped plan and execute many of the Gemini missions, including those that paved the way for the first moon landing. Her attention to detail and expertise had saved the Apollo 11 crew from potentially catastrophic errors.

After the Apollo program ended, Barbara went on to work as an engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. She continued to be involved in space exploration, helping to design and plan missions for robots that explored the far reaches of our solar system.

In her later years, Barbara became an advocate for people with disabilities, speaking out about the importance of inclusion and accessibility in all areas of life. Her experiences as a polio survivor had taught her the value of perseverance and the power of human resilience.

Barbara Morgan may not have been the first person to come to mind when thinking of astronauts, but she was certainly one of the most remarkable. Her courage, determination, and expertise had made an indelible mark on the history of space exploration, and her legacy continues to inspire people around the world.
