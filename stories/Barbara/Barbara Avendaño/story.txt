Barbara Avendaño was a force to be reckoned with in the small town of San Juan. A native son and daughter of Mexican immigrants, she had grown up surrounded by the vibrant colors and rhythms of her culture. As she grew older, Barbara's passion for social justice only intensified, driving her to become an advocate for marginalized communities.

After studying law at a local university, Barbara set out to make a difference in her community. She began working with a non-profit organization that focused on providing legal aid to low-income families and immigrants. Her tireless work ethic and natural charisma quickly earned her the respect of her peers, and soon she was leading a team of volunteers on high-profile cases.
