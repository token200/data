Nicolas Boucher stepped out of his worn leather jacket and onto the bustling streets of Montreal. The city was alive, the sounds of laughter and music filling the air as people from all walks of life went about their day. As a private investigator, Nicolas had seen it all – the highs and lows, the triumphs and failures.

He made his way to the small café where he was supposed to meet his contact, a mysterious woman named Sophia. She was known only by her first name, and Nicolas wasn't even sure what she looked like – just that she had given him the job of finding her missing sister.

As he waited at the counter for Sophia to arrive, Nicolas couldn't help but think about the case he'd been working on for months now. The wealthy businessman, Pierre LaFleur, had reported his daughter missing, and Nicolas had found himself entangled in a web of deceit and corruption that went all the way to the top.

The door swung open, and Sophia walked in – tall, with piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into Nicolas's very soul. She was dressed in black, her hair pulled back in a tight ponytail, and for a moment, Nicolas forgot about his job and saw only a woman lost and scared.

"Merci de venir," she said, taking a seat across from him. "I'm so glad you could come."

Nicolas nodded, pulling out his notebook and pen. "What can I do for you? You didn't even give me a name, let alone an address or a phone number – how did you manage that?"

Sophia shrugged, her shoulders barely rising above the fabric of her jacket. "I'm not a woman who leaves a trail, Monsieur Boucher."

He raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. "And what makes you think I can help you find your sister?"

Sophia's eyes locked onto his once more, and for a moment, Nicolas felt like she was seeing right through him. "Because," she said, her voice barely above a whisper, "I have information about Pierre LaFleur – information that could bring down an empire."

Nicolas's ears pricked up at this. This was the break he'd been waiting for, and he knew it. He nodded, his mind already racing with possibilities.

"Okay," he said, pulling out his notebook and pen once more. "Tell me everything you know."
