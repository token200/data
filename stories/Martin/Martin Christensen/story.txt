Martin Christensen was a man of few words, but when he spoke, people listened. A former detective with the Copenhagen Police Department, Martin had a reputation for being one of the most astute and intuitive investigators in the city.

It was on a drizzly evening in late October that Martin received a call from an unknown number. The voice on the other end was panicked, claiming to have information about a cold case from ten years ago. Martin's instincts kicked in, and he agreed to meet the caller at a dingy café on the outskirts of town.

As he sat down across from the nervous stranger, Martin noticed a faint scar above the left eyebrow. He made a mental note to ask about it later. The stranger handed him a folder filled with police reports, photographs, and witness statements.

Martin spent the next few hours poring over the documents, his mind racing with theories and connections. It wasn't until he stumbled upon an old interview transcript that the pieces began to fall into place. The case was closed, but Martin's gut told him there was more to it than met the eye.

The stranger, whose name was revealed to be Emma, had been a witness to the crime ten years ago. She claimed to have seen something that night, something she couldn't shake off. Martin listened intently as Emma recounted her story, his eyes locked onto hers.

As they parted ways, Martin felt a sense of satisfaction wash over him. He knew he still had work to do, but for now, the case was no longer cold. He made a mental note to revisit it in the morning, and perhaps then he could uncover the truth about what really happened that fateful night.

Martin Christensen walked out of the café, his eyes scanning the rainy streets as he pondered the new lead. The mysterious stranger had given him something to work with, and Martin was determined to see justice served.
