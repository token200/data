Despite being born with congenital glaucoma that left him with limited vision, Andrea's passion for music only grew stronger.

As a child, Andrea would watch the other students in school sing during class, while he sang along silently. His dream was to one day become a professional singer, and he worked tirelessly to achieve his goal. He began performing in local talent shows and competitions, where his powerful voice quickly earned him recognition.

Andrea's big break came when he won the Eurovision Song Contest in 1990 with his rendition of "Con te partir√≤." This victory catapulted him onto the international music scene, and soon he was signing contracts with major record labels and collaborating with top artists.

Throughout his career, Andrea has released numerous critically acclaimed albums and collaborated with some of the biggest names in music.
