Martin Varga stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit bar, shaking the droplets from his coat. A regular at this dive, he knew the bartender, Maria, would have a whiskey waiting for him by the time she turned around. As she polished a mug with a dirty rag, Martin took a seat at the counter and nodded in greeting.

"Hey, Marty," Maria said without looking up. "You look like you've had a rough day."

Martin Varga raised an eyebrow, but didn't protest as Maria poured him a generous shot of whiskey. He downed it in one gulp, feeling the burn spread through his chest. The rain outside seemed to match the mood inside – bleak and unforgiving.

Just then, the door swung open and a young woman slipped inside, her eyes scanning the room as if searching for something or someone. Martin watched her from under the brim of his hat, intrigued by the air of desperation that clung to her like a shroud. He knew that look – it was the same one he wore himself when he needed help.

The woman spotted Maria and made her way over, ordering a cheap beer with a quiet desperation that tugged at Martin's heartstrings. As Maria handed her the pint, their eyes met, and for an instant, Martin Varga saw a glimmer of hope in those haunted eyes.

He nodded at Maria, asking for another round, his mind already spinning scenarios where this fragile soul might find solace in this dingy little bar. Maybe she'd found something – a place to hide from the storm outside, or perhaps just someone who could listen. The bartender raised an eyebrow as she poured Martin's next drink, "Still got that way with you, Marty," she said softly.

Martin Varga sipped his whiskey, letting the warmth spread through his chest as he watched the young woman nurse her beer. Maybe, just maybe, this little place might be the only refuge for someone like him – and her.
