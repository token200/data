Karolina Poirier stepped off the plane in Montreal, her eyes scanning the arrivals hall for any sign of familiarity. It had been three months since she'd left Quebec, and she couldn't shake the feeling that she was a stranger to herself. Her parents were still living in their small town, but Karol knew she needed to get out if she wanted to figure things out.

As she made her way through customs, Karol's mind wandered back to the past year. She'd left high school early, not knowing what she wanted to do with her life. Her parents had urged her to pursue a degree in business or something similar, but Karol felt suffocated by the expectations.

She collected her luggage and hailed a taxi, giving the driver the address of a small boarding house she'd found online. The cab ride was short, but Karol's anxiety grew with each passing minute. What if this was all a mistake? What if she wasn't cut out for independence?

The boarding house itself was cramped, with three other girls sharing a single bathroom. Karol felt like an outsider from the moment she stepped inside, but she tried to push on, setting up her room and making herself at home.

Over the next few days, Karol settled into a routine of work and exploration. She landed a part-time job at a local bookstore, where she met fellow book lovers and found solace in their shared passion for words. On her days off, she wandered through the city, discovering hidden cafes and quirky boutiques that spoke to her artistic side.

One afternoon, while browsing through a vintage shop, Karol stumbled upon an old guitar hidden away in the back of the store. She picked it up, running her fingers over the worn wood, and felt an inexplicable jolt of recognition. It was as if she'd been holding onto this instrument for years, waiting for the right moment to rediscover its magic.

For weeks, Karol practiced every spare moment, teaching herself chords and experimenting with lyrics. Her parents might have thought they were getting rid of a rebellious teenager, but Karol knew she was finding her true self.
