Reece Emi stepped into the dimly lit café, the scent of freshly brewed coffee enveloping her like a warm hug. She had always found solace in this particular spot, where the sounds of the city were muffled and the atmosphere was cozy. As she waited for her friend to arrive, Reece's thoughts wandered to the strange dream she'd had that night.

In the dream, she was standing at the edge of a vast ocean, with waves crashing against the shore behind her. A figure stood before her – a woman with piercing green eyes and long, raven-black hair. The woman spoke in a voice that echoed within Reece's soul, telling her secrets and mysteries that only the sea could keep.

Reece sipped on the rich coffee, feeling the caffeine course through her veins like liquid courage. She had always been drawn to the ocean, finding solace in its rhythmic pulse and vast expanse. It was as if the sea spoke directly to her heart, reminding her of the mysteries that lay beyond the surface.

As she waited for her friend Emily to arrive, Reece's gaze drifted out the window, where the city lights twinkled like a million tiny stars. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she noticed a small piece of paper on the café floor, partially hidden by the base of a chair. Curious, Reece picked it up and smoothed out the wrinkles.

The message scrawled across its surface read: "The truth is in the tide." Reece's eyes widened as she felt a jolt of recognition. Was this some sort of message from her dream self? She tucked the paper into her pocket, a sense of excitement building within her.

Just then, Emily burst through the door, a bright smile lighting up her face. "Hey, Emi! Sorry I'm late," she said, dropping into the chair across from Reece's table.

As they chatted and sipped their coffee, Reece couldn't shake off the feeling that something was stirring within her. It started as a gentle hum, growing louder with each passing moment. Suddenly, Emily looked up at Reece with an uncanny intensity in her eyes, saying, "You know, Emi, I had the strangest dream last night too."

Reece's heart skipped a beat. Was this some sort of cosmic coincidence? Or was their connection running deeper than they thought? As the café emptied and the evening drew to a close, Reece felt an inexplicable sense of belonging – as if she were meant to follow the tide and uncover secrets hidden beneath the surface.

With Emily by her side, Reece set out into the unknown, ready to face whatever mysteries lay ahead. For in that moment, she knew that the ocean had whispered something important in her ear: "The truth is in the tide."
