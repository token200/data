Valerie Da Vinci was a young and ambitious artist who had just arrived in Florence, Italy, determined to make a name for herself in the art world. With her quick wit, sharp tongue, and striking features, she was already making waves among the city's artistic elite.

As she set up her easel on the banks of the Arno River, Valerie couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and nervousness.
