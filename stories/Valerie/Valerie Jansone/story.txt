Growing up in a small town in the Midwest, she had always been fascinated by the world beyond her doorstep. After studying journalism in college, Valerie landed an internship at a major metropolitan newspaper, where she quickly made a name for herself as a talented and tenacious reporter.

One day, while working on a exposé about local corruption, Valerie received a cryptic tip from an anonymous source about a potential scandal involving the city's mayor.
