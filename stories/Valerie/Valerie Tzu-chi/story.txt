As the daughter of a renowned archaeologist, Valerie grew up surrounded by ancient artifacts and dusty tomes filled with forgotten lore. Her father's expeditions often took her along for the ride, introducing her to hidden temples and cryptic scripts that would one day become the foundation of her own archaeological pursuits.

With her heart pounding and her mind racing, Valerie Tzu-chi reached out a trembling hand to claim the artifact, ready to unravel the enigma before her. As the weight of history bore down upon her, she steeled herself for the challenge ahead: to unlock the secrets hidden within this lost city, and in doing so, rewrite the course of human understanding.
