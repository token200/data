Valerie Garcia Fernandez was no ordinary woman. With a sharp mind and an even sharper tongue, she had made a name for herself in the competitive world of politics.

Through it all, Valerie remained true to herself and her values. She drew strength from her Latinx heritage and the stories of women and marginalized communities who had paved the way for her own success. As she stood on the stages, podium in hand, delivering impassioned speeches that electrified the crowd, Valerie Garcia Fernandez knew that she was exactly where she was meant to be – at the forefront of a movement that would shape the future of her city.
