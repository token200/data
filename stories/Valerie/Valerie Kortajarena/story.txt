I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Valerie Kortajarena. It's possible that you may be thinking of a different character or person.

However, I can suggest some famous individuals with the last name Kortajarena:

* Mar√≠a Kortajarena, an Argentine actress and model.
* Mariana Kortajarena, a Peruvian-Argentine fashion designer.

If you would like, I can write a story about one of these individuals. Alternatively, if you have any additional information or context about Valerie Kortajarena, I may be able to help you create a fictional character profile for them.

Let me know how I can assist you further!
