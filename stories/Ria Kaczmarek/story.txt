Ria Kaczmarek stepped off the plane in Warsaw, her eyes scanning the familiar streets below. She had returned to her hometown for the summer, eager to reconnect with her Polish roots and spend time with family. As she made her way through customs, Ria felt a mix of excitement and nervousness. The past year had been a whirlwind of college applications, part-time jobs, and endless nights spent scrolling through social media.

Growing up in a small town in suburban Chicago, Ria had always felt like an outsider among her peers. Her parents, both immigrants from Poland, had instilled in her a strong sense of pride and connection to her heritage. But as she grew older, Ria began to feel the weight of expectation on her shoulders. Shouldn't she be studying law or medicine, just like her parents? Instead, Ria had chosen to pursue a degree in creative writing, much to her parents' dismay.

As she made her way through the airport, Ria's thoughts turned to her upcoming summer internship at a local publishing house. She had landed the job after spending hours perfecting her portfolio and networking with industry professionals. The opportunity was a dream come true, but Ria couldn't shake off the feeling of uncertainty that lingered beneath the surface.

Ria hailed a taxi and headed towards her parents' old apartment building on ulica Pu≈Çaskiego. Her mother, Babcia (grandma), was waiting for her in the lobby, a warm smile spreading across her face as Ria approached.

"Rachunkiem!" she exclaimed, embracing Ria tightly. "Welcome home!"

Over the next few weeks, Ria settled back into the rhythms of small-town life. She spent long afternoons helping Babcia with her gardening, listening to her stories about life in Poland during World War II. She attended local festivals and markets, sampling pierogi and kielbasa with her friends.

But as much as she tried to shake off the feeling of restlessness, Ria couldn't help but wonder what the future held for her. Was this internship just a stepping stone, or was it something more? As she sat on Babcia's couch one evening, flipping through a worn copy of The New Yorker, Ria realized that maybe the answers weren't as clear-cut as she thought.

Her parents had always told her that success wasn't about achieving some grand milestone, but rather finding happiness in the everyday moments. And as Ria looked around at the familiar streets and buildings of Warsaw, she knew that they were right. This summer, at least, was all about finding herself, rediscovering her roots, and embracing the uncertainty that lay ahead.
