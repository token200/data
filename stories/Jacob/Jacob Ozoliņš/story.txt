Jacob Ozoliņš was a young and ambitious journalist who had just landed his first job at the local newspaper in Riga, Latvia. Born and raised in a family of modest means, Jacob had always been driven to succeed, and he saw this opportunity as a chance to make a name for himself.

One day, Jacob received a call from a source who wished to remain anonymous about a corruption scandal involving several high-ranking government officials.
