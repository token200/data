His full name was always accompanied by a warm smile, as if to say, "Yes, I'm Jacob Fischer, but you can call me Jase."

One fateful evening, a young woman named Sarah walked into the pub, looking lost and alone. She had just gone through a breakup and wasn't sure how to pick up the pieces of her shattered heart.
