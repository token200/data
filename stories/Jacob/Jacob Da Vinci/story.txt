As a young apprentice to the great Leonardo da Vinci, Jacob had been taught the ways of art and science by his illustrious namesake.

In those moments, it was as if he'd transcended time itself - just like his namesake Leonardo da Vinci had once believed possible. And when he looked up into those celestial expanse, he could almost see the infinite paths unfolding before him.
