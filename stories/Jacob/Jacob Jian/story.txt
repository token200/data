His parents, who had always been hesitant about their son's future, now saw an opportunity for him to make a name for himself. They encouraged him to share his findings with the world, and soon, Jacob Jian was invited to present his research at the prestigious Academy of Science in the city.

With trembling hands, Jacob Jian stood before the esteemed professors and scholars, presenting his revolutionary theory on celestial mechanics. The room fell silent as he explained his findings, and when he finished, a collective "wow" echoed through the hall. Jacob Jian had done it â€“ he had made a name for himself, not just in his village, but across the land.
