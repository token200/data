The sun had just set over the desert landscape, casting a golden glow over the small adobe house where Jacob Salamanca sat on his porch, sipping tea. His eyes gazed out at the vast expanse of land he'd inherited from his father, his thoughts consumed by the weight of responsibility.

Jacob was a man shrouded in mystery, with an air of quiet confidence that commanded respect. Few knew much about his life before arriving in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he'd made a name for himself as a ruthless and cunning lawyer. But rumors swirled around him like desert dust - whispers of past misdeeds, hinted at but never proven.

As the evening wore on, Jacob's mind turned to his family's history. He was a member of the Salamanca cartel, one of the most powerful in Mexico, but he'd made it clear that he operated under different rules. His father had instilled in him a sense of honor and respect for those who earned their place.

A knock on the door broke the silence, and Jacob's housekeeper, Sofia, entered with a look of concern etched on her face. "Se√±or, there's been trouble," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "The DEA has sent an agent to question you about your... activities."

Jacob set his tea down, a cold calculation spreading through his veins. He knew this was coming, and he'd prepared for it. "Send him in," he said, his eyes never leaving Sofia's face.

The agent, a young man with a determined look on his face, entered the house, flanked by two burly men who looked like they could crush steel with their bare hands. Jacob smiled wryly to himself as the agent began to speak, but he didn't rise from his seat or react in any way. He knew this was just a game, and he'd played it many times before.

As the interrogation dragged on, Jacob's calm demeanor remained unshaken, even when the agent mentioned names of people who'd crossed him - enemies, rivals, and those who'd ever dared to defy him. When the agent finally left, Jacob stood up, his movements fluid and precise, as if he'd been waiting for this moment all along.

Sofia watched with a mixture of awe and fear as Jacob walked her back to the kitchen, his eyes scanning the room as if searching for something - or someone. He paused by the door, his gaze lingering on Sofia before he turned and went back into the darkness of his house. The silence that followed was like a promise: this was far from over.
