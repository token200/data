One day, while researching in the archives of a local museum, Jacob stumbled upon an intriguing artifact - a small, intricately carved wooden box with no discernible markings or provenance. Despite his best efforts, he couldn't shake the feeling that this box held secrets worth uncovering.

Determined to learn more about the mysterious box, Jacob began conducting interviews with local residents and scouring online forums for any mention of it. His friends and family thought him mad, but Jacob was undeterred in his pursuit of knowledge.

The owner of the café, a kindly old man named Paweł, revealed to Jacob that his own great-grandfather had once owned the wooden box.
