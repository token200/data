Jacob Ruiz García stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the familiar landscape of the old town. It had been ten years since he'd left, chasing dreams in Madrid but finding only disappointment. Now, as he made his way through the crowded streets, he felt like a ghost returning to haunt the places he thought he'd left behind.

As he walked, the sounds and smells of home flooded back: the chatter of the street vendors, the scent of empanadas wafting from the markets, the laughter of children playing in the plazas. Jacob's heart swelled with nostalgia, but it was a bittersweet feeling. He'd come back for his abuela, who had passed away recently, and to settle her estate.

He made his way to the small apartment he'd shared with his brother, Carlos, when they were young. The same apartment where he'd first learned to play guitar from their father. Jacob's fingers itched to hold a six-string again, but for now, he pushed aside the sentimental urge and focused on the task at hand.

As he collected his belongings and made arrangements for storage, memories of his childhood flooded back. His brother, Carlos, was no longer the gangly teenager who'd always been one step behind him; instead, he was a successful lawyer with a family of his own. Their parents had moved to Spain when they were teenagers, seeking better opportunities than the small town had to offer.

Jacob couldn't help but feel a pang of regret. Had it all been worth leaving? He thought about the friends he'd made in Madrid, the love interests who'd never quite stick, and the fleeting dreams that still lingered on his lips. Yet, something about returning felt right. Maybe it was the simple acceptance of where he was, rather than where he wanted to be.

After a few days of settling into his old life, Jacob decided to visit some old haunts. He strolled through the park, reminiscing with Carlos, and then headed out to the local barrio, where the same street performers were still entertaining passersby with their jokes and acrobatics. Over a cold beer at El Mesón, he spotted an elderly man sitting alone in the corner.

"¿Quién eres?" (Who are you?), Jacob asked, nodding towards the old man.

The stranger looked up at him with piercing brown eyes. "I'm Pablo," he said, his voice like sandpaper on rough stone. "And I've been expecting you."

Jacob felt a shiver run down his spine as Pablo took a pull from his own drink and began to tell the story of how they met as teenagers in this very town – how Jacob had come back once for visits, only to find that life had moved forward while he was away.
