In that fleeting moment, Paul knew he had found his next subject – not just a photograph, but a story to be told for years to come.

As Paul continued on his journey, his camera by his side, the world became a canvas waiting to be explored, painted with the vibrant colors of his imagination. For Paul Abbagnato, every frame held a piece of himself, and every photograph whispered secrets of the human experience.
