People would often say that Paul's pictures were like windows into another world, one filled with beauty and wonder.

One evening, as Paul was setting up his equipment on Magazine Street, he struck up a conversation with a local artist named Sophia. She was intrigued by Paul's passion for photography, and the two quickly discovered a shared love of art and creativity. As they talked, Sophia asked Paul about his inspiration, and he told her about how he found solace in capturing the city's hidden corners.
