Despite his tough exterior, Paul Bernard was haunted by a personal tragedy - the loss of his younger sister, Emily, who had gone missing under mysterious circumstances when he was just a teenager. The case remained unsolved, and Paul's desire for answers had driven him to leave the police force and strike out on his own as a private investigator.

One rainy evening, a distraught woman named Sarah knocked on Paul Bernard's office door.
