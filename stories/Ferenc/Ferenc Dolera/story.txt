Ferenc Dolera stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of life. It had been years since he'd set foot in Budapest, yet the memories still lingered like a bad habit. He pulled out a crumpled map from his pocket and studied it, trying to get his bearings.

As a child, Ferenc Dolera would spend hours exploring the city's winding streets with his grandfather, listening to tales of war and revolution that had shaped the country into what it was today. Now, as a man in his mid-thirties, he felt restless, like there was more to life than the monotony of his job at the bank.

He hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of his family's old apartment building. The taxi screeched to a halt in front of the worn facade, and Ferenc Dolera stepped out into the familiar scent of damp earth and smoke.

The door creaked open, and his mother stood before him, her eyes red-rimmed from tears. "Ferenc Dolera," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I was starting to think I'd never see you again."

They hugged tightly, the years of separation melting away like salt on wet pavement. Ferenc Dolera's mother led him up the stairs, into the cramped kitchen where his father was waiting.

The conversation flowed easily, like they had practiced it for years. His parents asked about his job and his love life, but Ferenc Dolera hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. He'd always been a private person, content to keep his feelings locked away behind a mask of charm and good humor.

As the night wore on, and the whiskey flowed like a river, Ferenc Dolera's parents sensed something was amiss. They probed gently, but he pushed them off, insisting it wasn't anything to worry about. It was just a phase, they told him, one that would pass with time.

But as he lay in his childhood bed that night, listening to the city outside his window, Ferenc Dolera knew otherwise. He felt lost and adrift, like a ship without anchor or rudder. And for the first time in years, he wondered if he'd ever find his way back home.
