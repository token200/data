Ferenc Novak was a man with a passion for restoring old clocks and watches. As a skilled horologist, he spent most of his days tinkering in his small workshop, surrounded by ticking timepieces and the sweet scent of machine oil.

Despite his love for precision and order, Ferenc's personal life was a bit of a mess. His wife, Eva, had left him six months prior, citing his obsession with clocks as the reason for her departure. Ferenc was devastated, but he couldn't bring himself to give up his beloved hobby. He would often receive visits from his sister, Szilvia, who tried to persuade him to find a new partner, but Ferenc just shook his head.

One day, while working on a particularly intricate timepiece, Ferenc heard a knock at the door. It was an old acquaintance, Dr. Lajos, who had come to purchase one of Ferenc's finest clocks. As they chatted about the intricacies of horology, Ferenc couldn't help but notice how much he missed having someone to share his passion with.

After the sale, Dr. Lajos mentioned that he knew a woman who might be interested in meeting Ferenc. "Her name is Szabó," he said, "and she's an avid clock collector herself." Ferenc raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the prospect of meeting someone new.

The next day, Ferenc received a visit from Szabó, who introduced herself with a warm smile and sparkling eyes. They spent hours discussing clocks, watches, and even sharing stories about their shared love for intricate mechanisms. For the first time in months, Ferenc felt a glimmer of hope that he might finally find someone to share his life with.

As they parted ways, Szabó mentioned that she'd be returning soon to visit Ferenc's workshop again. He watched her leave, feeling a sense of excitement and possibility that he hadn't felt since Eva left. Maybe, just maybe, Ferenc Novak had finally found his perfect timepiece – the one that would keep him ticking for years to come.

Ferenc smiled to himself as he returned to his workbench, feeling a renewed sense of purpose. He knew that with Szabó on board, he might just find himself fixing more than just clocks in life.
