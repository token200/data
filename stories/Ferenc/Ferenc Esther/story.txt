Born in Budapest, Hungary, Ferenc had grown up surrounded by the rich sounds of classical music. His parents, both musically inclined themselves, had encouraged his passion from a young age, teaching him to play the violin and encouraging him to explore his creative side.

As he grew older, Ferenc Esther's talent became increasingly evident, earning him a spot at the prestigious Hungarian Academy of Music.
