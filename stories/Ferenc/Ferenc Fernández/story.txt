Ferenc Fernández sat alone at his small, cluttered desk, staring out the window of his dingy office. As a private investigator in Budapest, he'd seen it all - the cheating husbands, the embezzling business partners, and the missing persons cases that seemed to never be solved. But tonight was different.

Tonight, Ferenc had received a mysterious letter from an old acquaintance, asking him to meet at a small café on the outskirts of town. The note had been brief, simply stating that a valuable piece of information needed to be discussed in person.

As he sipped his black coffee and scanned the dimly lit café, Ferenc's eyes settled on a figure huddled in the corner. It was an old friend from his university days, one who'd always seemed to keep secrets hidden behind a charming smile.

"You're late," the woman said, as Ferenc approached her table. "I thought you were going to stand me up."

"Sorry about that," Ferenc replied, taking a seat across from her. "What's this all about?"

His friend leaned in close, her voice barely above a whisper. "It's the Szabó case," she said, referring to a high-profile murder that had shaken Budapest several years ago.

Ferenc's eyes narrowed. "The one I couldn't crack? The one that everyone says was botched?"

"Yes," his friend replied. "That one."

Ferenc leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers together as he thought. He'd always felt a lingering sense of guilt about the case - that he'd missed something crucial, or failed to connect the dots.

"What do you want me to know now?" Ferenc asked, as if trying on an old glove.

"You want me to tell you," his friend replied, her eyes glinting with amusement. "I've got evidence, Ferenc. Proof that the killer was never who we thought it was."

Ferenc's heart quickened as he leaned in closer, his ears straining to hear every word. It seemed that his long-standing obsession had finally paid off.

As they chatted into the night, Ferenc knew that this case - and his reputation - would be rewritten forever.
