Ferenc Larsen stepped out of the dimly lit bar and onto the rain-soaked streets of Budapest. The neon lights of the city reflected off the wet pavement, casting an otherworldly glow over the crowded sidewalks. As a private investigator, Ferenc had grown accustomed to the late-night calls and clandestine meetings that came with his line of work.

He adjusted his fedora and lit a cigarette, taking a long drag as he pondered the latest case on his plate. A wealthy socialite's daughter had gone missing, and her family was getting anxious. The police were stumped, and it was up to Ferenc to find her before they closed in on the wrong lead.

As he walked down Andrássy Avenue, the sound of jazz music wafted from a nearby club. Ferenc knew the owner, Szabolcs, and decided to pay him a visit. He pushed open the door and slid onto a stool at the bar.

"Jó esti, Ferenc," Szabolcs said, offering him a whiskey on the rocks.

"Just passing through," Ferenc replied, eyeing the bartender's hands as he expertly mixed the drink. There was something about the way Szabolcs moved that seemed... deliberate.

The music shifted to a slower tune, and Ferenc noticed a woman in the corner, sipping a drink and gazing into space. He made his way over, noticing she matched the description of the missing girl's accomplices from an earlier meeting with Szabolcs.

"Mind if I join you?" Ferenc asked, taking a seat beside her.

She turned to face him, her eyes flashing in the dim light. "Not at all," she said, her voice husky.

Ferenc took in the details – piercing green eyes, porcelain skin, jet-black hair framing her heart-shaped face. He'd seen his share of femme fatales, but there was something about this one that piqued his interest.

"Tell me," Ferenc began, "what do you know about the missing girl?"

The woman's gaze never wavered as she leaned in close. "Let's just say I have a business proposition for you, Mr. Larsen."

Ferenc raised an eyebrow. He was intrigued. This case just got a lot more interesting.

"Tell me," he said, his eyes locked on hers, "what do you want from me?"
