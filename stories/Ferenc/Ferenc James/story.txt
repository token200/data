For Ferenc James, there was no option but to keep moving forward, always staying one step ahead of his enemies. It was a fragile existence, built on shifting sands and uncertain alliances. Yet, in this world of intrigue and deception, it was the only life he knew.

As night fell, casting long shadows across the city, Ferenc disappeared into the crowd, lost in a sea of anonymous faces. The Fox had vanished, leaving behind only whispers of his presence, like a ghostly apparition on the wind.
