Ferenc Szabó was an unlikely hero, known throughout Budapest for his uncanny ability to solve problems with nothing more than a few well-placed coins and some quick thinking. As a humble street vendor, he had spent years perfecting the art of finding creative solutions to the everyday challenges that plagued the city's residents.

One crisp autumn morning, Ferenc was setting up shop outside St. Stephen's Basilica when a flustered office worker, Mrs. Kovács, rushed past him. Her briefcase was spilling its contents, and her prized family heirloom, a priceless antique locket, had fallen to the ground.

Without hesitation, Ferenc offered to help Mrs. Kovács collect her scattered belongings. As he handed her back the precious locket, he noticed that it had stopped working due to a lost battery. Without missing a beat, he rummaged through his pocket and produced a single 10-forint coin. He then inserted the coin into the locket's small slot, which was designed for the original currency.

To Mrs. Kovács' amazement, the locket sprang back to life, its sparkling diamonds now accessible once more. Word of Ferenc's ingenuity spread quickly through the city, and before long, people were seeking him out for his help in all sorts of predicaments.

A broken bike wheel? No problem – Ferenc would produce a rusty screw from nowhere and fix it with ease. A leaky faucet? He'd simply use some cleverly placed coins to redirect the water flow.

As word of his talents grew, so did the legend surrounding Ferenc Szabó. Some claimed that he was once a brilliant engineer who had chosen a simpler life on the streets, while others whispered that he possessed magical powers. The truth, however, remained much more prosaic – Ferenc was simply a resourceful and clever individual with a deep understanding of the world around him.

Years went by, and Ferenc continued to help those in need, never once expecting anything in return. Though his exploits became the stuff of local legend, he remained humble and kind, always ready with a smile and a helping hand. As the sun set over Budapest, Ferenc's small street stand would be just one of many, but the impact he had on the city's residents was undeniable – a testament to the power of creativity and resourcefulness in the most unexpected of heroes.
