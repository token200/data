Aet Szymanska stood in front of the old, worn-out mirror in her small apartment, gazing at the reflection staring back at her. Her long, dark hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall, and her piercing green eyes sparkled with a hint of mischief. Aet was a name that suited her perfectly – short for Antonia, which she had chosen to adopt when she left Poland in search of adventure.

As she dressed in the worn jeans and faded band t-shirt, Aet couldn't help but think about the journey that had brought her here. She had always been drawn to the arts, spending countless hours honing her skills as a painter and photographer. But after a painful breakup with her long-term boyfriend, Aet found herself lost and uncertain about her future.

It was then that she stumbled upon an art collective in Berlin, where she met like-minded individuals who shared her passion for creativity. They welcomed her with open arms, and soon, Aet found herself immersed in the vibrant art scene of the city.

As she made her way to the studio, Aet couldn't help but smile at the thought of the people waiting for her inside. Her friends were a quirky bunch – a group of misfits who had become her family. There was Józef, the musician with a heart of gold; Luka, the poet with words that could move mountains; and Anna, the dancer with a spirit that sparkled like diamonds.

Together, they worked on their latest project, a multimedia installation that explored themes of identity and belonging. Aet's contribution – a series of photographs capturing the beauty of Polish landscapes – was a highlight of the exhibition. As she looked at her reflection in the mirror once more, Aet felt a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over her. She had found her place in this new world, and it was here, among these people who understood her, that she truly belonged.

With a newfound confidence, Aet Szymanska set out to tackle the day ahead, ready to take on whatever challenges came her way.
