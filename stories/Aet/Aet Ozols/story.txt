Aet Ozols trudged through the dusty streets of Riga, her eyes scanning the crowded market stalls with a mix of disdain and determination. As a young woman living in the city during the early 20th century, she had grown accustomed to the harsh realities of life.

Born into a poor family, Aet's early years were marked by hardship and struggle. Her father, a skilled craftsman, had died when she was just a child, leaving her mother to raise her on her own. Despite the odds against them, Aet's mother had instilled in her a strong sense of resilience and determination.

Now, at 22, Aet found herself on the cusp of adulthood, with a decision looming before her. Her family, desperate for financial stability, urged her to take up an apprenticeship as a seamstress, a trade that would secure their future but also meant sacrificing her own dreams. Aet, however, had other plans.

She longed to study medicine, to heal and help others like the doctors who had helped her mother recover from a debilitating illness when she was a child. But with women excluded from medical school in Latvia at the time, Aet knew it was a pipe dream.

As she navigated the market stalls, Aet spotted a small, makeshift medical shop tucked away on a side street. The sign above the door read "Dr. Krišjāņa" and below it, a handwritten note promising affordable treatments for common ailments. Intrigued, Aet ducked inside.

The doctor, an elderly man with kind eyes, greeted her warmly. They spoke in hushed tones of his struggles to stay open, as the government was increasingly hostile towards medical men who dared to offer alternative treatments. Yet, he had persisted, driven by a passion for healing and helping those in need.

Aet left the shop that day with a renewed sense of purpose. She vowed to find a way to support herself, while also pursuing her dreams of medicine. The road ahead would be long and arduous, but she was ready to face it head-on.

For Aet Ozols, the journey had just begun – one that would take her from Riga's market stalls to the hallowed halls of medical school, with a determination to heal and help others, no matter what obstacles lay in her path.
