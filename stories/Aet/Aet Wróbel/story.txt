Aet Wróbel trudged through the snow-covered streets, his heavy boots crunching against the frozen crystals. He wore a thick woolen coat, its worn leather cuffs a testament to countless winters like this one. As a master craftsman in Krakow's medieval quarter, Aet knew every alleyway and every backstreet better than he knew himself.

He stopped before the wooden façade of his workshop, adorned with intricate carvings that told stories of their own. Aet produced a small key from his pocket, unlocked the door, and stepped into warmth. The smell of wood shavings, tar, and hot metal enveloped him like an old friend.

His apprentice, Stanisław, looked up from his workbench, where he was carefully shaping a wooden beam into a delicate lantern. "Aet-san!" he exclaimed, as his master approached. Aet smiled, pleased to see the boy's progress.

As they worked together, Aet began to tell tales of old Krakow – stories of battles fought and won, of nobles and merchants who had shaped the city over the centuries. Stanisław listened with wide eyes, drinking in every word like a thirsty man at an oasis.

The afternoon sun cast a golden glow through the workshop's windows, illuminating Aet's hands as he worked on his latest commission: a beautifully carved wooden reliquary for the local church. His fingers moved deftly, shaping and smoothing the wood until it seemed to take on a life of its own.

As night began to fall, casting long shadows across the workshop floor, Stanisław asked Aet about the stories he told. "Why do you remember all those old times, Master?" The master's eyes clouded for a moment before he replied, "Because, boy, memories are like wood – they must be carved and polished, or they will rot away. And besides, I've spent my whole life in this city, watching it grow and change, just like the stories themselves."

As the fire crackled in the hearth, Aet Wróbel smiled to himself. The world outside might be cold and unforgiving, but inside his workshop, all was warmth and light – a testament to the power of memory, craft, and tradition.
