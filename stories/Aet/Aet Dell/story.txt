Aet Dell was a wandering bard with a voice like honey and a heart full of stories. Born in the rolling hills of the countryside, she had always been drawn to the world beyond her small village. As a child, she would listen for hours to the traveling bards who passed through, their tales of adventure and bravery weaving a spell around her.

As she grew older, Aet Dell's own voice began to emerge, sweet and melodious, like her mother's. She practiced on the village green, singing songs of love and loss, of triumph and defeat. The villagers would stop and listen, mesmerized by her words, and soon, word spread of the young bard with a gift for storytelling.

Aet Dell set out into the world, carrying a lute and a sack full of stories. She traveled from town to town, sharing tales of myth and legend, of heroes and monsters. People would gather around her, entranced by the sound of her voice, as she spun yarns of magic and wonder.

Years passed, and Aet Dell's fame grew. Kings and queens invited her to perform at their courts, and she sang for pharaohs and emperors alike. Her songs were said to have the power to move mountains, to bring tears of joy to the eyes of the bereaved.

One night, as she performed in a bustling tavern, Aet Dell caught sight of herself in the mirror behind the bar. She saw a woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair, her skin glowing with a soft, golden light. For an instant, she felt like she was staring at a stranger, but then, her gaze softened, and she smiled. That was Aet Dell, the wandering bard, weaver of tales and spinner of dreams.

As she took her final bow, the crowd erupted into applause, and Aet Dell knew that she had found her true calling: to share her stories with the world, one song at a time.
