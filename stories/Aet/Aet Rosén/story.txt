As the price was discussed, Aet Rosén couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. She had created this piece herself, pouring all her skill and creativity into its delicate form. The Baroness paid handsomely for the vessel, and Aet Rosén knew that she had taken an important step in establishing her reputation as a master glassblower.
