Aet Hiroki stood at the edge of the city, gazing out at the endless expanse of water that stretched before him. He was a lone wolf, a wanderer without purpose or destination, yet drawn to this place like a moth to flame. The wind whipped through his dark hair, carrying the whispers of secrets and stories he had yet to hear.

As a child, Aet had been told that he was cursed - that his very existence was a blight upon the world. His parents, members of a secretive cult, had believed that by abandoning their own son, they could rid themselves of the evil that Aet embodied. But Aet knew better. He felt the weight of their rejection, like an anchor tied to his soul.

He walked along the water's edge, feeling the cool spray on his skin and listening to the cries of gulls overhead. The city gave way to suburbs, which in turn yielded to fields and forests, until Aet found himself at the foot of a great mountain range. There, he paused and looked back at the world he had left behind.

The wind picked up, carrying with it the faint scent of smoke. Aet followed its source to a small village, where flames danced and people wailed in despair. He watched from afar as a young woman emerged, her face smudged with soot, her eyes blazing with fury. It was then that Aet realized he had been running for far too long.

The girl, Emiko, was the daughter of the village elder, a man whose secrets and lies had destroyed countless lives. She was angry and heartbroken, but Aet saw something in her that no one else did - a spark of determination that could ignite the flames of change. Without thinking, he reached out and took her hand.

Together, they walked into the inferno, their footsteps weaving through the ashes as if to claim the ashes themselves. They spoke little, their language reduced to simple gestures and nods of understanding. But Aet knew what Emiko was thinking - that perhaps, just perhaps, there was more to this cursed existence than he had ever imagined.

As they walked, Aet felt a weight lift from his shoulders. He no longer needed to hide or be ashamed. With Emiko by his side, he finally understood the meaning of home, and knew that the world was not as empty as it once seemed.
