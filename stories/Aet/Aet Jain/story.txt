Under their guidance, Aet's powers grew stronger. She could manipulate the elements, communicate with animals, and even bend time and space to a certain extent. Her potential was vast, and many believed that she would one day become a great spiritual leader, guiding millions towards enlightenment.

Aet Jain had always known that her destiny lay in serving others, using her gifts to heal the sick, protect the vulnerable, and bring peace to those afflicted by strife. And so, with a heart full of compassion and a mind filled with wisdom, she set out on a journey to fulfill her purpose.
