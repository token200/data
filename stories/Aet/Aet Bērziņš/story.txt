Aet Bērziņš sat alone in his small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and flickering fluorescent lights. He was a man consumed by curiosity, driven by an insatiable desire to uncover the secrets of the past.

As a historian and cryptologist, Aet had spent years pouring over ancient texts, deciphering forgotten languages, and unraveling the mysteries of long-lost civilizations. His latest obsession was the lost city of Zenith, hidden deep within the Baltic states.

Legend had it that Zenith was a metropolis of unparalleled wealth and knowledge, where scholars and inventors had pushed the boundaries of human understanding in the centuries leading up to its downfall. But like all great secrets, Zenith's existence had been erased from history, leaving behind only cryptic clues and half-forgotten whispers.

Aet spent hours poring over ancient texts, searching for any mention of Zenith. He pored over dusty tomes, yellowed scrolls, and crumbling manuscripts, his eyes scanning the pages for any hint of the lost city's existence.

As night fell, Aet lit a cigar and sat back in his chair, surrounded by the shadows. He closed his eyes, letting the flickering light dance across his face, and began to hum a soft melody. It was an old Latvian tune, one that his grandmother had taught him when he was just a child.

As he sang, Aet's mind began to wander back to his childhood, spent playing in the forests of Latvia with his friends. He remembered the way the sunlight filtered through the trees, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor. He recalled the sound of birdsong and the rustle of leaves as they chased after rabbits.

And then, like a ghostly whisper, it came to him - a phrase from an ancient text that had been lost for centuries. It was a single sentence, penned by some forgotten scholar in a language Aet had only recently learned to decipher. The words seemed to leap off the page, echoing through his mind with an otherworldly clarity.

"Venimus in umbra," he whispered to himself, the phrase dancing on his lips like a mantra.

Aet's eyes snapped open, and he felt a jolt of excitement run through him. He had done it - he had uncovered the first clue to Zenith's existence. The lost city was real, hidden somewhere in the shadows of history waiting to be rediscovered.

With a sense of purpose renewed, Aet lit another cigar and began his search for the truth, driven by a hunger that would not be satisfied until he uncovered the secrets of Zenith.
