Aet Põld trudged through the muddy fields, her worn boots squelching with each step. She had been searching for hours, ever since her sister's letter arrived in the dead of night. The words were cryptic, but one phrase kept echoing in Aet's mind: "Meet me at the old oak by sundown."

As a young woman, Aet had learned to navigate the Estonian wilderness with ease. Her ancestors had lived off this land for generations, and she knew every hidden stream and ancient tree by heart. But something about the letter made her feel restless, like there was more to the story than met the eye.

Aet's eyes scanned the horizon as she walked, the sunlight casting long shadows across the fields. She spotted a figure in the distance, its shape indistinct until it grew larger and clearer. A woman, dressed in worn leather and carrying a worn wooden pack, emerged from behind a row of birch trees.

"Helena?" Aet asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

The woman nodded, a hint of a smile playing on her lips. "Aet Põld. I knew it was you."

They walked together in silence for a while longer, the only sound the rustle of leaves and the distant barking of a dog. Finally, Aet spotted it - an ancient oak, its branches twisted and gnarled with age.

Helena led her closer, her eyes shining with an intensity that made Aet feel both uneasy and curious. "I've been searching for you, sister," Helena said, her voice low and urgent. "The village is in danger. The crops are failing, the animals sickening. I think it's more than just bad luck."

Aet's eyes narrowed, her mind racing with possibilities. She had always known that their family's land was special - that there were secrets hidden beneath its surface, waiting to be uncovered.

"What do you mean?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Helena hesitated, glancing around nervously before answering in a hushed tone: "I think it's the old ones. The spirits of the land."

Aet felt a shiver run down her spine. She had always been skeptical of such tales, but something about Helena's words resonated deep within her.
