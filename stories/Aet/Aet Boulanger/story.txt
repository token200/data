As word of her talents spread, food critics from nearby cities began to flock to Ashwood, eager to sample Aet's creations for themselves. One such critic, Monsieur LaFleur, was particularly taken by Aet's signature "Bûche de Noël aux Fruits Rouges" – a majestic Christmas log cake infused with the essence of red berries and spices that left him speechless.

Despite the attention, Aet remained humble and dedicated to her craft. She spent countless hours perfecting new recipes and experimenting with innovative techniques, always pushing herself to innovate and improve. Her passion for baking was contagious, inspiring a new generation of young bakers in Ashwood to follow in her footsteps.
