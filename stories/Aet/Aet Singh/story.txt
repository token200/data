Aet Singh was a name that evoked intrigue and mystery. Few knew much about the enigmatic figure who roamed the streets of Delhi, leaving a trail of whispers and half-remembered tales in his wake.

As a young boy, Aet Singh had been an orphan, forced to fend for himself on the dusty streets of Old Delhi. He had grown up quick, surviving by his wits and stealth, earning him the nickname "The Ghost Boy" among the local thieves' guild.

Years went by, and Aet Singh's legend grew. He became a master thief, able to slip in and out of the most secure locations with ease. His reputation was whispered about in hushed tones, with some even claiming he had stolen from the royal family itself.

Despite his notoriety, Aet Singh remained an enigma. Few knew his true identity or motivations, and those who did were sworn to secrecy. He seemed to have a personal code of honor, stealing only from those who could afford it, and leaving behind a small token of appreciation in return.

One night, as the moon hung low over the city, Aet Singh received a message from an unknown sender, requesting his presence at an exclusive mansion on the outskirts of town. The message read simply: "Come alone, or don't come at all."

Curious, Aet Singh agreed to meet the mysterious caller. He arrived at the mansion just as the clock struck midnight, and was greeted by a figure shrouded in shadows.

"You're Aet Singh," the figure declared, its voice dripping with an air of superiority. "I've heard a great deal about you. You see, I'm willing to offer you a chance to leave your life of thievery behind... if you can complete one final task for me."

Aet Singh raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the proposal. He had always been driven by his own sense of justice, and this could be the opportunity he'd been waiting for.

"Very well," he said finally. "I'm listening."
