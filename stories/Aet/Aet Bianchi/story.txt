Aet Bianchi stood at the edge of the old stone bridge, gazing out across the mist-shrouded moor. The wind whipped her long, dark hair into a frenzy as she breathed in the damp, earthy scent of the landscape. It was a smell that always brought back memories of her childhood, spent exploring these very same hills and valleys.

As a child, Aet had been fascinated by the ancient stories of the moor's mystical energies. She'd spent countless hours listening to the tales of the local wisewoman, who claimed that the land itself held secrets and powers beyond human comprehension. Aet had always felt drawn to those secrets, as if an insatiable curiosity coursed through her veins.

Years had passed since then, but the call of the moor remained strong. Now, as a grown woman with the weight of her family's legacy upon her shoulders, Aet found herself increasingly entwined in the world of healing and magic that her ancestors had left behind.

She wore a silver necklace around her neck, adorned with a small crystal pendant passed down through generations of Bianchis. The stone seemed to hum with an otherworldly energy as she stood there, feeling its vibrations resonate deep within her chest.

Aet's thoughts turned to the strange occurrences that had been plaguing the village lately – livestock falling ill, crops withering away, and an unshakeable sense of unease hanging over the residents. She'd been called upon by the local healers to help uncover the source of the trouble, but so far, her efforts had yielded nothing but dead ends.

As she stood there, lost in thought, Aet felt a presence behind her. She turned to find an old man, his face creased with age and wisdom, watching her from beneath the brim of his hat. He nodded at her, as if to say "I've been waiting."

Without a word, the old man led Aet across the bridge, into the heart of the moor itself. The air seemed to thicken around them, as if the very fabric of reality was bending to accommodate their journey. They walked in silence, the only sound the soft rustle of leaves and twigs beneath their feet.

Eventually, they came upon a clearing, where Aet saw it for the first time – a great, ancient tree, its branches twisted and gnarled with age. The old man nodded once more, as if to indicate that this was the source of the trouble. And in that moment, Aet knew that her journey had only just begun.
