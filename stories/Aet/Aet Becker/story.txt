It all started when Aet Becker received a cryptic message from an unknown source, leading her to a secluded mansion on the outskirts of town. The air was thick with an eerie energy, and Aet Becker's instincts told her that something was amiss.

As she entered the mansion, she noticed a series of strange symbols etched into the walls. Aet Becker recognized them as an ancient language used by a long-lost civilization. She carefully transcribed the symbols onto a small notebook, hoping to decipher their meaning.

Suddenly, the lights flickered, and Aet Becker heard a faint whisper in her ear. "Get out while you still can." The voice sent shivers down her spine, but Aet Becker remained steadfast. She knew that she had to uncover the truth behind the mansion's dark history.
