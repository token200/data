Rumors swirled around the city, with some claiming Aet Maldini was a former member of an elite thieves' guild, while others believed her to be a brilliant scientist turned rogue. Whatever the truth may have been, one thing was certain: Aet's legend had grown, and those who knew her were bound by a shared secret.

As she vanished into the shadows, Aet Maldini smiled to herself, knowing that her reputation as the greatest thief of all time would only continue to grow. The city might never fully understand her, but they couldn't deny the allure of her mystique.
