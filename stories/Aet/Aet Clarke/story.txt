Aet Clarke stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her colleague, Rachel, sipping on a coffee and made her way over. As she approached, Rachel looked up and smiled.

"Aet! Hey, how's it going?" Rachel asked, setting down her cup.

Aet Clarke took a seat across from Rachel, unwrapping the scarf she had worn that morning to protect her neck from the chilly autumn air. "It's going," she replied, tucking the scarf back into her pocket. "Just trying to get through this deadline."

The two women chatted for a bit, discussing their work and sharing stories about their weekends. Aet Clarke had always been close with Rachel, who had become like a sister to her after years of working together.

As they talked, a young woman walked by the table, catching Aet's attention. There was something about the way she carried herself that reminded Aet of a famous artist from her history class. She excused herself and got up to follow the woman.

"Rachel, wait!" Aet called out, but Rachel didn't look back as she continued on with their conversation.

Aet Clarke trailed behind, curiosity getting the better of her. The woman eventually stopped in front of a small art gallery, where a painting caught her eye. It was a portrait of a woman who looked uncannily like Aet's own face.

The artist, sensing Aet's gaze, turned around and smiled. "Ah, you've seen it," she said, approaching Aet. "I'm Aria Grayson, by the way."

Aet Clarke's eyes widened as she took in Aria's features. They were identical. She felt a shiver run down her spine as Aria began to explain her inspiration behind the painting.

As they talked, Aet learned that Aria was also working on a novel and had published several pieces of short fiction online. Aet found herself getting lost in conversation with this stranger-turned-artist, feeling an unexpected connection.

Eventually, it was time for Aet Clarke to leave, but she made sure to exchange numbers with Aria Grayson – Aet's real name, that is. She couldn't wait to learn more about her new friend and see where their paths would lead in the future.

With a newfound sense of wonder, Aet made her way back to Rachel, unaware of how much had changed in just a few minutes.
