Andrzej Jing was a man with a reputation for being untouchable. A former hitman and assassin, he had left his violent past behind and started a new life as a successful businessman in Tokyo. By day, he was Andrzej Jing, owner of the lucrative Jing Enterprises, but by night, whispers of his old life still lingered.

As a young man, Andrzej Jing had been recruited by a powerful Russian oligarch to work as a hitman. He proved himself to be ruthless and efficient, taking on missions that required him to blend into the shadows. But after a particularly botched job left one of his targets alive, Andrzej Jing knew it was time to move on.

He abandoned his old life and reinvented himself in Tokyo, where he built a new identity for himself as a respected businessman. He married a Japanese woman and started a family, but the ghosts of his past never truly faded away.

Despite his newfound success, Andrzej Jing couldn't shake the feeling that his old life was still waiting for him, just beneath the surface. He would receive mysterious phone calls in the dead of night, and sometimes, he would catch glimpses of familiar faces lurking in the shadows.

One evening, as Andrzej Jing was closing up the office, a figure emerged from the darkness. It was a woman with piercing green eyes, her face twisted into a cold smile. "Andrzej," she said, her voice dripping with menace. "It's been too long."

For a moment, Andrzej Jing's old instincts took over, and he felt the familiar rush of adrenaline. But then, something unexpected happened - he recognized the woman as his former handler, and his emotions shifted from fear to curiosity.

"What do you want?" Andrzej Jing asked, his voice steady despite the turmoil within him. The woman smiled again, and for a moment, it seemed like she was enjoying herself. "I have a proposition for you, Andrzej Jing," she said. "One that will change everything."
