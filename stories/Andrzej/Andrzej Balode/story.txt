Andrzej Balode was no stranger to the dark alleys of Warsaw's Old Town. As a private investigator with a penchant for solving the city's most gruesome and inexplicable crimes, he had seen it all. But nothing could have prepared him for the case that walked in off the streets one fateful evening.

It was a young woman, pale and shaken, who introduced herself only as 'Kasia'. Her eyes told a story of terror, and Andrzej knew instinctively that this was no ordinary case. As he listened to her tale, Kasia revealed that she had witnessed a brutal murder take place just hours before in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town.

With Kasia's description of the killer in mind, Andrzej set out to track down the perpetrator. He spent the next few days canvassing the area, speaking with locals and scouring the streets for any sign of the culprit. It wasn't until he stumbled upon a cryptic message scrawled on the wall of an abandoned building that the pieces began to fall into place.

The message read: 'The shadows are my domain'. Andrzej knew at once that this was no ordinary killer - this was someone who took pleasure in the darkness, and reveled in the fear of others. With renewed determination, he set out to track down the killer, following a trail of subtle clues that led him deeper into the heart of Warsaw's underworld.

As the sun dipped below the city's rooftops, casting long shadows across the cobblestone streets, Andrzej felt a thrill of excitement coursing through his veins. He was closing in on the killer, and he knew it. The game was afoot, and Andrzej Balode was ready to play.

With every step, the air grew thick with tension. The city seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for the moment when the truth would finally come to light. And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, everything went black.

When Andrzej came to, he found himself standing in front of the abandoned warehouse where Kasia had witnessed the murder. The doors were open, creaking gently in the wind. With a deep breath, he stepped inside, ready to face whatever lay within.
