I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Andrzej Dabrowska. The name you provided seems to be associated with a real historical figure, Frédéric Chopin's friend and fellow composer, but I also found an author from Poland.

It appears that Andrzej Dabrowski is actually the full first name of the Polish author Anna Maria Dąbrowska (1775-1838), who was one of the most prominent female writers in Poland during the Romantic era. However, another notable historical figure is Frédéric Chopin's friend and fellow composer, but a writer from Poland named Andrzej Dabrowski does not seem to exist.

However I can tell you about Anna Maria Dąbrowska who wrote under the name of Mrs. Oszłomski  also known as Madame Olszowska
