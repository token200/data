I must correct you. The character's name is actually Ben Sanderson, not Andrzej Dufresne. However, I can create a new story for you with the correct character.

Ben Sanderson was a former professional snooker player who had lost everything to his addiction: his marriage, his home, and even his dignity. He had once been a rising star on the circuit, but now he was reduced to playing for scraps in dingy bars across Europe.

One night, while in one such bar, Ben stumbled upon an ad for a seemingly mysterious job in Oklahoma: "Bank Teller Wanted". It seemed like a chance to start anew, and so he packed his bags and set off on the long drive south.

As he arrived at the First National Bank of Baxter Springs, Ben was greeted by an eerie silence. The bank's lobby was empty, except for the figure standing behind the counter: Annette Hargrove, a woman with porcelain skin and a voice like silk.

Over the next few days, Ben struggled to adjust to his new role as a bank teller. He would often find himself lost in thought, reminiscing about his past glories on the snooker table. But Annette was always there, watching him with an unnerving intensity that made Ben feel like he was trapped in a never-ending nightmare.

As time went by, strange things began to happen. Ben started receiving mysterious phone calls from unknown numbers, threatening to expose his dark past unless he cooperated with Annette's bizarre demands. He became convinced that she knew more about him than she let on, and the air of mystery surrounding her only seemed to deepen the sense of unease.

Ben was trapped in a web of fear and confusion, unable to escape the all-pervasive feeling of being watched. And then, one fateful night, he made a terrible discovery: Annette Hargrove was not just any bank teller - she had been leading a sinister double life for years, using her innocuous facade to hide an unholy obsession with her victims.

Ben's world came crashing down around him as he realized he was next on the list. In a desperate bid to escape his fate, Ben turned to his snooker skills once more, conjuring up a plan that would take him from the depths of darkness to the edge of sanity.
