Jerzy Poirier stepped off the train and onto the platform, his worn leather boots making a familiar scuffling sound on the concrete. He had been traveling for days, ever since he'd received that mysterious letter from an old acquaintance in Montreal. The words had been brief, but the implication clear: Jerzy Poirier's skills as a "facilitator" were needed somewhere.

As he walked through the station, Jerzy's eyes scanned the crowded platforms, searching for any sign of trouble. He'd seen it all before - the desperate, the downtrodden, and the desperate with a plan to get ahead by any means necessary. Jerzy Poirier knew them all too well.

He made his way to the agreed-upon meeting point, a dingy café on the outskirts of town. The sign creaked in the gentle breeze, reading "Le Coeur Rouge" - The Red Heart. Jerzy smiled wryly; he'd heard that was what they called this part of town: the heart of darkness.

 Inside, the café was dim and smoky, with only a handful of patrons scattered around the small tables. A figure stood by the door, hood pulled up to conceal their face. Jerzy's instincts prickled; something wasn't quite right.

"Jerzy Poirier," the figure growled, pushing back its hood to reveal a woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. "I'm Lena. We meet about your... services."

Lena handed him a folder filled with photographs and documents. Jerzy flipped through them quickly; it seemed he was being asked to transport a valuable package from Montreal to Quebec City. Easy money, or so it seemed.

Jerzy Poirier raised an eyebrow. He wasn't one for taking orders blindly. "What's in the box?" he asked Lena, his voice low and even.

Lena smiled coldly. "That, my friend, is classified."

Jerzy shrugged; some things were better left unspoken. He pocketed the folder and nodded once. "I'm in."

As they shook hands to seal the deal, Jerzy Poirier couldn't shake the feeling that he was getting in over his head. But he'd played this game too many times to let a little caution get in the way. After all, it was Jerzy Poirier who had earned the reputation as Montreal's go-to facilitator - for better or worse.

With a final glance around the café, Jerzy turned to leave, ready to face whatever lay ahead. The Red Heart might be a part of this city's underbelly, but Jerzy Poirier knew its secrets - and he was always willing to share them for a price.
