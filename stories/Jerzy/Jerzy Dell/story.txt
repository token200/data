As a child, he would spend hours listening to records by Miles Davis and John Coltrane, mesmerized by their improvisational skills.

As Jerzy grew older, his love for music only deepened. He began to teach himself how to play the saxophone, and soon he was performing at local bars and clubs in his village. News of Jerzy Dell's talent spread quickly, and before long, he was invited to perform at larger venues in Poland.

One day, Jerzy received an offer to join a jazz band based in New York City. Excited by the prospect of playing with some of the best musicians in the world, Jerzy packed his bags and made the move across the Atlantic. As Jerzy Dell, he quickly became known for his soulful solos and charismatic stage presence.

Jerzy's time with the band was marked by incredible success. He toured Europe and North America, sharing the stage with icons like Herbie Hancock and Diana Krall. But despite all the attention, Jerzy remained humble and true to his roots. He continued to draw inspiration from Polish folk music and the jazz greats of his childhood.
