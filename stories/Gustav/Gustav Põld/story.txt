Gustav Põld was a quiet man with an extraordinary talent for observation. As a detective in Tallinn, Estonia's capital city, he had spent years honing his skills of deduction and attention to detail. His colleagues often joked that Gustav Põld could see more than met the eye, and it wasn't far from the truth.

One drizzly evening, Gustav Põld received a visit from a frantic businesswoman named Maria. She claimed her company's prized diamond necklace had gone missing, and the only clue was a cryptic message left on their safe: "The eyes that see are not the ones that look." Gustav Põld listened attentively as Maria described the events leading up to the theft.

As he puffed on his long-stemmed pipe, Gustav Põld began to weave together the seemingly unrelated threads of the case. He noticed a faint smudge of blue ink on the safe's locking mechanism, which seemed out of place among the sleek, modern security features. This tiny detail sparked an idea in his mind.

The next morning, Gustav Põld paid a visit to the local pawn shop, where he had heard rumors of a suspicious individual matching Maria's description. After some discreet inquiries, he discovered that "Ava" – the mysterious pawnbroker – was indeed connected to the necklace.

Gustav Põld made his way to Ava's shop, where he found her attempting to fence the stolen diamond for an exorbitant sum. With a subtle nod, Gustav Põld revealed his true identity and gently asked Ava about the blue ink. Her eyes darted around the room as she hesitated before producing a tiny notebook with a single sentence scribbled on it: "Ava's eyes see not what others look." The game was up.

As Gustav Põld recovered the necklace, he couldn't help but smile at the ingenuity of the thief. It turned out that Ava – or rather, the real name behind her alias – was a former actress with an obsession for Shakespearean drama. She had woven an elaborate riddle around herself to keep potential buyers off her trail.

When Gustav Põld returned the necklace to Maria's grateful face, he couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction. His extraordinary talent for observation had once again solved a complex case, much to everyone's surprise. As for Gustav Põld himself? He simply smiled quietly, content in the knowledge that his work was done – for now.
