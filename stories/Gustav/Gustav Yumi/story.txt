Gustav Yumi stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the city. His eyes, an unsettling shade of green, scanned the horizon as if searching for something only he could see. The wind whipped his dark hair into a frenzy, and his black coat billowed behind him like a shroud.

As a former member of the elite Yumi family, Gustav had always been expected to live up to their legacy. His ancestors had built the city's underworld into an empire, and Gustav was supposed to be its crown prince. But he had other plans.

Gustav turned away from the view, his gaze falling upon a photograph tucked into his pocket. It was of him as a child, standing alongside his brother, Hiro. The two brothers had grown up in a world of power and privilege, but Gustav had always felt suffocated by their expectations.

He took a deep breath, feeling the weight of his responsibilities settle upon him once more. As he stepped forward, the rooftop's edge seemed to disappear beneath his feet, and he was consumed by an overwhelming sense of uncertainty.

Gustav's thoughts were interrupted by a faint hum, growing louder with each passing moment. The air around him began to distort, as if reality itself was bending to accommodate something new. A figure materialized before him, its features shifting like the surface of a pond.

The creature spoke in a voice that echoed through Gustav's mind, "You have been chosen, Yumi. Chosen to wield the power of the forgotten."

Gustav raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. He knew little of this power, but something within him stirred with anticipation. Without thinking, he reached out and touched the creature's form.

A surge of energy coursed through his veins, and Gustav felt the world shift around him. The city below seemed to tilt and writhe like a living thing, its skyscrapers reaching toward him like skeletal fingers.

As the darkness receded, Gustav gazed upon his own reflection in a gleaming sheet of metal embedded in the rooftop's surface. His eyes now burned with an otherworldly intensity, and his hair had turned a wild tangle of silver-blonde.

He smiled to himself, knowing that he would never be bound by the expectations of others again. Gustav Yumi was no longer just a member of a family â€“ he was something more, a force of nature waiting to be unleashed upon the world.

With a silent nod, the creature vanished into thin air, leaving Gustav alone once more, but forever changed.
