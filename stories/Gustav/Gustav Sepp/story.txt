The other players eyed him warily, but Gustav's charisma quickly won them over, and he soon found himself seated at the high-stakes table.

With a calculating gaze, Gustav surveyed his opponents, his mind racing with strategies and calculations. This was going to be a long night, but Gustav Johann Andreas Sepp was ready for whatever came next. The game was on, and only one man would emerge victorious.
