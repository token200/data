Gustav Lucas Lacquer, known to his friends and acquaintances as Gustav Lace, was a master of the eccentric and bizarre. A curator of rare and unusual artifacts, he had spent years tracking down the most esoteric relics in the world. His current obsession was a taxidermied two-headed turtle named Bertrand.

Gustav's fascination with Bertrand began on a chance visit to a dusty old antique shop in rural France. The vendor, an elderly man with sunken eyes, claimed that Bertrand had been part of an ancient Egyptian royal menagerie. Gustav was skeptical, but something about the turtle's enigmatic stare drew him in.

Over the years, Gustav spent countless hours studying Bertrand's anatomy and behavior. He theorized that the two heads might be linked by a shared consciousness or perhaps even communicate through some form of telepathy. His friends and colleagues found his obsession amusing at best, but Gustav couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to Bertrand than met the eye.

As he sat in his cluttered office, surrounded by shelves of ancient texts and oddities, Gustav pondered the mysteries of the turtle's existence. He felt an inexplicable connection to Bertrand, as if their bond was forged across centuries and cultures. His fingers instinctively reached out to stroke the turtle's glassy surface, and he swore that he heard a faint whisper in response.

Gustav's life had always been a series of peculiar encounters and unexpected detours, but none had ever captivated him quite like Bertrand. Some might say he was mad, others simply eccentric, but Gustav knew the truth: that some secrets were too strange to be contained within the rational world. And it was on those rare moments when he gazed into Bertrand's unblinking eyes that Gustav felt closest to understanding the universe.

In a dimly lit corner of his office, a small plaque bore the name 'Bertrand' in faded gold lettering. Next to it stood a single word, scrawled on a scrap of yellowed paper: 'Follow'.
