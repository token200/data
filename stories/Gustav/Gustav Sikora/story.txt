One drizzly evening, Gustav Sikora received a visit from a distraught Mrs. Jenkins, whose prized diamond necklace had gone missing. She begged Gustav to take on the case, and he agreed, his curiosity piqued by the challenge. As he began to investigate, Gustav's exceptional powers of observation took him on a wild goose chase through the city's upscale boutiques and high-end jewelry stores.

With each new lead, Gustav's mental map of the case grew more intricate, but he refused to give up.
