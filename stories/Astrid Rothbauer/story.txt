Astrid Rothbauer stepped out of her small, cluttered apartment and into the crisp morning air. She took a deep breath, feeling the coolness fill her lungs as she gazed out at the city below. The skyscrapers seemed to stretch on forever, their peaks hiding in the clouds like jagged teeth.

As a freelance journalist, Astrid had always found solace in the chaos of the city. It was where she felt most alive, most herself. She lived for the rush of chasing down leads, the thrill of uncovering secrets that others had missed.

But today, Astrid's mind wasn't on work. Today, she was worried about her sister, Lena. They had been estranged for months, and Astrid hadn't heard from her in weeks. Their relationship had always been complicated, but Astrid couldn't shake the feeling that something was seriously wrong.

Astrid pulled out her phone and dialed a familiar number. It rang twice before a hesitant voice answered on the other end. "Astrid? Is that you?"

"Hey, Lena," Astrid said softly, trying to keep her tone neutral. She didn't want to scare her sister off.

There was a pause, and for a moment, Astrid wondered if she'd lost the connection. Then, Lena spoke up, her voice laced with tears. "I'm so sorry, Astrid. I know we haven't been talking, but...I need your help."

Astrid's heart skipped a beat as she listened to her sister's words. Something was seriously wrong, and Astrid knew that she had to drop everything to get to the bottom of it.

She agreed to meet Lena at a small caf√© in the city, and spent the next hour making her way there, her mind racing with possibilities. When she arrived, Lena was already seated at a corner table, sipping on a cup of coffee.

Astrid slid into the seat across from her sister, taking in the look of desperation etched on Lena's face. "What happened?" Astrid asked gently, trying to keep her own emotions in check.

Lena took a deep breath before speaking, her words tumbling out in a rush. "I was involved with some bad people, Astrid. People who...who hurt me." She paused, wiping away a tear.

Astrid's grip on the table tightened as she listened to her sister's story. It sounded like the kind of thing that could get her killed, and Astrid knew that she had to act fast.
