Émilie Abdi stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling streets of Marseille. As a journalist, she had spent years covering the city's rich history and culture, but today was different. Today, she was on a mission to uncover the truth about her family's past.

Her grandmother, Fatima, had always been tight-lipped about their heritage, leaving Émilie with more questions than answers. Growing up in Paris, she had assumed that her family was French, or at least French-influenced. But after discovering a cryptic letter hidden away in her attic, Émilie became determined to learn more.

As she walked through the winding streets of Le Panier, the historic neighborhood where many African and Middle Eastern immigrants once settled, Émilie felt a sense of excitement and trepidation. She had always been fascinated by the stories of her ancestors, who had fled war-torn Somalia and Ethiopia to start anew in France.

She stopped at a small café, ordering a cup of strong coffee as she pulled out her notebook and began to research. The owner, a kind-eyed woman named Aïcha, noticed Émilie's intensity and approached her table. "Bonjour, mademoiselle," she said. "What brings you here today?"

Émilie hesitated, unsure if she should share her story with this stranger. But something about Aïcha's warm smile put her at ease. "I'm searching for information about my family's history," Émilie explained. "My grandmother passed away recently, and I found a letter that suggests we may be from Somalia or Ethiopia."

Aïcha's eyes widened, and she nodded enthusiastically. "I think I can help you," she said, pulling out her own notebook and beginning to write.

Over the next few hours, Émilie learned about the history of African and Middle Eastern immigrants in Marseille, as well as the struggles they faced in building new lives. She also discovered that her grandmother's name was Fatima Abdi – a common name among Somali and Ethiopian women.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the city, Émilie felt a sense of connection to her heritage that she had never felt before. She knew that this journey was just beginning, but for the first time in her life, she felt like she was home.
