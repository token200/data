Émilie Saar stepped into the dimly lit jazz club, her eyes scanning the crowded room in search of her friend, Léon. The smooth sounds of a saxophone wafted through the air, transporting her to a bygone era of sophistication and elegance. As she made her way through the throng of patrons, Émilie's thoughts drifted back to her own passion for music - or rather, her desire to learn it.

Growing up in the small town of Krefeld, Germany, Émilie had always been fascinated by the world beyond her narrow horizons. She spent countless hours listening to records by Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday, dreaming of the day she could sing like them. Though her parents encouraged her to pursue a more practical career, Émilie's heart belonged to music.

Now, as an adult, Émilie found herself working as a translator for a small firm in Düsseldorf. It was a decent job, but one that left her feeling unfulfilled and restless. Léon, on the other hand, had followed his dreams and become a successful jazz musician, touring Europe and playing to sold-out crowds.

As Émilie spotted Léon across the room, she felt a surge of excitement and envy. She made her way over to him, feeling a little self-conscious about her own lackluster career choices. But as they hugged hello, Léon's warm smile put her at ease. "How's life been treating you, Em?" he asked, using the affectionate nickname only he reserved for her.

Émilie shrugged, feeling a pang of uncertainty. "It's...fine," she replied, not wanting to admit how unfulfilled she felt. Léon nodded sympathetically and invited her to join him on stage after the show. As they took their places beside each other, Émilie felt the familiar rush of adrenaline that came with performing music. It was a fleeting moment of joy, one that left her feeling more alive than she had in weeks.

As the night drew to a close, Léon turned to Émilie and said, "You know, Em, I've been thinking...maybe it's time you pursued your own musical dreams." His words sparked a glimmer of hope within her. Maybe, just maybe, it was never too late for Émilie Saar to follow her heart.
