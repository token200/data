Émilie Fernández González sat alone at a small café, sipping her coffee and staring out the rain-soaked window. As an investigative journalist, she was no stranger to late nights and rainy days, but this particular morning felt different.

She had been working on a story about corruption in the city's government for months, following a trail of clues that led her to a small café like this one, where the owner, Carlos, seemed to know more than he let on. Émilie's instincts told her that Carlos was hiding something, and she was determined to get to the bottom of it.

As she pondered her next move, a woman with striking green eyes walked into the café, shaking the rain off her coat. Émilie recognized her - it was Sofía, a former government official who had been mysteriously transferred out of the city's corruption investigation team just weeks ago.

Sofía spotted Émilie and slid into the empty seat across from her, ordering a coffee in a low tone. "You're not going to believe what happened last night," she said, eyes darting around the café as if searching for eavesdroppers.

Émilie's ears perked up. "Try me," she said, leaning forward.

Sofía took a deep breath and began to recount her story. She had been given evidence of a massive embezzlement scheme by her colleagues in the corruption unit - enough to bring down several high-ranking officials. But instead of turning it over to the authorities, she was suddenly reassigned to work at a small agricultural project on the outskirts of the city.

"The director of that project is none other than Carlos's brother," Sofía whispered, eyes locking onto Émilie's.

Émilie felt her mind racing. This was the break she had been waiting for - proof that the corruption went all the way to the top. She pulled out her notebook and began scribbling notes as fast as her fingers could move.

"Thank you, Sofía," she said finally, smiling. "You've just given me the story of a lifetime."

Sofía smiled back, relief written across her face. "Just be careful, Émilie. If they find out what I've told you..."

Émilie nodded. She knew the risks involved in investigating corruption - but she was ready for whatever came next.

As Sofía left the café, disappearing into the rain-soaked streets, Émilie felt a thrill of excitement. This was it – her big break. And she was ready to see it through, no matter what lay ahead.
