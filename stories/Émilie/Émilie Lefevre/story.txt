Just as she was about to take another sip of her coffee, the café door swung open and a flustered-looking woman rushed in, dashing Émilie's reverie. "Mademoiselle Lefevre, I need your help," the woman begged, out of breath. "My sister has gone missing and the police aren't taking me seriously."

Émilie's instincts kicked in immediately, and she ushered the woman into a seat across from her. "Tell me everything," she instructed, her eyes locked onto the worried face before her.
