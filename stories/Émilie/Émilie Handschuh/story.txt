Émilie's love affair with photography began when she stumbled upon an old camera in her grandmother's attic. The worn leather case and intricate mechanisms drew her in like a magnet, and she was hooked from that very first click. She spent years honing her craft, studying the works of the great masters and experimenting with different techniques to find her unique voice.

One fateful evening, while wandering through Kreuzberg's bustling streets, Émilie Handschuh stumbled upon a hidden courtyard tucked away between two rowdy bars. The narrow alleyway was lined with crumbling brick walls, overgrown with vines and tangled with twinkling fairy lights.

For in the stillness of the night, when the world seemed to slow down and the only sound was the soft hum of the city's pulse, she found solace and inspiration.
