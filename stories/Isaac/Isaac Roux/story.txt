One stormy evening, a young woman named Sarah walked into Isaac's small, cluttered office. She was trembling with fear as she recounted her recent loss: her child had passed away suddenly, leaving her feeling lost and alone. Isaac listened attentively, his eyes filled with compassion as he nodded in understanding.

Without hesitation, Isaac closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He began to hum softly, allowing the energy of the room to shift around him. As he opened his eyes, Sarah saw visions dancing before them: her child playing in a lush meadow, laughing with friends under a sun-drenched sky. The images faded slowly, leaving behind an eerie stillness.

"Your child is at peace," Isaac said softly. "They're waiting for you on the other side." Tears streamed down Sarah's face as she grasped the truth of his words. She had been clinging to the fear of losing her precious one, but now, with Isaac's guidance, she saw a new reality unfolding before her.
