One stormy evening, a worried Mrs. Jenkins arrived at Välja's office, her usually composed demeanor shaken to its core. Her prized family heirloom, a priceless diamond necklace, had gone missing from her estate, and she suspected foul play. Isaac listened intently as she recounted the events leading up to the theft, his piercing gaze never wavering.

With a flick of his wrist, Välja summoned his trusty notebook and began scribbling down notes at an alarming rate.
