Isaac Ryota stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit café, shaking the water off his trench coat. He had just received a cryptic message from an unknown number, summoning him to meet with an old acquaintance. As he waited for his contact to arrive, Isaac sipped on a warm cup of coffee and watched the rain-soaked streets outside.

The door swung open, and a woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair walked in. "Isaac Ryota," she said, her voice low and husky. "It's been a long time."

Isaac smiled wryly as he stood up to greet her. "Aurora. What brings you to this fine establishment?"

Aurora took a seat across from him, her eyes scanning the café before focusing on Isaac once more. "I've heard rumors of your... extracurricular activities," she said, her voice dripping with intrigue.

Isaac raised an eyebrow, his mind racing with possibilities. What could Aurora possibly know about his clandestine life? He had been careful to keep his true nature hidden from the world, but it seemed that someone had discovered his secret.

"I'm not sure what you're talking about," Isaac said, trying to sound nonchalant despite the growing unease in his stomach.

Aurora chuckled, a low, throaty sound. "Don't play dumb with me, Isaac Ryota. I know all about your little exploits. And I have information that could change everything."

Isaac's heart quickened as he leaned forward, his eyes locked on Aurora's. What did she want? And how much was she willing to trade for this information? The game was afoot, and Isaac Ryota was ready to play.

As they sat there in the dimly lit café, the rain pounding against the windows like a rhythmic drumbeat, Isaac knew that this encounter would be just the beginning of a very long night.
