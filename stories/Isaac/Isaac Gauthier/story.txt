Isaac Gauthier stepped off the last train of the evening, his eyes scanning the deserted platform. He had been waiting for what felt like an eternity, and the silence was starting to get to him. The flickering streetlights cast long shadows across the worn concrete, making him feel like he was walking into a dream.

As he made his way through the sleepy town of Ravenswood, Isaac's thoughts were consumed by the letter in his pocket. It had arrived yesterday, delivered to his small apartment in the city with no indication who it came from or what it meant. All it said was "meet me at the old oak tree at midnight" and a single initial: I.

Isaac had tried to shake off the feeling of unease that had settled in his stomach since he'd read the words, but they lingered, refusing to be silenced. He couldn't help but wonder who could have written such a cryptic message and why they wanted him there at midnight.

As he walked, the trees seemed to close in around him, casting an eerie gloom over the deserted streets. The old oak tree loomed ahead, its gnarled branches stretching towards the sky like skeletal fingers. Isaac felt a shiver run down his spine as he approached the base of the tree, the air growing thick with anticipation.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows, their features illuminated by the moon rising over the horizon. It was her â€“ the woman whose face had haunted Isaac's dreams for years. She was younger now, but her eyes still held the same piercing intensity that had drawn him in so many times before.

"I've been waiting," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Isaac felt his heart pound as he took a step closer, his mind racing with questions and doubts. What did she want from him? Why now? And what lay hidden behind those enigmatic eyes?

As the clock struck midnight, Isaac hesitated for just a moment before reaching out to take her hand. The connection was electric, sparking a chain of emotions that had been dormant for years.

The old oak tree stood watch as they vanished into the night, leaving behind only the faintest whisper of their presence.
