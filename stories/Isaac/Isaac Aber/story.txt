Isaac Aber was a man of mystery, shrouded in an aura of quiet confidence. A former detective, he had traded in his badge for a life of solitude, living on the outskirts of town where the only sound was the wind rustling through the trees.

It had been five years since Isaac's last case, one that had left him shaken to his core. The memory of the young girl's eyes still haunted him - their bright blue sparkle frozen in time as she lay lifeless on the pavement. It was a case he couldn't shake, and it had driven him from the only life he'd ever known.

Isaac's current existence was one of simplicity. He spent his days tending to his garden, watching the seasons change with a quiet appreciation for the beauty in the world around him. Yet, there were moments when the silence was broken by a faint scratching at the door. It was then that Isaac knew someone had come to visit.

He made his way to the porch, his boots creaking on the weathered wood. A young woman stood before him, her eyes scanning the overgrown yard as if searching for something - or someone. Isaac recognized the look, one he'd seen in himself years ago.

"I'm looking for a detective," she said, her voice firm but laced with desperation.

Isaac raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. "What makes you think I'm still here?"

The woman hesitated before producing a faded photograph from her pocket. Isaac's heart skipped a beat as he recognized the face staring back at him - the same bright blue eyes that had haunted his dreams for years.

"It was taken during my sister's murder," she said, tears brimming in her eyes. "I've been searching for answers ever since."

Isaac's stoic exterior cracked, revealing a glimmer of compassion beneath. He took the photograph from her hand and nodded once. "Let's find your sister's killer."

And so, Isaac Aber stepped back into the shadows, his silence now replaced with a fierce determination to uncover the truth. As he led the young woman down a path fraught with danger and uncertainty, one thing became clear: some mysteries were too old to leave unsolved.
