Isaac Mendes stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the sleepy town before him. The air was thick with the scent of saltwater and decay, a familiar smell that always brought back memories of summers spent at the coast as a child.

As he made his way through the station, Isaac's thoughts drifted to the letter he had received just yesterday - an invitation from his estranged sister, Sophia, to return home for her wedding. It had been years since they'd last spoken, and Isaac had assumed their relationship was irreparably broken.

But the letter had stirred something within him, a mix of emotions that left him feeling both hopeful and trepidatous. He thought back to the good times they'd shared as kids - exploring the tide pools, sharing secrets, and laughing until their sides ached.

As he walked through the town, Isaac noticed the way people looked at him - with curiosity, suspicion, or outright hostility. Some of them had known his family, while others had heard stories about the outsider who had grown up on the outskirts of town.

Isaac's past was complicated, to say the least. His parents had died in a tragic accident when he was young, leaving him alone and adrift. He'd bounced from foster home to foster home before finding himself at the local orphanage, where he'd eventually met Sophia.

Their relationship had been one of siblings - fierce and protective, with moments of warmth and laughter. But as they grew older, their differences began to drive them apart. Isaac had always felt like an outsider in town, while Sophia seemed content to stay put, building a life that was stable and familiar.

The train station was quiet now, save for the sound of seagulls overhead. Isaac stood on the edge, staring out at the ocean as the waves lapped against the shore. He knew he had two weeks before Sophia's wedding - time to decide whether to face his past or let it remain buried.

For the first time in years, Isaac felt a spark of determination ignite within him. He would return home, not just for Sophia's sake, but for his own. It was time to uncover the truth about their family's past and confront the demons that had driven them apart.
