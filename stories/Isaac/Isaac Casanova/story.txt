As a member of the powerful Casanova family, Isaac had grown up with the weight of expectation on his shoulders.

Despite his aristocratic upbringing, Isaac yearned for adventure and excitement beyond the confines of his family's estate. He spent countless nights pouring over dusty tomes in the library, devouring tales of piracy and exploration. His restless spirit longed to set sail for the high seas, to chart new territories, and to uncover hidden treasures.

One fateful evening, Isaac received an invitation from a reclusive collector to join him on a private expedition to the Caribbean.

Upon arrival, Isaac met the enigmatic collector, a man known only as "The Patron." With a keen eye for valuable artifacts, The Patron guided Isaac through the dense jungle, pointing out ancient ruins and hidden temples.

With a hint of mischief in his eyes, Isaac smiled to himself, knowing that The Patron's true intentions were still shrouded in mystery. He couldn't wait to uncover the next piece of the puzzle, and to continue exploring the world beyond the confines of his family's legacy.
