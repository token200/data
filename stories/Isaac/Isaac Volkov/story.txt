Isaac Volkov stepped out of his sleek, black sedan and onto the sun-kissed streets of Monte Carlo. The sound of jazz music and the hum of luxury cars filled the air as he made his way to the exclusive Casino de Monte-Carlo. He was a man accustomed to getting what he wanted, when he wanted it.

A Russian oligarch with a reputation for ruthlessness and cunning, Isaac had built his fortune on the backs of those who underestimated him. His eyes scanned the crowded room, locking onto a familiar face - Sofia, his former business partner turned rival. The tension between them was palpable, but Isaac's expression remained calm, a mask he wore like a well-tailored suit.

As he made his way to their table, Isaac's mind began to wander back to the deal that had gone sour just weeks prior. Sofia's betrayal still seared, but Isaac knew he couldn't let it get to him. He had more important things to attend to - like consolidating his power and expanding his empire.

Isaac slipped into his seat, signaling for a drink. The dealer shuffled the cards with a flourish, and Isaac began to play, his fingers dancing across the felt as he manipulated the odds in his favor. His opponents underestimated him at their own peril - Isaac was a master of the game, always staying one step ahead.

As the night wore on, Sofia's frustration grew, her face reddening with each loss. Isaac watched with an air of detachment, his eyes never leaving hers. The game of cat and mouse between them had begun long before this moment, and it would continue until only one of them emerged victorious.

With a flourish, Isaac pushed all-in, revealing a straight flush that left Sofia stunned. He raked in the pot, his smile twisted into a thin-lipped grin. "Looks like I'm still the king," he said, his voice dripping with condescension.

The crowd parted as Sofia stood up, her eyes blazing with anger and defeat. Isaac watched her walk away, feeling no sense of triumph - only a familiar itch to be fed again. The game was far from over; in fact, it had just begun. And Isaac Volkov was always ready to play.
