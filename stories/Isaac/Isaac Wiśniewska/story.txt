It was then that he spotted her: a woman with raven-black hair and piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through him.

They exchanged brief words before she disappeared into the crowd, leaving Isaac feeling both intrigued and unsettled. As the evening drew to a close, he couldn't shake off the feeling that his life was about to take an unexpected turn.

Isaac Wiśniewska slipped away into the night, lost in thought, pondering the enigmatic woman's presence in his life. Little did he know that this chance encounter would set him on a path that would forever alter the course of his existence.
