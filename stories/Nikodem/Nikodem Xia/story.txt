Nikodem Xia sat in the dimly lit room, his eyes fixed on the old watch sitting on the small wooden table. It was an heirloom, passed down to him from his grandfather, a man who had fought against the Empire that had taken over their world.

As a child, Nikodem had heard stories of his grandfather's bravery and cunning. He had been part of an underground resistance movement, fighting against the Empire's oppressive rule. But as Nikodem grew older, he realized that his grandfather's legacy was more than just tales of war - it was about the struggle for freedom.

Nikodem's own story was one of exile. He had fled to a distant planet on the outskirts of the galaxy, where he lived in hiding, always looking over his shoulder. The Empire had sent agents to hunt him down, and Nikodem knew that if they found him, he would be caught and punished for his crimes against the state.

But tonight was different. Tonight, Nikodem felt a sense of peace wash over him as he held the watch in his hand. It was said that this watch could reveal its owner's true nature to anyone who wore it, but Nikodem knew better than to trust such things. He had worn the watch before, and it had revealed nothing more than his own doubts and fears.

As he sat there, lost in thought, Nikodem heard a faint noise outside the room. It was a soft tapping on the door, followed by a whisper: "Nikodem, I'm here." He knew that voice - only one person dared to call him out from the shadows.

He slowly stood up and made his way to the door, his hand resting on the handle as he waited for his visitor. The door slid open, revealing a young woman with piercing green eyes. She was one of the few people who had managed to evade the Empire's agents, and Nikodem knew that she was here to offer him a chance to join their cause.

"Nikodem, we've been watching you," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "We know what your grandfather did for this world. We want you to carry on his legacy."

Nikodom's heart swelled with pride and determination. He knew that the road ahead would be fraught with danger, but he was ready to face it head-on. For the first time in years, he felt a sense of belonging, of purpose.

Without hesitation, Nikodem nodded, his eyes locked on the young woman's. "I'm with you," he said, his voice firm and resolute.
