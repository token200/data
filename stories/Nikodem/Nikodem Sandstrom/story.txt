Nikodem Sandstrom stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the cityscape as the sun dipped below the horizon. The wind whipped through his dark hair, carrying with it the whispers of the past. As a private investigator, Nikodem had seen his fair share of secrets and scandals, but tonight was different.

Tonight, he was searching for answers about his own family's mysterious disappearance. It had been twenty years since Nikodem Sandstrom's parents vanished without a word, leaving behind only a cryptic message that read: "The truth is in the shadows."

Nikodem's eyes scanned the rooftops below, searching for any sign of movement or surveillance. He was not alone tonight; he had his trusty sidekick, a street-smart pigeon named Luna, perched on his shoulder.

As he searched, Nikodem's mind wandered back to those fateful nights when his parents disappeared. They had been involved in some sort of clandestine operation, one that Nikodem couldn't quite remember the details of. But he knew it was connected to their line of work as journalists.

A sudden gust of wind buffeted Nikodem, sending him stumbling backwards. Luna squawked in alarm, flapping her wings wildly as she clung to his shoulder. Nikodem laughed and steadied himself against the railing, gazing out over the city once more.

And then he saw it: a small piece of paper caught in a ventilation grate on the roof below. With shaking hands, Nikodom carefully extracted the note, smoothing out the creases with trembling fingers.

The handwriting was his parents' â€“ unmistakable, yet strange and unfamiliar after so many years. It read: "Meet us at the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone."

Nikodem's heart skipped a beat as he tucked the note into his pocket. Tonight, he would finally uncover the truth about his family's disappearance. And maybe, just maybe, find out what had become of them all these years ago.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Nikodem Sandstrom turned and walked away from the rooftop, Luna still perched on his shoulder, into the darkness that awaited him.
