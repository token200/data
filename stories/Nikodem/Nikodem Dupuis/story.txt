Nikodem Dupuis stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the sleepy town of Willow Creek. It was a place where time seemed to stand still, where the only sound was the rustling of leaves and the gentle hum of the local diner. He had come back to this small town in search of answers.

As he walked down Main Street, Nikodem felt a sense of nostalgia wash over him. This was where his father, a French-Canadian woodworker, had settled when he came to America seeking a better life. It was where Nikodem had grown up, playing stickball with the other kids and helping his father in the shop.

But that life was lost to tragedy. His father had died in a logging accident when Nikodem was just a teenager, leaving him alone and adrift. He had drifted from town to town, taking on odd jobs and trying to make sense of it all.

Now, at 35, Nikodem had come back to Willow Creek with a proposition. A local businessman, Henry Wellington, had offered him a job as the new owner of his father's woodworking shop. It was an opportunity to reconnect with his roots and rebuild a life that he thought he'd left behind forever.

As Nikodem pushed open the door to the old shop, a wave of memories flooded back. He remembered helping his father sand down wooden spoons and listening to stories about the town's history. The air inside was thick with scent of sawdust and wood stain.

The new owner, Wellington, greeted him warmly. "Welcome home, Nikodem," he said, extending a hand. "I'm glad you're back."

Nikodem smiled, feeling a sense of belonging wash over him. He knew that this wasn't going to be easy. Rebuilding the shop and reconnecting with old friends wouldn't happen overnight. But for the first time in years, he felt like he was coming home.

As the sun began to set outside, casting a warm glow over Willow Creek, Nikodem took his place behind the workbench and picked up his father's old axe. The weight of it in his hands felt familiar, comforting. He knew that he had a long road ahead of him, but for now, he was exactly where he needed to be.

"Bonjour," he whispered to himself, as if his father were standing right beside him, guiding his hand through the wood. "I'm home."
