Nikodem Altmann was known for his enigmatic smile and piercing green eyes that seemed to hold secrets of their own. As a master thief in the shadows of Berlin's underbelly, few knew much about him beyond his reputation as "Der Dämon" - The Devil.

As Nikodem Altmann walked through the crowded streets of Kreuzberg, he noticed a familiar face watching him from across the room - a young art historian named Sophie. She had been researching the very painting he had stolen, and Nikodem could sense that she was close to uncovering his true identity.
