Nikodem Gonzalez stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the crowded station. As he made his way through the throngs of people, he felt a sense of unease wash over him. He had been summoned to the city by his estranged father, a man Nikodem had not seen in years.

As a child, Nikodem had known only fragments of his father's life - stories of business deals and lavish parties that Nikodem's mother would share when he was old enough to listen. But now, at 25, he felt an insatiable curiosity about the man who had walked out on him so abruptly.

Nikodem's thoughts were interrupted by a voice behind him. "Ah, Nikodem Gonzalez! I see you made it."

He turned to face a tall, imposing figure with piercing blue eyes and chiseled features that seemed almost otherworldly in his age. This was the man he had been summoned to see.

"Father," Nikodem said, trying to keep his tone neutral. His father, Eduardo Gonzalez, smiled wryly and extended a hand for Nikodem to shake. It felt strange to do so, as if shaking hands with someone who might as well be a stranger.

The next few hours were spent in an awkward dance of small talk and carefully veiled questions. But as the evening wore on and they sat down to dinner, Nikodem began to sense that his father was holding something back. The words he chose were laced with ambiguity, and the subject seemed to shift and evade him.

As the meal drew to a close, Eduardo leaned forward, his eyes locked intently on Nikodem's. "I want you to know, son," he said quietly, "you're not like me. You're different."

Nikodem felt a shiver run down his spine as he met his father's gaze. What did it mean? Was this a compliment or an insult?

In the silence that followed, Nikodem made up his mind to ask questions, no matter how difficult they might be to face. He wanted answers, and he was determined to get them - even if it meant facing his own demons along the way.
