Nikodem Ozols was a man shrouded in mystery. A former Latvian spy, he had spent years navigating the complex web of Eastern European politics and espionage. After a falling out with his handlers, Ozols vanished from public view, leaving behind only whispers of his existence.

Years later, while sipping absinthe at a dingy Parisian café, Ozols was approached by an old acquaintance, a woman named Sofia. Her eyes gleamed with an unmistakable hunger as she slid onto the stool beside him.

"Nikodem," she purred, her voice husky from disuse. "I've been looking for you."

Ozols raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. Sofia had been a fellow agent during his time in the KGB; their partnership had been marked by both camaraderie and bloodshed.

"What do you want?" Ozols asked, taking a sip of his absinthe as he waited for her response.

Sofia hesitated, glancing around the café before leaning in closer. "I represent a client who's willing to pay top dollar for your services," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "A project that requires... delicate handling."

Ozols's eyes narrowed. He knew Sofia too well; this sounded like trouble.

"What kind of project?" he asked gruffly.

Sofia smiled, a hint of mischief dancing in her eyes. "Let's just say it involves a high-stakes game of cat and mouse between rival factions vying for control. Your... unique set of skills would be invaluable to our client."

Ozols snorted, shaking his head. He'd played those games before; the thrill had long worn off.

"I'm not interested," he said flatly, tossing a few euros onto the table to pay Sofia's tab.

Sofia's face fell, but only for an instant. Her eyes flashed with determination as she stood up to leave.

"Nikodem, you don't know what you're saying." She reached into her purse and produced a small photograph. "This could be your ticket back in."

Ozols's heart skipped a beat as he took the photo, his mind racing with possibilities. The woman on the image was a young girl, no more than ten years old. Her eyes were sunken, her skin pale – she looked like she'd been starved to within an inch of her life.

A shiver ran down Ozols's spine as Sofia vanished into the crowded streets of Montmartre, leaving him with more questions than answers. What was this project, really? And what had he just gotten himself into?
