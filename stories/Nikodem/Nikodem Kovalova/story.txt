Her art was a reflection of this deep connection to her heritage.

Madame Dupont approached Nikodem during one of these conversations, a warm smile on her face. "Nikodem Kovalova," she said, "your talent is undeniable. I believe you are the next big thing in French art." The words filled Nikodem with a sense of validation and gratitude.
