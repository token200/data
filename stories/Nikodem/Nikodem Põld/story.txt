I couldn't find any information on the character Nikodem Põld. Could you provide more context or details about this character? If not, I can create a fictional story based on your request.

If you'd like, I can generate a story about a person named Nikodem Põld and write it in Estonian (as 'Põld' is an Estonian surname). Please let me know!

(Also, please note that if the character exists in some form of media or literature, my generated story might not be entirely accurate. If you have any additional information about the character, feel free to share!)
