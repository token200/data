Nikodem Borromeo sat at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of papers in front of him. As the new head of marketing for a small publishing house, he was tasked with promoting their latest bestseller to the masses. The problem was, Nikodem didn't actually like reading.

Growing up, Nikodem had always been more interested in the business side of things. His father, the owner of the publishing house, had taught him everything he knew about the industry, from accounting to distribution. But when it came time for Nikodem to take over, his father handed him a bestseller and said, "Get people excited about this."

The book was written by one of their most promising authors, but to Nikodem, it might as well have been written in ancient Sumerian. He struggled to find the words to describe its literary merits, and instead relied on tired buzzwords like "emotional resonance" and "thought-provoking themes."

As he sat at his desk, a knock came from outside. It was his assistant, Emma, who had brought him a cup of coffee and a plate of freshly baked cookies.

"Nikodem, I need to talk to you about the marketing strategy," she said, fidgeting with her hands. "I think we need to focus more on social media."

Nikodem raised an eyebrow. "But Emma, our target audience is middle-aged suburbanites who love romance novels. They don't exactly flock to Instagram."

Emma sighed and took a seat in the chair opposite Nikodem's desk. "That's exactly why they're not flocking to Instagram, because that's where all the romance readers are actually hanging out. We need to speak their language if we want to reach them."

Nikodem leaned back in his chair and rubbed his temples. He wasn't sure if he wanted to be a marketing expert or a book lover, but he knew he needed to figure it out fast.

Just then, the phone rang. It was Emma's mom, calling to ask how Nikodem was doing. As they chatted, an idea began to form in Nikodem's mind. He picked up his pen and jotted down some notes on a piece of paper.

"Emma," he said, looking up at her with a grin. "I think I might have figured out our marketing strategy."

Over the next few weeks, Nikodem worked tirelessly to create a social media campaign that would appeal to romance readers. He spent hours scrolling through Instagram, watching cat videos and reading witty tweets about love and relationships.

And then, something magical happened. People started talking about Nikodem's publishing house. They shared their favorite quotes from the book on Instagram, using hashtags like #romancevibes and #booklove. And before long, the small publishing house was flooded with requests for more books to read.

Nikodem looked at Emma, who was beaming with pride. "I did it," he said, feeling a sense of accomplishment wash over him. Maybe being a marketing expert wasn't so bad after all.
