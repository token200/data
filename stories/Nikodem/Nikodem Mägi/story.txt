Nikodem MÃ¤gi trudged through the snow-covered streets, his worn boots crunching against the frost. As a private investigator in Tallinn, Estonia, he had seen it all - from corporate espionage to ghostly apparitions. But nothing could have prepared him for the case that lay before him.

Lena, a young and enigmatic woman, had approached Nikodem with a plea for help. Her sister, Aria, had gone missing, leaving behind only a cryptic message: "The answer lies in the moonlit square." Nikodem had been skeptical at first, but Lena's desperation was infectious. He agreed to take on the case.

As he delved into the world of Estonian folklore, Nikodem discovered that Aria's disappearance was linked to an ancient myth. According to legend, the goddess Selene watched over the moonlit square, where the veil between worlds was at its thinnest. It was said that those who walked under her gaze would be granted unimaginable power.

Nikodom followed a trail of cryptic clues, leading him from the winding streets of Old Town to the frozen shores of the Baltic Sea. He interviewed Aria's friends and acquaintances, but none seemed to know anything about her disappearance. That was until he met Ilmar, a local artist who claimed to have seen Aria in a mystical ritual.

Ilmar revealed that Aria had been part of a secret cult, dedicated to harnessing the power of Selene. They believed that by performing ancient rituals under the light of the full moon, they could tap into the goddess's energy and unlock hidden abilities. Nikodem suspected that something sinister was at play, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it.

As the night wore on, Nikodom found himself standing in the moonlit square, the stars above him twinkling like diamonds. He felt a shiver run down his spine as he realized that he was being watched. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows - Aria herself.

She looked different, her eyes gleaming with an otherworldly intensity. "You should not have come here," she hissed, before vanishing into thin air.

Nikodem was left standing alone in the square, his mind reeling with questions. What had really happened to Aria? And what lay behind the mysterious cult? As he turned to leave, he felt a gentle touch on his shoulder - Ilmar's hand, with a single phrase etched into the palm: "The moonlit square is just the beginning."
