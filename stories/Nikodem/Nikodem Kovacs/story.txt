Nikodem Kovacs stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the familiar streets of Budapest. The city was alive with the sounds of vendors calling out to passersby and the wail of sirens in the distance. Nikodem took a deep breath, feeling the cool night air fill his lungs, and began his walk through the city.

As he walked, Nikodem couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. He had been tracking a lead on a potential new case for weeks, but every clue seemed to point to a dead end. His mind was consumed by thoughts of his latest victim, a young woman who had fallen victim to the same modus operandi as several others before her.

Nikodem's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a familiar voice calling out his name. "Kovacs!" it shouted. He turned to see his trusted colleague and friend, Detective Ilona Horv√°th, hurrying towards him.

"Nikodem, I have something for you," she said, handing him a small folder filled with photos and notes. Nikodom's eyes scanned the contents, his mind racing as he pieced together the fragments of evidence.

"This is it," he muttered to himself. "This is the break we've been waiting for."

Ilona nodded in agreement. "I thought you'd see it my way, Nikodem Kovacs. We can finally get to the bottom of this case and bring some justice to the victims' families."

As they walked through the city, discussing their plan of action, Nikodem couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation. He had always prided himself on being one step ahead of the bad guys, and this new lead promised to be no exception.

The two detectives made their way back to the station, their minds racing with possibilities and theories. Nikodem Kovacs knew that he had a long night ahead of him, but he was ready for whatever lay in store.
