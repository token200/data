Nikodem Pires was a name whispered in hushed tones among the city's underworld. A master thief, with fingers as quick as the wind and eyes that seemed to see right through you. His reputation preceded him - or rather, his lack thereof. You didn't want Nikodem on your tail; it was better to know beforehand.

He moved like a ghost, leaving no trail behind but a faint scent of smoke and leather. Some said he had once been a soldier, trained to disappear into the shadows and reappear at will. Others claimed he was born with this gift, that his very soul was attuned to the art of deception.

One fateful evening, as the moon cast its silver glow over the city's rooftops, Nikodem received a message - a small piece of paper slipped under his door like a secret handshake between old friends. It was an invitation, written in elegant script: meet me at the opera house tonight. Come alone.

The opera house was not exactly the most clandestine location; it was more of a symbol of respectability, a facade against which the city's seedy underbelly recoiled in horror. But Nikodem had been there before, and he knew that those who summoned him did so for a reason.

He arrived dressed for the occasion - a fine silk shirt, gloves, and shoes polished to perfection. He blended into the crowd of dandies and debutantes, watching as they twirled and laughed in their gilded finery. The host waited for him at the far end of the opera house, a tall figure with eyes that shone like stars.

"Welcome, Nikodem," the host said, his voice dripping with amusement. "I have something I think you'll find...enlightening."

With a flick of his wrist, he revealed an exquisite music box - intricate carvings adorned its lid, and when wound, it played a melody that seemed to capture the very essence of moonlight.

Nikodem's fingers danced across its surface as if mesmerized. He knew this piece; it was from his childhood, a lullaby sung by his mother before she disappeared into the night, leaving him with nothing but rumors and unanswered questions.

For an instant, the mask slipped, and Nikodem let go of the carefully crafted persona. Tears streamed down his face as he recalled the whispered words of his childhood: "When you need me most, call my name."

The host smiled knowingly, understanding that sometimes it takes a moment for a ghost to be seen - by itself, or by someone else who had known its darkness.
