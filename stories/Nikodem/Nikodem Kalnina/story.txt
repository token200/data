The woman hesitated before answering. "I'm a journalist," she said. "I've been researching street artists in this city, and your work is some of the most compelling I've seen. Can I ask you a few questions?"

Nikodom shrugged, clearly uninterested but willing to play along. The interview was short but lively, with Nikodem sharing stories about his inspirations and creative process. As they talked, it became clear that there was more to this enigmatic artist than met the eye.
