Nikodem Balode stood at the edge of the forest, his eyes scanning the dense foliage as if searching for something hidden from prying eyes. The moon cast an eerie glow over the trees, casting long shadows that stretched like skeletal fingers towards him.

As a detective with a troubled past, Nikodem had grown accustomed to the darkness within himself. But this case was different. This case was personal.

He thought back to the words of his estranged sister, Maria, who lay dead in her apartment just days ago. The police were stumped, and the only lead they had was a cryptic message scrawled on her kitchen wall: "They're watching."

Nikodem's mind flashed back to the night she died, the sound of shattering glass still echoing in his ears. He knew he had to keep digging, no matter how deep or dark it went.

With a quiet determination, Nikodom pushed aside the branches and stepped into the forest. The trees seemed to close in around him, their whispers weaving together like a sinister melody. As he walked, the rustling leaves beneath his feet served as a reminder that even the most isolated places were never truly alone.

He followed the faint scent of smoke wafting from deeper within the woods. A fire? No, something more calculated than that. He'd been following this thread for weeks now, tracing the whispers and shadows back to their source.

Suddenly, he stumbled upon a hidden clearing, lit by candles placed around the perimeter. In the center stood an old woman, her eyes aglow with an otherworldly intensity. Nikodem recognized the symbol etched into the wall behind her: his sister's signature, but not in her handwriting.

"You're watching me," the old woman whispered, her voice barely audible over the crackling flames.

Nikodom knew then that he was on the right track. He reached for his gun, ready to face whatever horrors this night had in store for him.

The old woman vanished into thin air as suddenly as she appeared, leaving behind only the faint scent of rose petals and a small note with a single word: "Start".

As Nikodem stumbled out of the clearing, he knew that he'd only just begun unraveling the tangled threads of his sister's final days. The darkness closed in around him once more, but this time, it was different â€“ he felt ready to face it head-on.
