Nikodem Bach, a 32-year-old German baritone, stood backstage at La Scala, his heart racing with anticipation. He had spent years preparing for this moment, pouring over every note of Mozart's Don Giovanni, rehearsing until his voice was raw but ready.

As he took his place beside the esteemed conductor, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Bach couldn't help but think back to his humble beginnings in rural Bavaria. Born into a family of modest means, music had always been his escape – his father, a talented amateur singer, had introduced him to opera at the age of six.

Bach's journey to La Scala was not an easy one. He had faced rejection after rejection from top-tier conservatories, and struggled to make ends meet while working as a part-time teacher and salesman. But he refused to give up on his dream. With each performance, he grew stronger, his voice deepening into the rich, velvety tones that had earned him a reputation among opera enthusiasts.

As the curtain rose, Bach closed his eyes and let the music wash over him. He was Giovanni, the charismatic but doomed nobleman, and with every phrase, he felt himself becoming one with the character. The audience was entranced, their eyes fixed on the young baritone as he soared through the night air, his voice like honey dripping from a golden vase.

Bach's performance was met with thunderous applause, the crowd erupting into cheers and whistles as he took his final bow. As he left the stage, tears of joy streaming down his face, Harnoncourt approached him with a warm smile.

"Well done, Nikodem," the conductor said, shaking Bach's hand firmly. "You have truly outdone yourself."

Bach's heart swelled with pride, knowing that this moment was just the beginning. He had worked too hard to let it slip away now. As he made his way through the crowded hallways, basking in the glow of triumph, Bach felt a sense of belonging – as if finally, he had found his place in the world of opera.

Backstage, Bach's thoughts turned to his family back home. His parents, who had supported him every step of the way, would be thrilled with this achievement. He smiled to himself, imagining their faces beaming with pride as they listened to recordings of his performances online.

For now, though, Bach simply reveled in the rush of adrenaline and satisfaction that came with knowing he had given it his all. As he made his way back to his dressing room, he felt a sense of peace wash over him – he knew that this was where he belonged, on stage, lost in the music that had set his soul free.
