Nikodem Clarke, a former member of the Rebel Alliance's intelligence division, sat in the dimly lit cantina on Coruscant. His eyes scanned the room, taking in the assortment of shady characters and underworld figures that seemed to populate every corner of the galaxy. The hum of conversation and the occasional blaster discharge filled the air, but Nikodem remained detached, lost in his thoughts.

It had been years since he'd last walked among the rebels, dodging Imperial patrols and gathering intelligence on the Empire's plans. But after a mission gone wrong, Nikodem had been forced to go into hiding. He'd assumed various identities, using his skills to survive, but never staying in one place for too long.

Tonight was no different. Nikodem sipped on a drink, his eyes locked onto a hooded figure sitting across from him. The air around the stranger seemed to vibrate with an aura of danger, and Nikodem's instincts told him this person was trouble.

"Who are you?" Nikodem asked, his voice low and even.

The figure pushed back its hood, revealing a striking face that seemed almost... familiar. "I'm someone who knows what you're looking for," the woman said, her eyes glinting in the dim light.

Nikodem raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. "What makes you think I need your help?"

"I have information about the Empire's latest project," she replied, her voice barely above a whisper. "Something big, Nikodem. Something that could change the course of the war."

Nikodom's curiosity piqued, he leaned forward, his eyes locked onto hers. He had always been driven by a desire to bring down the Empire, but this... this was different.

"What do you want in return?" he asked, a hint of desperation creeping into his voice.

The woman smiled, a cold, calculating smile. "I think we can come to an agreement, Nikodem. One that benefits us both."

For the first time in years, Nikodem felt a spark of hope. Maybe, just maybe, this was the break he'd been waiting for. He nodded, extending his hand. "Let's talk."
