Luna Kovalova sat alone in her dimly lit apartment, surrounded by the echoes of memories past. The flickering candles cast eerie shadows on the walls as she rummaged through old trunks and boxes, searching for a lost piece of herself.

As a child, Luna had always been fascinated by the mysteries of the universe, often sneaking out to gaze at the stars in the middle of the night. Her parents, though traditional and conservative, encouraged her curiosity, gifting her with an antique telescope that had become her constant companion.

Years went by, and Luna's passion for astronomy only grew stronger. She devoured books on celestial mechanics and spent countless hours studying the movements of planets and stars. Her dream was to one day travel to space, to explore the mysteries of the cosmos firsthand.

But life had other plans. Luna's parents, though well-intentioned, forced her to pursue a more traditional career path – medicine. They wanted her to settle down, get married, and have children. The pressure was suffocating, and Luna felt like she was losing herself in the process.

One fateful night, Luna decided to take a stand. She packed her bags, left behind the expectations of others, and set out on a journey to follow her heart. With nothing but a small backpack and a worn-out copy of Einstein's theory of relativity, she boarded a train headed for the city of New Orleans.

As the train chugged along, Luna felt a sense of liberation wash over her. She was finally doing what she wanted, following her dreams like never before. The city lights twinkled in the distance as she walked along the Mississippi River, feeling the wind in her hair and the stars above her.

In that moment, Luna Kovalova knew exactly where she belonged – among the celestial bodies, reaching for the unknown. She took a deep breath, letting the city's rhythm guide her footsteps, ready to face whatever lay ahead with an open heart and an unwavering spirit.
