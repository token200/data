Luna Fischer stepped out of her small, cluttered apartment and into the crisp morning air. The city was still waking up, the sounds of the metropolis gradually rising from the fog of night. She took a deep breath, feeling the familiar scent of old books and worn wood wafting from the nearby bookstore.

As a freelance writer and book reviewer, Luna spent most of her days holed up in her apartment, surrounded by stacks of novels and half-read essays. But she had a secret: Luna was also a book thief. In the dead of night, when the city was quiet, she would slip out into the shadows and steal rare volumes from the bookstore's hidden stockroom.

No one knew about Luna's nocturnal exploits – not even her closest friends. She had always been drawn to the written word, but there was something about owning a piece of literature that made it seem like less than enough. By stealing books, she felt like she was taking possession of a part of someone else's soul.

Tonight was no exception. Luna slipped through the narrow alleyway behind the bookstore and into the dimly lit stockroom. She moved with practiced stealth, her eyes scanning the shelves for the perfect prize. Her fingers trailed over spines as she searched – Austen to Zola, Dickens to Dostoevsky. Finally, her hand landed on a tattered copy of _The Decameron_ by Boccaccio.

She pulled the book from its hiding place and tucked it into her worn leather satchel. The moon was rising outside, casting a silver glow over the city. Luna smiled, feeling like she had outsmarted the world once again.

As she made her way back through the alleyway, the sounds of the city grew louder – street performers and early morning revelers began to stir. Luna felt invigorated, like she was ready to take on anything. She ducked into a small café nearby and ordered a strong coffee. The barista raised an eyebrow as she handed over her satchel.

"Your usual," he said with a knowing smile.

Luna chuckled, unwrapping the book within. "I think I'll make it two," she replied, slipping the _Decameron_ onto the counter beside the old notebook from last week's café visit.
