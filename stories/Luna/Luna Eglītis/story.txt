Luna Eglītis stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the sleepy town of Ravenshire. She had been away for so long, chasing dreams and making a name for herself in the city, that it was hard to believe she was back where it all began.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Luna couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her. This was where her parents had first met, where she had grown up playing in the woods and exploring the nearby river. It was a place that held so many memories, both happy and sad.

Luna's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her phone buzzing in her pocket. She pulled it out to find a text from her best friend, Ava: "Hey girl! What brings you back to Ravenshire? We've got a lot to catch up on!"

Luna smiled as she typed out a response. It had been too long since she'd seen Ava, and she couldn't wait to fill her in on all the gossip and adventures from her time in the city.

As she walked, Luna noticed that things looked different than she remembered. The old ice cream parlor was gone, replaced by a trendy new cafe. The park where she used to play as a kid was now dotted with fancy new houses and gardens.

Despite the changes, one thing remained the same: the people. Luna spotted familiar faces on the street, including her childhood friend, Jasper, who was now running his own successful bakery.

Luna Eglītis stopped in front of the old family house, feeling a mix of emotions. She hadn't been back here in years, and she wasn't sure what to expect. But as she stood there, looking up at the familiar roofline, she felt a sense of belonging wash over her. This was where she came home.

With a deep breath, Luna stepped forward and knocked on the door. It swung open, and her mother's face appeared, a warm smile spreading across it. "Luna! Welcome back, sweetie. We've missed you so much."
