Despite her success, Luna remained true to her roots, always keeping her family's legacy in mind. She would often incorporate elements of Spanish culture and symbolism into her work, paying homage to the heritage that had shaped her life. Her paintings became a reflection of her own story, with each brushstroke telling a piece of the Almodóvar family history.
