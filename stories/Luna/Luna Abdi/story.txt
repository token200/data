Luna Abdi walked into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the crowded room. She spotted him – Khalil, her long-lost friend from childhood. Their families had been separated during a war that ravaged their small country years ago, but fate had brought them back together again.

As she made her way through the throng of people, Luna's thoughts wandered back to the memories they shared before the conflict. They used to explore the ruins of ancient mosques, and laugh together in the streets. The pain and loss had scarred their young lives, but their friendship had remained unbroken.

Khalil spotted Luna first, his face lighting up with a warm smile. He pushed through the crowd and wrapped her in a tight hug. "Luna! Oh, my friend!" he exclaimed.

The two sat down at a small table by the window, ordering steaming cups of coffee and fresh bread to share. They talked about their lives since the war – the struggles they faced as refugees, the hopes they held for a brighter future.

As they spoke, Luna couldn't help but notice the weariness etched on Khalil's face. The lines around his eyes told stories of late nights spent working, long hours at odd jobs to make ends meet. She listened attentively, her heart aching with compassion.

Over the next few hours, their conversation flowed effortlessly, like no time had passed at all. They reminisced about old times, shared new experiences, and forged plans for the future. Luna confided in Khalil about her dreams of becoming a writer – of using her words to tell the stories that needed to be told.

Khalil listened intently, his eyes shining with encouragement. "You can do it, Luna," he said. "I'll support you every step of the way."

As they parted ways, Luna felt a weight lift off her shoulders. She knew she wasn't alone – not anymore. Khalil was back in her life, and together, they would face whatever challenges lay ahead.

With renewed hope, Luna walked out of the café, into a brighter future. The war may have left its scars, but it could never erase the power of friendship.
