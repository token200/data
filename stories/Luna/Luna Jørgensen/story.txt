Luna Jørgensen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any signs of life. It had been years since she'd set foot in this tiny town in Norway, but the memories still lingered like a faint scent on her skin.

As a child, Luna Jørgensen would spend hours exploring the mist-shrouded fjords and forests surrounding the town, collecting wildflowers and listening to the ancient stories of her grandmother. But life had taken its toll, and she'd left long ago to chase dreams in the city.

Now, with her grandmother's passing, Luna Jørgensen felt an overwhelming sense of loss and regret. She'd never returned to visit, and now it was too late. The stationmaster, a gruff but kind man named Gunnar, approached her with a worn smile.

"Welcome back, Luna," he said, his voice like a warm hug. "We've missed you."

Luna Jørgensen smiled wistfully, feeling the weight of years lifting off her shoulders. She'd come to say goodbye, to pay her respects and try to make sense of it all.

As she walked through the town, Luna Jørgensen felt like a stranger in her own childhood home. Everything looked different now, yet somehow the same. The old wooden houses still stood, their windows cloudy with age; the river still babbled its gentle song; and the mountains loomed above, majestically unchanging.

She visited the grave where her grandmother lay, surrounded by a tangle of wildflowers that bloomed in every color of the rainbow. Luna Jørgensen closed her eyes, feeling the wind rustle her hair, and whispered a silent goodbye to the woman who'd raised her.

In this quiet moment, Luna Jørgensen felt a sense of peace settle over her, like the morning mist that shrouded the fjords. It was a small comfort, but it was enough to give her the strength to face whatever lay ahead.
