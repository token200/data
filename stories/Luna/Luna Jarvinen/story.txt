Luna Jarvinen sat alone on the edge of her bed, staring out the window at the starry night sky. As a talented astronomer and stargazer, she felt most at home among the celestial bodies that twinkled above. Her bright blue eyes sparkled with wonder as she pondered the mysteries of the universe.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was her best friend, Aria, who had stopped by to bring over some freshly baked cookies and a warm smile. Luna's cheeks flushed as Aria handed her a plate of still-warm treats, which Luna devoured in grateful silence.

"Hey, Lu, what's going on?" Aria asked, noticing the distant look in Luna's eyes. "You've been cooped up in here for hours. Come out and play!"

Luna chuckled, her shoulders relaxing as she stood up to join Aria outside. They spent the next few hours stargazing together, Luna identifying constellations and sharing tales of her own astronomical discoveries.

As they walked back to Luna's apartment, the night air filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers, Luna turned to Aria with a mischievous grin. "Hey, Ari? I've got a secret," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Aria raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "Spill, Lu."

Luna leaned in close, her voice taking on a conspiratorial tone. "I just discovered the most incredible new galaxy! It's hidden deep in the Andromeda cluster – have you ever heard of it?"

Aria shook her head, eyes wide with excitement. "No way, that's amazing!"

Luna beamed with pride, feeling happy to share her passion with her friend. As they settled back into their apartment, Luna realized she was grateful for the quiet nights spent stargazing alone – and for having Aria by her side to share it all with.

Over a cup of steaming hot tea, Luna poured out her thoughts on the galaxy to Aria, filling in every detail and sharing her theories. As the night wore on, their conversation turned from science to dreams and aspirations, Luna Jarvinen lost in thought as she gazed at the stars shining outside, feeling truly seen and heard by her friend.
