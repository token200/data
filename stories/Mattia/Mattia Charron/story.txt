Born in Paris to a family of Italian descent, she had always been drawn to the world of investigative journalism. With a passion for uncovering hidden secrets, Mattia spent countless hours researching and interviewing sources, often taking risks that put her at odds with powerful interests.

As she sat across from the official, Mattia Charron noticed a mixture of fear and determination in his eyes. He revealed to her that he had been working undercover to take down a powerful crime syndicate, but was now being threatened by those who wanted him silenced.
