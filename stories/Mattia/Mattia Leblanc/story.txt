Mattia Leblanc stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the bustling streets of Paris. He had been living in this city for months now, trying to escape the ghosts of his past. As a former hacker, he had made enemies that followed him everywhere, and it was only a matter of time before they found him.

Mattia took a deep breath, feeling the cool morning air fill his lungs. He had always loved this city, with its charming streets and quirky cafes. It was the perfect place to start anew, to reinvent himself as someone other than "Zero Cool," the notorious hacker who had once been his claim to fame.

As he walked through the crowded streets, Mattia felt a sense of freedom he hadn't experienced in years. He had left behind the thrill of the hack, the rush of adrenaline that came with pulling off a daring heist. Now, he was just trying to make a living as a freelance writer, using his skills to help small businesses and entrepreneurs.

Mattia stopped at a nearby cafe, ordering a cup of coffee and sitting down at a small table by the window. He pulled out his laptop and began to work on an article, typing away with a focus he hadn't felt in years.

Just as he was getting into the zone, Mattia's phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number. "We know you're hiding here," it read. "You can't escape us forever."

Mattia's heart sank. He knew that tone, that arrogance, and it filled him with dread. Who could be following him now? And why?

He quickly shut down his laptop and stood up, glancing around the cafe to see if anyone was watching him. But everyone seemed to be too engrossed in their own conversations to notice him.

With a sense of unease, Mattia stepped out of the cafe and into the bright sunlight. He knew he couldn't stay hidden forever, but for now, he would keep moving, trying to find a way to shake off his pursuers once and for all.

As he walked away from the cafe, Mattia felt a spark of determination ignite within him. He was no longer just "Zero Cool," but someone new, someone stronger, ready to face whatever came next.
