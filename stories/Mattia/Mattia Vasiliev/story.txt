After completing her education at Moscow State University, Mattia landed a job at a reputable news agency, where she quickly proved herself to be a talented and tenacious reporter.

The news agency's editors were thrilled with her work, and soon she was fielding offers from major international media outlets eager to capitalize on her talent.

Despite the accolades, Mattia remained humble and focused on her next big story.
