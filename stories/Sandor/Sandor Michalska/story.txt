After leaving the agency, Sandor decided to use his skills for good, becoming a private investigator specializing in cases involving espionage and counter-intelligence. His reputation as one of the best in the business was well-deserved, earning him the trust and respect of clients from all over the world.

One day, a wealthy entrepreneur approached Sandor with a peculiar request. A valuable piece of technology had been stolen from his company, and he suspected a mole within his own ranks. He needed someone with Sandor's expertise to track down the thief and retrieve the device.

Sandor accepted the challenge, using his vast network of contacts and resources to launch an investigation. He spent weeks gathering clues, interviewing suspects, and following leads, all while keeping a low profile and avoiding detection himself.
