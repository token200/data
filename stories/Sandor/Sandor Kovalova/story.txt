Sandor Kovalova stepped out of the crowded market square and onto the winding streets of Prague. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows behind the Gothic spires of St. Vitus Cathedral, a stark contrast to the vibrant colors of the vendors' wares on display. As a skilled illuminator, Sandor Kovalova was accustomed to the intricate dance between light and shadow.

Her eyes scanned the cobblestone pavement, searching for the familiar sign of her destination: the Black Bull Inn. The owner, Herr M端ller, had promised her a warm meal and a chance to discuss a lucrative commission she'd been offered by the wealthy collector, Count Harrington. Sandor Kovalova's curiosity was piqued at the prospect of working on such an esteemed piece.

As she pushed open the door to the inn, a bell above it let out a cheerful clang, announcing her arrival to the patrons within. The atmosphere inside was cozy and lively, with the aroma of roasting meats wafting from the kitchen. Sandor Kovalova spotted Herr M端ller, a jovial man with a thick beard, pouring mugs of frothy beer for a group of rowdy travelers.

After exchanging pleasantries, Herr M端ller led her to a quiet corner table by the fire, where they could converse without interruption. Over steaming bowls of soup and freshly baked bread, Sandor Kovalova outlined her plans for the commissioned piece: an intricate illumination of St. Vitus Cathedral, showcasing its Gothic grandeur in exquisite detail. Herr M端ller's eyes lit up at the prospect of such a masterpiece, assuring her that Count Harrington would be thrilled with the result.

With the discussion concluded and the terms agreed upon, Sandor Kovalova left the inn feeling optimistic about her upcoming project. As she strolled through the streets once more, the city seemed bathed in an even warmer light than before, as if the promise of a successful commission had ignited a spark within its ancient stones. With a sense of renewed purpose, Sandor Kovalova continued on her way, ready to tackle the creative challenges ahead with the skill and precision that had earned her a reputation among Prague's artistic community.
