It was a small notebook belonging to Emily's sister, containing cryptic messages and phone numbers. Sandor's eyes widened as he realized that the sister had been involved in something much bigger than they initially thought.

With renewed determination, Sandor Mancini set out to unravel the tangled web of secrets and lies.
