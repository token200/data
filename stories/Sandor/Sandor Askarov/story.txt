Sandor Askarov had always been drawn to the world of high-stakes magic. As a young man, he spent countless hours poring over ancient tomes and practicing spells in secret. His parents, both accomplished wizards in their own right, encouraged his passion, recognizing the raw talent that lay within him.

As Sandor's skills improved, so did his reputation. He began to attract attention from the most powerful figures in the magical community, who sought him out for his unique abilities. One such individual was the enigmatic Lady Arachne, a renowned sorceress with a reputation for ruthlessness.

Lady Arachne summoned Sandor to her chambers, where he found himself surrounded by an aura of dark magic. She presented him with a proposition: join her ranks and help her achieve her goals in exchange for power and recognition. Sandor hesitated, aware that allying himself with Lady Arachne would come at a steep price.

However, the allure of her promises proved too great. He agreed to her terms, and over the next few weeks, he underwent an intense indoctrination program designed to break his spirit and mold him into a loyal servant. Sandor Askarov was no more; in his place stood a hardened, obedient instrument of Lady Arachne's will.

As time passed, Sandor found himself increasingly entrenched in Lady Arachne's inner circle. He participated in dark rituals and carried out her bidding without question, all while suppressing the memories of his former life. But despite his outward conformity, a spark within him continued to flicker – a reminder of the person he once was.

One fateful night, Sandor received an invitation from Lady Arachne herself, requesting his presence at a secret gathering. He arrived at the appointed hour, ready to carry out her instructions without hesitation. But as he gazed upon her face, something stirred within him, like a long-dormant flame. For a fleeting moment, Sandor Askarov's true self peeked through the veil of obedience – and Lady Arachne sensed it.
