Sandor Dubois stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the quaint village of Ashwood. As he breathed in the crisp morning air, memories came flooding back to him. This was where his grandmother grew up, where his parents had settled down before moving away when Sandor was just a boy.

As he made his way through the quiet streets, Sandor couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. He had returned to Ashwood after years abroad, seeking refuge from the world and a chance to reconnect with his roots. His grandmother's passing had left him feeling lost and disconnected, like a part of him was missing.

As he approached the old family cottage, Sandor noticed that it looked just as he remembered – the same weathered wooden shutters, the overgrown garden. He took a deep breath, letting the familiar scent transport him back in time. This was where his grandmother had taught him how to bake, where he had spent hours listening to her stories of old Ashwood.

Sandor opened the creaky door and stepped inside, calling out for any signs of life. The only response was the soft ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner. He smiled wistfully, remembering his grandmother's laughter as she wound the clock every Sunday morning.

As he began to unpack, Sandor couldn't help but think about how much he missed her. His full name was often referred to with affectionate nicknames – Sando, Dubi, even just Dubs for short. But to him, it would always be Sandor Dubois, the boy who had grown up listening to his grandmother's tales and learning from her wisdom.

As the sun began to set over Ashwood, casting a warm golden light over the village, Sandor felt a sense of peace settle in. He knew that he still had a long way to go in healing his wounds, but with this return to his roots, he felt like he was finally starting to mend. The old cottage, once again, felt like home – and with it, a part of him had come back alive.
