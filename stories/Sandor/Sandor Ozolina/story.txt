He had spent years honing his skills on the streets of Budapest, where he was born to a family of skilled pickpockets and con artists. As a child, Sandor had watched in awe as his parents worked their magic on unsuspecting tourists, making them believe they were getting the best deals possible.

As he made his escape, Sandor felt an overwhelming sense of pride and accomplishment. He had pulled off the impossible – stealing Szent Gyorgy's Crown, and doing it with style. And as he disappeared into the night, he knew that this was just the beginning of his next great adventure.

Sandor Ozolina would go on to become a legendary figure in Budapest's underworld, known for his daring heists and unparalleled skill. But for now, he simply smiled to himself, basking in the glory of his victory. After all, when you're Sandor Ozolina, nothing can ever bring you down.
