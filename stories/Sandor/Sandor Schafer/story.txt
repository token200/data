Sandor Schafer was a man of few words, but his piercing green eyes told stories of their own. A former soldier, he had seen his fair share of battles and loss. Now, he wandered the world as a drifter, taking on odd jobs to survive.

As he walked through the bustling streets of Budapest, Sandor's thoughts turned to his past. He thought of the comrades he had lost, the friends he had made, and the scars that still lingered beneath his rugged exterior. His full name, Sandor Schafer, seemed like a distant memory, one that he couldn't quite recall.

A voice behind him caught his attention. "Excuse me, sir," a young woman said, her eyes shining with curiosity. "I couldn't help but notice your... unique attire."

Sandor turned to face the stranger, his expression guarded. "What's it to you?" he asked gruffly.

The woman smiled, undeterred by his hostility. "My name is Sophia," she said. "And I'm a history student at the local university. I've been studying the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and I couldn't help but notice the similarities between your... uniform?"

Sandor's eyes narrowed, but he seemed to relax ever so slightly. "It's not a uniform," he said. "I used to be in the military."

Sophia's eyes widened with interest. "Really?" she asked. "What was your rank?"

Sandor hesitated, as if unsure of how much to reveal. But something about Sophia's kind eyes put him at ease, and he found himself opening up to her.

"I was a private," he said finally. "I served in the 13th Hussars."

Sophia's face lit up with excitement. "I've studied those units!" she exclaimed. "You must have seen some incredible things during your time in service."

Sandor shrugged, his expression returning to its usual stoic state. But Sophia's gaze seemed to pierce through his defenses, and for a moment, he felt like he was seeing himself through her eyes.

"Thank you," he said finally, turning to leave. "It's been... enlightening."

As he walked away, Sandor couldn't help but wonder if he had just made a connection with this strange young woman. His full name, Sandor Schafer, seemed less like a distant memory now, and more like a reminder of the man he used to be.
