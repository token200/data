Sandor Evans was known for his rugged charm and unwavering dedication to justice. As a seasoned detective with over two decades of experience, he had solved some of the most heinous crimes in the city's history. But despite his impressive track record, Sandor still harbored a secret that only a handful of people knew: he was haunted by nightmares.

These dark visions of murder and despair followed him everywhere, seeping into his waking life like a cold mist. Sandor's colleagues at the police department had grown accustomed to seeing him come in late, his eyes bloodshot from lack of sleep. They whispered among themselves about the "Evans strain" – a supposedly incurable condition that afflicted those who witnessed too much.

One evening, as Sandor poured himself a whiskey, he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. For an instant, he saw not the weary detective but a stranger: gaunt, troubled, and lost. He spun away from the glass, shattering his reverie with a sharp intake of breath. The line between reality and fantasy blurred, making it harder to distinguish friend from foe.

Sandor's partner, Maria Rodriguez, had long suspected that her colleague was more than just a brilliant investigator. Over coffee one morning, she broached the subject: "Evans, can I ask you something?" Her voice held a mixture of concern and curiosity.

"What is it, Maria?" Sandor replied gruffly, his eyes avoiding hers.

"Do you ever... see things?" Maria ventured. The question hung in the air like a challenge.

Sandor hesitated before answering: "Sometimes, I do."

Maria nodded empathetically. "We all do, Evans. We carry our burdens with us, but we don't let them define us." She reached out, placing a reassuring hand on his arm.

As the days passed, Maria became Sandor's anchor – someone to whom he could turn in times of darkness. The nightmares still lurked beneath the surface, but now they had an ally. Together, they pushed forward into the world, bound by their shared determination to seek justice for those who needed it most.
