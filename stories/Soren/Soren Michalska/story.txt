Soren Michalska sat alone in his small, cluttered apartment, staring blankly at the wall as he nursed his whiskey-soaked thoughts. The city outside was alive and buzzing with energy, but for him, time had stopped. It was a cold winter's night, and the snowflakes danced in the windowpane like tiny ballerinas.

As a former soldier, Soren Michalska had seen his fair share of battles and bloodshed. He had fought alongside comrades, shared tears and laughter with them, and watched as they fell to their fate. The memories haunted him, and he struggled to shake off the feeling of emptiness that settled in his chest every time a new day began.

A knock at the door broke the silence, and Soren hesitated for a moment before getting up to answer it. His old friend, Jacek, stood on the other side, a warm smile spreading across his face as he asked if he could come in. Soren nodded curtly, allowing Jacek into the apartment.

Jacek sat down beside him on the couch and passed him a cup of coffee. "Hey, you okay?" he asked softly. Soren took a sip, his eyes drifting towards the window where snowflakes continued to dance. He shook his head, unable to muster up any words.

"You're still stuck in the past, aren't you?" Jacek said gently, knowing that look all too well. Soren nodded again, and for a moment, they sat there in silence, lost in their thoughts.

As the night wore on, the whiskey flowed freely, but it didn't dull the ache within him. It was only when Jacek spoke of his own struggles, of his own battles with demons, that Soren felt even remotely connected to the world outside. And perhaps, just perhaps, he found a glimmer of hope â€“ not for himself, but for someone else.

As Jacek prepared to leave, Soren stood up, his movements stiff and awkward. "Thanks, mate," he muttered, his voice barely audible over the silence.
