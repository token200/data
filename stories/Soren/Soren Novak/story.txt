Soren Novak walked into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. He spotted her sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of black coffee. It had been months since they last met, but Soren's intuition told him that she was still watching over him.

As he approached her table, the woman looked up and smiled faintly. "Soren Novak," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "It's been a long time."

Soren sat down across from her, his eyes locked onto hers. "Avery Welles," he replied, using the only name he knew of her. Avery was an alias, one that Soren had discovered by chance months ago. It was the only name that seemed to match the whispers in the shadows.

The two of them fell into a comfortable silence, sipping their coffee and watching the patrons of the café. Soren couldn't help but feel like he was being pulled back into Avery's world. He had tried to leave it all behind, but she seemed to be calling him back.

As they talked, Soren learned more about Avery's past. She was a member of an ancient organization, one that had been watching over him since birth. The whispers in the shadows were part of their code, a way of communicating with those who needed protection.

Soren felt a shiver run down his spine as he realized the true extent of Avery's involvement. He was no longer just a ordinary person; he was a target, a key player in a much larger game. And Avery Welles was the guardian who had been watching over him all along.

As they finished their coffee, Soren turned to Avery and asked, "What do you want from me?" Avery smiled again, her eyes glinting with a hint of mischief. "I want to teach you how to protect yourself," she said, her voice low and husky. "You're not as safe as you think, Soren Novak."

Soren raised an eyebrow, unsure if he was ready for the lessons that lay ahead. But as he looked into Avery's eyes, he knew he had no choice. He was in this now, whether he liked it or not.
