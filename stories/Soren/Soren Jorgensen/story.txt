As Soren Jorgensen stood in his childhood home, surrounded by memories of a life long gone, he knew that he had made the right decision. He was home now, and that's all that mattered.

With a sense of resolution, Soren Jorgensen turned and walked out into the fading light of day, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.
