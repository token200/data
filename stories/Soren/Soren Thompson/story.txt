Soren Thompson was known for his unorthodox approach to detective work. A former professor of criminology, Soren had grown disillusioned with the academic world and set out on his own to solve cases that had stumped the authorities. His methods were often unconventional, but they always yielded results.

One day, a wealthy businessman approached Soren with a peculiar problem. His family's priceless heirloom, a rare diamond necklace, had been stolen from their mansion overnight. The police were baffled, and the businessman was desperate for a solution. Soren accepted the case, intrigued by the challenge.

As he began his investigation, Soren noticed something peculiar about the crime scene. A small, almost imperceptible scratch on the window frame seemed out of place among the polished glass and gleaming surfaces. He made a mental note to investigate further.

Soren spent the next few days following leads and interviewing suspects, but nothing seemed to pan out. It wasn't until he received a cryptic message from an anonymous source that the case began to unravel. The message read: "Look again at the scratch."

Soren's eyes widened as he realized the significance of the scratch. He recalled a similar detail in one of his old academic papers, where a researcher had mentioned a peculiar flaw in the manufacturing process of certain glass products. Suddenly, it clicked into place - the thief was not just any ordinary thief; they were an expert in forgery.

Armed with this new information, Soren pieced together the events surrounding the theft. He tracked down the forger to an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town and retrieved the stolen necklace. The businessman was overjoyed, and Soren couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction at having solved another case.

As he collected his payment and bid farewell to the grateful businessman, Soren Thompson smiled to himself. His unconventional methods had done it again - and this time, justice had been served.
