Nargiza Yun was known for her fiery spirit and sharp wit, traits that had earned her both admiration and frustration from those who knew her. As a successful businesswoman, she had built a reputation as a shrewd investor and astute entrepreneur, always on the lookout for the next big opportunity.

Despite her tough exterior, Nargiza Yun's eyes sparkled with kindness when it came to her loved ones. Her younger brother, Amir, was particularly close to her, and he often found himself on the receiving end of her impromptu advice sessions over steaming cups of coffee.
