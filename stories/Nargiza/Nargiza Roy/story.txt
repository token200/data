As a child, Nargiza Roy had spent hours sketching in her notebook, lost in a world of her own making.

She continued to paint from the heart, pouring her emotions onto the canvas in a way that resonated deeply with her audience. Her studio became a hub for like-minded creatives, who would gather around her easel to share stories and inspire one another.

One day, Nargiza Roy received an invitation to showcase her work at a prestigious gallery in downtown Manhattan. It was a dream come true, and she threw herself into preparing for the exhibition with reckless abandon.
