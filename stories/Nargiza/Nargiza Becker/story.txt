Her obsession was not merely driven by curiosity but also by a sense of duty. She believed that the ancient city held the key to understanding her family's troubled past.

One day, while excavating a recently unearthed site, Nargiza stumbled upon an intricate stone door adorned with symbols she had never seen before.
