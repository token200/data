Nargiza Hill stood atop the windswept moor, her long, curly black hair whipping around her face like a dark vortex. Her eyes, an piercing shade of indigo, scanned the horizon, searching for something - or someone.

Legend had it that Nargiza was cursed by the ancient druids who once called this land home. Some said she was a witch, weaving spells to manipulate the lives of those around her. Others whispered that she was a vessel for an otherworldly force, one that drove her to roam these moors with no purpose but to seek out connection.

Nargiza didn't care what they said. All she knew was that she felt it - this insatiable hunger to be close to something, anything, that would quiet the cacophony in her mind.

As a child, she'd wandered these same moors with her father, searching for rare herbs and healing plants. But when he vanished on one of those walks, Nargiza had been left alone, lost in grief. Since then, she'd roamed this land, always drawn to the hills and glens that seemed to hold secrets of their own.

Tonight was no exception. The stars shone bright above, casting an ethereal glow over the landscape. Nargiza felt it in her bones - a presence, waiting just out of sight. She closed her eyes, breathed in deep, and listened.

At first, there was only silence. But then, a faint rustling caught her attention. She opened her eyes to find a figure emerging from the darkness. Tall, with skin as pale as moonlight, he regarded Nargiza with an expression that was both curious and wary.

"I've been searching for you," he said, his voice low and husky. "My name is Lyrien. I think we might have...business to discuss."

Nargiza raised an eyebrow. No one had ever approached her like this before. Most people fled at the mere mention of her name. But there was something about Lyrien that made her feel a spark of connection - a sense that, for once, she'd found someone who understood.

As they began to talk, Nargiza realized that Lyrien was different too. Not because he knew anything about the ancient druids or their curse, but because he listened - really listened - when she spoke. He saw beyond the rumors and legends, to the person behind the myth.

For the first time in years, Nargiza felt a sense of calm. Maybe, just maybe, this stranger was the key to unlocking the secrets she'd been chasing for so long.
