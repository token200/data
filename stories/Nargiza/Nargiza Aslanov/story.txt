Nargiza Aslanov stepped out of the misty Baku dawn, her bright pink hijab a vibrant splash against the drab grey streets. She took a deep breath, letting the salty sea air fill her lungs as she made her way to the bustling market.

As a young entrepreneur, Nargiza had turned her passion for traditional Azerbaijani textiles into a thriving business. Her stall was adorned with colorful fabrics, intricately woven patterns, and hand-beaded jewelry that sparkled like diamonds in the morning light.

Nargiza's eyes scanned the crowd, searching for her sister, Gulnar. They were supposed to meet at 9 am to discuss their latest order from the United States – a prestigious boutique had requested their signature designs for an upcoming collection.

Just as Nargiza was about to give up hope, she spotted Gulnar, her dark hair tied back in a neat bun, amidst a cluster of admiring customers. The two sisters exchanged warm hugs and kisses on each cheek, before settling into a lively discussion about the order's details.

As the morning wore on, their stall became a hotspot for activity. Nargiza expertly haggled with customers, negotiating prices while maintaining her signature warmth and hospitality. Her sister assisted, deftly manipulating threads and yarns as they worked together to create custom pieces that would dazzle the American clientele.

The sun climbed higher in the sky, casting a golden glow over the market. Nargiza's thoughts turned to their late father, who had instilled in them a love for traditional craftsmanship and entrepreneurship. His memory fueled her determination to preserve Azerbaijani heritage through her business.

As lunchtime approached, the Aslanov sisters took a break, indulging in steaming bowls of plov – a hearty national dish made with rice, meat, and spices – at a nearby café. Over plates of fragrant pilaf, they shared stories about their clients' fashion choices and laughed over misadventures that had occurred on the road.

Reinvigorated, Nargiza and Gulnar returned to their stall, ready to tackle the rest of the day with renewed energy. As the afternoon sun beat down, they worked in perfect harmony, their movements a testament to years of practiced partnership.

The market began to wind down as the sun dipped towards the Caspian Sea. Nargiza wrapped up her final sale and smiled at Gulnar, who was busy meticulously packing the finished pieces into boxes. "We did it, sis," she said, beaming with pride. Their business was thriving, thanks in large part to their dedication to preserving Azerbaijani traditions for a global audience.
