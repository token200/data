Nargiza Mäkinen stood alone on the edge of the frozen lake, her eyes fixed on the dark shape that had caught her attention earlier that morning. A lone figure, huddled in a thin coat, trudging through the knee-deep snow.

As she watched, the figure paused, looking up towards her with a mixture of surprise and wariness. Nargiza's gaze narrowed, assessing the stranger. She was a skilled hunter, one of the few remaining members of her tribe who had survived the harsh winter that had ravaged their land for months.

Slowly, the stranger began to move closer, its features becoming more defined in the pale light. Nargiza recognized the marks on its face - scars from battles fought against rival tribes, and the lines etched into its skin told a story of hardship and struggle.

"Who are you?" Nargiza called out, her voice low and commanding.

The stranger hesitated, then nodded its head in acknowledgement. "I am Aksel," it replied, its voice rough from disuse.

Nargiza's curiosity was piqued. She had heard stories of outsiders who roamed the frozen tundra, searching for something - or someone. But she had never encountered one before. "What brings you to our land?" she asked, her eyes never leaving Aksel's face.

Aksel hesitated, as if weighing its words carefully. "I seek shelter," it said finally. "My tribe has been ravaged by famine and disease. I was sent out to find aid... but I lost my way."

Nargiza's expression softened ever so slightly. She knew what it was like to lose one's tribe, to be left with nothing but the cold and the snow for company. But she also knew that there were those who would take advantage of a stranger in their midst.

"I will let you stay with us," she said finally, making a decision. "But in return, you must help me hunt. Our storehouses are empty, and we need meat to survive."

Aksel nodded gratefully, its face breaking into a faint smile. Nargiza watched it, her mind racing with possibilities. She had heard stories of outsiders who could bring new skills, new knowledge to their tribes. But she also knew that there were risks involved.

As the sun began to set, casting the frozen landscape in a cold, golden light, Nargiza Mäkinen led Aksel towards the safety of her tribe's encampment.
