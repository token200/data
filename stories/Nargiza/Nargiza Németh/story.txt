Nargiza Németh stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar town. She had been on the run for weeks, ever since her family's farm had been repossessed by the government due to the drought. Her parents had always taught her that a person was only as strong as their circumstances, but Nargiza felt like she'd been broken by it.

As a skilled engineer, Nargiza had always dreamed of building bridges and roads that would bring people together, not tear them apart. She had left Hungary with nothing but a suitcase and a determination to make a difference in the world. Her destination was New York City, where she hoped to find work on one of the many infrastructure projects she'd heard were available.

The cool morning air carried the scent of fresh bread from the bakery next door, enticing Nargiza to explore her new surroundings. She wandered down the street, taking in the sounds and sights of a city that was both overwhelming and exhilarating. People rushed past her on the sidewalk, their faces fixed on small screens in their hands.

Nargiza spotted an advertisement for a company called "New Horizon Builders" on the side of a building. Her heart skipped a beat as she read through the job description – they were looking for engineers to work on sustainable infrastructure projects across the city. It was like fate had led her straight to them.

She walked into the office, where a friendly receptionist greeted her with a warm smile. Nargiza's confidence began to grow as she filled out the application and introduced herself. The CEO, a kind-eyed woman named Sarah, listened attentively to Nargiza's story before inviting her for an interview.

The next day, Nargiza sat in front of a panel of esteemed engineers, explaining her vision for green infrastructure and sustainable development. Her words flowed effortlessly, and she could feel the room shifting toward her side as they asked follow-up questions.

As she left the office that afternoon, Sarah approached her with a smile. "Welcome to New Horizon Builders, Nargiza," she said, extending a hand. "We're thrilled to have you on board."

In this moment, Nargiza felt like she was finally home – not just in New York City, but within herself. She knew that the road ahead wouldn't be easy, but with her skills and passion, she was ready to build bridges and roads that would bring people together.
