Nikita's artistic journey began at a young age, when she was encouraged by her parents to explore her creative side. She spent hours sketching and painting, losing herself in the world of color and light.

The deal was tantalizing, but Nikita declined, citing that she could never sell out to the highest bidder. Her integrity and dedication to her art were paramount to her, and she knew that compromising would undermine everything she stood for.
