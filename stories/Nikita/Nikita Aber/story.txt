Nikita Aber stepped off the train and onto the bustling platform, her eyes scanning the crowded station for any sign of her contact. It had been three days since she'd received the message - a cryptic warning that her former employer, a shadowy organization known only as "The Agency," was closing in on her.

Nikita's thoughts were consumed by memories of her past life with The Agency. She'd been trained from a young age to be an expert operative, carrying out missions and eliminating targets with ease. But something had gone wrong, and Nikita had decided to break free from the organization's grasp.

As she made her way through the station, Nikita spotted a figure lurking in the shadows - her contact, code-named "Nova". Nova was a skilled hacker and ally from her past life within The Agency. They'd kept in touch over the years, exchanging coded messages and coordinating plans to evade capture.

Nikita quickened her pace as she approached Nova, who nodded discreetly as she drew near. "You're clear," Nova whispered, handing Nikita a small device. "This contains all your old files - encryption codes, safe houses... everything."

Nikita's eyes widened as she took the device, her mind racing with possibilities. With these documents, she could finally lay low and start building a new life.

But as they made their way through the station, Nikita couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched. She glanced around, her hand instinctively reaching for the gun concealed beneath her jacket.

Nova followed her gaze, her expression grim. "We need to get out of here, now," she urged, grabbing Nikita's arm and pulling her towards a nearby alleyway.

As they burst into the narrow passageway, Nikita felt a rush of adrenaline - she'd never been one for stealthy escapes before, but something about this situation demanded precision. They sprinted through the winding alleys, dodging pedestrians and leaping over trash-filled drains.

Finally, they emerged onto the other side of town, the bright lights of the city stretching out before them like a promise of freedom. Nikita took a deep breath, feeling the weight of her past lifting off her shoulders. She was finally free to forge her own path - no more hiding in the shadows, no more running from The Agency.

With Nova by her side, she stepped into an uncertain future, ready to take on whatever lay ahead.
