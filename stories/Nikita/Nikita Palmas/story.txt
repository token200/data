Nikita Palmas stood on the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the city skyline as the sun dipped below the horizon. Her piercing green eyes seemed to gleam with a hint of mischief, as if daring anyone to challenge her. As the daughter of a powerful mafia boss, Nikita had grown up with a life of privilege and danger that came with it.

But Nikita Palmas was not your average mafia moll. She was a force to be reckoned with, driven by a fierce independence and a sharp mind that rivaled even the most seasoned operatives. Her long, raven-black hair whipped in the wind as she leaned against the railing, her eyes fixed on the distant hum of the city.

A figure emerged from the shadows beside her - it was Marcus, Nikita Palmas's closest ally and confidant. "What's on your mind, Nicki?" he asked, using the nickname only a handful of people were allowed to call her.

Nikita Palmas turned to him, a sly smile spreading across her face. "Just thinking about the job we've got coming up," she said, her voice low and husky. "I don't like being tied down to one location for too long. It's like my skin is itching for something more."

Marcus raised an eyebrow, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he chuckled. "You're always looking for a fight, aren't you?"

Nikita Palmas shrugged, her shoulders barely rising off the edge of the rooftop. "Maybe," she admitted, her eyes glinting in the fading light. "But someone's got to keep things interesting around here."

The two of them stood there in comfortable silence for a moment, watching as the city lights began to twinkle like stars. Then, without warning, Nikita Palmas sprang into action, her movements swift and deadly. It was clear that even on a rooftop, she was always on high alert - a true master of her domain.

As the night wore on, Nikita Palmas vanished into the shadows, leaving Marcus to wonder what new adventure lay ahead for his partner in crime-fighting. One thing was certain: with Nikita Palmas at the helm, nothing would ever be dull again.
