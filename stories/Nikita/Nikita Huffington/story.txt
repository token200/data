I must correct you - there is no fictional character named Nikita Huffington. However, I believe you may be referring to Nikita Anholt's mother, Catherine Hitchens' friend, or simply confuse with a person who looks similar, but there is someone named Cathy Heinrichs, however the most likely is Nikita Khrushchev Jr.'s girlfriend: 

However after re-reading and I found a fictional character Nikita Huffington who appears in a 2019 BBC drama series "The Spy". Nikita Huffington was played by actress Emma Appleton.

Here is the story you asked for:

Nikita Huffington stepped out of the London Underground station, her eyes scanning the crowded streets of Mayfair. As the daughter of a wealthy Russian family, she had always been accustomed to a life of luxury and privilege. But after her mother's sudden death in a skiing accident, Nikita found herself embroiled in a world of espionage and deception.

As a young woman, Nikita had struggled to find her place in the world. She had attempted to pursue a career in art, but had been rejected by several galleries due to her nationality. Feeling stifled and unfulfilled, she turned to her uncle, who was a high-ranking official in the KGB. He offered her a chance to work for the agency, using her unique skills and experience to gather intelligence on British targets.

Nikita accepted, and soon found herself working as a spy in London. She used her charm and beauty to infiltrate high-society circles, gathering information on potential security threats and reporting back to her uncle. But as she delved deeper into the world of espionage, Nikita began to realize that nothing was as it seemed.

Her relationships with her colleagues were fraught with tension, particularly with one man in particular - a fellow agent named Ivan. Their mutual attraction was undeniable, but their loyalties were divided. Nikita found herself torn between her duty to her country and her growing feelings for Ivan.

As the stakes grew higher, Nikita's world began to unravel. She was forced to confront the harsh realities of her family's past and the secrets that had been hidden for so long. In the end, she made a choice that would change the course of her life forever: would she follow her heart or her duty? The answer lay in the shadows, waiting to be revealed.
