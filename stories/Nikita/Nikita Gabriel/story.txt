Nikita Gabriel stood confidently on stage, her piercing green eyes scanning the crowd of aspiring artists and musicians that had gathered to witness the audition for the prestigious Golden Note competition. As the lead singer of the indie rock band, Wildfire, Nikita was no stranger to the spotlight, but she knew that this moment could make or break their career.

With a deep breath, Nikita began to belt out the lyrics to their original song, "Burning Down," her powerful vocals echoing through the venue. The judges watched intently, taking note of every nuanced expression and deliberate pause. Her bandmates, Jack and Alex, played with conviction behind her, their guitars and drums weaving a rich tapestry of sound.

As Nikita's performance came to an end, she was met with a mixture of applause and silence. She waited anxiously for the verdict, her mind racing with thoughts of what could go wrong.
