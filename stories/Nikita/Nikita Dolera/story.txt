She honed her skills in secret, training for hours every day until she could take down anyone who dared step into the ring with her.

As Nikita's reputation grew, so did the attention from those who sought to bring her down. The rival fighters, the promoters, they all wanted a piece of the action. But Nikita remained steadfast, focused on one goal: to be the best.
