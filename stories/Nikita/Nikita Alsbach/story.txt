Nikita Alsbach stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station with a mix of caution and determination. A former Russian intelligence operative turned rogue agent, Nikita had been on the run for months, evading capture and leaving a trail of destruction in her wake.

As she made her way through the crowds, Nikita's mind raced with the mission ahead. She was meeting a contact at the local café on the outskirts of town, someone who claimed to have information about her sister's disappearance. Ana Alsbach, her younger sister, had been taken by their enemies after Nikita's last operation went sour.

Nikita pushed open the door to the café and scanned the room for her contact. A hooded figure sat in the corner, sipping a coffee and watching her approach with an intensity that made her skin prickle. She slid into the seat across from them, her eyes locked on theirs.

"Who are you?" Nikita asked gruffly, trying to keep her tone neutral.

"I'm someone who knows what happened to Ana," the figure replied, their voice low and gravelly. "And I'm willing to tell you, for a price."

Nikita hesitated, weighing the risks and benefits of trusting this stranger. But she had no other leads, and desperation was driving her to make impossible choices.

The hooded figure leaned forward, producing a small USB drive from their pocket. "This contains everything I know about Ana's disappearance," they said, their eyes glinting with a mixture of malice and warning. "But you have to understand, Nikita Alsbach, the truth comes with a price."

Nikita's grip on the armrest tightened as she took the drive from her contact. She knew that this information would change everything – but at what cost? Only time would tell if the secrets contained within that small device were worth risking her own life once again.
