Nikita Schillaci stepped into the dimly lit alley, her eyes scanning the rooftops for any sign of movement. As a former Russian spy turned freelance journalist, she had a reputation for being one step ahead of her enemies.

A faint noise caught her attention, and Nikita quickened her pace, her hand instinctively reaching for the dagger hidden in her boot. The alley was narrow, with tall buildings looming on either side, casting long shadows that made it impossible to see more than five feet away.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the darkness, its features obscured by a hoodie. "Nikita Schillaci," a low voice said, dripping with menace. "I've been waiting for you."

Nikita's grip on her dagger tightened, but she remained still, studying the stranger's movements. Who was this person, and how did they know her real name?

The figure stepped closer, its eyes gleaming in the faint moonlight. Nikita's instincts screamed at her to attack, but something about the stranger's tone stayed her hand.

"You're a hard woman to find," the stranger continued, its voice weaving in and out of the shadows. "I've been searching for you for months."

Nikita's mind racing, she slowly backed away, keeping her dagger trained on the stranger. "What do you want?" she asked, trying to keep her voice steady.

The stranger smiled, revealing a glint of metal. "I have information about your past," it said, producing a small device from its pocket. "Information that could change everything."

Nikita's eyes locked onto the device, her mind reeling with possibilities. She had thought she left her Russian spy days behind, but this stranger seemed to know otherwise.

Without hesitation, Nikita reached out and snatched the device, her fingers closing around it like a vice. "What do you want in return?" she asked, her voice cold and calculated.

The stranger hesitated for a moment before answering, its voice dripping with regret. "I just want to see that it ends," it said, its eyes pleading for mercy.

Nikita's gaze lingered on the device, weighing her options. She knew that this information could be explosive, but she also knew that she couldn't let her enemies get their hands on it.

With a quiet resolve, Nikita tucked the device into her pocket and turned to leave. "It ends," she said, her voice firm and final.

The stranger watched as Nikita disappeared into the night, its eyes haunted by a mixture of fear and defeat.
