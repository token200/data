Nikita Charron stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, her eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of movement. As a former assassin and current member of an underground resistance, she had grown accustomed to navigating the darker corners of the city.

Her latest mission was to infiltrate a high-security facility owned by a corrupt businessman with ties to the government. Nikita's intel suggested that he was hiding something big, and it was her job to find out what it was.

She moved stealthily through the alleyway, her black jumpsuit blending into the darkness. Her hands hovered over the grip of her gun, ready for anything. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows - a young woman with piercing green eyes.

"Nikita Charron?" the woman asked, her voice hesitant.

Nikita nodded, her expression neutral. "Who are you?"

"I'm Lena," the woman replied. "I've been sent to extract me from this place. The businessman is using me for some kind of experiment."

Nikita's instincts went on high alert. She knew that sound like a job for someone like her. "Come with me," she said, leading Lena out of the alleyway and into the safety of the night.

As they navigated through the city streets, Nikita couldn't shake off the feeling that she was being watched. She glanced over her shoulder, but saw nothing. Still, the hairs on the back of her neck stood up.

They finally arrived at a safehouse - an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. Lena collapsed onto a chair, gasping for breath.

"What kind of experiment?" Nikita asked, handing Lena a glass of water.

"I don't know," Lena replied, shaking her head. "I was just in a lab with several other women when this... thing happened. I remember hearing voices and screams. Then, nothing."

Nikita's expression turned grim. She knew that sound like a job for someone who took action. She would find out what was happening to those women and put a stop to it.

As she dialed a number on her phone, Nikita couldn't help but think about how far she had come since her days as an assassin. Now, she used her skills to protect the innocent - something that felt more like home than her old life ever did.

"Hello?" a voice answered on the other end of the line.

"It's me, Nikita Charron," she said, her voice firm and commanding. "I have a situation that needs attention."

The voice on the other end replied, "We're on our way."
