Nikita's journey began when she was just a teenager, forced to flee her hometown after witnessing a tragic event that left her with no choice but to escape. Since then, she had been living off the grid, taking on various identities and personas to blend in with her surroundings. Her determination to uncover the truth about her past remained unwavering.

One day, while working as a waitress at a small diner, Nikita overheard a conversation between two men that sparked her curiosity. They were discussing an organization known only as "The Syndicate," rumored to be involved in some of the darkest secrets of the city's elite. Intrigued, Nikita decided to dig deeper.

She spent countless hours researching and investigating, gathering evidence and following leads.

The truth about her family's involvement with The Syndicate threatened to upend everything she thought she knew about herself.

With each new revelation, Nikita felt a sense of purpose growing within her. She was no longer just a fugitive; she had become a force for justice, driven by her determination to expose the truth and bring those responsible to account. Her name, Nikita Maria Hoffmann, echoed in her mind as she vowed to see this mission through to its conclusion.
