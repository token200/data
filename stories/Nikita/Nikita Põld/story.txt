Her eyes gleamed with intensity behind her signature cat-eye glasses, and her raven-black hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall.

One rainy evening, Nikita Põld received a cryptic message from an anonymous source claiming to have information about a high-stakes art heist that had shaken the city's elite. The thief had stolen a priceless painting worth millions, leaving behind only a hint of its whereabouts.
