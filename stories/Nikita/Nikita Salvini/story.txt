Nikita Salvini stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the rain-soaked streets of Manhattan. Her eyes scanned the crowded sidewalks, searching for any sign of her quarry. She was on the hunt for a man named Victor, a former associate who had turned against her.

As she navigated through the throngs of people, Nikita's mind flashed back to the events that led her here. A chance encounter with Victor had put her in a precarious situation, one that required her to take drastic measures. The memories still lingered, a painful reminder of the risks she took every day as a freelance operative.

Nikita quickened her pace, weaving past tourists and businessmen alike. Her phone buzzed in her pocket, a text message from an unknown number: "Meet me at the coffee shop on 5th Avenue if you want to see Victor again."

Her gut told her this was a trap, but Nikita's instincts were rarely wrong. She pushed open the door to the coffee shop and scanned the room. The man who had sent the text sat in the corner, nursing a cup of black coffee.

"Victor," she said, striding confidently towards him. "I see you're as charming as ever."

The man looked up, his eyes narrowing behind a pair of wire-rimmed glasses. "Nikita Salvini," he replied coolly. "It's been too long."

Their conversation was stilted at first, each trying to gauge the other's intentions. But Nikita knew better than to underestimate Victor. He had a history of playing both sides against the middle.

As they spoke, Nikita noticed a subtle change in Victor's demeanor. He seemed... nervous. A fleeting glance around the coffee shop revealed a security detail lurking outside, their eyes fixed intently on her.

Without warning, Nikita made her move. She lunged forward, snatching Victor's phone from his hand and silencing it with a swift swipe of her finger. The room fell silent as she stood, towering over Victor like a specter of justice.

"You should have stayed loyal," she whispered, the words dripping with venom.

The security detail swooped in, surrounding Nikita like a vice. She smiled to herself, knowing that this was only the beginning.
