Nikita Hassan sat in her small apartment, staring blankly at the wall as she tried to gather her thoughts. It had been three months since her mother's death, and the pain still felt like a fresh wound. She thought back to the happy memories they had shared - the laughter, the adventures, the quiet moments of companionship.

As she sat there, lost in her thoughts, Nikita Hassan heard a knock at the door. It was her best friend, Rachel, come to check on her. Rachel had been by Nikita's side since childhood, and her presence always brought some comfort.

"Nikita, I'm so sorry again for your loss," Rachel said, as she took a seat next to her on the couch. "Your mom would want us to be strong for you."

Nikita Hassan smiled weakly, feeling a lump form in her throat. She had always been close to her mother, and the thought of living without her was almost too much to bear.

As they chatted, Nikita Hassan realized that she needed to start thinking about her future. She couldn't keep dwelling on the past forever. With Rachel's support, she began to make plans for school and a career - things that would honor her mother's memory.

But as the days turned into weeks, Nikita Hassan found herself struggling to balance her grief with her newfound determination. There were times when the pain felt overwhelming, and she couldn't help but wonder if she was strong enough to move on.

One day, while out for a walk, Nikita Hassan stumbled upon a small park that she had never noticed before. She sat down on a bench, watching as children played tag on the grass. It was in these quiet moments that she began to feel a sense of peace - a feeling that she was starting to heal, slowly but surely.

As the sun set over the park, Nikita Hassan smiled softly to herself, knowing that her mother would be proud of the strong and resilient person she was becoming.
