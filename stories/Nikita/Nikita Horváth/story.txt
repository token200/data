Nikita Horváth stood at the edge of the rooftop, the city sprawled out before her like a canvas of steel and glass. She had always felt most alive in these moments, where the world seemed to stretch out endlessly and nothing but possibilities waited.

As a former member of an elite intelligence agency, Nikita had seen her fair share of battles and betrayals. But after a fateful mission went awry, she had fled, leaving behind the life she once knew. Now, she moved in the shadows, taking on clandestine missions for those who needed her unique skillset.

Tonight was no different.

Nikita checked her watch, a small, discreet device that monitored her movements and provided real-time intel. She was supposed to meet someone here, a contact with information about a high-profile target. But as she scanned the rooftop, a lone figure emerged from the darkness.

It was him – Viktor, the man who had once been her closest ally. Now, he stood before her, his eyes locked onto hers with an unnerving intensity.

"You're still working for me," Nikita said, trying to keep her voice steady.

Viktor nodded, his smile a thin line on his face. "I have information about the target you seek."

Nikita's hand tightened around the grip of her gun. She had trusted Viktor once, but she knew better now. Betrayal was just a word away from the past.

"What do you want in return?" she asked, keeping her eyes locked on his.

Viktor took a step closer, his voice dripping with menace. "I have information about your sister."

Nikita's heart skipped a beat. Her sister, Lada, had been taken by Viktor years ago. She had never given up hope that Nikita would find out what happened to her.

"What do you know?" she asked, trying to keep her composure.

Viktor smiled again. "Your sister is alive. And I'll give you the location of her new position... for a price."

Nikita hesitated, weighing her options. She could take Viktor down, but that would mean she'd never find Lada. Or, she could play along and risk losing herself to the very people she had once sworn to protect.

As the city lights twinkled below, Nikita made her decision. She took a deep breath and nodded. "I'll listen."

And with that, she stepped into the unknown, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
