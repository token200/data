Nikita Satylganova was a woman on a mission. Her piercing green eyes seemed to bore into those she met, as if sizing them up for potential threats. With her raven-black hair pulled back into a sleek ponytail and a scattering of tattoos across her cheeks, Nikita exuded an air of quiet confidence.

A former member of the infamous Russian mafia, Nikita had left that life behind after a particularly close call with the law. Now, she worked as a freelance security consultant, taking on high-stakes missions for wealthy clients who couldn't be bothered to do it themselves.

Tonight was one such mission. A prominent tech mogul had hired Nikita to infiltrate a rival company's high-security facility and steal a cutting-edge AI prototype. Easy enough, thought Nikita – she'd done this kind of thing before. But as she surveyed the perimeter of the building, her instincts told her something wasn't quite right.

She made her way around to the east side of the building, where a single guard stood watch over a small entrance. Nikita slipped out a smoke bomb and activated it, creating a brief diversion as she slipped past the guard undetected.

Inside, the facility was a labyrinthine maze of corridors and server rooms. Nikita's trained eyes quickly picked out the location of the AI prototype – a sleek, black cylinder nestled in a heavily fortified vault. She worked her way through the security grid, avoiding laser beams and pressure plates with ease.

Finally, she reached the vault. With a few swift movements, Nikita disabled the biometric lock and slid open the door. The AI prototype hummed to life before her, its glowing blue circuits pulsing with an otherworldly energy.

Nikita's eyes narrowed as she accessed the AI's internal systems – something was indeed off about this job. She quickly hacked into the facility's mainframe, unearthing a shocking truth: the rival company had been working on a backdoor for their own purposes – and Nikita's client was about to become a pawn in a much larger game.

With her mission compromised, Nikita knew she had to act fast. She swiftly disabled the AI prototype and made her way back out of the facility, already planning her next move as she disappeared into the night, ever-vigilant and always ready for whatever lay ahead.
