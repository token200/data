As the leader of The Shadow Syndicate, Nikita Allende had set out to dismantle a corrupt government that had been oppressing its citizens for far too long. With a small but fiercely loyal team by her side, she infiltrated high-security facilities, gathered intel on the regime's atrocities, and executed daring raids to disrupt their operations.

The more she uncovered, the more she realized that nothing was as it seemed. The lines between friend and foe blurred, and Nikita Allende's world was turned upside down.

With her back against the wall, Nikita Allende knew she had to make a choice: trust her instincts or risk everything on a wild gamble. In a tense standoff with Victor Vex, she made her decision. "I'll never be bound by your rules," she declared, eyes blazing with determination.
