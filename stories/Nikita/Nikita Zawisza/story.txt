Nikita Zawisza's eyes scanned the crowded café, her gaze lingering on each patron with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. As a former Russian spy turned rogue agent, she had honed her skills to blend in seamlessly with the crowd. Her raven-black hair was pulled back into a tight ponytail, revealing the sharp angles of her face.

Nikita Zawisza sipped her coffee, her mind racing with the latest intel she had gathered. A mole within the CIA had tipped her off about a potential threat to global security, and she aimed to uncover its source before it was too late. Her instincts told her that this could be the break she needed to finally redeem herself in the eyes of her former handlers.

As she surveyed the café, Nikita Zawisza's trained eye picked out a few suspicious characters lurking in the shadows. She noted their descriptions and movements, committing them to memory for future reference. Her experience with undercover operations had taught her that attention to detail was key, and she wouldn't let anything slip through the cracks.

Nikita Zawisza's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a woman's voice behind her. "Mind if I join you?" the stranger asked, flashing a disarming smile. Nikita Zawisza turned to face the newcomer, her instincts on high alert. There was something about this woman that didn't add up – the way she seemed too eager, too confident.

"I'm not sure I want any company," Nikita Zawisza replied coolly, her eyes narrowing as she assessed the stranger's true intentions. The woman chuckled, a throaty sound that sent shivers down Nikita Zawisza's spine. For a moment, the two women locked gazes, their mutual wariness palpable.

Without breaking eye contact, Nikita Zawisza reached for her phone and dialed a number. "I think I've found someone who can help me," she whispered to the woman, her voice dripping with menace. The stranger's smile faltered, and for an instant, Nikita Zawisza glimpsed a flicker of fear behind those piercing green eyes. It was enough to make her pause, if only for a moment.
