Daniela Yang was no ordinary college student. By day, she was a junior majoring in computer science, but by night, she was an underground graffiti artist, known only by her pseudonym "Dyaa". Her vibrant murals had become a staple of the city's street art scene, and people whispered about the elusive creator behind them.

One rainy evening, as Daniela Yang walked home from the library, she couldn't shake off the feeling that someone was watching her. She quickened her pace, glancing over her shoulder, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Shrugging it off, she ducked into a nearby alleyway to avoid getting soaked.

As she stood there, a piece of paper caught her eye. It was a sketch of one of her murals, with the words "You're being watched" scrawled across it in bold letters. Daniela Yang's heart skipped a beat as she realized that someone had been following her. She felt a shiver run down her spine, but she refused to let fear get the better of her.

Back in her dorm room, Daniela Yang began working on a new piece, inspired by the mysterious encounter. Her brushstrokes were bold and confident, as if she was trying to make a statement about being seen and not silenced. As the night wore on, the colors blended together, forming a swirling vortex of creativity.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. Daniela Yang hesitated for a moment before getting up to answer it. To her surprise, it was a fellow student from her class, with a smile on his face and a camera slung over his shoulder. "Hey, Dyaa," he said, using her pseudonym. "I saw your murals last night, and I had to meet the artist behind them."

Daniela Yang smiled wryly, knowing that she had been discovered. But as she looked at the student's face, she saw something there that made her feel seen too â€“ a sense of connection, of understanding. Maybe, just maybe, being watched wasn't so bad after all.
