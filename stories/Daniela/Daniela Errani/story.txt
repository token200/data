I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Daniela Errani. However, I did find information on an Italian professional tennis player named Daniela Hantuchov√° and an Argentine tennis player, but not a person by the name of Daniela Errani.

If you'd like, I can write a story about an alternate version of the character Daniela Errani. Alternatively, I can provide information on one of the real-life tennis players mentioned above.

Alternatively, if you have any additional context or clarification on who Daniela Errani is, I may be able to create a fictional story for her.
