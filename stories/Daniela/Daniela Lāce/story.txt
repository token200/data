She took a deep breath, savoring the salty sea air and the sound of chimes from the nearby church steeple. As a renowned folklorist, Daniela Lāce had spent countless hours studying the ancient traditions of her people, but it wasn't until she stumbled upon an obscure tale in a dusty archive that she discovered her true calling.

Daniela Lāce's eyes widened as she sampled the delicious treat, feeling a sense of connection to her heritage that she had never experienced before.
