Elisa Stenström stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the drizzly streets of Helsinki. She had been away for months, visiting relatives in Sweden, but was now back in Finland, ready to face whatever lay ahead.

As a young journalist, Elisa had always been drawn to the darker side of human nature. Her latest investigation had led her to the city's underbelly, where she had stumbled upon a string of gruesome murders. The police were stumped, and the public was on edge.

Elisa's eyes landed on a small café across the street, where she knew her source would be waiting. She pushed open the door and slid onto a stool at the counter.

"Ah, Elisa," said her source, a grizzled old sailor named Kalle. "I see you're back. I have some information for you."

Elisa leaned in, her ears perked up. Kalle pulled out a small notebook from his pocket and flipped through its pages, stopping at a particular entry.

"This one's the latest," he said, his voice low. "A young woman found dead in an alleyway off Esplanadei. No signs of forced entry or struggle. Just a single bullet wound to the head."

Elisa's mind was racing. This was getting too close for comfort. She knew she had to tread carefully, but she couldn't let this story drop.

"Can you tell me more about her?" Elisa asked, her eyes locked on Kalle's.

Kalle hesitated before speaking. "Her name is Sofia. She was a nurse at the city hospital. No one seems to know much about her, except that she was working nights and had left work early that day."

Elisa nodded to herself. This was going to be tough. But she was determined to get to the bottom of it.

As she finished her coffee and stood up to leave, Elisa felt a shiver run down her spine. She knew that this case would be one of the toughest she'd ever tackled, but she was ready for it. Bring it on, Helsinki.
