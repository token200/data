Elisa Rodríguez García was a free-spirited artist who had always followed her passion for painting, no matter where life took her. Born and raised in the vibrant city of Madrid, Spain, Elisa's creativity was nurtured from a young age by her parents, both artists themselves.

As she grew older, Elisa became increasingly drawn to the works of Spanish surrealist master Salvador Dalí. His bold, dreamlike landscapes and sculptures inspired her own unique style, which blended traditional techniques with modern twists. Her artwork often featured fantastical creatures and cityscapes, imbued with a sense of mystery and intrigue.

After completing art school, Elisa set out on the road, traveling to various countries in search of new inspiration. She spent time in Italy, where she marveled at the Renaissance masterpieces in Florence; in Mexico, where she immersed herself in the colorful world of Day of the Dead celebrations; and in Brazil, where she danced with the rhythms of samba.

Wherever Elisa went, her art followed, capturing the essence of each place she visited. Her paintings became a testament to her boundless curiosity and creativity, inviting viewers to step into the surreal worlds she created.
