I couldn't find any information on a well-known fictional character named Elisa Kortajarena. It's possible that she is not a widely recognized or prominent character in literature, film, or other forms of media.

However, I can create a new story around this character, assuming she is a protagonist in a work of fiction. Here is a 400-word short story:

Elisa Kortajarena was an enigmatic figure with piercing green eyes that seemed to see right through you. She lived in the small town of Azul Bay, where everyone knew her name and whispered about her mysterious past.

Rumors swirled around Elisa like the fog that rolled in from the ocean every evening. Some said she was a daughter of a wealthy merchant who had disappeared at sea, while others claimed she was a skilled thief with a network of hidden safe houses throughout the town.

Despite the whispers and suspicions, Elisa remained elusive, always keeping to herself and observing the world around her with an unnerving intensity. She worked as a seamstress at the local boutique, where she would spend hours sewing intricate patterns into silk garments that seemed to shimmer like moonlight on the water.

One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, a stranger arrived in town. He was tall and brooding, with eyes that matched Elisa's piercing green – an uncanny resemblance that sent shivers down her spine. The townsfolk were wary of him at first, but there was something about his presence that seemed... familiar.

As Elisa watched the stranger from afar, she began to sense a connection between them, as if they shared some unspoken understanding. Without hesitation, she approached him, and they walked side by side through the streets of Azul Bay, their footsteps echoing off the whitewashed walls.

The night air was alive with secrets, and Elisa knew that this stranger might hold the key to unlocking her own enigmatic past. As they vanished into the darkness, the townsfolk whispered among themselves once more – but this time, there was a sense of hope and anticipation in their voices.

For in Azul Bay, nothing was as it seemed, and sometimes the truth lay hidden beneath the surface, waiting to be uncovered by those with eyes that saw beyond the veil. Elisa Kortajarena was no exception; she would uncover her secrets, one thread at a time, as the mystery of her past slowly unraveled like the delicate patterns on a silk fabric.
