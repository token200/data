One day, a wandering wizard stumbled upon the village, seeking refuge from the wars that ravaged the land. Impressed by his wisdom and kindness, Elisa Krumina secretly learned the art of magic from him.

"You will never win," she declared defiantly. "The people will rise up against you, and I will be their voice." With a fierce cry, Elisa Krumina unleashed her magic, banishing the sorcerer from the land.
