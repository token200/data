Elisa Abdi had always been fascinated by the world of art. As a child, she would spend hours sketching and painting, lost in her own little world of colors and shapes. Her parents, both artists themselves, encouraged her creativity and nurtured her passion for art.

As Elisa grew older, her interest in art only deepened. She went on to study fine arts in college, where she honed her skills and developed a unique style that blended traditional techniques with modern influences.
