I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Elisa Kalniņš. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created recently.

However, I can create a new character and write a story about them. Please let me know if you'd like me to do so.

If you provide more context or details about the character Elisa Kalniņš, I'll be happy to write a story based on that.

Alternatively, if you're interested in learning more about fictional characters from Latvia, I can suggest some well-known Latvian characters and their stories.
