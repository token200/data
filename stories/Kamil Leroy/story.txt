Kamil Leroy stood in front of the old, worn mirror, adjusting his jacket for what felt like the hundredth time. He checked himself over, making sure every crease was in place and his tie was perfectly knotted. It was a ritual he'd perfected over years of trying to present himself as someone he wasn't.

As he finished his pre-grooming routine, Kamil's eyes wandered to the small photograph on the mantlepiece above him. A picture of his late mother, taken on her 50th birthday - a bright smile and sparkling eyes that seemed to radiate warmth even through the lens. He hadn't spoken to her in years, but memories still lingered.

Kamil took a deep breath, mentally preparing himself for the night ahead. He had a job interview with the prestigious Harrington Corporation, an opportunity he couldn't afford to blow. It was his chance to leave his lowly marketing assistant role behind and join their ranks as one of their top executives.

As he walked into the sleek, modern office building, Kamil felt like a fish out of water among the polished suits and business cards exchanged with confidence. His own suit seemed too sharp, too perfect - it was hard to shake the feeling that someone would see through his mask and discover the fake behind it.

Throughout the interview, Kamil fielded questions about leadership style, problem-solving skills, and vision for the company's future. He wove together answers carefully crafted from books he'd devoured on the subject, never once revealing his lack of genuine experience.

The interview ended, and Kamil was ushered into a small waiting room with a sleek glass table and comfortable chairs. A soft voice called out his name an instant later, followed by a poised woman with piercing blue eyes who introduced herself as Emily Harrington. She offered him the job on one condition - meet her in three weeks for another interview.

Kamil's heart skipped a beat as he left the office building that night, feeling like he was walking on air. For the first time in years, his carefully constructed facade seemed to be getting stronger, rather than weaker.

He couldn't shake off the thought of Emily Harrington - what would she see if she looked beyond the carefully arranged veneer? Was it possible that finally, someone saw him for who he truly was?

The three-week waiting period felt like an eternity. Kamil rehearsed every line from their first interview a dozen times, ready to confront the doubts and fears head-on in Emily's second meeting.

And as he walked into her office on the third day of April, Kamil Leroy stood tall - almost - his tie slightly askew, but a glimmer of self-assurance sparkling behind those tired blue eyes.
