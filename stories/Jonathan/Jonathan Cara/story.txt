Jonathan Cara stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out at the cityscape below. The sun had just set, casting a warm orange glow over the towering skyscrapers and bustling streets. He took a deep breath, feeling the cool breeze fill his lungs as he surveyed his domain.

As a private investigator, Jonathan had seen it all. From missing persons cases to corporate espionage, he'd worked on every type of case imaginable. But there was something about this one that bothered him - a feeling of unease that settled in the pit of his stomach like a cold stone.

It started with a phone call from an unknown number. A woman's voice whispered a cryptic message: "They're watching you, Jonathan." She hung up before he could respond, leaving him wondering who was behind the ominous warning and what it meant for his own life.

Jonathan had tried to brush it off as a prank, but something about the call lingered in his mind. He began to feel like he was being watched, even when he was alone. The hairs on the back of his neck stood on end whenever someone entered a room. It was as if an unseen presence lurked just out of sight, waiting for him to make a move.

Determined to get to the bottom of things, Jonathan started digging into his past. He scoured through old files, talked to sources, and followed every lead no matter how small. And then, like a ghost from the shadows, a name began to emerge: Alexei Petrov, a former KGB agent with a reputation for ruthlessness.

It was clear that someone had been watching Jonathan, following him for weeks maybe even months. He couldn't shake the feeling that his own life was now in danger. The city seemed darker, more sinister than before. Even the stars above seemed to twinkle with malice, as if they were taunting him.

Jonathan's phone rang again, shrill and insistent. This time he answered without hesitation. "Hello?" he said, ready for whatever lay on the other end of the line. The voice on the other end whispered a single word: "Run."
