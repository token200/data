Jonathan Wright had always been drawn to the world of music. As a child, he spent hours listening to his parents' vinyl collection, mesmerized by the sounds of The Beatles and Led Zeppelin. His love for music only grew stronger as he entered adulthood, and he went on to study music theory at university.

After graduating, Jonathan worked as an audio engineer in a small recording studio in Los Angeles. He spent his days assisting top artists and producers, honing his skills and learning the ins and outs of the industry. Despite the long hours and grueling workload, Jonathan thrived in this environment, his passion for music driving him to excel.

One day, while working on a project with a new client, Jonathan was approached by a local musician who had been impressed by his work. The musician, a young singer-songwriter named Emma, asked if she could record her demo at the studio. Jonathan agreed, and soon found himself pouring his heart and soul into helping Emma bring her music to life.
