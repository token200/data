Sofie Sten stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the desolate station. It had been five years since she'd last set foot in Ravenswood, the small town on the outskirts of Stockholm where her family had made their home for generations.

As a young woman, Sofie had always felt a deep connection to this place. Her parents had raised her and her brother here, teaching her the ways of the forest and the secrets of the old gods. But after her mother's passing, Sofie had left Ravenswood behind, seeking answers in the world beyond their tiny valley.

Now, as she walked through the station, Sofie felt a sense of restlessness wash over her. She'd been back to Ravenswood once before, searching for clues about her family's dark past. But that time, she'd found nothing but dead ends and unanswered questions.

This time, however, Sofie had come with purpose. Her grandmother, Helga, had passed away recently, leaving behind a cryptic letter and a promise to meet her at Ravenswood station. The letter spoke of an ancient artifact hidden somewhere in the town, one that held the key to unlocking Sofie's family secrets.

As she walked through the station, Sofie noticed a figure waiting for her by the coffee shop. He was tall and lean, with piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through her. "Sofie," he said, his voice low and smooth. "I've been expecting you."

"Who are you?" Sofie asked, her hand instinctively reaching for the knife she always carried.

"I'm Einar," the stranger replied, a small smile playing on his lips. "And I think we both know why I'm here."

Over coffee, Einar told Sofie that he'd been tracking a series of strange occurrences in Ravenswood. People had gone missing, and some had reported seeing shadowy figures lurking in the woods. It sounded like something from an old legend â€“ but Einar believed it was more than just myth.

Together, Sofie and Einar set out to explore the town and uncover its secrets. As they walked, the air seemed to grow heavier, as if the very fabric of reality was shifting around them. And then, just as they were about to give up for the night, they stumbled upon an ancient symbol etched into the bark of a standing tree.

"It's the mark of the old gods," Sofie breathed, her heart racing with excitement.

Einar's eyes locked onto hers, his gaze burning with intensity. "We're close," he said. "We really are."
