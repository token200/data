Sofie Mägi stepped into the bustling café, scanning the room for her friend, Emilia. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and baked goods filled the air as she made her way to the table where Emilia sat sipping a latte.

"Sofie Mägi!" Emilia exclaimed, as Sofie dropped into the chair across from her. "It's been too long! How have you been?"

Sofie smiled, taking a sip of her own coffee. "I've been good, Emilia. Just busy with work and trying to get some writing done on my novel."

Emilia's eyes lit up with interest. "Oh? What's the novel about?"

Sofie leaned in, lowering her voice. "It's a romance set in Tallinn, where I grew up. I want to capture the essence of our city's history and culture."

As they chatted, a group of tourists walked by, asking for directions. Sofie pointed them in the right direction, feeling a sense of pride in her hometown.

After a while, Emilia suggested they take a walk along the harbor. The sun was shining, casting a warm glow over the water as they strolled along the pier. Sofie felt a sense of contentment wash over her, grateful for this break from her busy schedule.

As they walked, Emilia asked Sofie about her plans for the future. "Do you think you'll ever publish your novel?" she asked, eyes sparkling with curiosity.

Sofie hesitated, unsure if she was ready to share her doubts out loud. But something about Emilia's kind smile put her at ease. "I hope so," she said finally. "But even if I don't, I know I'll always have this city and these people in my heart."

Emilia nodded understandingly, and the two friends continued their stroll, lost in conversation and the beauty of the harbor. As they walked, Sofie Mägi felt a sense of peace settle over her, knowing that she had Emilia by her side to share in the joys and challenges of life.
