Sofie Szabó stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the crowded station. It had been years since she'd set foot in Budapest, but the familiarity was still there – the worn wooden benches, the scent of freshly baked bread wafting from the nearby café, and the sound of the Danube River lapping against the shore.

Sofie's thoughts were elsewhere, however. She'd received a letter from her estranged father, inviting her to return home for his funeral. The news had come as a shock – Sofie hadn't seen or heard from him in over two decades. Her mother had long since passed away, and Sofie had always assumed she was the only one left behind.

As she made her way through the station, Sofie's eyes landed on a familiar face – that of József, her childhood friend and confidant. They'd lost touch after Sofie left Budapest for university, but it seemed their paths had crossed again by chance.

"Sofie!" József exclaimed, rushing over to envelop her in a warm hug. "It's been ages! How are you?"

Sofie smiled wryly, feeling a mix of emotions. "I'm here," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Why have I come? My father...?"

József nodded somberly. "Yes, the funeral. He wanted to see you one last time."

As they walked through the station together, Sofie couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. Her father's letter had been cryptic – a vague mention of an old debt and a desire for forgiveness.

The ride from the station to the cemetery was spent in silence, with József filling the gaps with small talk about his family and job. But as they arrived at the gravesite, Sofie's gaze locked onto the simple headstone bearing her father's name.

Sofie felt a lump form in her throat as she approached the grave. She'd never known much about her father – just that he was a man who had left without explanation when she was just a child. But now, standing before his final resting place, she felt a sense of resolve wash over her.

For all the years she'd spent wondering and searching for answers, Sofie knew in this moment that closure was the greatest gift of all.
