Sofie Carlburg had always been fascinated by the world of art and history. Growing up in a small town in Sweden, she spent most of her free time exploring the local museums and galleries, soaking up the knowledge and inspiration that surrounded her.

She smiled to herself, knowing that this was just the beginning â€“ Sofie Carlburg had finally found her place in the world, and she was ready to take on whatever came next.

With her foot firmly planted on the ground, Sofie Carlburg looked out at the sea of faces before her, feeling a sense of belonging she had never felt before.
