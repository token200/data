Sofie Eriksson stepped into the bustling café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. As she waited in line, she couldn't help but think about her upcoming birthday. Thirty-five was looming, and she wasn't sure if she was ready to turn another year older.

As she ordered her usual coffee, a gentle voice interrupted her thoughts. "Sofie Eriksson? I've been looking for you."

She turned to see an old friend from college, Lena, waving at her with a warm smile. The two had lost touch after graduation but had reconnected on social media recently. Over the past few weeks, they'd been messaging nonstop, catching up on each other's lives.

Lena joined Sofie at the counter and they exchanged hugs. "It's so great to see you, Sofie Eriksson," Lena said, using Sofie's full name with a fondness that made Sofie blush.

Over steaming cups of coffee, they reminisced about old times and shared stories about their lives since graduation. Lena was working as a freelance writer, while Sofie had taken on a new role at her family's bakery. As they chatted, the café became less crowded, and the noise level dropped to a comfortable hum.

As they sipped their coffee, Lena broached the subject of birthdays. "You're having a big one soon, aren't you?" she asked with a mischievous glint in her eye.

Sofie nodded reluctantly, feeling a twinge of anxiety about turning thirty-five. She had never been one for celebrations or grand gestures but maybe this was the year to shake things up. Lena suggested they plan something together – a party, perhaps? Sofie hesitated, unsure if she was ready for that kind of attention.

Lena noticed her hesitation and placed a reassuring hand on her arm. "Whatever you want, Sofie Eriksson. No pressure at all."

The two friends spent the rest of their coffee break discussing everything from party ideas to old family recipes. As they parted ways outside the café, Lena handed Sofie a small gift – a handmade birthday card adorned with flowers and colorful doodles.

As she watched her friend disappear into the crowd, Sofie felt a spark of excitement ignite within her. Maybe this birthday would be different after all.
