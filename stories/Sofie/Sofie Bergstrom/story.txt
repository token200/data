One day, while examining the museum's collection, Sofie stumbled upon an obscure painting by a lesser-known artist named Carl Larsson.

The message revealed a shocking truth about Carl Larsson's personal life – one that challenged everything Sofie thought she knew about his art.

Overwhelmed with excitement and discovery, Sofie decided to share her findings with the museum staff and local historians. Together, they worked tirelessly to unravel the mysteries surrounding Larsson's painting. As news of their discovery spread, the small museum became a hub of activity, attracting scholars and enthusiasts from across the globe.
