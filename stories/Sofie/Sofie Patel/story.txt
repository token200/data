Sofie Leela Patel was a brilliant and ambitious young engineer who had always been passionate about sustainable energy solutions. Growing up in a low-income household, she saw firsthand the impact that renewable energy could have on her community's lives. After completing her degree in electrical engineering, Sofie landed an internship at a top tech firm, where she worked tirelessly to develop innovative solutions for off-grid communities.

One day, while working on a project with a team of developers, Sofie Leela Patel had an epiphany - what if they could create a portable solar panel that was not only affordable but also designed specifically for small-scale households?
