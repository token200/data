Veronique Balodis sat alone in her small apartment, staring blankly at the wall as she tried to shake off the feeling of emptiness that had been following her for weeks. A successful event planner by day, Veronique's life was one of precision and control - until her fianc√© broke up with her six months ago.

As she sipped her coffee, Veronique couldn't help but think about how far she had fallen. Just a year ago, she was the epitome of happiness, planning elaborate weddings for high-society clients and enjoying the adoration of her partner. But now, everything felt empty and hollow.

Veronique got up from her couch and began to pace around the room, trying to clear her head. She thought about all the things she had planned, all the events she had organized - but it wasn't enough anymore. The spark that once drove her passion for event planning was gone, leaving her feeling lost and unfulfilled.

As she walked over to the window, Veronique noticed a group of people gathered outside in the park. They were laughing and chatting, enjoying each other's company - something that made Veronique feel like she was missing out on. She thought about how much she used to love being around others, but now it felt like too much.

Feeling overwhelmed, Veronique decided to take a walk. She grabbed her coat and headed out into the crisp evening air. As she strolled through the park, she noticed a young couple sitting on a bench, holding hands and gazing into each other's eyes. Veronique watched them for a while, feeling a pang of nostalgia for what could have been.

Eventually, the couple got up and walked away, leaving Veronique to continue her solo journey. She walked for hours, trying to process her emotions and find a way to move forward. Eventually, she returned home, feeling a little more at peace with herself - but still unsure of what the future held for Veronique Balodis.
