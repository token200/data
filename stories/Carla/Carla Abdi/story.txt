Carla Abdi had always been an outsider. Growing up in the small town of Mogadishu, Somalia, she was the daughter of a Muslim taxi driver and a Christian nurse who met while working at the local hospital. As a result, Carla grew up speaking both Swahili and English, a trait that would later serve her well on her journey.

Despite the cultural differences in their home, Carla's parents instilled in her a strong sense of justice and compassion for others. They encouraged her to volunteer at the local orphanage, where she met many children who had lost loved ones to war and poverty.

As Carla grew older, she became increasingly restless. She felt an insatiable urge to leave Somalia and make a difference in the world. With a degree in international relations from a nearby university, she set out on a journey that would take her across continents.

Carla's travels took her to refugee camps in Kenya, where she witnessed firsthand the devastating effects of war on innocent civilians. She saw families torn apart by conflict, children orphaned by violence, and communities struggling to survive. The experiences left an indelible mark on Carla, fueling a desire to do something about it.

One day, while working at a refugee camp in Jordan, Carla met Amira, a young girl who had fled Somalia with her family after their home was destroyed in a bombing. Amira's eyes sparkled with tears as she told Carla about the struggles of living in exile, feeling disconnected from her community and culture.

Carla listened intently, her heart swelling with empathy. She realized that even the smallest acts of kindness could make a difference in someone's life. And so, she began to work tirelessly on behalf of refugees like Amira, advocating for their rights and providing support for those struggling to rebuild their lives.

Years later, Carla became a prominent voice for refugee rights, using her platform to raise awareness about the plight of displaced people around the world. Her story served as a testament to the power of compassion and determination in the face of adversity, inspiring countless others to follow in her footsteps.
