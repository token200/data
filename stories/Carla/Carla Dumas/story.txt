Carla Dumas stepped out of her small apartment, taking in the humid air of New Orleans. The scent of beignets and coffee wafted through the streets as she made her way to Café du Monde. She had always been drawn to the city's unique energy, its blend of jazz and voodoo that seemed to seep into every pore.

As a psychic medium, Carla had built a reputation for being one of the most sought-after in the city. People came from all over to seek her guidance, hoping to unravel the mysteries of their loved ones who had passed on. She listened intently to each story, her eyes closed as she allowed herself to tune into the otherworldly realm.

Tonight was no different. Carla sat at a small table near the door, sipping on a café au lait as she waited for her next client. A young woman with long, curly hair and bright green eyes walked in, looking every inch of the lost soul she claimed to be.

Carla smiled warmly as the girl took a seat across from her. "I've been getting some messages from someone who knows you," Carla began, setting down her cup. "They say their name is Pierre, and he's been trying to reach out to you for some time."

The girl's eyes widened in surprise. "That's my great-grandfather," she whispered.

Carla nodded, making a note on her pad. "He's telling me that he's proud of the path you've chosen, but there are still some decisions left to make. He wants you to know that life is precious, and every moment counts."

The girl listened intently as Carla continued to receive messages from Pierre. They spoke of love and loss, of choices made and roads not taken. As the readings progressed, Carla could feel Pierre's presence growing stronger.

Finally, with a final message delivered, Carla opened her eyes. The girl took a deep breath, looking around the café in awe. "Thank you," she said softly to Carla. "I needed that."

As the girl left, Carla stood up, taking one last sip of her coffee. She knew that the connection between this world and the other was fragile, but moments like these reminded her why she continued to do what she did – help people bridge the gap between the worlds of the living and the dead.

With a quiet smile, Carla slipped back into her apartment, the city's energy swirling around her as she settled in for another night of listening to the whispers from beyond.
