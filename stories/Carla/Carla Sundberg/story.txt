Carla Sundberg wiped the sweat from her forehead as she surveyed the chaotic scene before her. As the lead detective on the case, she had spent countless hours pouring over evidence and interviewing witnesses, but nothing seemed to be leading her anywhere.

The victim, a young woman named Emily, had been found dead in an alleyway with no signs of forced entry or struggle. The only clue was a small piece of paper left at the scene with a single word: "Mine".

Carla's eyes narrowed as she thought back to the previous night's interviews. She had spoken to several people who claimed to have seen something suspicious, but none of them seemed entirely trustworthy. She made a mental note to re-interview them, determined to get to the bottom of this case.

As she began to walk towards her office, her phone rang. It was Emily's best friend, Sarah, calling with some disturbing news. "Carla, I need to tell you something," Sarah said, her voice trembling. "I saw something last night that I'm not sure if I should be sharing."

Carla's instincts told her that this could be the break she had been waiting for. "Sarah, please tell me what happened," she urged.

Sarah hesitated before speaking up. "I saw someone arguing with Emily in the alleyway where she was found. It looked like they were saying something to each other, but I couldn't see who it was."

Carla's mind began racing as she processed this new information. This was getting interesting. She made a quick note on her pad and then headed back out into the fray.

With renewed determination, Carla set off to re-interview Sarah and track down the mysterious person from the alleyway. As she walked, she couldn't help but think of Emily's full name, Emily Jane Wilson - the victim who was now driving her to uncover the truth.

Carla Sundberg was on a mission, and nothing would get in her way.
