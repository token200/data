Carla Bąk's eyes scanned the dimly lit alleyway, her hand instinctively reaching for the small pouch at her waist. She had been warned not to come here alone, but she had to know the truth.

As a private investigator, Carla had seen her fair share of shady characters and clandestine meetings. But this was different. This was about someone from her own past, someone who claimed they had information that could change everything.

The voice behind her sent a shiver down her spine. "Carla Bąk?" it called out, the tone dripping with sarcasm.

She turned to face the figure emerging from the shadows. It was Krzysztof, an old acquaintance from her early days as a cop. He had been her partner, her friend, and then – something went terribly wrong.

"What do you want, Krys?" Carla asked, trying to keep her tone neutral.

"I know what happened to Anna," he said, his eyes locking onto hers with a mixture of guilt and desperation. "I can prove it."

Carla's heart skipped a beat. Anna was her younger sister, who had gone missing six years ago. The police had never found any leads, and Carla had spent countless hours searching for answers.

"Why now?" she asked, taking a step closer to Krzysztof.

He hesitated before answering, "I've been investigating some... irregularities in the force. I think someone is covering up something big."

Carla's mind was racing with possibilities. Was Krys telling the truth? And if he was, what did it have to do with Anna's disappearance?

She pulled out her phone and dialed a number, her eyes never leaving Krzysztof's face.

"I need to know more," she said into the receiver. "And I need you to meet me at the safe house in an hour."

As she listened to the response, Carla turned back to Krzysztof. "You have one chance to redeem yourself," she said, her voice firm but wary. "I'll listen, but if you're lying... you're dead."

Krzysztof nodded, a hint of relief on his face.

For a moment, Carla saw the old Krys, the friend and partner she had lost so long ago. But as quickly as it appeared, the illusion shattered, leaving her with more questions than answers.

The game was afoot once again, and Carla Bąk was ready to play.
