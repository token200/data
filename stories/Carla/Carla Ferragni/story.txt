Carla Ferragni was more than just a fashion influencer - she was an entrepreneur, a brand ambassador, and a style icon. Born to Italian parents in Turin, Italy, Carla's passion for fashion began at a young age. She grew up surrounded by the city's vibrant fashion scene, where she would spend hours exploring boutiques and markets.

After studying business at Politecnico di Milano, Carla launched her career as a fashion blogger, sharing her style and love of Italian fashion with the world. Her blog quickly gained popularity, and soon she was working with top brands and designers. She became known for her bold and eclectic sense of style, which blended high-end designer pieces with more affordable, everyday items.

As her influence grew, so did her business ventures. Carla launched several successful collaborations with luxury brands like Gucci and Prada, creating limited-edition collections that flew off the shelves. Her e-commerce platform, Ferragni Collection, also became a go-to destination for fashionistas looking for stylish and affordable clothing and accessories.

Despite her immense success, Carla remained humble and grounded. She was a devoted mother to her son, Leo, whom she shares with her husband, Jordan Bratman. Together, they made headlines for their high-profile romance and eventual wedding.

Carla's entrepreneurial spirit extended beyond fashion. In 2018, she co-founded Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), an Italian state-owned railway company that aimed to promote sustainable transportation. The move showcased Carla's commitment to social responsibility and her desire to use her platform to make a positive impact.

Throughout her career, Carla Ferragni has been recognized for her contributions to the fashion industry. She was named one of Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World and has received numerous awards for her business achievements. Her influence extends beyond the fashion world, as she inspires young women around the globe with her confidence, entrepreneurial spirit, and commitment to social responsibility.

As Carla continues to break barriers and push boundaries in the fashion industry, one thing remains constant - her passion for style, her love of Italy, and her dedication to making a difference. With her business ventures and philanthropic efforts, she solidifies her position as a true leader in the world of fashion.
