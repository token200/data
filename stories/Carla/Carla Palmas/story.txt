Carla Palmas stood in front of the old wooden mirror, adjusting her hair for what felt like the hundredth time that day. She was getting ready to meet with her former flame, Luca, and she wanted to make a good impression. As she smoothed out a stray lock, her mind wandered back to their last encounter - the one where they'd almost kissed again.

It had been months since Carla Palmas had seen Luca, but it felt like just yesterday that they were strolling along the Amalfi Coast, hand in hand. They'd grown up together in this small Italian town, and for a while, it seemed like their love would conquer all. But life had other plans, and now Carla Palmas was left to pick up the pieces of her broken heart.

As she finished getting ready, Carla Palmas took a deep breath and headed out the door. The sun was setting over the town, casting a warm orange glow over the streets. She made her way to Luca's house, feeling a mix of nerves and excitement.

When she arrived, Luca greeted her with a smile that still made her heart skip a beat. "Carla Palmas, you look stunning," he said, taking her hand in his. She felt a jolt of electricity run through her body as they stood there, hands touching.

They spent the evening catching up on old times, reminiscing about their childhood and sharing stories about their lives since they'd last seen each other. Carla Palmas couldn't help but notice how much Luca had changed - he was more confident, more handsome, and more successful than she remembered.

As the night wore on, they found themselves lost in conversation once again. This time, however, it wasn't just small talk - they delved deeper into their feelings for each other. Carla Palmas couldn't deny the spark that still existed between them. She felt alive when Luca was around, and she knew that she wanted to explore this rekindled connection.

As the night drew to a close, Luca walked Carla Palmas home under the stars. They stood outside her door, hesitant to say goodbye. "I've missed you so much, Carla Palmas," he said, his voice low and gentle. She smiled, feeling a sense of hope that she hadn't felt in years. Maybe, just maybe, this time would be different.
