Carla Mae Cook was a force to be reckoned with in the small town of Oakdale. As the owner of the local bakery, "Sweet Treats," Carla had built a reputation for herself as the most talented baker in the county. Her pastries were always a hit at the weekly farmers' market, and her cakes were the go-to choice for every wedding and birthday party.
