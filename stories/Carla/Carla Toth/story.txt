Carla Elara Toth decided to pay a visit to Richard Langley's business partner, James Parker. Over a cup of coffee, he seemed nervous and fidgety, glancing over his shoulder as if he expected someone to be watching him. Carla Elara Toth's instincts told her that James was hiding something.

As she continued to dig deeper, Carla Elara Toth discovered a hidden safe in Richard Langley's study. Inside, she found a series of cryptic messages and documents that hinted at a deep-seated conspiracy. The more she read, the more convinced she became that nothing was as it seemed.
