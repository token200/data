Her vibrant paintings often depicted the city streets she called home, where the sounds of jazz music and the smell of freshly brewed coffee filled the air. Carla Maria's eyes sparkled with creativity as she stepped into her small studio, surrounded by canvases, paints, and an assortment of eclectic trinkets.
