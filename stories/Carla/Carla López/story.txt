Carla López stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the quaint town of El Puerto. It was a place she hadn't set foot in since childhood, where summers were spent playing on the beach and exploring the winding streets with her abuela.

As she made her way through the quiet town, Carla couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her. She had left El Puerto years ago to pursue a career as a journalist, but now, at 35, she was back for one reason: to care for her ailing abuela.

Abuela Rosa had been the rock of their family, with a fierce spirit and a quick wit that could charm even the grumpiest of souls. But after a lifetime of love, laughter, and loss, Abuela Rosa's body was finally giving out.

Carla arrived at the small casa her parents had shared before moving away, and was greeted by Abuela Rosa's frail form, propped up on pillows in the living room. Carla rushed to hug her tight, tears welling up in her eyes as she took in the familiar scent of old books and cooking spices that filled the air.

"¿Cuánto tiempo tienes que quedarte?" Abuela Rosa croaked, her voice weak but full of love.

"I'll stay until you're feeling better," Carla promised, helping her grandmother adjust into a comfortable position on the couch. "We'll take things slow, okay?"

As the days passed, Carla settled into a routine of care and comfort. She brought in fresh flowers from the market, cooked Abuela Rosa's favorite meals, and helped with the household chores. But more than anything, she just sat by her grandmother's side, listening to tales of El Puerto's history, its secrets and stories that only Abuela Rosa knew.

As the sun dipped below the horizon each evening, Carla would help Abuela Rosa into bed, tucking in a blanket around her frail form. And as they whispered goodnight to each other, Carla felt the weight of their family's legacy settling onto her shoulders.

She was determined to be there for Abuela Rosa, not just as a daughter but as a guardian, keeping her grandmother's memories and stories safe until she could pass them on to another generation. In this quiet town, where time seemed to stand still, Carla López knew that she had found her true home – in the heart of El Puerto, with the woman who had always been her rock.
