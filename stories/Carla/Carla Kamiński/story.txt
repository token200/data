Carla Kamiński stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station with a mix of familiarity and unease. She had returned to Krakow, the city where she grew up, after years away in the United States.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Carla couldn't help but feel like a ghost from her past was still lurking around every corner. The memories she had tried so hard to forget seemed to seep out of every building and alleyway, haunting her with their presence.

Carla's eyes landed on a small café tucked away between two larger buildings. She hadn't been back in years, but the owner, Old Mr. Kowalski, still remembered her fondly. He had always taken a liking to Carla, and she knew he would welcome her with open arms.

She pushed open the door and was enveloped by the warm scent of freshly brewed coffee and baked goods. Mr. Kowalski looked up from behind the counter, his eyes twinkling with recognition.

"Carla! Córka moja!" he exclaimed, using the Polish term for "my daughter." Carla's cheeks flushed as she smiled and took a seat at the small table by the window.

Over steaming cups of coffee, Mr. Kowalski filled Carla in on the latest news from Krakow. She listened intently, feeling like she was finally reconnecting with her roots.

As they chatted, a figure caught Carla's eye outside the café window. A tall, dark-haired man stood standing by the sidewalk, watching her with an intensity that made her skin prickle. She felt a jolt of recognition, but couldn't quite place him.

When she finally worked up the courage to ask Mr. Kowalski about the stranger, he leaned in close and whispered, "Ah, that's Jakub – your...ex-boyfriend."

Carla's eyes widened in shock as memories came flooding back. The summer they had spent together in Krakow, the laughter, the adventures, the heartbreak. It all came rushing back like a tidal wave.

With a heavy sigh, Carla pushed her chair back from the table and stood up, ready to face whatever lay ahead. She walked out of the café, into the bright sunlight, with a sense that she was finally coming home – but not just to Krakow, but to herself, too.
