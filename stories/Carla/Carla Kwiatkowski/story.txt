One day, Carla Kwiatkowski received a call from a local non-profit organization that specialized in representing low-income families in court.

The corporation was forced to cease its evictions and work with the non-profit organization to find alternative solutions for the affected families. As news of her win spread, Carla Kwiatkowski became an even more respected figure in the community, known for her unwavering commitment to justice.
