Carla Junko was a woman of mystery, with piercing green eyes that seemed to hold a thousand secrets. Her dark hair was always styled in a sleek bob, and her sharp jawline gave her an air of confidence that was hard to ignore.

A former spy, Carla had spent years working for a top-secret government agency, taking on high-stakes missions and consistently delivering results. But after a particularly grueling assignment left her feeling burnt out, she decided it was time to retire from the game.

These days, Carla ran a small boutique hotel in the heart of Tokyo, where she could indulge in her passion for art and design without the pressures of espionage weighing her down. Her guests adored her warm hospitality and keen eye for detail, which she reserved for everything from vintage teapots to cutting-edge kitchen appliances.

One evening, as Carla was closing up shop, a quiet, bespectacled man slipped into her lobby, his eyes scanning the space as if searching for something. She watched him with interest, recognizing the subtle tension in his shoulders and the way he seemed to be waiting for someone – or something.

Without hesitation, Carla summoned the barista from the lounge next door and handed over a small tray of snacks and drinks. "For our new friend," she said with a sly smile.

The man's eyes widened as he accepted the offering, and for a moment, Carla saw a flicker of recognition in his gaze. It was a fleeting glance, but one that told her he had done this before – or at least, knew what it meant to be someone she couldn't trust.

As the evening wore on and the man gradually relaxed, Carla made small talk with him, probing gently for information without making it too obvious. She discovered his name was Kenji – a freelance journalist working on a big story – but refused to reveal her own identity or motivations.

For now, at least, Carla's hotel remained a haven from the shadows of her past, where she could enjoy simple pleasures and offer shelter to those who stumbled into her domain.
