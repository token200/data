Hanna Petrov stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. It had been years since she'd last set foot in Ravensburg, and yet the familiar chill that ran down her spine was still unmistakable.

As a child, Hanna had spent summers at her grandparents' old cottage on the outskirts of town, exploring the dense forests and lazy streams with an unbridled sense of freedom. But life had taken its toll – her parents had passed away in a tragic accident when she was just a teenager, and her grandmother had vanished into obscurity shortly after.

Now, at 25, Hanna had returned to Ravensburg for reasons both practical and personal. She'd inherited the old cottage from her grandmother's estate, and it seemed like an opportunity too good to pass up. The town was quiet and grey, but there was a stubborn beauty to it that drew her in.

As she made her way through the station, Hanna noticed the locals watching her – curious, perhaps even wary. In Ravensburg, people didn't take kindly to outsiders. But Hanna had grown accustomed to being an outsider herself, ever since the accident took her parents from her.

She hailed a taxi and gave the driver directions to her grandparents' old cottage. The ride was silent, save for the soft rustle of leaves outside. When they pulled up, Hanna felt a pang in her chest – it looked exactly as she remembered it, the wind-shattered windows and rusty gate all still intact.

For a moment, she hesitated on the porch, feeling the weight of years of memories bearing down on her. The wind picked up, whipping the leaves into a frenzy, and Hanna took a deep breath. It was time to face whatever had brought her back to Ravensburg – to face herself, really.

As she stepped inside the creaking door, a faint scent of pipe smoke wafted out from the kitchen. Hanna smiled wryly to herself – it sounded like someone else lived here now too. She set down her suitcase and walked into the unknown, the silence swallowed by the familiar rhythms of home.
