Closing her eyes, she focused all her energy on the question: "Where is my sister?" The air seemed to thicken, charged with an electric anticipation.

Suddenly, a gust of wind swept through the room, extinguishing the candles and sending shivers down Hanna's spine. In the silence that followed, a faint whisper echoed in her mind: "Follow the river." With newfound determination, Hanna rose from her chair, resolved to uncover the truth about Sophia's sister.
