Hanna Wisniewski stepped into the dimly lit café, scanning the room for a familiar face. As a freelance journalist, she had grown accustomed to working on her own, but sometimes it was nice to have someone to share a cup of coffee with.

She spotted him in the corner, nursing a coffee and staring intently at his laptop screen. Hanna smiled to herself as she made her way over to join him. She slid into the booth across from him, signaling for the barista to bring them another round.

"So, what's new?" Hanna asked, pulling out her notebook and pen. Her eyes met those of her friend and occasional research assistant, Alex.

"Just working on a piece about local politics," Alex replied, not looking up from his screen. "I'm trying to get a handle on the recent scandal."

Hanna nodded sympathetically. She had been covering this story herself, but sometimes it was nice to have someone else's perspective. As she scribbled notes in her book, she asked, "Do you think we're missing anything?"

Alex shook his head. "I've got all the angles covered. I just need some background info on the mayor."

Hanna nodded, jotting down a few quick notes. She had interviewed the mayor once before, but something about this story didn't sit right with her. As she sipped her coffee, she decided to dig deeper.

"Alex, can you dig up any dirt on the mayor's personal life?" Hanna asked, leaning in slightly.

Alex raised an eyebrow, impressed by Hanna's sudden interest. "You're thinking of going after him hard?"

Hanna grinned mischievously. "I'm always thinking of going after someone hard. Especially when it comes to exposing corruption."

With renewed determination, Hanna and Alex set to work on uncovering the truth behind the scandal, determined to get to the bottom of things.

As they worked, Hanna couldn't help but feel grateful for her friend's help – even if he did sometimes drive her crazy. She leaned back in her seat, a smile spreading across her face as she contemplated the story unfolding before them.
