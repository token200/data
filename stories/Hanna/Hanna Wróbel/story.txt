Hanna Wr√≥bel stood at the edge of the worn wooden pier, gazing out at the vast expanse of water that stretched before her. The wind whipped her dark hair into a frenzy as she breathed in the salty air, feeling the familiar mix of sadness and peace wash over her.

It had been three years since Hanna's mother passed away, leaving behind only memories and the small, weathered cottage by the lake. The cottage, once filled with laughter and warmth, now stood empty and still, a haunting reminder of all that she had lost.

Hanna's thoughts turned to her childhood days spent exploring these same waters with her mother, collecting shells and watching the fish swim beneath the surface. Her mother had taught her how to identify the different species, and how to respect the delicate balance of the ecosystem.

As Hanna stood there, a faint glimmer caught her eye. A small wooden boat, half-hidden among the reeds, was bobbing gently on the waves. She remembered this old boat, one that had been left behind by her father, who had long since moved away to chase his dreams.

Without hesitation, Hanna began to walk along the shoreline, following the familiar path to the old dock. She lifted the wooden hull, and a small note slipped from beneath it, carried on the breeze. The note was scribbled with a few hasty words: "For Hanna, always remember, we're all here in the water".

A wave of emotion washed over her as she read the note, knowing that her mother had written those words just before she passed away. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes, and for a moment, Hanna felt like she was back in those early days by the lake, surrounded by the love and laughter of her family.

She folded the note, tucking it into her pocket, and took a deep breath. The wind still howled through the reeds, but now it carried a different tone - one of comfort, rather than sadness. Hanna smiled softly to herself, knowing that she was not alone. Her mother's spirit was out there with her, in every wave, in every shell.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow across the water, Hanna made her decision. She would restore the old boat to its former glory, and spend her days exploring these waters once more. The memories of her childhood would remain, but she knew that new ones were waiting for her on the horizon - stories of adventure, of love, and of the unwavering connection between a girl and the water.
