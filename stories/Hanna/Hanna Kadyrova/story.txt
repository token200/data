Hanna Kadyrova stepped out of her small apartment and onto the bustling streets of Moscow. As a young journalist, she had seen it all - from the gleaming skyscrapers to the dark alleys that seemed to swallow hope whole. But there was one story that still lingered in her mind, a story that drove her every move.

It was about a small child named Sasha, who had gone missing three years ago during a protest against the corrupt government. Hanna had been investigating the case at first, but it had become so personal that she couldn't just drop it. The authorities had given up on finding the little boy, and his family had all but lost hope.

Hanna knew that Moscow was a city of secrets, where people's faces were always hidden behind masks of politeness. But tonight, she felt like one face in particular was worth uncovering - that of Sasha's killer.

She walked down to the small caf√© on the corner, where an informant had agreed to meet her. The man, known only as "Vladimir", looked nervous as he handed her a crumpled piece of paper. On it was an address - a run-down warehouse on the outskirts of town.

"This is it," Vladimir said, before quickly disappearing into the crowd. Hanna watched him go, her heart racing with anticipation.

She made her way to the warehouse, her footsteps echoing off the walls as she approached the door. She hesitated for a moment, wondering if she should be doing this - but something about the address seemed too right to ignore.

Hanna took a deep breath and pushed open the creaking door. Inside, she found herself in a dimly lit room filled with dusty boxes and broken furniture. And then, she saw him - an old man with sunken eyes and a face that seemed to hold a thousand secrets.

"You're here about Sasha," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Hanna nodded, her eyes locked on the old man's face. "I want to know what happened to him."

The old man leaned forward, a small smile playing on his lips. "He was just a pawn in a game much bigger than you can imagine. A game of power and corruption that goes all the way to the top."

Hanna's eyes narrowed as she listened, her mind racing with the implications. She knew that this story would change everything - but she also knew that it came at a great cost.
