Hanna Lin walked into the small café, scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Rachel, sitting by the window, sipping on a cup of coffee. Hanna joined her, taking a seat across from Rachel.

"Hey, Rach," Hanna Lin said, as she always did, giving her friend a warm smile.

Rachel looked up, "Hey, Hana! Long time no see." The two friends had been inseparable since childhood, and despite going to different colleges, they managed to stay close. Now, in their late twenties, they were navigating the ups and downs of adult life together.

As they chatted, Hanna Lin pulled out her phone and scrolled through old photos. She found a picture from their college days, taken during a group trip to the beach. In it, she was standing next to Rachel, both grinning from ear to ear. "Remember that summer?" Hanna Lin asked, chuckling.

Rachel laughed, "How could I forget? You two were inseparable back then." The three of them had shared countless memories together – late-night conversations, road trips, and silly pranks. It was a special bond that only grew stronger with time.

As they sipped their coffee, Hanna Lin realized she had been feeling lost lately. Her job as an artist wasn't taking off like she had hoped, and her personal life was a jumbled mess of relationships and self-doubt. Rachel noticed the change in her friend's demeanor and reached out, taking Hanna Lin's hand.

"Hey, Hana? What's going on?" Rachel asked softly.

Hanna Lin looked up, tears welling up in her eyes. "I just feel so lost, Rach. I don't know who I am or what I want anymore." Rachel listened attentively, offering words of comfort and reassurance.

In that moment, Hanna Lin felt a weight lift off her shoulders. She knew she wasn't alone, and with friends like Rachel by her side, she could face anything life threw their way. As they finished their coffee and parted ways, Hanna Lin smiled to herself, feeling grateful for the unbreakable bond between her and Rachel – a friendship that would last a lifetime.
