Hanna Horvath sat in her small apartment, staring blankly at the wall as she tried to muster up the energy to do anything but stare. It had been weeks since she'd last left her place, and the isolation was starting to take its toll.

She thought back to when she was first coming into her own, full of fire and determination to make a name for herself in the art world. Hanna Horvath was on top of the world, or so it seemed. But after the death of her mother, everything changed. Her relationship with her brother, Josh, became strained, and her creative spark began to fade.

As she gazed around her cluttered apartment, Hanna couldn't help but feel a sense of stagnation. She had all the materials she needed right there, but she just couldn't seem to find the motivation to create anything new.

Just then, her phone buzzed with an incoming text from Josh. "Hey, can we talk?" he asked. Hanna hesitated for a moment before responding. She knew that Josh was struggling too, and maybe this conversation could be exactly what both of them needed.

They met at a small coffee shop on the outskirts of town, sitting down at a table in the back. The tension between them was palpable, but as they began to talk, Hanna started to see the vulnerability behind her brother's facade. They discussed everything from their art to their personal struggles, and for the first time in months, Hanna felt like she was really connecting with someone.

As they parted ways, Hanna Horvath felt a glimmer of hope that she hadn't felt in a long time. Maybe, just maybe, she could start creating again, not just as an artist but also as a person. The thought filled her with excitement and anticipation for what the future might hold. With renewed energy, Hanna made a promise to herself: she would get back up and try again, no matter how hard it got.
