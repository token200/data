Rumors claimed that Hanna Claudius Nero had once infiltrated the palace of Emperor Claudius himself, snatching a priceless gemstone right from beneath his nose.

The sharp lines of her face, the mischievous glint in her eye, and the jet-black locks that cascaded down her back left an indelible mark on Lucius's mind.

Though he vowed to track her down, Hanna Claudius Nero remained one step ahead. She vanished into the night, leaving behind only a trail of breadcrumbs for those brave enough to follow. As the years went by, the whispers about Hanna Claudius Nero only grew louder, fueling an obsession that would haunt Rome for generations to come.

In the shadows, she watched and waited, her name etched into the annals of history as one of the greatest thieves the world had ever known.
