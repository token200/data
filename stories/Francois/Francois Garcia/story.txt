Francois Garcia stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the small town of Ashwood. It was a place he had called home for most of his life, where the streets were lined with old oak trees and the air was sweet with the scent of blooming lilacs.

As he made his way through the quiet streets, Francois couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. He had grown up in this very town, exploring its hidden corners and making friends with the locals. But after high school, Francois had left to pursue bigger dreams, chasing opportunities in the city that lay beyond Ashwood's borders.

Years later, Francois found himself back in his hometown, returning after a decade away. He had come to scatter the ashes of his grandmother, who had passed away just a few weeks prior. The ceremony would be held at the family farm, where Francois and his sister had spent countless hours playing as children.

As he walked through the fields, Francois couldn't help but notice the changes that time had brought. The farm was still beautiful, but it showed signs of aging - the paint on the old barn was chipped, and the grass was longer than he remembered. Despite the wear and tear, however, the farm still felt like home.

Francois's sister, Sophie, greeted him with a warm hug at the doorstep of the farmhouse. "It's so good to have you back," she said, her voice trembling slightly. Francois hugged her back, feeling a sense of comfort and familiarity wash over him. "I've missed this place," he admitted.

Together, they worked through the afternoon, preparing for the ceremony. As the sun began to set, Francois took his place alongside Sophie at the gravesite, holding a small wooden box containing his grandmother's ashes. With a deep breath, he let the wind carry them away, feeling a sense of peace settle over him. It was a moment of closure, and Francois knew that his grandmother would always be with him, no matter where life took him next.
