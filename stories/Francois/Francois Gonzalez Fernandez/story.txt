The scout was blown away by Francois's raw talent and charisma, and soon offered him a record deal. Francois Gonzalez Fernandez found himself on the road to stardom, releasing album after album that showcased his unique blend of folk, rock, and Latin rhythms.

Despite his rapid rise to fame, Francois remained true to his roots. He continued to write songs about love, loss, and social justice, drawing inspiration from his hometown and its people. His music resonated with listeners from all walks of life, who appreciated his authenticity and commitment to telling stories that needed to be told.

He used his platform to promote emerging talent and support initiatives that promoted arts education and community development.
