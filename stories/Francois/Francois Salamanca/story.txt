Francois Henri Lepic-Salamanca sat in his plush office chair, gazing out at the Manhattan skyline. As the self-proclaimed "Kingpin" of the city's underworld, he had built an empire of respect and fear. His piercing blue eyes seemed to bore into the souls of those around him, as if daring them to cross him.

A knock at the door interrupted his reverie. "Enter," he rasped, his voice like gravel beneath a smooth veneer.

His right-hand man, Hector Salamanca, walked in with a hint of a bow. "Your Highness, we have a problem."

Francois' gaze snapped to attention. "Explain."

"It seems one of our rivals, the Esposito family, has been making overtures towards your territory." Hector reported, his tone measured.

Francois' expression turned cold, like ice formed on a winter's night. He drummed his fingers on the armrest, his eyes never leaving Hector's face. "I want them neutralized. Now."

Hector nodded and left to carry out the order.

As he waited for Hector to return with news, Francois pondered his next move. His rise to power had not been an easy one, forged from years of hard-won battles and calculated risks. But beneath his polished exterior, a fire burned â€“ a flame that would consume anyone who dared challenge him.

The door opened once more, this time with Hector returning bearing news. "The Espositos have made their move," he reported flatly. Francois' eyes gleamed like stars in the dark as he listened to Hector's account of the skirmish and the subsequent defeat.

Francois Lepic-Salamanca stood up from his chair, a master strategist once more. His reputation for ruthlessness had grown throughout the years, but few dared test its limits. Tonight, Francois Salamanca would walk among the shadows, waiting to see who would dare challenge him next.

With a quiet smile, he vanished into the night, leaving those in his path with only whispers of his name: "Francois Henri Lepic-Salamanca."
