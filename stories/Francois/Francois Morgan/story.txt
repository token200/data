Francois Morgan stepped into the dimly lit jazz club, his eyes scanning the crowded room for a familiar face. As he made his way through the sea of patrons, his gaze landed on a figure sitting alone at the bar - his old friend and saxophonist, Lena Lee.

Lena looked up as Francois approached, a hint of a smile playing on her lips. "Francois Morgan, I should have known you'd show up eventually," she said, her voice husky from years of smoking.

Francois chuckled, sliding onto the stool beside her. "Hey, someone's got to keep the joint alive around here." He signaled the bartender for a whiskey on the rocks, his eyes never leaving Lena's face.

As they sipped their drinks in silence, Francois couldn't help but think about the journey that had brought him to this place. From his rough-and-tumble childhood on the streets of New Orleans to his days as a struggling musician in the city's underbelly, Francois Morgan had seen it all.

But tonight, he was here with Lena, sharing stories and laughter like old times. They talked about everything and nothing - music, politics, and their latest romantic misadventures. Francois Morgan felt like himself again, unshackled from the burdens of adulthood and free to simply enjoy life.

As the night wore on, the band took the stage, launching into a sultry rendition of Coltrane's "My Favorite Things." Francois and Lena sat back, closing their eyes as the music washed over them. The saxophone's mournful melody seemed to speak directly to Francois Morgan's soul, reminding him that even in the darkest moments, there was always beauty to be found.

As the final notes faded away, Francois turned to Lena with a grin. "You know, for an old man like me, I'm still feeling pretty alive." Lena raised an eyebrow, a mischievous glint in her eye. "I think that's what makes you so lovable, Francois Morgan."

The night wore on, filled with laughter and music, as these two old friends reveled in each other's company. And Francois Morgan knew, for one fleeting moment, that he was exactly where he belonged.
