The evening's festivities concluded with an impromptu performance by a local musician. The music wove in and out of the warehouse's soundscape, echoing off the walls as Clément Xia took to the stage. He began to recite a poem he had written, its words flowing like a river, carrying the listener on a journey of self-discovery.

As the night drew to a close, Sophie approached Clément, her eyes shining with excitement. "Your words are like nothing I've ever heard," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.
