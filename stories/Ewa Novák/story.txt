Eva Novak was known for her fierce determination and quick wit. As a young journalist, she had already made a name for herself in Prague's vibrant media scene by breaking some of the biggest scoops. Her sharp eyes and sharp tongue had earned her both respect and fear from her colleagues.

One day, Eva received a cryptic message from an anonymous source claiming to have information about a high-ranking government official involved in embezzlement. The message read: "Meet me at the old windmill on the outskirts of town at midnight if you want the truth."

Eva was intrigued and decided to take on the challenge. She arrived at the windmill just before midnight, her heart racing with anticipation. As she stepped out of the car, a figure emerged from the shadows.

It was a woman, dressed in dark clothing and sunglasses. "Who are you?" Eva asked gruffly.

"My name is not important," the woman replied. "But I'm willing to give you something that could bring down an entire government department."

Eva's eyes narrowed as she pulled out her recorder. "What do you have?"

The woman hesitated before producing a small USB drive from her pocket. "This contains evidence of widespread corruption and embezzlement by high-ranking officials. But I need to be sure it gets to the right people."

Eva's mind was racing with possibilities. She knew that if she could get this information into the public domain, it would shake the very foundations of Prague's government.

"I'll take care of it," Eva said, tucking the USB drive into her bag. "But I need your name and contact details for further verification."

The woman smiled, a hint of mischief in her eyes. "I'll give you my email address, but be warned: if anyone finds out who I am, it's game over."

Eva nodded and pulled out her phone to write down the email address. As she did, she noticed that the woman was checking her watch.

"Time's up," Eva said quickly. "What do I need to do?"

The woman leaned in close. "Just drop by the old bakery on Riegrova Street tomorrow at 2 PM. I'll be there, and we can finalize the deal."

With that, she turned and disappeared into the darkness, leaving Eva staring after her in confusion.

Eva didn't sleep much that night, thinking about the implications of what she had just overheard. She arrived at the bakery the next day, her heart pounding with excitement.

As she entered the dimly lit bakery, she spotted a familiar face - it was a colleague from the newspaper who had been quietly investigating some shady dealings on their own.

"Looks like we've got more than one source now," Eva whispered, a grin spreading across her face.
