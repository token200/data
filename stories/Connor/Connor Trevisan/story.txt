Connor Trevisan stepped into the crowded café, scanning the room for his friend Alex. They had planned to meet here an hour ago, and he was starting to get worried that something had come up. As he waited, he sipped on a lukewarm coffee, feeling a pang of frustration.

Just as he was about to give up, Alex spotted him across the room and waved enthusiastically. Connor made his way over, exchanging warm smiles with the regulars as he went. "Hey, sorry I'm late," Alex said, plopping down in the chair opposite Connor.

"No worries, just getting a caffeine boost," Connor replied, grinning wryly. They ordered a pair of new-fangled iced lattes and settled in for a catching-up session.

As they chatted, Connor couldn't help but feel grateful for this chance to spend time with his best friend. It had been a tough few months – Connor Trevisan had just landed a high-profile project at work, which meant countless late nights and weekends spent staring at spreadsheets. But Alex was always there to provide a much-needed respite.

The conversation flowed easily, covering everything from their latest video game obsessions to their shared love of hiking on the weekends. As they laughed and joked, Connor felt his stress melting away, replaced by a sense of contentment he hadn't experienced in ages.

Just as they were getting into the meat of their discussion – Alex was determined to convince Connor to join him for a road trip to visit their favorite music festival – the café started filling up with new patrons. The atmosphere shifted, becoming more lively and rowdy. Connor Trevisan's thoughts turned back to his own projects, reminding him that there was still work to be done.

With a sigh, he refocused on Alex, smiling as his friend caught him eyeing his watch. "Alright, alright – just one more minute," Alex said, holding up a hand. They settled in for what promised to be an epic late-night chat, the city hum outside providing a soothing background melody to their friendly banter.
