Connor Zieliński stepped into the dimly lit alley, his eyes scanning the rooftops for any sign of movement. As a private investigator with a penchant for the unknown, he had been hired by a mysterious client to look into a string of disappearances in the city.

The victim's names were all over the local news: Sarah Jenkins, 25; Emily Lee, 28; and Jack Harris, 32. Each one had vanished without a trace, leaving behind only cryptic messages on their phones.

Connor lit a cigarette and took a long drag, his mind racing with possibilities. He had heard rumors of a secret organization operating in the shadows, one that seemed to be connected to the disappearances. But he needed concrete evidence before he could start chasing down leads.

As he turned to leave, he noticed a piece of paper stuck between two dumpster lids. He pulled it out and examined it closely. It was a single sentence, scrawled in red ink: "The shadows are where you find me."

Connor's eyes narrowed as he tucked the note into his pocket. This was getting interesting. He made a mental note to look into any local connections between the victims.

He headed back to his office, a small room above a rundown bar on 5th Street. The sign outside read "Zieliński Investigations." Connor smiled wryly - it was a bit of an understatement, but he liked the way it sounded.

As he settled into his chair, Connor's phone rang. It was his client, a sultry voice on the other end asking if he'd found anything yet. Connor hesitated before responding, unsure of how much to reveal.

"Let's just say I've got some leads," he said, trying to keep the tone casual. "But I need you to come in for a meeting tomorrow and discuss the details."

There was a pause on the other end of the line before the voice spoke up again. "I'll be there, Connor. But be careful. You're getting close to something big."

Connor felt a shiver run down his spine as he hung up the phone. He knew that look - it was the same one he'd seen in the eyes of those who had vanished. And he was determined to uncover whatever secrets lay hidden in the shadows.

The case was about to get a lot more complicated.
