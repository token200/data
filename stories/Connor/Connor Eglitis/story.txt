Connor Eglitis stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, his eyes scanning the crowded street market for any sign of trouble. As a private investigator with a talent for sniffing out secrets, he had been hired by a wealthy businessman to investigate a string of missing people.

A tall, lanky figure emerged from the shadows, dressed in a long coat that billowed behind him like a dark cloud. "Connor Eglitis," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "I've heard a lot about you."

Connor's eyes narrowed as he sized up the stranger. He was a man with a face like worn leather and an air of quiet confidence that made Connor's instincts sit up straight. "And who might you be?" he asked, his hand resting on the grip of his gun.

"My name is Victor LaGrange," the man replied, offering a small smile. "I have information about your client. Information that could change everything."

Connor's curiosity was piqued. He nodded for Victor to continue, and the two of them stepped into a nearby caf√©, away from prying ears. Victor pulled out a small folder filled with documents and photographs.

"These are people who went missing several weeks ago," he explained. "They all have one thing in common: they were last seen near your client's business ventures."

Connor's eyes scanned the contents of the folder, his mind racing with connections. He had suspected that something fishy was going on, but this was more than he had initially thought.

"This is big," Connor said, his voice barely above a whisper. "I think I need to get back to my client and see what he has to say about all of this."

Victor nodded, his eyes locked on Connor's. "Be careful, Eglitis. You're playing with fire here."
