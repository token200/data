Connor Andersen trudged through the dense forest, his boots crunching on the underbrush. As a park ranger, he knew these woods like the back of his hand, but today's mission was personal.

Connor's sister, Emma, had gone missing three days ago while hiking in this very forest. The authorities had given up searching, and Connor felt responsible for not being able to find her sooner. He had been out here every day since her disappearance, scouring the trails and talking to locals, but so far, nothing.

As he walked, the trees seemed to close in around him, their branches tangling together like skeletal fingers. Connor's mind was consumed by memories of Emma: her bright smile, her infectious laugh, her love of hiking and adventure. He had always been close to her, and his failure to protect her now weighed heavily on his conscience.

Suddenly, Connor heard a faint noise behind him. He turned, his heart racing, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Shrugging it off, he continued on his way.

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the forest floor, Connor stumbled upon an old, weathered cabin. It was hidden away from view, tucked between two massive trees, and looked like it hadn't been used in years.

Connor's gut told him this was where Emma had ended up. He approached the cabin cautiously, calling out her name softly into the silence. There was no response.

With a surge of determination, Connor pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside. The air was thick with dust and decay, but he didn't care. He had to know what had happened to his sister.

As his eyes adjusted to the darkness, Connor saw a figure huddled in the corner of the cabin. It was Emma, her eyes sunken, her skin pale. But as Connor rushed to her side, she looked up at him with a faint smile.

"Connor," she whispered, her voice barely audible.

With tears streaming down his face, Connor knelt beside his sister and held her close. "I'm here, Emma," he said, his voice shaking with relief. "I'll never let you go again."

Together, they would find their way out of this darkness, side by side, just like always.
