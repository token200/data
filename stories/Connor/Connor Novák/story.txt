Connor Novák stepped out of the small café and onto the rainy streets of New Haven. His eyes scanned the crowded sidewalks, searching for a familiar face – or one that he hoped would be familiar.

It had been five years since his father's disappearance, leaving behind only a cryptic message scrawled on Connor's bedroom mirror: "The truth is in the city." Since then, Connor had dedicated his life to unraveling the mystery. His search had led him down countless dark alleys and through crumbling buildings, each new discovery bringing him closer – or further away.

Tonight was no different. A whispered tip about a local gang's involvement with an underground crime lord had brought Connor to this dingy neighborhood. He tucked his hair into his cap and set off, the rain-soaked streets mirroring his mood.

As he turned down alley after alley, Connor noticed something peculiar: each graffiti tag displayed a small variation of a symbol – an insignia that seemed eerily similar to his father's old watch. The markling in his mind grew stronger with every step; it was as if the universe itself was pushing him toward this hidden truth.

Finally, he found himself standing before a dilapidated warehouse on 33rd Street. Flickering fluorescent lights cast an ominous glow through the grimy windows. With each cautious breath, Connor's hand hovered over his pocket – the one containing a small notebook page with the same symbol his father had given him years ago.

Without hesitation, Connor entered the dimly lit building and began to explore. Stained by the flickering light, every movement seemed as if through quicksand – slow, heavy steps echoed off concrete walls. The smell of smoke hung in thick coils, masking a stench that might have driven lesser men mad.

He found the crime lord's lieutenant huddled over a table littered with scattered documents and gold coins. Connor recognized none of it – his father had always warned him against being blinded by material wealth or temporary gains. These pieces didn't fit into his vision; they were but parts of the intricate puzzle, not its answer.

"Tell me," Connor demanded, a low voice cutting through the air. "Where is he? Where's Dad?"

A cold smile crept onto the lieutenant's face before spreading to reveal jagged lines on an otherwise smooth surface – one that seemed eerily familiar to Connor. It was as if his heart had finally found its home – or perhaps a glimpse of the truth it had been searching for years.

"Maybe," the lieutenant said, her voice low and hypnotic, "you should be looking in the mirror."
