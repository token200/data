Connor Valja sat alone in his dimly lit room, staring blankly at the wall as the fluorescent lights hummed above him. His eyes wandered to the old photograph on the nightstand, a faded image of himself as a child with his parents and younger sister. He couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia wash over him.

Connor Valja was never one for sentimental feelings, though. As he grew older, he became increasingly withdrawn, shutting out the world around him to protect himself from getting hurt again. His parents had always been supportive, but they struggled to understand their son's need for isolation.

A faint knock at the door broke the silence, and Connor Valja reluctantly got up to answer it. It was his sister, Emily, looking worried and out of breath. "Connor, I've been trying to reach you all day," she said, her voice laced with concern. "I found a letter in my room, written by Mom and Dad. They're planning to sell the house."

Connor Valja's expression remained stoic, but his mind was racing. He had always known that their parents' plans were being put on hold, waiting for him to return home and sort out his life. But he had never thought it would happen so soon.

Without a word, Connor Valja turned and walked back into the room, leaving Emily standing in the doorway. She looked at her brother with pleading eyes, but Connor Valja just shook his head before sitting back down on the bed. He knew that some things were better left unspoken, and he wasn't about to let his sister get involved in his business.

As the hours passed, Connor Valja's mind continued to wander, weighing the pros and cons of facing his past and moving forward with his life. Would he be able to overcome his fears and find a way to reconnect with the world outside these walls? Or would he remain trapped in this limbo forever? The uncertainty hung over him like a shadow, but Connor Valja knew that he had to try.
