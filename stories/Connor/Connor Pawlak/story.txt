Connor Pawlak sat at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of papers in front of him. As the newest member of the Justice League, he felt like an imposter, always living in the shadow of the seasoned heroes who had come before him.

He was a teenager from Smallville, Kansas, who had been chosen by Superman to be his protégé after the Man of Steel's own origin story came to an end. It was a big responsibility, and one that Connor felt he was still getting used to.

Just as he was starting to get frustrated with himself, his comms device beeped. "Connor, we have a situation in Gotham City," Alfred Pennyworth said, his voice calm and collected.

Connor sprang into action, grabbing his gear and meeting up with Superman, Wonder Woman, and the Flash at the Justice League headquarters. They arrived in Gotham just as the Dark Knight was battling a group of heavily armed thugs.

As they jumped into the fray, Connor couldn't help but feel a little overwhelmed. There were so many people to protect, and not enough time to do it all. But Superman took him under his wing, showing him how to use his powers to their fullest potential.

The battle was intense, with punches flying and explosions rocking the streets of Gotham. Connor found himself facing off against one of the thugs, a giant of a man wielding a massive bat-shaped club.

With a burst of confidence, Connor used his agility and quick thinking to dodge the blows and disarm his opponent. The crowd cheered as he emerged victorious, and Superman patted him on the back.

"You're doing great, kid," Superman said. "Remember, we're a team. We work together, support each other, and protect the innocent."

Connor smiled, feeling a sense of belonging that he hadn't felt before. He realized that being part of the Justice League wasn't just about saving the world - it was also about supporting his fellow heroes.

As the night drew to a close, Connor walked back to Superman's side, feeling more confident and capable than ever before. "Thanks for the advice," he said. "I won't forget it."

Superman smiled back at him. "You're one of us now, Connor. We're in this together."
