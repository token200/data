Connor Askarov trudged through the snowy streets, his eyes scanning the frozen sidewalks for any sign of life. As a detective with the NYPD, he had seen it all – from the bright lights of Manhattan to the dark alleys of Brooklyn. But tonight, something felt off.

It started when a call came in about a young woman found dead on the waterfront. No ID, no witnesses, just a body with a single word scrawled on her forehead: "Echo".

Connor's gut told him this was more than just a random victim. He spent the next few hours poring over the evidence, talking to witnesses, and following leads that led nowhere. The more he dug, the more convinced he became that Echo was connected to an old case from his past.

As a rookie detective, Connor had worked on a string of murders in Queens, each one linked to a mysterious figure known only as "The Architect". He had never caught a break, and the case still lingered in his mind like an open wound. Now, it seemed, The Architect was back.

Connor arrived at the crime scene just as the sun began to rise over the Hudson River. The air was crisp and cold, carrying the scent of saltwater and decay. He knelt beside Echo's body, taking a moment to commit her face to memory. She was young, maybe early twenties, with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair.

He stood up, his mind racing with possibilities. Who was Echo? What did The Architect want from her? And what did this word on her forehead mean?

As he made his way back to the precinct, Connor couldn't shake the feeling that time was running out. He had a hunch that Echo's death was just the beginning of something much bigger – and he needed to get to the bottom before The Architect struck again.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Connor sat down at his desk and began to dig deeper. This case was personal now, and he was determined to see it through to the end.
