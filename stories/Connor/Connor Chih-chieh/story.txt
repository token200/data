A Taiwanese-American artist with a passion for fusion cuisine, Connor's eclectic style blended traditional Chinese motifs with modern street art techniques. Theirs was a world where vibrant colors and intricate patterns danced across canvases, creating an immersive experience that transported viewers to the streets of Taipei.
