Connor Salamanca sat on the rooftop, gazing out at the city below. The wind whipped his dark hair into a frenzy as he took a long drag on his cigarette. It was moments like these that Connor felt most alive, disconnected from the weight of his family's legacy.

As the youngest son of Gus Fring and Margaret Salamanca, Connor had always lived in the shadow of his more successful siblings. But he had grown into a man with a mind for numbers and a talent for manipulation. He had made a name for himself on Wall Street, working as a high-stakes trader and building a reputation as ruthless but fair.

Connor's thoughts turned to his mother, Margaret. She was the one who had instilled in him a sense of duty and loyalty to their family's business. Even after her passing, Connor felt her presence guiding him, urging him to keep the Salamanca name proud.

He stood up, taking another drag on his cigarette as he looked out over the city. It was a place where anyone could make a fresh start, where the past didn't matter. But for Connor, that was a hard sell. He knew too much about what it took to get to the top, and he wasn't sure he wanted to climb any higher.

Connor's phone buzzed in his pocket, breaking his reverie. It was an unknown number, but he answered anyway. "Salamanca," he said, expecting a sales pitch or a cold call from a stranger. But instead, it was the voice of Mike Ehrmantraut on the other end.

"Connor, I need to talk to you about something. Meet me at the usual place tomorrow."

Connor's instincts told him this wasn't good. He didn't need Mike getting involved in his life again. "What is it, Mike?" he asked, already knowing better than to ask for details.

There was a pause on the other end of the line before Mike replied, "Just come alone, Connor."

The connection ended, leaving Connor feeling uneasy and uncertain. Was this another attempt by someone else to pull strings in his life? Or did Mike really have something important to say?

Connor took one last look at the city below, his mind racing with possibilities. He knew he had to be careful, but a part of him wanted to trust Mike. After all, that was what family was for, right?
