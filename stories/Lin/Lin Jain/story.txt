Lin Jain stepped out of her small apartment and onto the bustling streets of New York City. As she walked towards the coffee shop on 5th Avenue, she couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement wash over her. She was on her way to meet her best friend, Rachel, for brunch.

As she waited in line, Lin Jain took a moment to review her schedule for the day. With an upcoming exam at school and a group project due soon, she knew she had a lot of work ahead of her. But today, at least, she was taking a much-needed break.

When it was finally her turn to order, Lin Jain smiled brightly at the barista and asked for her usual cappuccino. As she waited for her drink, she checked her phone for what felt like the hundredth time that morning.

Just then, Rachel popped out of the coffee shop door and gave Lin Jain a big hug. "Hey girl, I'm so glad you're here!" she exclaimed. The two friends had been inseparable since childhood, and Lin Jain cherished their daily catch-up sessions.

Over plates of pancakes and waffles, they chatted about everything from school gossip to their favorite TV shows. Lin Jain was grateful for the chance to forget her worries about exams and projects for a few hours.

As they finished up their meal and prepared to part ways, Rachel turned serious for a moment. "Lin Jain, I need to talk to you about something," she said. "I've been noticing that you seem really stressed out lately. Is everything okay?"

Lin Jain hesitated for a moment before responding. "It's just school, Rach. It's always something, you know? But I'm managing." She smiled brightly again, trying to reassure her friend.

Rachel nodded understandingly and handed Lin Jain a napkin with a scribbled note on it: "Remember to breathe, okay?" Lin Jain grinned, feeling grateful for Rachel's unwavering support.

With renewed energy and determination, Lin Jain set off towards the university, ready to tackle whatever challenges lay ahead.
