Lin Meinstein was not an entirely well-known name in New York's esteemed Upper East Side. But if you knew a bit about her, particularly her eccentricities, she wouldn't be so obscure after all.

She lived with her mother, a celebrated artist who spent most of the day arguing with herself. This usually happened when Lin walked into their kitchen to grab some toast or cereal for breakfast – as much as anyone could possibly need from an already overstocked pantry.

Lin wasn't one for mornings; she'd always sleep in late, listening intently through her doorways as her mother discussed a series of artistic theories that had nothing to do with the painting on the walls. But despite this peculiar upbringing, Lin found solace in art itself – drawing and sculpting, mainly. 

She could spend hours locked away in their cluttered studio above the garage, tinkering with different materials until she reached her perfect vision. Lin's artistic style was unlike anything you'd find in any of Manhattan's galleries; vibrant colors clashed against somber shapes. A lot of people thought it looked chaotic but to Lin, each stroke and scratch told a story – or so she claimed.

When not hunched over at the desk, exploring canvases, Lin would often walk through Central Park. She felt alive walking down the winding paths lined with trees that seemed older than her own memories. There was something magical in watching nature change seasons in such rapid succession, as if it too struggled to keep pace with the chaos of New York.

It didn't take long for someone to notice Lin's talent; she started attending drawing classes taught by an experienced artist. Her skills caught the attention of collectors, and her art began appearing on store shelves across Manhattan.

As time passed, Lin found herself torn between pleasing the patrons of her art with traditional representations of life or staying true to her unique vision. It was a difficult choice – much like choosing between waking up early and sleeping in late.
