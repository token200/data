She slipped into her flight suit, mentally preparing herself for the long haul ahead. With a final check of the ship's systems, Lin Kaleja Kaleja set course for the outer rim, ready to face whatever dangers lay in wait for her next adventure.

The "Maverick's Revenge" shot into the sky, leaving the crowded room and its inhabitants far behind. Lin Kaleja was gone, vanished into the depths of space, her legend growing with every successful mission.
