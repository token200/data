Linnea "Lin" Stenström was a force to be reckoned with in the small town of Ravenswood. A 30-year-old journalist, she had a reputation for being fearless and doggedly determined. With her sharp mind and quick wit, she had already made a name for herself as one of the most respected reporters in town.

Lin's latest assignment was to investigate the rumors surrounding the abandoned mill on the outskirts of Ravenswood. Rumors swirled that the mill was haunted by the ghost of its former owner, a reclusive millionaire named Malcolm McTavish. Lin was skeptical, but her curiosity got the better of her.

As she approached the mill, she noticed an eerie feeling in the air. The trees surrounding the building seemed to lean in, as if they were trying to listen in on her every move. Lin shivered despite herself and stepped inside, her eyes adjusting slowly to the dim light within.

The interior of the mill was just as abandoned as the exterior, with cobwebs clinging to old machinery and dust covering everything. But it was the air that really unsettled Lin. She could have sworn she smelled the faint scent of smoke and leather, smells that seemed all too familiar to her.

Suddenly, a chill ran down her spine as she heard footsteps echoing through the corridors. They were light, almost hesitant, but they sent shivers down her spine. Who – or what – was making those noises?

Lin's heart pounded in her chest as she moved cautiously deeper into the mill. She had been a journalist for too long to let fear get the better of her, but this was different. This felt personal.

As she turned a corner, Lin stumbled upon an old room that seemed untouched by time. A desk sat in the center, with a single chair facing it. And on the desk, a small, leather-bound book lay open, as if someone had been reading it just moments before.

Lin's eyes widened as she read the words scrawled across the page – words that seemed to match her own handwriting. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she realized that she was not alone in the mill after all.
