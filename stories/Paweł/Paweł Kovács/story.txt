Paweł Kovács stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, his eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of trouble. As a detective with the Budapest Police Department, he had seen it all - from petty theft to high-stakes corruption. But tonight was different. Tonight, he was on the trail of a lead that could crack open a decades-old case.

Paweł Kovács had been working on this particular case for months, pouring over files and interviewing witnesses. He knew every detail by heart, but nothing seemed to fit together quite right. That was when his instincts kicked in, and he followed a hunch down this particular alleyway.

As he turned a corner, he spotted a figure lurking in the shadows. Paweł Kovács's hand instinctively went to his gun, but as he took a step closer, the figure stepped forward - an old man with a worn face and a twinkle in his eye.

"Ah, Detective," the old man said, his voice low and gravelly. "I've been expecting you."

Paweł Kovács's eyes narrowed. "Who are you?" he demanded.

The old man chuckled, a dry, mirthless sound. "My name is not important," he said. "What matters is what I know about your case."

Paweł Kovács's grip on his gun tightened. He knew that this was it - the break he had been waiting for. The old man took a step closer, and Paweł Kovács could see the faintest glimmer of fear in his eyes.

"Listen, Detective," the old man said, his voice barely above a whisper. "I know who killed your sister all those years ago."

Paweł Kovács's world went white. He had been so close to catching the killer all these years, and now...now it seemed that justice was finally within reach.

The old man took another step closer, and Paweł Kovács could feel his heart pounding in his chest. This was it - the moment of truth.

"Tell me," Paweł Kovács said, his voice barely above a whisper.

The old man smiled, a small, wry smile. "It's time to set the record straight, Detective," he said.
