As he delved into the heart of the conspiracy, Balode found himself in increasing danger. Threats were made against him, and he began to receive cryptic messages warning him to back off. But the determined journalist refused to be intimidated.

Undeterred, Balode continued his investigation, using every trick in the book to uncover the truth. His colleagues at the newspaper began to notice a change in him – a newfound focus and an air of confidence that bordered on recklessness.
