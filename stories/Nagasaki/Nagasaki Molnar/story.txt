In the sweltering heat of summer, the small town of Willow Creek was abuzz with excitement as the annual SummerFest celebration approached.

Passersby couldn't help but stop and stare at the mesmerizing display, drawn in by Nags' infectious energy.

Despite their growing fame, Nags remained humble and kind, always willing to share their skills with the next generation of performers-in-training. It was this spirit that inspired a young girl named Lily, who watched in awe as Nags effortlessly flipped and twirled through the air. Inspired, Lily approached Nags after the show and asked for advice on how to improve her own acrobatics.
