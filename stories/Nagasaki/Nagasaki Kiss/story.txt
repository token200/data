Her name was whispered in hushed tones by passersby, and her presence seemed to draw people in like moths to a flame.

No one knew much about Nagasaki Kiss's past, except that she appeared out of nowhere, dressed in a stunning black gown that shimmered like the night sky. Her raven hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall of darkness, and her eyes burned with an intense, golden light.

As she wandered through the city streets, Nagasaki Kiss left a trail of mesmerized onlookers in her wake.
