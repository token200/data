Nagasaki Mägi was not an easily recognizable figure, even to those who knew him. A tall, slender man with piercing blue eyes and jet black hair, he moved through crowds without drawing attention to himself. His skin was pale, as if kissed by the dawn of a new day, but it held a depth that seemed almost otherworldly.

Mägi lived in a world not unlike our own, where technology had reached an unprecedented height and humanity teetered on the brink of a new era. Yet, despite all this, he stood apart, a ghost wandering the city streets at night, collecting forgotten stories and half-forgotten dreams.

It was said that Mägi held the ability to hear the whispers of the past, echoes of memories long buried beneath the surface of time. Those who sought him out would find themselves lost in his eyes, their own secrets and fears reflected back at them like a mirror.

One night, a young woman named Akira stumbled upon Mägi as she wandered through the city's oldest quarter. She had heard whispers of his existence, but never thought she'd encounter him herself. As she approached, Mägi looked up from his notebook, where lines of scribbled text told the stories he'd gathered over the years.

"What do you want to hear?" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

Akira hesitated, unsure how to answer. She had always felt lost, as if a part of her was missing. "Tell me my story," she said finally.

Mägi nodded, his eyes narrowing as he began to speak. The words spilled out like water from a dam, a torrent of memories and emotions that Akira had never known she possessed. Tears streamed down her face as she listened, the world around her dissolving into nothingness.

As the night wore on, Mägi vanished as suddenly as he appeared, leaving Akira alone in the darkness. Yet, though he was gone, his words remained with her, echoing through her mind like a mantra. And when she looked up at the stars that night, she saw a figure watching over her, a ghostly presence that seemed to be saying: "I'm here, and I'll always hear your story."
