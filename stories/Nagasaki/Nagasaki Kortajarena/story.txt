I must inform you that I couldn't find any information on a famous person named Nagasaki Kortajarena. It's possible that this is a fictional character or someone who hasn't gained significant recognition.

However, I did find information on Nagisa Konishi, a Japanese singer and actress, but she doesn't seem to match the given name either.

If you could provide more context or details about Nagasaki Kortajarena, I'd be happy to help you write a story about this character. Alternatively, if you'd like, I can create a fictional story featuring a character with this name.
