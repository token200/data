Tamas Brown stepped into the dimly lit pub, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. It had been months since he'd set foot in this place, and yet, it still felt like home. The patrons seemed to fade into the background as he made his way to the bar, his long strides eating up the distance.

As he ordered a whiskey, the bartender raised an eyebrow. "Tamas Brown, if I recall correctly? It's been a while."

Tamas chuckled and took a seat at the stool. "You do. Long enough for me to miss the old place." He leaned in, his voice taking on a conspiratorial tone. "But I heard rumors of some big changes around here. Something about a new owner?"

The bartender nodded discreetly, wiping down the bar with a dirty rag. "Let's just say that things have changed. But we still keep the good stuff flowing."

Tamas smiled to himself as he sipped his drink. He'd always been drawn to places like this – where the old-timers knew each other's names and the stories flowed as freely as the ale.

As he listened in on the hushed conversations, Tamas learned that the new owner was a woman with a reputation for being ruthless in business. Some said she was behind some of the city's most notorious scams, while others whispered about her supposed connections to the underground world.

Tamas raised an eyebrow. He didn't believe in rumors or gossip, but there was something about this woman that intrigued him. As he downed his drink and prepared to leave, he spotted a figure watching him from across the room – a woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair.

For a moment, their gazes locked, and Tamas felt like he'd been caught off guard. Then, she turned away, disappearing into the crowd as quickly as she'd appeared. He made his way to the door, his mind whirling with questions about who this mysterious woman was – and what her connection might be to the new owner of the pub.

As he stepped out into the chilly night air, Tamas couldn't shake the feeling that his life was about to get a whole lot more interesting. Little did he know, it had only just begun.
