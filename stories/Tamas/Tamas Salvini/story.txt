Tamas Salvini stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the cool evening air enveloping him like a damp shroud. He had been traveling for days, ever since he'd received that cryptic letter from his estranged father. The words still lingered in his mind: "Meet me at the old windmill on the outskirts of town. Come alone."

Tamas Salvini had always felt like an outsider in his own family. His father, a wealthy merchant, had abandoned him and his mother when Tamas was just a child. Now, at 25 years old, he was determined to uncover the truth behind his father's departure.

As he made his way through the deserted streets, Tamas Salvini couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He quickened his pace, his eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of movement. The windmill loomed before him, its wooden slats creaking ominously in the breeze.

Tamas Salvini approached the entrance cautiously, his hand on the hilt of his dagger. The door creaked as he pushed it open, and a figure emerged from the darkness.

"Father?" Tamas Salvini's voice was barely above a whisper, though his heart pounded with excitement.

The older man nodded, his eyes red-rimmed from lack of sleep. "Tamas Salvini," he said, his voice roughened by time. "I see you've come."

Over the next few hours, Tamas Salvini listened as his father recounted the story of his own troubled past and the reasons behind his abandonment. The wind howled outside, but inside, Tamas Salvini felt a sense of peace wash over him.

For the first time in his life, he felt like he understood where he came from. And though the journey had been fraught with hardship, Tamas Salvini knew that this was just the beginning. He would forge his own path now, one free from the shadows of his family's past.

As they parted ways under the fading light, Tamas Salvini couldn't help but feel a sense of closure. He turned to leave, the windmill's silhouette fading into the distance as he vanished into the night, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
