One fateful day, an invitation arrived from the neighboring kingdom, requesting Tamas' presence at a grand conference to discuss a fragile peace treaty. Lord Edgar Claudius, proud of his son's accomplishments, presented Tamas with a gift - a beautifully crafted sword adorned with intricate designs and symbols of their family crest. With this symbol of his heritage, Tamas set out on the perilous journey to negotiate the terms of the treaty.

Upon arrival, Tamas was met with skepticism by the representatives of the rival kingdom, who questioned his intentions and motives. However, Tamas' calm demeanor and commanding presence quickly put them at ease, as he skillfully fielded their concerns and presented a compelling case for cooperation.

As the negotiations progressed, it became clear that both sides shared a common goal - to establish lasting peace and prosperity in their region. With each passing moment, Tamas demonstrated an unshakeable commitment to this vision, earning him the respect and admiration of his counterparts.
