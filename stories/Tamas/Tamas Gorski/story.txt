Tamas Gorski was an enigmatic figure in the small town of Szentendre, Hungary. Few knew much about him beyond his striking blue eyes and jet-black hair, but whispers of his talent for forgery had begun to circulate.

As a young man, Tamas had grown up amidst the quaint streets and cobblestone alleys of Szentendre. His father was a woodcarver, and it was said that Tamas's early fascination with the art was inherited from him. However, Tamas Gorski had an ulterior motive – he dreamed of using his craft to create masterpieces for the black market.

Years passed, and Tamas honed his skills as a painter and sculptor, eventually mastering the art of forgery. He created exquisite replicas of famous works by renowned artists like Monet and Picasso. People from across Europe sought out his masterpieces, unaware that they were being deceived.

But there was one piece that Tamas Gorski had yet to create – the elusive "Portrait of Lady Catherine". It was said that this painting had the power to make its owner irresistible to any man in Szentendre, and Tamas was determined to capture it. He spent countless hours studying Lady Catherine's face from various angles and sketches until he finally captured its essence on canvas.

One stormy evening, as the wind howled through Szentendre's narrow streets, a wealthy collector arrived at Tamas Gorski's doorstep with an offer that could make or break his career. The two sat by candlelight, the only sound being the creaking of wooden floorboards beneath their feet, and the air thick with anticipation.

Tamas presented Lady Catherine's Portrait to the collector with great pride, revealing a level of craftsmanship he had never seen before. Impressed, the collector agreed to purchase it at any price. As the deal was sealed, Tamas knew that his life would never be the same – for this piece, and for the secrets he kept locked within his brilliant blue eyes.

The years went by and Lady Catherine's Portrait changed hands several times until eventually coming back to Hungary where a reputable art critic finally identified its true origins.
