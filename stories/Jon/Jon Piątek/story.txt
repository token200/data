I couldn't find any information on a character named Jon Piątek. However, I found that there is a Polish professional footballer named Piotr Wiśniowski's teammate on club level Piotr Wieteska's teammate on national level for the Poland national team, however on the international stage his name was not widely known.

However I can write an alternative story with information of how some fictional characters get well known

In the small town of Ashwood, Jon Piątek was a local legend. He was a charismatic and fearless adventurer who had been known to take on any challenge that came his way. With his trusty map and compass by his side, he had explored every nook and cranny of the surrounding countryside.

Despite his fearless nature, Jon was not one to seek out danger without a good reason. He had a deep respect for the land and its inhabitants, and he always made sure to leave nothing but footprints behind. His friends and family looked up to him as a role model, and many young adventurers in Ashwood sought out his guidance and advice.

One day, a group of travelers arrived in town seeking Jon's expertise. They were on a quest to find the lost city of Eldarath, said to be hidden deep within the nearby forest. Jon was immediately intrigued, and he agreed to join the group on their journey.

As they ventured deeper into the forest, Jon proved to be an invaluable asset to the team. His knowledge of the land and his quick thinking helped them navigate treacherous terrain and avoid deadly traps. With each passing day, the group grew closer to their goal, and eventually, they stumbled upon the ancient city of Eldarath.

Jon Piątek was hailed as a hero by the people of Ashwood, not only for his bravery but also for his wisdom and leadership. He had proven himself to be a true champion, and his name would go down in history as one of the greatest adventurers of all time.
