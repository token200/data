As he entered adulthood, Jon's passion for learning only intensified. He went on to study engineering at a top-tier university, where he excelled despite the demands of his coursework. His mother, who had always been his biggest supporter, beamed with pride as she watched him graduate and begin his career.

But Jon's real calling wasn't in the corporate world or academia – it was in using science to solve real-world problems. He spent years working for a non-profit organization, developing innovative solutions to address some of the world's most pressing issues.
