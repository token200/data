As a child, Jon had always been fascinated by the world of mystery and detection. He spent hours pouring over true crime novels and watching old detective movies with his grandfather, who had been a police officer himself.

As Jon grew older, his passion for detective work only intensified. He went on to study criminology in college and landed an internship at the local police department. It wasn't long before he was offered a full-time job as a detective, and Jon Wróbel was born.
