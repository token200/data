Jon Larsen trudged through the dense forest, his worn boots crunching on the dry underbrush. He had been walking for hours, but the trees seemed to close in around him like sentinels, making it impossible to gauge time.

As a former soldier, Jon had grown accustomed to solitude and hardship. But this was different. This was his own doing. His brother, Kjetil, had gone missing three days ago, and Jon had promised himself that he would find out what happened to him.

The only sound was the rustling of leaves and snapping of twigs beneath his feet. Jon's eyes scanned the horizon, searching for any sign of movement. He knew the forest like the back of his hand, having spent countless hours here as a child.

As he walked, memories flooded his mind. His parents had been killed in a tragic accident when he was just a teenager, leaving him and Kjetil to fend for themselves. They had grown up rough, their lives marked by hardship and poverty. But Jon's brother had always had a spark of hope within him. A dream to leave the forest behind and see the world.

And now, Kjetil was gone.

Jon quickened his pace, his heart pounding in his chest. He knew that he couldn't just sit around waiting for someone else to come looking for his brother. He had to take matters into his own hands.

As he turned a bend in the path, Jon caught sight of a clearing up ahead. In the center of the clearing stood an old cabin, its wooden walls weathered to a silvery gray. A wispy tendril of smoke drifted from the chimney, curling upwards like a ghostly finger.

Jon's heart skipped a beat. This was it. This was where Kjetil had vanished into thin air.

Without hesitation, Jon sprinted towards the cabin, his boots pounding on the ground. He burst through the door, his eyes adjusting to the dim light within.

The interior of the cabin was sparse, with only a single bed and a small stove in the corner. But it was what lay on the bedside table that made Jon's blood run cold. A piece of paper, folded into a neat square. On it, a single word scrawled in familiar handwriting: "Run."

Jon's heart sank. Kjetil had been warned away from something, but he had gone anyway. And now...

Suddenly, a sound came from outside the cabin. Footsteps crunching through the underbrush, growing louder with each passing second.

Jon's instincts kicked in. He knew that he couldn't stay here and wait for whatever was coming his way. With a deep breath, he snatched up the piece of paper and tucked it into his pocket.

He strode towards the door, ready to face whatever lay outside. The cabin creaked behind him as he opened it wide, revealing the forest in all its fury.
