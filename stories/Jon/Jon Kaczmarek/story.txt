Jonas Kaczmarek was a man with a passion for photography. Growing up in a small town in Poland, he had always been fascinated by the way light danced through the streets and buildings of his childhood home. After completing his education, Jon Kaczmarek decided to pursue his dream of becoming a photographer, and he traveled the world capturing its beauty.
