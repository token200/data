Jon Bergstrom trudged through the snow-covered streets, his boots crunching on the frozen crystals beneath him. As he walked, the cold air stung his cheeks and nose, but he didn't feel it. Not yet.

Jon "Jonny" Bergstrom, a former professional ice hockey player, had given up the game years ago, trading in his skates for a quieter life. But the memories still lingered, haunting him like a ghostly presence.

He stopped in front of an old diner, the neon sign creaking in the wind, reading "Mae's Eats" in faded letters. Inside, Mae herself was cooking up a storm, the smell of sizzling burgers and fries wafting through the air. Jon took a seat at the counter, his eyes scanning the worn Formica table as if searching for something lost.

"What can I get ya, Jonny?" Mae asked, wiping her hands on a grease-stained apron.

"Just coffee," he replied, his voice low and gravelly from years of shouting into the microphone. "And a slice of pie."

Mae nodded, sliding a cup of steaming black coffee in front of him. As she handed over a generous slice of cherry pie, Jon couldn't help but think about the old rink he used to play on, the sound of puck-swatting and grinning teammates still ringing in his ears.

He took a bite of the sweet tartness, feeling it wash over him like a warm balm. It was a taste that reminded him of summertime barbecues, post-game celebrations with buddies, and late-night laughs around campfires.

For a moment, Jon "Jonny" Bergstrom closed his eyes, letting the memories wash over him. He felt alive again, the rush of adrenaline still coursing through his veins like ice-cold water on a cold winter's night. But as he opened his eyes, reality came flooding back â€“ this was just a slice of pie, not the entire game.

The sound of Mae's Eats creaked and groaned once more, and Jon sighed, pushing away from the counter. He took one last bite of the pie, then tossed a twenty-dollar bill on the table. "Thanks, Mae," he said, his voice laced with a hint of sadness.
