Jon Schneider was a 30-year-old freelance writer who had always been fascinated by the world of true crime. Growing up in a small town, he had often found himself drawn to the darker side of human nature, and as an adult, he had turned this fascination into a career.

After graduating from college with a degree in English, Jon had started out writing for local newspapers and blogs before eventually landing a spot on a popular true crime podcast. His sharp insights and unique perspective quickly made him a fan favorite among listeners, and soon he was fielding offers from major networks and production companies.

Despite his success, Jon struggled to find fulfillment. He felt like he was simply scratching the surface of what he truly wanted to explore - the complexities and motivations behind some of the most notorious crimes in history. His podcast, "The Dark Side," had built a loyal following, but it was more than just a show for Jon; it was his passion.

One day, while researching a particularly intriguing case, Jon stumbled upon an obscure article about a cold case from 20 years ago. A young woman named Sarah had gone missing in a small town on the outskirts of the city, and despite a massive manhunt, her body was never found. The only clue was a cryptic message left at the scene - a single sentence that read: "You'll never find me."

Jon's curiosity was piqued. He couldn't shake the feeling that this case held more than just a simple crime story. There was something about Sarah's disappearance, and the message that followed it, that resonated deeply with him.

As Jon delved deeper into the case, he began to uncover some unexpected leads. He spoke to former detectives who had worked on the original investigation, and scoured through dusty archives in search of any mention of Sarah or her family. It was clear that this case was more than just a cold case - it was a puzzle waiting to be solved.

And then, something strange happened. Jon began to feel like he was being watched. He would get these fleeting glimpses out of the corner of his eye, only to turn and find no one there. The feeling grew stronger as the days passed, until eventually, he couldn't shake it anymore.
