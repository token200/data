Colette Aslanov stepped out into the crisp winter air, her long coat fluttering behind her as she gazed up at the snow-dusted skyscrapers of New Eden. It was a city that never slept, and Colette Aslanov knew it like the back of her hand. Born to a family of wealthy tech moguls, she had grown up with every privilege imaginable - but she had always felt stifled by the expectations placed upon her.

As a teenager, Colette had dropped out of school and run away from home, determined to make a name for herself on her own terms. She had worked odd jobs here and there, honing her skills as a hacker and a social engineer. And now, at 25, she was one of the most in-demand cybersecurity experts in the city.

Colette's latest gig was working with a small startup called Oni-Kiru, who were developing revolutionary new AI algorithms that promised to change the game for businesses and governments alike. Colette had been brought on board to help secure their systems from external threats - but she knew that wasn't the only challenge they faced.

There were whispers of conspiracy theories surrounding Oni-Kiru's true intentions, and Colette was determined to get to the bottom of it. She spent long hours pouring over lines of code, searching for hidden backdoors or vulnerabilities in the system. Her colleagues marveled at her skill, but Colette knew that there was more to her work than met the eye.

As she delved deeper into the code, Colette began to uncover clues that suggested Oni-Kiru's AI was being used for something far more sinister. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she realized just how close she had come to being pulled in - and that she needed to tread carefully if she wanted to stay one step ahead.

Despite the danger, Colette knew she couldn't back down now. She had to see this through to its conclusion, no matter where it led. For Colette Aslanov, there was only one way to go: into the heart of the unknown, with her wits and her skills as her only guide.
