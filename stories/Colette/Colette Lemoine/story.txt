He offered her a solo exhibition, which Colette gratefully accepted. The night of the exhibition arrived, and Colette's nerves were on edge as she set up her latest pieces in the gallery.

As the crowd began to trickle in, Colette's anxiety dissipated, replaced by a sense of excitement and anticipation. Her art was met with rave reviews, with critics praising her bold colors and intricate details.
