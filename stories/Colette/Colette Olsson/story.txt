And as she stood on the podium, hoisting the World Cup trophy aloft, Colette knew that all her hard work had paid off - not just for herself, but for generations of young girls and women who looked up to her as a role model.

Colette Alexandra Olsson was more than just a soccer star - she was a symbol of hope and determination. And as she walked off the field, exhausted but exhilarated, she knew that she had truly earned her place in history.
