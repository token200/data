The hold was small, but she placed her fingers with ease, using every ounce of technique and muscle memory to propel herself upward.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the valley below, Colette Sepp found herself hauled up onto a precarious ledge, her hands shaking slightly as she secured herself against the rock. She took another deep breath, surveying the terrain before her, and began to make her way across the narrow ridge.
