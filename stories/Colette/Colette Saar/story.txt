Colette Saar stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small town of Ravenswood. It was a place she hadn't been to in years, not since she'd left behind the life she knew. The memories lingered, like the scent of old books and stale coffee that wafted from the café on Main Street.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Colette couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. She had come back to Ravenswood with a purpose – to reconnect with an old friend, Sophia, who had recently lost her mother. Sophia's family owned the local antique shop, and Colette had promised to help with the preparations for the upcoming funeral.

As she pushed open the door to Sophia's shop, a bell above it rang out, and Colette was enveloped in the familiar scent of old leather and wood polish. Sophia looked up from behind the counter, her eyes widening as she took in Colette's appearance. She hadn't changed much – still had that wild mane of curly hair and those piercing green eyes.

"Colette! It's so good to see you," Sophia exclaimed, rising from her seat to hug her tightly. "I've missed you."

Over the next few days, Colette helped Sophia prepare for the funeral, sorting through boxes of family heirlooms and deciding which ones to keep or sell. They talked long into the night, reminiscing about old times and sharing stories about their lives since she'd left.

As they worked, Colette couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her. Ravenswood was just as she remembered it – quaint, charming, and full of secrets. She had thought she'd left all that behind when she left to pursue a career in writing, but being back now made her realize that some things were meant to stay.

One evening, as they sat on the porch watching the sun set over the hills, Sophia turned to Colette with a serious expression. "I've been thinking," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Maybe it's time for me to leave this place behind too. You know how much I love Ravenswood, but sometimes I feel like it's holding me back."

Colette smiled, feeling a sense of solidarity with her friend. "You deserve more than just one small town," she said, taking Sophia's hand in hers. "The world is out there, waiting for you."
