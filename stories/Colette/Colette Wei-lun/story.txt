Colette Wei-lun was a 25-year-old freelance writer with a passion for exploring the intersection of technology and society. Born in Taipei, Taiwan, to a family of entrepreneurs, Colette had grown up surrounded by the hum of computers and the glow of screens. As a child, she spent hours helping her parents manage their small IT firm, learning the ins and outs of coding and programming.

As she grew older, Colette's interests shifted towards writing, and she began to pursue a career in journalism. She earned a degree in English literature from the National Taiwan University, where she honed her skills as a researcher and writer. After graduating, she landed an internship at a prominent tech publication, where she quickly made a name for herself as a sharp and insightful observer of the industry.

Colette's unique perspective – born out of her Taiwanese heritage and her experiences growing up in a rapidly modernizing society – gave her a distinct voice in the world of technology journalism. Her articles on topics such as AI ethics, cybersecurity, and the impact of social media on mental health resonated with readers around the globe.

One day, Colette received an email from a tech mogul who wanted to meet with her about a potential project. He was impressed by her writing and saw great potential in her ability to tell stories about technology's role in shaping our world. The meeting led to a collaboration that would take Colette on a journey of discovery, exploring the boundaries between humanity and technology.

Through this project, Colette found herself delving deeper into topics she had previously only scratched at as a journalist. She spent countless hours researching and interviewing experts, from AI researchers to social media influencers. As she dug deeper, Colette discovered that her own experiences growing up in Taiwan gave her a unique insight into the complexities of modern technology.

As she worked on this project, Colette's full name – Wei-lun Colette – began to feel more like a personal brand than just a title. She was proud of who she was and where she came from, and she saw her work as a way to share that with others. With every article and blog post, Colette felt herself growing closer to her true purpose: using technology to tell stories that mattered.
