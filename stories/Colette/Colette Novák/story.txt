Colette Novák stepped into the dimly lit jazz club, the smooth sounds of the saxophone echoing through the air. As a renowned journalist and music critic, she had been invited to review the latest performance by the enigmatic singer, Luna Nightingale. Colette's eyes scanned the room, taking in the eclectic mix of patrons, from hipsters sipping craft beers to vintage enthusiasts swaying to the rhythm.

As she made her way to the bar, Colette noticed a figure sitting alone at a table near the stage. He was a tall, brooding man with piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into her very soul. She felt an inexplicable jolt of attraction, but quickly dismissed it as mere curiosity. After all, Colette Novák had a reputation for being fiercely objective in her reviews.

The music began, and Luna Nightingale took the stage, her sultry voice weaving a spell over the audience. Colette was captivated by the singer's raw talent and emotional depth. As she scribbled notes on her pad, she found herself lost in the performance, the music transporting her to a world of vivid colors and pulsating rhythms.

When the set ended, Colette made her way backstage, eager to interview Luna about her latest album. But as she approached the singer's dressing room, she was intercepted by the brooding stranger from the table near the stage. His eyes locked onto hers, and for a moment, they simply stared at each other.

"Luna tells me you're quite the music critic," he said finally, his voice low and husky. "I'm Max Wells, her manager."

Colette's journalist instincts kicked in, and she began to pepper him with questions about Luna's creative process and upcoming projects. As they talked, Colette found herself drawn to Max's quiet intensity, their conversation flowing effortlessly like a jazz standard.

When the interview ended, Max handed her a small card with his number on it. "If you want to discuss music further, I'm always up for a debate," he said with a smile. Colette felt a flutter in her chest as she tucked the card into her pocket, wondering what other hidden talents this enigmatic stranger might possess.
