Colette Salamanca was known for her unapologetic attitude and sharp wit, which often left people intrigued by her presence. As the illegitimate daughter of infamous cartel leader, Hector Salamanca, she had grown up surrounded by violence and power struggles.

Despite her troubled past, Colette had forged a name for herself as a fierce entrepreneur and cunning businesswoman. Her rise to success was nothing short of meteoric, as she leveraged her unique skillset to build a vast network of connections in the underworld.

Her latest venture, "El Jardin" - a high-end nightclub in the heart of the city's most affluent neighborhood - had quickly become the go-to spot for those seeking exclusivity and discretion. Colette's personal touch and exceptional taste in music, decor, and talent had made El Jardin a must-visit destination.

One fateful evening, as Colette was sipping champagne with her closest associates, she fielded an unexpected call from a prominent figure known only by his alias: "The Phoenix." Rumors swirled that this enigmatic individual possessed the ability to manipulate events from behind the scenes.

Intrigued, Colette listened intently as The Phoenix offered her a tantalizing proposal: partner with him in an underground gaming operation, promising lucrative returns and unparalleled influence. The stakes were high, but Colette's innate instincts told her that this could be the opportunity she'd been waiting for.

She glanced around the crowded room, her eyes locking onto the familiar face of Marco, her trusted ally and confidant. His gaze met hers, conveying a silent understanding - they would navigate this treacherous landscape together, side by side.

With calculated confidence, Colette accepted The Phoenix's offer. As she smiled to herself, knowing that her path was now forever intertwined with the shadows, Marco's eyes never left hers, silently vowing to watch her back every step of the way.

Together, they had just begun their ascent into a realm where power and ambition were the only currencies that mattered. And for Colette Salamanca, there was no turning back - she had set her sights on the top, with no intention of apologizing for it.
