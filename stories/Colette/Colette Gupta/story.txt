Colette Gupta walked into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Rohan, sitting at a small table by the window and made her way over to him.

"Hey, Ro!" Colette exclaimed, dropping into the chair across from him.

Rohan looked up from his laptop, a smile spreading across his face. "Colette Gupta! I was starting to think you weren't coming."

Colette chuckled and playfully rolled her eyes. "I would have never missed our weekly catch-up session."

The two friends chatted for a bit, catching up on each other's lives. Colette filled Rohan in on her latest art project, a series of paintings inspired by the city's street performers. Rohan shared stories of his new job at a local non-profit, where he was working to promote environmental awareness.

As they talked, Colette couldn't help but feel grateful for their friendship. She and Rohan had met in college, bonding over their shared love of art and music. Over the years, their connection had only grown stronger.

After an hour or so, Colette pulled out her sketchbook and began to work on a new piece. Rohan watched with interest as she brought her ideas to life on paper.

"You're so talented, Colette," he said, his eyes scanning the pages of her sketchbook. "I'm not surprised you're making a name for yourself in the art world."

Colette blushed at the compliment. "Thanks, Ro. I just try to stay true to myself and my vision."

As they worked on their respective projects, the café began to clear out, and the sounds of the city outside grew louder. Colette and Rohan sat in comfortable silence for a few moments, enjoying each other's company.

Finally, Rohan spoke up. "I should probably get going," he said. "But we'll catch up again soon, okay?"

Colette nodded, tucking her sketchbook into her bag. "Definitely. Take care of yourself, Ro."

Rohan smiled and stood up, brushing off his jeans. As Colette watched him leave, she felt a sense of contentment wash over her. Being around people like Rohan made life feel richer, fuller.

She finished her coffee, closed the café door behind her, and stepped out into the vibrant streets of the city. With a newfound sense of inspiration, Colette Gupta set off to bring her next art piece to life.
