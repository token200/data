Avani Wolf's eyes scanned the crowded festival grounds, her sharp ears picking up snippets of conversation and music drifting through the air. As a skilled thief and con artist, she was always on the lookout for potential marks, but today she had come to the festival with one goal in mind: to gather intel.

Avani Wolf, alias "The Fox," had heard rumors of a wealthy collector who would be attending the festival, and she aimed to sniff out any valuable information about him. With her quick wit and charming smile, she had already managed to infiltrate several high-society circles, but tonight was different. Tonight, she needed to blend in with the masses.

She dodged through the crowds, weaving past stalls selling handmade crafts and artisanal goods. Her fingers brushed against a vendor's wares, earning her a brief scolding, but Avani Wolf just flashed her most disarming smile and continued on her way.

As she navigated the festival grounds, she noticed several heavily armed guards patrolling the perimeter, no doubt protecting their prized collector from potential thieves like herself. Avani Wolf nodded to herself; she would have to find another way in. Her eyes scanned the crowd once more, searching for any opportunity to exploit a vulnerable moment.

That's when she spotted him - a tall, slender man with piercing blue eyes and an air of quiet confidence that only a seasoned collector could possess. Avani Wolf felt her heart quicken as she wove through the crowds towards him, her senses on high alert.

For a few tense moments, they locked eyes, but Avani Wolf merely flashed a warm smile and introduced herself, using all her charm to draw out a conversation with the elusive collector. And as the night wore on, she slowly gathered enough intel to make a move... or two.
