Avani Zielińska stepped out of her small flat and onto the bustling streets of Krakow, Poland. The morning light cast a warm glow over the cobblestone pavement as she made her way to the university library. She was determined to spend the day researching for her thesis on medieval folklore.

As a young Polish historian, Avani had always been fascinated by the stories of old. Her grandmother used to tell her tales of supernatural creatures and ancient traditions that seemed like mere myths until she stumbled upon them in dusty books and archives. Now, as a graduate student, Avani was on a mission to uncover the truth behind these legends.

She slipped into the library, weaving past rows of shelves stacked with dusty tomes and flickering fluorescent lights. The air was thick with the scent of old paper and coffee wafting from the cafeteria downstairs. Avani smiled, feeling at home among the musty silence.

As she delved deeper into her research, Avani's mind began to wander back to her childhood stories. She remembered the legend of the Polish forest spirit, the Żmij, said to roam the woods and forests of southern Poland, searching for lost souls. Her grandmother used to whisper that if you left a small offering of honey and milk in the woods, the Żmij would grant your wishes.

Avani's eyes scanned the stacks, searching for any mention of the Żmij. Suddenly, her fingers brushed against an old leather-bound book with intricate gold filigree on its cover. She pulled it out, blowing off a layer of dust and opening to the page marked "Żmij" in faint blue ink.

The words spilled onto the page like a river: tales of enchanted forests, ancient rituals, and forgotten gods. Avani's eyes widened as she devoured the text, her mind racing with possibilities. This was it – this was the proof she needed to complete her thesis.

Hours passed, and the library emptied out, leaving only Avani hunched over her notes, fueled by coffee and determination. The light from outside began to fade, casting a golden glow over the pages. Suddenly, the creaking of old wooden beams and distant whispers echoed through the silence.
