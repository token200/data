As a young journalist, she had been assigned to cover the annual Ganesh Chaturthi festival in the city, and she was determined to make a name for herself by uncovering the stories behind the festive celebrations.

As she made her way through the crowded streets, Avani Omar's eyes scanned the colorful stalls selling traditional sweets and ornaments. She had always been fascinated by the rich cultural heritage of India, and this festival was the perfect opportunity to delve deeper into it.
