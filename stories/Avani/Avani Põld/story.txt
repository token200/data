Avani Põld, a former professional athlete from Estonia, sat on the edge of her bed, staring blankly at the wall as if trying to recall the last time she had felt truly alive. It was the summer after the 2018 European Athletics Championships in Berlin, where she had won a silver medal in the women's marathon. But that moment of triumph now seemed like an eternity ago.

Avani's mind wandered back to her childhood days, running through the Estonian forests with her grandfather, who had instilled in her a love for distance running and an unyielding work ethic. As she grew older, Avani dedicated herself to honing her craft, pouring every ounce of energy into training sessions that often left her exhausted but triumphant.

After retiring from professional athletics at the age of 30, Avani struggled to find purpose outside the realm of competitive sports. Her body no longer responded as it once did; the pain and fatigue had become all too familiar companions. She began to question whether she had made a career out of something that brought her more sorrow than joy.

One day, while taking a walk along the Tallinn waterfront, Avani met an old friend from high school – Elise – who now owned a small bakery in town. Over steaming cups of coffee and warm pastries, they reminisced about their teenage escapades and laughed until their bellies ached. It was as if no time had passed at all.

Elise invited Avani to help out with the bakery's annual charity event – a fun run benefiting local youth sports programs. As Avani laced up her running shoes once again, she felt an unexpected spark within her. The familiar rhythms of her breathing, the pounding of her feet on the pavement, and the rush of endorphins through her veins all conspired to remind her that this was where she belonged.

That day marked a turning point for Avani Põld. Though no longer a world-class athlete, she had rediscovered her passion for running and found a new purpose in life – helping others experience the thrill of movement and community, as she navigated this newfound chapter with hope, determination, and a renewed sense of self.
