Avani Pētersons stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the sleepy station. The late evening sunlight cast long shadows across the wooden benches, and the sound of crickets provided a soothing background hum. She breathed in deeply, feeling the cool breeze fill her lungs.

As she walked through the station, Avani's thoughts turned to the letter she had received that morning. It was an invitation from her great-aunt, Māra, to spend the summer with her on the family farm. Avani had never met her aunt before, but her parents spoke fondly of their sister and brother-in-law, who lived out in the countryside.

Growing up, Avani had always felt a sense of restlessness in the city. The skyscrapers towered above her, casting long shadows that seemed to swallow all light. But she knew that she needed to get away from it all – the noise, the crowds, the constant rush of life. Māra's farm was supposed to be a place where she could find peace and connection with nature.

As Avani walked through the village, she noticed how different everything looked compared to her city home. The buildings were smaller, the gardens more lush. People smiled and nodded as they passed, greeting her with a warm welcome. Avani felt a sense of belonging that she had never experienced before.

She turned down a dirt path leading to the farm, following the winding road until she saw the rustic farmhouse come into view. Smoke drifted lazily from the chimney, carrying the scent of fresh-baked bread and herbs. Avani's stomach growled with anticipation as she made her way up to the door.

The door swung open, revealing a bright-eyed woman in her sixties, dressed in a simple but colorful dress. "Ah, welcome, little one," Māra said, embracing Avani warmly. "I've been waiting for you."

As they walked into the house, filled with the smell of baking and fresh air, Avani knew that she had found a new home – at least, a temporary one. She smiled up at her great-aunt, feeling a sense of belonging wash over her.

"Come," Māra said, leading Avani to the garden, "the sun is setting, and we have work to do."

And with that, Avani began her journey into the heart of the farm, surrounded by nature's beauty, where she could find peace and connection.
