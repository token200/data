Avani Tamm stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out at the glittering city below. Her long, dark hair whipped in the wind as she stared intently at the night sky. It was a habit she'd developed since childhood, when her grandmother would take her to watch the stars together on warm summer nights.

As she grew older, Avani's passion for stargazing never wavered. She spent countless hours studying astronomy, pouring over textbooks and attending lectures at the local university. Her dream was to one day join the prestigious Astronomical Society of India, a feat that seemed almost impossible given her humble beginnings in a small town.

But Avani refused to be deterred. She worked tirelessly as an intern at a research institution, honing her skills and learning everything she could about the cosmos. And then, just when it seemed like all her hard work was paying off, disaster struck.

Avani's laboratory caught fire during an experiment gone wrong, leaving her with burns on her hands and face, and forcing her to take a break from her studies. Crushed and disillusioned, Avani felt like giving up. But then she remembered the words of her grandmother, who'd always believed in her daughter's potential.

"Stars are not made just for humans," Avani had said. "They're meant for us to reach for, no matter where we come from."

Avani took a deep breath and stood up straighter, her eyes still fixed on the stars above. She knew it wouldn't be easy, but she was determined to overcome this setback and prove herself to the world.

Over the next few months, Avani worked harder than ever before, pouring all her energy into learning from her mistakes and rebuilding her skills. And slowly but surely, her confidence began to return. She landed a research grant to study a rare astronomical phenomenon, and soon found herself at the forefront of her field.

Years later, Avani stood on that same rooftop, her hair blowing in the wind once again as she gazed out at the stars. This time, however, it was different â€“ this time, she felt like the universe was shining just for her.
