Avani Dubois stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It had been months since she'd last set foot in Willow Creek, the quaint town where her family had raised her before abandoning her as a child.

As she made her way through the deserted streets, Avani couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The memories of her past lingered, haunting her like a ghost. Her full name echoed in her mind, a constant reminder of the life she'd left behind: Avani Dubois, daughter of Aur√©lien and Delphine Dubois.

The town had changed little since Avani's departure, yet everything felt different now. The buildings seemed taller, the streets cleaner, and the people... people who knew her. She spotted a familiar face across the square - Rachel, the girl who'd been her best friend all those years ago.

Rachel's eyes widened as she took in Avani's appearance, a mix of shock and curiosity written across her face. "Avani?" she whispered, taking a step forward.

"Rachel," Avani replied softly, her voice barely audible over the hum of the town's evening chatter.

The two girls stood there for a long moment, the past hanging between them like a challenge. Finally, Rachel broke the silence, extending a hand in greeting. "I've missed you so much, Avani."

Avani took Rachel's hand, feeling a spark of connection she hadn't felt in years. Together, they walked through the town, reminiscing about old times and sharing secrets that only they knew.

As the night drew to a close, Avani made her way back to the station, her thoughts whirling with emotions. Her full name echoed in her mind once more: Avani Dubois, a symbol of the life she'd left behind, yet also a reminder of the person she was becoming.

With a sense of purpose renewed, Avani stepped onto the train, ready to face whatever lay ahead. The journey had just begun, and this time, Avani Dubois was ready to take control of her own story.
