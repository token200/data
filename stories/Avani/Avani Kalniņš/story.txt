Avani Kalniņš stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the sleepy town as if searching for a ghost. She had been away from Riga for months, but the memories of her homeland lingered like a bad habit.

As she made her way through the deserted streets, Avani couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching her. The sun was setting over the Baltic Sea, casting long shadows across the buildings, and for a moment, she swore she saw a figure standing on the edge of town.

Avani shivered and quickened her pace, her mind racing with the secrets she had left behind in Riga. She had fled to Berlin after her sister's death, seeking solace in the city's chaotic streets and vibrant art scene. But now, as she faced another new day, she couldn't help but wonder if she was running from something or someone.

She arrived at the small flat she had rented on the outskirts of town, dropped her bag onto the floor, and collapsed onto the couch. The room was sparse, with only a few pieces of furniture and a faded Soviet-era poster hanging on one wall. Avani smiled wryly as she recalled her sister's words: "You can never go back to Latvia, Avani. You have to move forward."

But how could you move forward when the past refused to stay buried? Avani's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her phone buzzing on the coffee table. She hesitated before picking it up, wondering who would be calling her after all this time.

As she checked the screen, a wave of emotion washed over her – a message from an unknown number, with only one sentence: "I know what happened to your sister."

Avani's heart skipped a beat as she stared at the words on the screen. Who could have sent this? And how did they know? She hesitated for a moment before responding, her fingers trembling slightly over the keyboard.

The response came quickly – a single sentence in return: "Come home and we'll talk."

Avani felt a shiver run down her spine as she read the words. Was it a trap, or an opportunity to finally uncover the truth? She looked around the small flat once more, feeling the weight of her secrets bearing down on her.

With a deep breath, Avani decided to take the leap. She packed a small bag and set out into the night, ready to face whatever lay ahead in Riga.
