Lara Jarv stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. She had been searching for this place for weeks, pouring over dusty maps and crumbling scrolls in search of any hint about her family's past. As a renowned archaeologist, Lara had always been driven by a desire to uncover the secrets of the past, but nothing had prepared her for the mystery that had drawn her to this small village.

Lara Jarv pulled out a map from her worn leather satchel and spread it on the table at the nearby caf√©, pouring over the faded markings as she waited for her coffee. The barista, a gruff but kind-eyed man named Ivan, refilled her cup with steaming hot water and asked if she needed anything else.

"Just more of this," Lara replied, nodding towards the map. "I'm trying to track down some information about my family's history."

Ivan raised an eyebrow, but said nothing, simply handing her a slice of dark bread and a pat of rich butter. Lara smiled in gratitude, tucking the food into her bag as she continued to study the map.

As the sun began to set outside, casting long shadows across the village square, Lara finally found what she was looking for - a small inscription on an ancient stone, partially hidden by a overgrown patch of vines. She leaned forward, her heart racing with excitement, and carefully transcribed the words into her notebook.

"It's a message," she breathed, turning to Ivan as he came out of his shop to collect his own gear for the evening. "It says 'Seek the temple of the Moon Mother'."

Ivan nodded knowingly, his eyes twinkling in the fading light. "You're talking about your family's temple, Lara Jarv. The one that was thought lost forever."

Lara's eyes widened as she felt a shiver run down her spine. She had always known that her family had been involved with this place, but to think it might still exist... She took a deep breath, tucking the map and note back into her bag.

"I have to go," she said finally, shouldering her pack and stepping out into the night air. "I have a temple to find."
