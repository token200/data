One day, Lara received a call from an anonymous source claiming to have information about a high-profile murder that had gone cold years ago. Intrigued, Lara agreed to meet with the caller at a secluded café on the outskirts of town. As she sipped her coffee, she noticed a peculiar figure lurking in the shadows.

Suddenly, the figure emerged and revealed themselves to be a former witness who had been too afraid to come forward earlier. With shaking hands, Lara listened intently as the witness recounted the events surrounding the murder. She took meticulous notes, her eyes locking onto every detail.
