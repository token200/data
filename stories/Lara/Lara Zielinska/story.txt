Determined to uncover more, Lara sought out the gallery owner, an elderly man with a kind face and twinkling eyes. He revealed to her that Emilija Zielińska was indeed the artist behind the piece, and that she had been an influential figure in Poland's art scene during the war years.

As Lara delved deeper into the mystery of Emilija Zielińska's life and work, she found herself becoming increasingly obsessed with unraveling the truth. Her colleagues began to notice a change in her demeanor, as if she was under the surface of something, but couldn't quite put her finger on it.
