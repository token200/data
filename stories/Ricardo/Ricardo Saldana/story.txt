I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Ricardo Saldana. However, I did find information on an actor named Ricky Gervais' friend, but also an American actor that has appeared in several films and television shows.

Ricardo Antonio Chavira is an American actor who has had notable roles in the TV series "Desperate Housewives" and other films such as "Cheaper by the Dozen" and "The Single Moms Club". Here's a story about him:

Ricardo Antonio Chavira walked onto the set of his latest film, feeling like a million bucks. The cameras were rolling, and he was ready to bring his character to life. As the lead actor in the movie, Ricardo had spent hours rehearsing his lines and perfecting his performance.

As he began to film, Ricardo felt a sense of calm wash over him. He had played this role before, but there was something about it that still made him feel like he was on top of the world. The crew around him were all seasoned professionals, and they seemed to know exactly what they were doing.

Ricardo's co-stars were also talented actors who brought their own unique energy to the set. As they worked together, Ricardo couldn't help but notice how well they all worked together as a team. It was clear that everyone on set shared a common goal: to create something amazing.

As the day went on, Ricardo found himself getting lost in the world of the film. He forgot about the cameras and the crew, and just focused on bringing his character to life. When the director called "cut", Ricardo felt like he had been living for hours.

After a long day on set, Ricardo headed back to his trailer to relax. As he sat down in front of the mirror, he couldn't help but smile at himself. He was proud of what he had accomplished, and he knew that this film was going to be something special. And as he walked off into the sunset, Ricardo Antonio Chavira felt like a true Hollywood star.
