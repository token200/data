Ricardo Bergström stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of life. As he waited, a chill ran down his spine - this was where it had all begun.

It had been ten years since Ricardo Bergström, then a young and ambitious journalist, had arrived in Berlin with a dream to expose the dark underbelly of the city's politics. He had spent countless hours digging through dusty archives and interviewing shady characters, always on the lookout for the next big scoop.

But it wasn't until he stumbled upon an obscure article about a forgotten genocide that his career really took off. The story had captivated him, and he became determined to uncover more.

As he made his way through the crowded streets, Ricardo Bergström couldn't shake the feeling of unease. Something didn't feel right. He quickened his pace, weaving past pedestrians on the sidewalk.

He finally arrived at the small café where he was supposed to meet a source. The door swung open, and a figure emerged from the shadows - an old man with sunken eyes and a gaunt face.

"You're late," the man growled, his voice like gravel.

Ricardo Bergström apologized profusely as he took a seat across from the man. "I'm sorry, I got held up at the station."

The old man snorted. "You'll be held up soon enough. You see, Ricardo Bergström, your curiosity has put you on a very short list of people who can uncover the truth about what really happened here."

Ricardo's eyes widened as he realized the magnitude of his discovery. This wasn't just a story - it was a chapter in history.

As they sipped their coffee, the old man revealed more and more shocking details about the genocide that had taken place years ago. Ricardo Bergström listened intently, his mind racing with questions.

This was it. This was the story of a lifetime. And he knew that nothing would ever be the same again for him as Ricardo Bergström, journalist.
