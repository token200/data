Ricardo Novák stepped into the crowded café, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. He had received an invitation to meet with a potential client, and he was determined to make a good impression.

As he waited in line to order, Ricardo couldn't help but think about his background. Born in Prague, Czech Republic, Novák had always been fascinated by business and finance. After studying economics at the University of Economics in Prague, he had moved to London to work for a top investment bank.

Years later, Novák had struck out on his own, starting his own consulting firm that specialized in helping small businesses navigate the complex world of global trade. His clients adored him – he was witty, charming, and always willing to lend a helping hand.

Just as Ricardo was about to take a seat at the bar, he spotted his client waiting for him. She was a petite woman with piercing green eyes, and Novák knew immediately that this was going to be an interesting meeting.

"Ricardo Novák!" she said, extending a manicured hand. "I'm so glad we could finally meet in person."

Novák smiled warmly and shook her hand. "The pleasure is all mine," he said. "Please, call me Ricardo – not Mr. Novák or anything formal like that."

As they sipped their coffee and discussed the intricacies of international trade, Novák could tell that this woman was different from his usual clients. She was smart, confident, and had a spark in her eye that he hadn't seen in years.

After what felt like hours of conversation, Novák knew that he had to make a move. He pulled out his phone and began typing away at the screen, as if possessed by some sort of business wizard.

"I think I've found something," he said finally, looking up at his client with a grin. "A small window of opportunity that could give your business a real boost."

The woman's eyes lit up, and Novák knew that he had made contact. He leaned forward, his elbows on the table, and began to explain his plan in vivid detail.

As they talked, Ricardo Novák couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. This was what he did best – helping small businesses navigate the wilds of global trade, one client at a time.
