Ricardo Yi-hsien sat on the worn wooden bench, his eyes fixed on the vast expanse of Taipei's night sky. The sounds of the city - the honking horns, the chatter of pedestrians, the wail of sirens in the distance - receded into the background as he lost himself in thought.

A poet and writer, Yi-hsien had always found solace in the quiet moments like this one. His mind wandered to the words that swirled through his thoughts like the stars above: "The city's madness, the poet's curse" - a phrase he had scribbled down in the margins of an old notebook years ago.

Born into a family of modest means, Yi-hsien had grown up surrounded by the rhythms and cadences of Taiwanese folk music. His mother, a skilled weaver, would sing to him as she worked, her voice weaving a spell of comfort and security that would stay with him forever. It was no wonder then that words became his sanctuary.

As he sat on the bench, Yi-hsien felt the weight of his years. A man in his late sixties, with lines etched into his face like the folds of an old kimono, he had seen much of life's turmoil and beauty. His writing had taken him on a journey through the highs and lows, from the joyous celebrations to the sorrowful elegies.

The night air carried the scent of incense and blooming jasmine, transporting Yi-hsien back to his childhood. He remembered helping his mother in the family shop, watching as she carefully tended to the intricate patterns of silk embroidery. Those moments had taught him the value of patience and dedication - essential qualities for any writer.

As the stars began to fade with the dawn, Yi-hsien stood up, brushing off his worn jeans. The world would wait no longer; it was time to return to the page, to let the words flow onto the paper like water from a faucet turned loose. With a quiet smile, he vanished into the morning mist, ready to face another day of crafting verse that spoke to the soul.

His notebooks lay scattered across his desk - dog-eared and stained with tea leaves. The pages whispered secrets only known to him: of love lost and found, of hope and despair, of life's intricate tapestry woven from the threads of human experience. In those scribbled words, Yi-hsien had distilled his soul, revealing a universe of wonder that pulsed through every line like the beat of his own heart.
