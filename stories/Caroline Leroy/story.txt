Caroline Leroy was a woman with a reputation for being fearless. As a renowned journalist, she had spent her career taking on the toughest stories and coming out unscathed. Her determination and unwavering commitment to truth had earned her the respect of her colleagues and the admiration of her readers.

But Caroline's latest assignment had left her shaken. She had been investigating a series of bizarre occurrences at an isolated research facility deep in the woods, where scientists were conducting experiments on humans using untested technology. The more she dug, the more disturbing the evidence became.

One night, as she was preparing to leave the facility for the final time, Caroline stumbled upon a hidden laboratory. Inside, she found rows of subjects strapped to gurneys, their eyes vacant and unblinking. A chill ran down her spine as she realized that these were human beings, subjected to unimaginable suffering in the name of science.

Determined to expose the truth, Caroline began to take notes by hand, even though she knew it was a reckless move. The more information she uncovered, the more she understood that the researchers had been hiding something sinister.

As she made her way back to her car, Caroline noticed that she was being watched. A figure emerged from the shadows, its features obscured by a hood. "You shouldn't be here," the figure growled.

Caroline stood her ground, refusing to back down. "I have a right to know what's going on," she said firmly.

The figure lunged at her, but Caroline was quick. She grabbed her notebook and shielded herself with it just as the figure attacked. In the ensuing scuffle, the notebook flew out of her hands and landed on the ground.

Panic set in as Caroline frantically searched for her notebook. That's when she saw it: a page torn from her notes, fluttering in the wind. It read: "They're not just subjects. They're vessels."

Suddenly, the world around Caroline seemed to warp and distort. The figure loomed over her, its eyes glinting with an otherworldly light. She felt herself being pulled into a vortex of madness.

And then everything went black.

When Caroline came to, she was lying on the ground, her notebook scattered around her. But something was different. Her hands were shaking, and her vision blurred. As she stumbled to her feet, she caught a glimpse of the figure standing over her, its face no longer obscured by the hood.

"Welcome to the truth," it said with a twisted smile.

Caroline's eyes locked onto the figure, and for a moment, she knew that she had crossed a line from which there was no return.
