Johann Krumina stepped out of his small flat and into the crisp morning air, the smell of freshly brewed coffee wafting from the café down the street. As a freelance journalist, Johann spent most of his days typing away on his laptop, chasing leads and researching stories for the local newspaper.

Despite his introverted nature, Johann had a knack for uncovering hidden gems in the city's streets. He loved nothing more than stumbling upon a quirky cafe or an underground art gallery, where he could spend hours listening to the stories of its owners and patrons.

Today was no exception. Johann had received a tip about a new street artist who was set to unveil his latest piece tonight at a secretive warehouse on the outskirts of town. Eager to get there early and get the scoop, Johann set off towards the warehouse, his camera slung over his shoulder and a notebook clutched in his hand.

As he arrived at the warehouse, Johann noticed a buzz of excitement among the crowd gathered outside. The artist, known only by his pseudonym "Riven," was notorious for his enigmatic works that seemed to evoke emotions rather than represent them directly.

Johann pushed his way through the crowd and made his way into the dimly lit warehouse. There, he found Riven standing in front of a massive canvas, his eyes fixed intently on Johann as he approached. "Ah, Johann Krumina," Riven said with a nod, "I've been expecting you."

Over the next hour, Johann sat and watched as Riven worked tirelessly to finish his latest piece. The result was breathtaking – a swirling vortex of colors that seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the warehouse in a warm orange glow, Riven turned to Johann and handed him a small card. "For you," he said with a smile, before disappearing into the crowd.

Johann took the card and examined it. On one side was an image of his own face – but it was distorted, as if reflected in a funhouse mirror. The other side read simply: "Until next time, Johann Krumina."
