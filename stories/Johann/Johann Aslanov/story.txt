Johann Aslanov stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his worn leather boots making soft scuffling sounds on the gravel. He had been away for months, leaving behind the dusty alleys and cramped shops of Moscow, and now he found himself in the small village of Tbilisi, Georgia.

Aslanov's eyes scanned the crowded station, taking in the bustling energy of the villagers. He spotted a figure waiting by the exit, dressed in a traditional qvevri-patterned apron - his friend, Nino. She flashed him a warm smile as he approached, her dark hair tied back in a neat knot.

"Nino! How long has it been?" Aslanov asked, clapping her on the back.

"Too long," she replied, laughing. "Welcome home, Johann. I've got everything ready for you at our little dacha."

As they made their way through the village, Aslanov was struck by the beauty of this ancient land. The Georgian architecture seemed to blend seamlessly with the lush greenery and vibrant colors of the flowers. He felt a sense of peace wash over him, a welcome respite from the chaos of his life in Moscow.

At the dacha, Nino introduced him to her elderly aunt, Ana. She was a kind-hearted woman with piercing brown eyes, who welcomed Aslanov into her home with open arms.

"Johann Aslanov, it's been too long," she said, patting his hand. "We've missed you here."

Aslanov spent the next few days in Tbilisi, immersed in the rich culture and history of Georgia. He explored ancient churches, sampled local delicacies, and even attempted to learn a few basic phrases in Georgian. But it was Nino's encouragement that kept him grounded, reminding him that there was more to life than the constant din of Moscow.

One evening, as they sat on the balcony watching the sun set over the mountains, Nino turned to Aslanov with a serious expression. "Johann, we need to talk," she said.

Aslanov's heart quickened - he knew what was coming. It had been months since his parents' death in Moscow, and now they were ready for him to make a decision about his future. He took a deep breath, knowing that this conversation would change the course of his life forever.
