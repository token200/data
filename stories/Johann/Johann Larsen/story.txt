Johann Larsen stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. A former mercenary and now retired, he had thought he'd left the dangers of the world behind him. But the past had a way of catching up.

As he made his way to the bar, a hooded figure caught his eye from across the room. Johann's instincts immediately went on high alert. He ordered a whiskey at the bar and turned his attention back to the mysterious individual.

Johann Larsen was no stranger to danger, having fought in countless battles throughout his career. But he'd never been one for drawing attention to himself. Yet, here he was, about to find himself entangled in something far more sinister than he could have ever imagined.

The hooded figure slowly rose from their seat and approached Johann. As they drew closer, the figure pushed back its hood, revealing a young woman with piercing green eyes. "Johann Larsen," she whispered, her voice barely audible over the din of the tavern. "I've been searching for you."

Johann's grip on his whiskey tightened as he raised an eyebrow. What could this mysterious woman possibly want from him? He wasn't one to get involved in petty squabbles or family feuds.

But there was something about her words that tugged at Johann's conscience. Something about the desperation in her eyes that made him wonder if she was telling the truth. "What do you mean?" he asked gruffly, his curiosity getting the better of him.

The woman hesitated before speaking, her voice trembling. "My sister... she's missing. And I think it has something to do with your past, Johann Larsen."

As the weight of her words settled upon him, Johann felt a cold dread creeping up his spine. His thoughts turned back to the battles he'd fought, the lives lost, and the ghosts that still haunted him. He knew then that he couldn't turn his back on this young woman. Not when she needed him.

With a heavy heart, Johann Larsen agreed to help the mysterious woman find her sister. Little did he know that this decision would lead him down a dark path from which there was no return.
