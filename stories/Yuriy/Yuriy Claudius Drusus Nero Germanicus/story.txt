It was a sweltering summer evening in Rome, and Emperor Vespasian sat on his throne, weary from a long day of governance. By his side stood his son, Vespasian II, who had just returned from the wars with great triumph. But as he gazed out at the sprawling city before him, his thoughts were consumed by another son, one who was not yet born.

Nero Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus was a man of mystery and intrigue, a name whispered in awe by those who knew him. As the adopted son of Emperor Augustus, he had grown up surrounded by power and privilege, yet seemed destined for greater things. Some said he possessed an uncanny intelligence, while others claimed he could tame even the most ferocious beasts.

Vespasian's eyes narrowed as he recalled a tale from his own youth, when Drusus was still a young man. The emperor had watched in awe as Drusus effortlessly navigated the treacherous waters of politics, forging alliances and crushing rivals with equal ease.

As the night wore on, Vespasian's thoughts turned to the future, and the legacy he wanted to leave behind. He knew that his own son would one day sit upon the throne, but would it be enough? Drusus, though never actual emperor, had all but achieved everything he set his mind to.

In a burst of inspiration, Vespasian summoned his chief advisor, Epaphroditos. "We must create a new legacy," he said, his voice low and urgent. "One that will live on long after I'm gone."

Epaphroditos nodded, his eyes wide with understanding. "The Augustan family's traditions can be honored in many ways, my lord," he replied.

Vespasian smiled to himself as the meeting drew to a close. He had given Epaphroditos his charge, and now all that remained was for him to weave the threads of history into something truly remarkable.

Years went by, with Drusus becoming Emperor at age 27 in AD 37. Vespasian, feeling pride, did little but watch from the shadows until his death in AD 74, when he left the throne to his son.
