Yuriy Weber stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room with a mix of caution and familiarity. He had been here before, but he knew that in a world where memories could be manipulated and reality was a fragile construct, you couldn't trust anyone or anything too much.

As he made his way to the counter, a hint of a smile played on his lips. The barista, a woman with piercing green eyes, raised an eyebrow as Yuriy ordered his usual coffee.

"You know I'm not supposed to be here," she said, her voice low and husky.

Yuriy chuckled, pulling out his wallet and sliding it across the counter. "I know. But someone's gotta keep this place afloat."

The barista took the money, her fingers brushing against Yuriy's as she handed him his coffee. It was a fleeting touch, but one that sent a jolt of electricity through his body.

Yuriy took a sip of his coffee, feeling the familiar warmth spread through his veins. He had always been a man who thrived on routine, and this café was one of the few constants in his life.

As he sat down at a small table by the window, Yuriy's gaze wandered to the strangers sitting across from him. They were all wearing the same look – a mixture of confusion and curiosity.

It was as if they too knew that something was off about this place, but they couldn't quite put their finger on what it was.

Yuriy leaned back in his chair, feeling the creak of the leather beneath him. He had been to this café many times before, but each visit felt like a first.

He thought back to how he got here – a mysterious letter with only two words: "Meet me." The letter had arrived at his doorstep one day, with no return address or indication who might have written it.

At first, Yuriy had dismissed it as a prank, but something about the words had resonated within him. He had followed the trail of breadcrumbs to this café, where he found a small group of strangers who seemed to be hiding in plain sight.

As he sipped his coffee, Yuriy couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more to this place than met the eye. That there were secrets lurking beneath the surface, waiting to be uncovered.

The barista appeared at his side once again, this time with a small package wrapped in brown paper. "For you," she said, her eyes sparkling with mischief.

Yuriy unwrapped the package, revealing a note with only three words: "Trust no one."

He smiled wryly, knowing that he should be scared. But Yuriy Weber was not a man who trusted easily.
