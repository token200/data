Yuriy Zariņa stepped out of the cold winter air and into the cozy café, shaking the snowflakes from his long coat. As a renowned Latvian journalist, he had spent years investigating corruption and bribery in Riga's city government. But today, he wasn't there to dig up dirt – he was on a mission to uncover the truth behind a mysterious letter that had been circulating among the city's elite.

As he waited for his coffee to arrive, Yuriy Zariņa took out his notebook and began to scribble down notes. The letter, penned by an anonymous source, hinted at a massive embezzlement scheme involving several high-ranking officials. Intrigued, Yuriy Zariņa had decided to pay a visit to the city's mayor himself.

The mayor, a portly man with a well-groomed beard, looked up from his newspaper as Yuriy Zariņa entered his office. "Can I help you, Mr...?" he asked, eyeing the journalist's notebook suspiciously.

"Yuriy Zariņa," the journalist replied, flashing a warm smile. "I'm working on a story about corruption in Riga's city government. I was wondering if we could have a chat."

The mayor shifted uncomfortably in his seat, clearly uncomfortable with the conversation. "I don't know what you're talking about, Mr. Zariņa," he said, attempting to brush off the journalist.

But Yuriy Zariņa had heard it all before. He leaned forward, his eyes locked intently on the mayor's. "Don't play dumb, Mayor. I have sources who tell me otherwise. Care to comment?"

The mayor sighed, and for a moment, Yuriy Zariņa thought he saw a glimmer of fear in his eyes. "Fine," he said finally. "I'll give you an answer. But if this story gets out, I'll deny it to my grave."

Yuriy Zariņa nodded, his pen poised over his notebook. This was going to be a long day – but he was ready for whatever came next.
