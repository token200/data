I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Yuriy Vargas Llosa. It's possible that this character is not well-known or doesn't exist in popular culture.

However, I can create a story about a character with the given name Yuriy and surname Llosa, and mention their full name at least two times:

Yuriy was a young and ambitious journalist named Yuriy Vargas Llosa. Growing up in a small town in Peru, he always had a passion for storytelling and a desire to make a difference in his community.
