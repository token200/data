One evening, at an exclusive gallery opening, Yuriy Laurent stood alone by the edge of a crowded room. His eyes scanned the sea of faces, searching for someone – or something – that would stir his creative juices.

As they talked, Yuriy Laurent found himself drawn deeper into the woman's enigmatic world. She was a kindred spirit, one who understood the darker corners of his own psyche.
