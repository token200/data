"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining me tonight. I'm Yuriy Clarke, and I'm here to talk about something that's been on my mind for a long time – identity."

The audience erupted into applause, cheering and whistling as Yuriy smiled humbly from the stage. For a moment, he forgot about the struggles he'd faced and simply basked in the warmth of their acceptance.
