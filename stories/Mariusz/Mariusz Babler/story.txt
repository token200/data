One day, a young girl named Sophia arrived in the village, desperate to find her beloved dog, Max. She had been searching for weeks, but no matter where she looked, she couldn't seem to find him. Desperate and on the verge of tears, Sophia approached Mariusz with her plea for help.

Mariusz listened attentively as Sophia described Max's last known whereabouts and his distinctive bark. Then, he closed his eyes and focused on the energy surrounding the missing dog. After a few moments of silence, Mariusz opened his eyes and pointed towards a nearby thicket. "I think I've found him," he said with confidence.

Sophia rushed to the thicket and was overjoyed when she found Max wagging his tail and barking excitedly. The villagers cheered as Sophia hugged her dog tightly, thanking Mariusz for his incredible skill.
