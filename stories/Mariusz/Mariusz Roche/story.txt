Mariusz "Mari" Roche was a 25-year-old freelance journalist with a penchant for getting into sticky situations. With a mop of messy brown hair and a quick wit, he had earned himself a reputation as one of the most tenacious young reporters in the business.

One day, Mari received an email from his source about a potential expos√© on corruption within the city's elite social circle. The informant was willing to share confidential information with Mari, but only if he agreed to meet in a deserted alleyway at midnight.

Mari arrived at the designated spot, camera and notebook at the ready. His source, a nervous-looking individual known only as "Alex," handed him a sheaf of documents detailing secret deals between high-society figures and city officials. As they exchanged words, Mari's instincts told him that something wasn't quite right - Alex seemed overly fidgety, almost... rehearsed.

With the evidence in hand, Mari rushed back to his office, eager to get his story published before anyone else did. But as he sat down at his desk to begin writing, his phone rang. It was Alex, this time with an urgent message: "Mariusz 'Mari' Roche, you need to meet me NOW."

Confused and concerned, Mari rushed out of the office and onto the streets. He arrived at a coffee shop on the outskirts of town, where he spotted Alex once again. But this time, the informant was accompanied by two burly men in suits.

"Mariusz 'Mari' Roche," one of them growled, "you've been poking your nose into places it doesn't belong. Time to take a little payback."

With that, the three men advanced on Mari, ready to make an example out of him. But just as all hope seemed lost, a loud noise echoed through the coffee shop - a stray firework exploding outside.

The distraction allowed Mari to slip away unnoticed, his heart pounding in his chest. He knew he had stumbled into something much bigger than himself, and that his life was about to change forever.
