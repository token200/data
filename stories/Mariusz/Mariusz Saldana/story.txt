I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Mariusz Saldana. It is possible that this character does not exist in my knowledge database.

However, I can create a story around a character with the surname Saldana and mention it at least twice:

As the sun set over the bustling streets of Madrid, Captain Rey (who went by his full name, Mateo Kassian Reyes) stood tall, his eyes scanning the crowded square. He was on a mission to find his long-lost friend, Mariusz Saldana, who had gone missing during a recent expedition.

Mateo's search led him to a small café on the outskirts of town, where he spotted Mariusz sitting alone at a table, nursing a cup of coffee. As Mateo approached, Mariusz looked up and smiled, relief washing over his face.

"Rey, I've been looking all over for you!" Mariusz exclaimed, standing up and embracing his friend.

The two friends sat down together, catching up on each other's lives. Mariusz told Mateo about his latest adventure, working as a freelance photographer in South America. Mateo shared stories of his time with the Resistance, fighting against the evil Empire.

As they talked, a group of Imperial Stormtroopers appeared at the café entrance, scanning the room for any sign of the Rebel Alliance. Mariusz quickly ushered Mateo out of sight, and they made their way through the crowded streets, avoiding detection.

Once they were safely outside, Mariusz turned to Mateo and said, "I'm glad I found you, Rey. We need each other's skills if we're going to take down the Empire."

Mateo nodded in agreement, his eyes locked on Mariusz's. "We make a good team, amigo. Together, we can do anything."

As they walked off into the night, ready for their next adventure, Mateo knew that he and Mariusz Saldana would always have each other's backs.

(Note: I used a different character name to avoid any potential confusion with another famous actor)
