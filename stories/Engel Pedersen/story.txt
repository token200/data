Engel Pedersen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of saltwater and seaweed wafting up to greet him. It had been years since he'd last set foot in his hometown of Bergen, Norway, but the rugged landscape and sound of the fjords were still etched vividly in his mind.

As a young man, Engel had left Bergen to chase his dreams in the big city of Oslo. He'd studied architecture and landed a prestigious job with one of the top firms, but the creative spark that had driven him as a student had slowly been extinguished by the monotony of it all. He'd returned to Bergen after a decade away, seeking refuge from the chaos of his own making.

Engel's eyes scanned the platform, searching for the familiar face of Maja, the café owner who'd become like a mother to him. She was always there, waiting with a warm smile and a steaming cup of coffee.

"Engel Pedersen, finally back!" she exclaimed, as he settled into his favorite chair at the counter. "How's life been treating you?"

Engel sighed, running a hand through his unruly hair. "It's been...fine," he replied, downplaying the extent of his disillusionment.

Maja raised an eyebrow. "Don't give me that. You're here because it's not working out in Oslo, ja?" She poured him a fresh cup of coffee and slid a plate of freshly baked kråkbrød across the counter.

Engel took a bite of the dense, dark bread, feeling a wave of nostalgia wash over him. This was home – the rugged coast, the ancient architecture, the people who knew his name and smiled when he walked into town.

Over the next few weeks, Engel threw himself into his new life in Bergen. He spent hours exploring the narrow streets and canals, marveling at the intricate wooden buildings that seemed to lean in on each other like sentinels. He helped out Maja with odd jobs around the café, earning her affectionate nickname of "little engineer".

But it wasn't until he stumbled upon a small workshop tucked away in a quiet corner of the city that Engel felt his creative spark reignite. The owner, a wispy-haired woman named Lena, took him under her wing and taught him the art of woodworking – the feel of the wood beneath his hands, the satisfaction of bringing a piece to life.

As Engel delved deeper into the craft, he began to see Bergen through fresh eyes. The lines on the ancient stones, the curves of the boats bobbing in the harbor, the way the light danced across the city's weathered surfaces – it was all coming alive for him once more.

Engel Pedersen had found his true calling, and this time, he knew exactly where he belonged.
