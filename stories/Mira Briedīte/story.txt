Mira Briedīte stepped out of her small, cluttered apartment and into the bustling streets of Riga, Latvia. As an amateur taxidermist, she spent most of her days holed up in her flat, surrounded by jars of stuffed animals, their glassy eyes seeming to watch her every move.

But tonight was different. Tonight, Mira had a client who was willing to pay top dollar for her unique services. She lit a cigarette and took a long drag as she made her way through the crowded streets. Her clients were often eccentric, but this one promised to be particularly interesting.

As she arrived at the agreed meeting spot – an old, rundown café on the outskirts of town – Mira could see that her client was already there. He was a tall, gaunt man with sunken eyes and skin like dry parchment. He introduced himself as Dr. Krieg, a renowned collector of rare specimens.

"Welcome, Mira," he said in his low, gravelly voice. "I've heard great things about your work. I have a specimen that requires...special care."

Mira's curiosity was piqued as she followed Dr. Krieg to a small, ornate box hidden behind the café's counter. Inside, nestled among layers of velvet and cotton, lay a delicate, porcelain bird with glassy blue eyes.

"This is a rare species," Mira said, her voice barely above a whisper. "A bird that has never been seen outside of this region."

Dr. Krieg smiled, revealing crooked teeth. "Yes, yes. I've heard it's a treasure trove of information for the right collector."

Mira nodded, her mind racing with possibilities. She carefully lifted the bird from its bed and examined it more closely. It was beautiful, delicate, but there was something...off about it.

"What do you want me to do?" she asked Dr. Krieg, trying to keep her voice steady.

Dr. Krieg leaned forward, his eyes glinting with excitement. "I want you to preserve this bird, to make sure its secrets remain hidden for as long as possible."

Mira hesitated, feeling a shiver run down her spine. She knew that working with specimens like this often came at a cost – not just to the creatures themselves, but to her own soul.

But Dr. Krieg's words were firm and persuasive. Mira nodded, knowing what she had to do. With trembling hands, she began the delicate process of preserving the bird, each step a reminder that some secrets were better left unspoken.

As the night wore on, Mira worked tirelessly, her mind consumed by the task at hand. She knew that when this was done, she would be free to return to her quiet life in Riga, surrounded by her beloved animals and the familiar comfort of her cluttered apartment.

But deep down, she wondered if she had made a terrible mistake – one that would haunt her for years to come.
