I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Chantal Kortajarena. However, I can provide you with some information on the real-life supermodel and actress Chantel Jeffries and create a new story for a fictional character of the same name.

But since that's not what you asked for I will write a new 400-word story about a fictional character with the last name Kortajarena:

Ana√Øs Kortajarena was known to her friends as Ana, a free-spirited young woman who lived life on her own terms. With a wild mane of curly brown hair and an infectious laugh, she could light up any room with her presence.

Ana grew up in the vibrant city of Barcelona, where art and music filled the air. Her parents were artists themselves, and Ana learned to paint and dance at a young age. She was especially drawn to flamenco, and spent hours practicing her footwork and arm movements in front of the mirror.

As she entered adulthood, Ana discovered that her passion for art wasn't just limited to painting and dancing. She had a natural talent for photography, and began taking pictures of everything around her - from street performers to hidden corners of the city.

Ana's love of photography led her to become a freelance photographer, capturing the beauty of Barcelona and its people. Her work was showcased in local galleries and publications, and she became known for her unique perspective on the world.

But Ana's greatest joy was her work with children. She volunteered at a local orphanage, where she taught art classes to kids from all over the city. The look of wonder on their faces as they created something beautiful for the first time was all the inspiration Ana needed to keep going.

One day, Ana received an offer to shoot a campaign for a major fashion brand. It would be her first big client, and she was both excited and nervous about the opportunity. But as she looked through her camera lens, she knew that she had already found her true calling - capturing the beauty of the world, one frame at a time.

With her camera slung over her shoulder, Ana set off into the city, ready to take on whatever came next. She was a true creative force to be reckoned with, and her art would inspire countless people for years to come.
