Okada Lafourcade's latest assignment was to investigate a string of high-profile robberies targeting luxury jewelry stores across the city.

Despite the taunts, Okada Lafourcade was determined to crack the case. She spent countless hours pouring over security footage and interviewing witnesses, searching for any lead that might bring her closer to catching the thief.

As she delved deeper into the investigation, Okada Lafourcade began to notice a pattern.
