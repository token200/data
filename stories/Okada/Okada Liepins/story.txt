Okada Liepins was known for his unorthodox approach to meditation. While others would sit cross-legged on a cushion, eyes closed, and focus solely on their breath, Liepins preferred a more...unconventional method. He liked to sit on the edge of a cliff, overlooking the vast expanse of the ocean below.

Liepins believed that the crashing waves and salty air helped him tap into a deeper state of consciousness. His friends would often join him on these excursions, but they couldn't help but feel a twinge of concern for his safety. "Liepins, aren't you going to get seasick?" or "What if you lose your balance?" they'd ask.

But Liepins was undeterred. He loved the feeling of the wind in his hair and the spray of the sea on his face. It was invigorating, almost spiritual. As he sat there, he'd focus on the sensation of the air moving through his body, rather than just his breath. It was as if he was one with the universe.

One day, a group of curious hikers stumbled upon Liepins perched precariously on the cliff's edge. They watched in awe as he closed his eyes and began to hum a gentle melody. The vibrations of his humming seemed to match the rhythm of the waves, creating a symphony that was both calming and exhilarating.

The hikers approached him cautiously, not wanting to disturb the mystical atmosphere. Liepins opened his eyes and smiled at them, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "Ah, welcome," he said. "I'm Okada Liepins, but you can call me Li if you like."

The group nodded in unison, still feeling a bit awestruck. One of them asked, "Liepins, how do you find this... cliff-sitting thing? Does it work for you?"

Liepins chuckled, his eyes twinkling with amusement. "It works beautifully," he replied. "I've been doing it for years now. The view is stunning, and the energy of the ocean is incredible."

As they watched, Liepins stood up, brushing off his pants, and began to walk along the cliff's edge once more. His friends followed him, mesmerized by his carefree demeanor. They knew that with Okada Liepins around, anything was possible â€“ as long as you were willing to take a leap of faith.
