Okada Põld was a recluse who lived in a small, secluded cottage on the outskirts of a dense forest. Few people knew much about him, except that he was a skilled archer and hunter who spent most of his days alone, surrounded by nature.

One day, a young girl named Liina wandered into the forest, searching for wild berries to sell at the local market. As she walked deeper into the woods, she stumbled upon Okada Põld's cottage. She had heard stories about him from her grandmother, who claimed that he was a mysterious and elusive figure.

Liina cautiously approached the cottage, noticing that the door was slightly ajar. She pushed it open and called out, "Hello? Is anyone here?" There was no response, but she saw a quiver of arrows on the wall and a bow lying across her lap.

Suddenly, Okada Põld emerged from the shadows, his piercing blue eyes fixed intently on Liina. He was tall and lean, with long silver hair that fell to his shoulders. Liina felt a shiver run down her spine as he approached her.

"Who are you?" Liina asked, trying to hide her fear.

"I am Okada Põld," he replied in a low, gravelly voice. "And who might you be?"

Liina explained how she had wandered into the forest in search of wild berries. Okada Põld nodded thoughtfully and invited her inside.

As they sat by the fire, Liina learned that Okada Põld was once a member of the Estonian military but had left to live off the land after a tragic accident took the life of his family. He had been living in solitude ever since, content with the simplicity of his life.

Liina listened intently as Okada Põld spoke about his past and his love for nature. She realized that despite his reclusive nature, he was not as alone as she thought.
