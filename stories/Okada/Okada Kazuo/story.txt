As he entered the exclusive gaming club, Okada Kazuo's eyes scanned the room with an air of quiet confidence. He was dressed in tailored black attire, his hair slicked back to reveal piercing brown eyes that seemed to bore into those he encountered.

Okada Kazuo made a beeline for his favorite table, where he knew he could find his mark: a young up-and-coming player named Yuki.
