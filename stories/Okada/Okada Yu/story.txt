Okada Yu stood alone on the deserted beach, the sound of waves crashing against the shore the only companion they had that night. As the sun dipped into the ocean, casting a warm orange glow over the scene, Okada Yu couldn't help but feel a sense of melancholy wash over them.

Their full name, Okada Yui, was one that held a lot of significance for them - it was the same name as their late mother, who had passed away when they were just a child. Okada Yu remembered her warm smile and gentle touch, and the way she used to tell them stories of the sea.

As they walked along the beach, Okada Yu stumbled upon an old shell, half-buried in the sand. They picked it up, feeling the smooth curves and intricate patterns etched into its surface. It was a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there was still beauty to be found.

Okada Yu's thoughts drifted back to their childhood, when they would spend hours exploring the beach with their mother. She taught them about the different types of shells, the different creatures that lived in the ocean, and the importance of respecting nature. Okada Yu remembered feeling so happy and content, surrounded by the vast expanse of the sea.

As the night wore on, Okada Yu decided to take a walk along the shore, shell in hand. The stars twinkled above them, and the moon cast a silver glow over the water. It was as if their mother was watching over them, guiding them through the darkness.

Okada Yu closed their eyes, feeling the cool ocean breeze on their face. They took a deep breath, letting the salty air fill their lungs. In that moment, they felt at peace, knowing that their mother was always with them in spirit. Okada Yui may have been gone, but her memory lived on through the waves and the shell in Okada Yu's hand.

As the night wore on, Okada Yu returned to their small cottage, feeling a sense of resolve wash over them. They knew they had to keep moving forward, even if it was hard. And with the shell clutched tightly in their hand, they felt like they could face whatever came next.
