Okada Durand stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit tavern, shaking the water from her long, dark coat. She had been traveling for days, searching for any lead on her sister's disappearance, and finally, she had heard a rumor that brought her to this small, forgotten town.

As she made her way to the bar, Okada Durand noticed the patrons casting nervous glances in her direction. It was clear they were used to strangers being rare around here. She slid onto a stool, ordering a whiskey from the gruff bartender.

A figure emerged from the shadows at the far end of the tavern, his piercing blue eyes locking onto Okada Durand's. He was tall and lean, with jet black hair that fell across his forehead in messy locks. As he approached her, Okada Durand could sense an air of confidence about him that was both captivating and intimidating.

"My name is Kael," he said, his deep voice low and smooth. "And you are...?"

Okada Durand smiled wryly, pushing back her hood to reveal a flash of silver hair at her temples. "I'm Okada Durand. It's not every day I meet someone who can keep up with me."

Kael chuckled, taking a seat next to her on the stool. "I think we'll get along just fine, Ms. Durand." As they sipped their drinks in comfortable silence, Okada Durand couldn't help but feel drawn to Kael's enigmatic presence.

Suddenly, a commotion erupted at the entrance of the tavern. A group of rough-looking men, armed to the teeth, strode in and began searching for someone. Their eyes landed on Okada Durand, and her instincts screamed at her to be ready to fight.

Kael swiftly stood up, positioning himself between Okada Durand and the newcomers. "I think you've overstayed your welcome," he growled, his hand resting on the hilt of a dagger sheathed at his belt.

The men snarled, but Kael's calm demeanor kept them at bay. Eventually, they left as abruptly as they arrived, leaving Okada Durand and Kael alone once more.

As the tavern returned to its normal hum, Kael turned to her with an air of curiosity in his eyes. "So, Ms. Durand... what brings you to our humble town?"

Okada Durand smiled again, this time with a hint of wariness. "Just searching for my sister, like I said."

Kael's gaze lingered on hers before he nodded, his expression neutral once more. But Okada Durand could sense that beneath the surface, something was brewing â€“ and she couldn't help but wonder if Kael would be her ally or enemy in the days to come.
