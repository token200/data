Okada Aslanov stepped out of the train and onto the platform, gazing out at the unfamiliar cityscape before him. The towering skyscrapers and neon lights seemed to stretch on forever, a jarring contrast to the quiet countryside he had left behind. Aslanov Okada, former soldier turned private investigator, adjusted his fedora and began to make his way through the crowded station.

His eyes scanned the sea of faces, searching for any sign of his contact. It wasn't long before he spotted her - a petite woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She flashed him a brief smile as he approached, and Aslanov's instincts told him that she was trouble.

"Okada-san," she said, using the honorific suffix that few outsiders dared to use. "I see you're on time."

Aslanov nodded curtly, his mind racing with possibilities. Who was this mysterious woman, and what did she want from him? He followed her through the winding streets of the city, passing by street vendors and market stalls filled with exotic goods.

They eventually arrived at a small, unassuming apartment building. The woman produced a keycard and swiped it across the reader, revealing a hidden keypad beneath the screen. Aslanov watched warily as she punched in a sequence of numbers, her eyes flicking between him and the keypad before returning to his face.

"I have information about your sister," she said finally, her voice barely above a whisper. "The one who disappeared five years ago."

Aslanov's gut tightened with tension. He had given up all hope of finding her, resigning himself to the fact that she was gone forever. But now, it seemed, he might have a lead.

"What do you know?" he demanded, his patience wearing thin.

The woman hesitated, glancing around the deserted hallway before leaning in close. "I'll tell you everything," she whispered. "But you must trust me, Okada-san. The truth is not what you expect."

Aslanov's eyes narrowed, but he nodded curtly. He had no choice but to trust her - not yet, at least. Aslanov Okada followed her into the apartment, ready to face whatever secrets lay within.
