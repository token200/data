Okada Sten stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the neon-lit cityscape. As a renowned detective with the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, he had seen his fair share of darkness and despair. But tonight, it was the rain-soaked streets below that called to him.

Born Okada Kenji, Sten had always been drawn to the unknown, and his troubled past had driven him to become one of the city's most skilled investigators. His nickname "Sten" - a short, rugged take on his given name - suited him perfectly, like a shield against the world.

As he lit a cigarette, Sten's thoughts turned to the case that had brought him here tonight: a string of seemingly unrelated murders that had shaken the city to its core. The victims all shared one thing in common: a small, intricate tattoo on their left shoulder blade.

Sten took a long drag on his cigarette, feeling the familiar burn in his lungs. He knew that this case would be different from the last, with each new piece of evidence like a puzzle he was determined to solve. His colleagues might see him as aloof or detached, but Sten knew that beneath his gruff exterior lay a mind sharp enough to cut through any deception.

With a flicker of inspiration, Sten pulled out his notebook and began scribbling notes, the words flowing onto the page like blood from a wound. He was getting close; he could feel it.

As the rain pounded against the rooftop, Okada Sten disappeared into the night, driven by an unyielding hunger for justice. His quest to unravel the tangled threads of this case would be long and treacherous, but one thing was certain: Sten would not rest until the truth lay bare before him.

In the shadows, Sten's eyes gleamed like stars, as he vanished into the rain-soaked night, ready to face whatever dangers lay ahead. The city might see him as a lone wolf, but Okada Sten knew that in this dark and twisted game of cat and mouse, only one side could be revealed - the truth.
