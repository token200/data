Okada Zieliński sat alone at the small café, nursing a cup of lukewarm coffee. The kind of place where time stood still and the world outside moved with indifference. He sipped his drink, staring out the grimy windowpane at the grey Tokyo streets.

As he gazed, memories came flooding back - the days spent in the barracks, the training drills, the endless ranks and procedures. Zieliński's eyes scanned the café, searching for a familiar face or a glimpse of recognition. But it was always the same: strangers staring back.

The war had changed him, etched lines on his once-smooth forehead and hardened his gaze. He remembered the laughter, the camaraderie, the thrill of battle - now nothing but a distant dream. Zieliński sighed, letting the cool air seep into his chest. It was as if he'd lost his way.

A young woman with bright pink hair walked into the café, shaking off the chill from outside. Her bright colors were jarring against the drabness of the room, but Okada Zieliński watched her intently. She smiled at him once, and for a fleeting moment, their eyes met in understanding.

Zieliński remembered being young once too, full of life and purpose. How different it seemed now. He took another sip from his cup, wondering if anyone noticed the emptiness within.

Outside, the world moved on. People rushed past the café, chasing their own dreams. The pink-haired woman ordered a coffee and began to scribble in her notebook. She caught Zieliński's gaze once more and smiled. This time, however, he looked away quickly, his expression betraying nothing.

The café emptied, leaving only the faint scent of burnt coffee beans. Okada Zieliński took one last look at the pink-haired girl before rising from his seat. His movements were slow, calculated, like a soldier going through the motions. He walked out into the rainy Tokyo streets, lost in thought.

For a moment, the city's cacophony faded away. All that remained was his own voice whispering to him: "What am I doing here?" The words swirled around him like leaves on an autumn wind, leaving Okada Zieliński standing alone, staring into the grey Tokyo rain.
