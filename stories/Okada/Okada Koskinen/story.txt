Okada Koskinen trudged through the dusty streets of Tokyo, her eyes scanning the crowds with a mixture of disdain and wariness. A former yakuza enforcer turned mercenary, she had built a reputation for being ruthless and efficient. Her clients didn't care about her troubled past; they only cared about getting the job done.

As she turned a corner, Koskinen spotted a nervous-looking young man waiting by the curb. He was clutching a small briefcase and glancing around nervously, as if expecting an assassin to leap out from behind a nearby trash can.

"Can I help you?" Koskinen asked, her deep voice firm but not unfriendly.

The young man's eyes widened as he took in Koskinen's imposing figure – the tattoos, the scars, the perpetual air of menace surrounding her like a cloud. "I-I've been sent to meet with...with your employer," he stammered.

Koskinen raised an eyebrow. "And who might that be?"

The young man hesitated before producing a business card from his briefcase. Koskinen snatched it from him, examining the logo and contact information. It was a high-end security firm, specializing in discreet and high-stakes missions.

"Tell me," Koskinen said, her voice dripping with skepticism, "what makes you think I'm involved with this outfit?"

The young man swallowed hard before answering, "I've been told that...well, that the work is too sensitive for other companies. That only people with your particular set of skills can handle it."

Koskinen snorted, a low, husky sound. "My 'particular set of skills' are legendary, kid. You don't need to know any more than what's on this card." She waved the card dismissively.

The young man took a step back, his eyes darting toward the briefcase still clutched in his hand. Koskinen watched him with interest as he opened it, revealing a small data chip and a cryptic note that read: "Project Erebus – high-priority."

Koskinen's expression softened ever so slightly, her gaze lingering on the contents of the briefcase before snapping back to the young man. "What does this project entail?" she asked, her voice softer now.

The young man swallowed hard once more before answering, his words spilling out in a rush: "It's about retrieving...information from an old warehouse on the outskirts of town. The pay is 500,000 yen, double what any other company would offer."

Koskinen snorted again, this time with amusement. It seemed that some people still thought she was worth paying top dollar for her services.
