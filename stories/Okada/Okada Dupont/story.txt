Okada Dupont was a man with a reputation for being able to charm his way out of any situation. His slick smile and effortless mannerisms had earned him a spot as one of the most sought-after "fixers" in the city.

A fixer, by definition, was someone who could get things done for people who didn't want to be seen doing them themselves. Whether it involved "accidentally" deleting a rival's email or "misplacing" a crucial document, Okada Dupont was the go-to guy.

But what his clients never knew was that Okada Dupont had an ulterior motive for getting things done. He wasn't just in it for the money; he was also on a mission to uncover the truth about his own past.

As a child, Okada Dupont had been orphaned and left to fend for himself on the streets. But when he turned 18, he vanished into thin air, only to reappear years later with no memory of where he'd been or how he'd gotten there.

Okada Dupont knew that something had happened to him during those missing years. He had fragments of memories scattered throughout his mind, but they made no sense - a flash of sunlight in a hospital room, the sound of a woman's laughter, a mysterious tattoo on his arm that seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy.

Determined to uncover the truth about himself, Okada Dupont began to use his fixer skills for more than just making people happy. He started snooping around for clues, poking his nose into cases that were too hot for anyone else to touch.

It wasn't long before he stumbled upon a thread of evidence that led him straight back to the missing years of his life. A mysterious organization had been tracking him all along, and they'd left behind a trail of breadcrumbs for Okada Dupont to follow.

With his reputation on the line, Okada Dupont knew he had to see this through. He put everything on the table - his connections, his money, even his very soul. The stakes were high, but the reward was worth it: uncovering the truth about himself and finally finding some sense of purpose in a life that had been shrouded in mystery.

As Okada Dupont delved deeper into the unknown, he couldn't shake off the feeling that something else was watching him from the shadows. He knew he was getting close to the heart of the matter, but the truth was still just out of reach... for now.
