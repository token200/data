Okada Szymański was no ordinary person. Born in Warsaw, Poland to Japanese and Polish parents, they had grown up navigating two vastly different cultures. Their parents' relationship had been marked by secrecy and tension, but Okada Szymański's curiosity about their heritage had driven them to explore both worlds.

As a child, Okada Szymański spent summers in Japan with their Japanese grandparents, where they were taught the intricacies of calligraphy and tea ceremonies. In contrast, winters were spent in Warsaw with their Polish parents, where they immersed themselves in language classes and traditional folk music.

This unique upbringing had shaped Okada Szymański's perspective on life, making them both a bridge between cultures and an outsider in both. They struggled to find their place within either community, often feeling like they didn't fully belong.

As they grew older, Okada Szymański began to pursue their passion for photography, using the lens as a tool to capture moments of human connection and vulnerability. Their work took them to streets across Europe, from the bustling streets of Tokyo to the quiet canals of Amsterdam.

One day, while on assignment in Poland, Okada Szymański received an unexpected phone call from their Japanese grandfather. He asked them to visit him before he passed away, as he wanted to show them a family heirloom that had been passed down through generations – a intricately carved wooden box adorned with kanji characters.

Okada Szymański traveled to Japan, filled with anticipation and sadness. The visit was bittersweet, but the time they spent together with their grandfather made it worthwhile. As they held the wooden box, Okada Szymański felt a deep sense of connection to their heritage and a renewed appreciation for the complexities of their identity.

From that day forward, Okada Szymański's photography took on a new depth and meaning. They continued to capture moments of beauty and humanity, but now with a deeper understanding of themselves and their place in the world.
