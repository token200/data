Okada Kovács stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the smell of damp earth and saltwater filling their lungs. They had been away for so long, it was like coming home to a stranger's city. Their eyes scanned the crowded station, searching for familiar faces.

As they made their way through the throngs of people, Okada Kovács spotted a figure waiting by the exit - their sister, Lila. She flashed a bright smile as Okada Kovács approached, and pulled them into a tight hug.

"Kovács-san!" she exclaimed, using the formal address that only a handful of people dared to use. "It's so great to see you!"

Okada Kovács chuckled, hugging their sister back tightly. "Lila-chan, it's been too long."

The two sisters stood on the platform for a moment, watching as the trains roared by. Okada Kovács knew they had to get moving - they still had a lot of catching up to do.

As they walked out of the station and into the bright sunlight, Okada Kovács couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. They had left this city behind years ago, seeking a new life in the bustling metropolis of Tokyo. But after their father's passing, they had returned to their hometown on the coast, to help care for their aging mother.

Their mother, bless her worn and weary heart, was struggling to keep up with the demands of caring for themselves. Okada Kovács knew that they needed to do what was best for their family - but it was hard to know what that was when everything felt so uncertain.

As they walked along the seafront, the salty air whipping through their hair, Okada Kovács spotted a figure standing on the edge of the water. It was an old friend from school, someone who had always been there for them through thick and thin.

"Kovács-san!" their friend exclaimed, waving them over. "I've missed you so much!"

Okada Kovács smiled, feeling a wave of warmth wash over them. They knew that they were exactly where they needed to be - surrounded by the people who cared about them most.
