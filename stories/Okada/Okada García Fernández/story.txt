Okada García Fernández was known for his unorthodox approach to problem-solving. As a renowned detective in the small town of Ashwood, he had an uncanny ability to unravel even the most complex cases. His keen observational skills and sharp mind made him a sought-after expert in the field.

One sunny afternoon, Okada García Fernández received a visit from the local police chief, who was stumped by a recent string of burglaries. The thief seemed to always strike at exactly midnight, leaving behind no signs of forced entry or evidence of their presence. Okada García Fernández listened intently as the chief described the latest incident, his eyes narrowing with curiosity.

"I think I can help you crack this case," Okada García Fernández said, a hint of a smile on his face. "Tell me, when was the last time the burglar struck?"

The chief thought for a moment before responding, "It was last night."

Okada García Fernández nodded thoughtfully and began pacing around the room. He muttered to himself, making connections between seemingly unrelated pieces of information. After a few minutes of contemplation, he stopped in front of the chief and declared, "I have it! The burglar isn't stealing valuables; they're stealing time."

The chief looked perplexed, but Okada García Fernández continued, "Consider this: what's the one thing that everyone wants to get out of their life?"

The chief hesitated before responding, "More free time?"

Okada García Fernández nodded. "Exactly! The burglar isn't targeting expensive items; they're targeting people's time. They're stealing away precious hours and minutes from the residents of Ashwood."

With this revelation, the case began to unravel. Okada García Fernández tracked down the thief, who was none other than a reclusive clockmaker with a vendetta against the town's residents for disrupting his peaceful existence.

As the sun set over Ashwood, Okada García Fernández stood outside the clockmaker's workshop, victorious in solving the mystery. He smiled to himself, knowing that his unique perspective had once again proven invaluable. With a sense of satisfaction, he walked away from the case, ready to take on the next challenge that came his way as Okada García Fernández, the unorthodox detective with a knack for solving the unsolvable.
