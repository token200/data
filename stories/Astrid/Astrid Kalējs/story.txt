Astrid Kalējs stood at the edge of the frozen lake, her eyes fixed on the icy expanse before her. The wind whipped her dark hair into a frenzy as she clutched the worn wooden oar in her gloved hands. This was her sanctuary – the one place where she could escape the burdens of her past.

As a young girl, Astrid had been forced to flee Latvia during the Soviet occupation. Her family's resistance against the communist regime had made them targets for persecution. But it wasn't just the danger that drove her from home; it was the loss of her brother, who had fallen in the fight for freedom.

Now, as a teenager living in exile in Sweden, Astrid found solace in this quiet, isolated moment by herself on the lake. She would often come here to clear her mind and think about the world beyond her small cabin.

Astrid's thoughts drifted back to her childhood on the shores of the Gulf of Riga. She remembered the feeling of sand between her toes and the smell of saltwater carried on the breeze. But those memories were bittersweet, tainted by the fear and uncertainty that had defined their lives under Soviet rule.

As she gazed out at the lake's serene surface, Astrid noticed a disturbance in the water. A small wooden boat was making its way towards her, its occupant barely visible beneath a hooded cloak. She felt a surge of anxiety mixed with curiosity – who could be braving this treacherous weather?

The boat drew closer, and Astrid saw that it was her friend, Lina. Lina's dark hair was pulled back under the hood, and her eyes sparkled behind thick-rimmed glasses as she smiled at Astrid.

"I couldn't sleep," Lina said, leaping from the boat onto the ice with a soft thud. "I needed to talk."

Astrid nodded, welcoming Lina into the silence of the frozen lake. As they walked along the shoreline together, Lina told Astrid about her own struggles – the loneliness that had been weighing on her since leaving their home.

The two friends stood in contemplative silence for a moment, watching as the stars began to twinkle overhead. Then, without warning, Astrid reached into her pocket and pulled out a small piece of paper. It was an old letter, written by her brother before his death – a message of hope and defiance that had brought her through countless dark nights.

As she unfolded the paper and held it out to Lina, Astrid felt a weight lift from her shoulders. She realized that even in exile, there were still moments of beauty, of connection, and of resilience to be found.
