Astrid Sundlof stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the familiar landscape of her hometown. The small town of Ravenswood was quiet today, with only a handful of people milling about on the streets. Astrid Sundlof had been away for several years, chasing dreams in the big city, but she'd returned to Ravenswood to take care of some family business.

As she walked down Main Street, Astrid Sundlof couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her. The old diner was still serving up the same burgers and milkshakes it had all those years ago. She spotted familiar faces peeking out from behind the counter - the owner, Gus, and his sister, Emma - who had always been like a surrogate mother to Astrid Sundlof.

Astrid Sundlof made her way to the old Sundlof estate on the outskirts of town, where she'd spent countless hours as a child exploring the woods and playing in the gardens. Her parents had passed away when she was young, but Astrid Sundlof had always felt a deep connection to this place.

As she approached the house, Astrid Sundlof noticed that something was off. The windows were boarded up, and the door looked like it hadn't been opened in months. She pushed open the creaky gate and stepped onto the porch, where a small note lay on the welcome mat. It read: "Astrid Sundlof, come inside. We've got work to do."

Curiosity piqued, Astrid Sundlof stepped inside and called out into the darkness. The response was immediate - her family's butler, Jenkins, appeared from nowhere with a lantern in hand.

"Welcome back, Miss Sundlof," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "We've been expecting you."

Astrid Sundlof's eyes adjusted to the light as she looked around at the cluttered space. There were stacks of papers and documents everywhere, and a small table set up with a single chair.

"What is this?" Astrid Sundlof asked, feeling a shiver run down her spine.

"It seems your family has left you some... unfinished business," Jenkins replied, his eyes glinting in the lantern light. "But don't worry, Miss Sundlof - we'll get to it. After all, someone needs to take care of the Sundlof legacy."

Astrid Sundlof's mind was racing as she followed Jenkins into the depths of the old mansion. She had a feeling that her return to Ravenswood was going to be more complicated than she'd initially thought.
