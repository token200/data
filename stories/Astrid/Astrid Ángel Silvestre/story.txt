Astrid Ángel Silvestre stepped off the last bus of the day onto the cracked sidewalk, her worn boots sinking into the dusty earth. She was heading home from her shift at the café down by the river, the same river that had been her refuge since childhood.

As she walked, the fading light painted the sky in hues of crimson and gold, a final reminder of another day's toil. Astrid pushed open the creaky door to her small apartment above her sister's bakery, letting out a sigh as the stale air enveloped her.

Her sister, Sofia, looked up from arranging pastries on the counter, a hint of a smile playing on her lips. "Hey, cuz," she said, wiping flour-dusted hands on her apron. "How was your day?"

Astrid shrugged, dropping her worn leather bag onto the floor. "Same old, same old."

Sofia raised an eyebrow. "You know you should take a break more often. You're not getting any younger, you know."

Astrid snorted. "I'm fine, Sis. Just need to get some rest before we start prepping for tomorrow's festival."

The annual Festival de las Fiestas was a highlight of the year, and Sofia's bakery would be at the center of it all, whipping up sweet treats for the revelers. Astrid had always loved this time of year, but lately, she'd been feeling restless.

As they worked side by side that night, the fire crackling in the hearth, Astrid began to confide in Sofia about her feelings. "I don't know, Sis...sometimes I feel like there's more out there for me than just serving coffee and making small talk."

Sofia's expression turned serious, but she nodded knowingly. "Maybe it's time you started exploring what that is, then. We can help each other figure it out."

The next day, Astrid took a walk along the riverbank, feeling the cool breeze on her skin as she strolled. She closed her eyes, letting the sounds of the river wash over her – birds chirping, water lapping against the shore.

A memory flashed in her mind: a trip to Mexico City with their abuela, who'd always spoken of far-off lands and endless skies. Astrid opened her eyes to find herself standing at the water's edge, watching as a lone boat drifted down the river. She felt an unexpected jolt, a spark that ignited something within.

Perhaps, just perhaps, she was ready to start exploring what lay beyond this small town – and what secrets the world held for someone like her, with a heart full of wonder and a spirit that refused to stay rooted in one place.
