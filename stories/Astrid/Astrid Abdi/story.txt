Astrid Abdi stepped into the crowded café, her bright blue eyes scanning the room for any sign of her friend. She had been searching for Lena all morning, and the café was one of their usual haunts.

As she waited in line, Astrid's mind wandered back to the argument they had the night before. It seemed like a small thing - a disagreement over whose turn it was to buy coffee - but it had escalated into something much bigger. Lena had stormed out of the room, leaving Astrid feeling frustrated and worried.

The barista called out her name, and Astrid smiled as she reached for her cup. As she waited in line, she spotted Lena sitting at a small table near the window, her back to her.

Astrid slid into the chair across from her, trying to gauge her mood. Lena's shoulders seemed tense, and her eyes were fixed on some point beyond Astrid's left shoulder.

"I'm sorry," Astrid said quietly, reaching out to cover Lena's hand with hers.

Lena didn't flinch, but a tiny crack appeared in her resolve. "I'm just tired of being overthrown all the time," she muttered. "We're supposed to be partners, not rivals."

Astrid squeezed her hand gently. "I know that feeling. But I thought we were stronger than that. We support each other, remember?"

Lena snorted. "You keep saying that, but when it counts, you're always the one in charge. You never let me take the lead."

Astrid sighed, taking a deep breath as she tried to process Lena's words. She knew that their partnership wasn't about being in charge - it was about working together towards a common goal.

"I'm sorry, Lena," Astrid said again, her voice softer now. "I feel like I've been so caught up in trying to help the group that I forgot how much you need me to be your rock."

Lena's shoulders relaxed ever so slightly, and she turned to face Astrid. For a moment, their eyes locked, and Astrid could see the vulnerability there.

"I need someone to tell me what's going on," Lena said finally, her voice barely above a whisper. "I feel like I'm losing control, and I don't know how to stop it."

Astrid nodded, feeling a weight lift off her shoulders. She leaned in, wrapping her arms around Lena in a tight hug.

"I've got you, Lena," she whispered. "We'll figure this out together."
