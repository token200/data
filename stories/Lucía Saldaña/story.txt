Born and raised in a low-income neighborhood, Lucía knew firsthand the struggles that many faced.

The verdict sent shockwaves through the city's power elite, forcing them to confront the consequences of their actions. Lucía's victory had sparked a wave of renewed activism and accountability, earning her widespread recognition as a leading voice for justice.
