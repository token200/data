Tatyana Jun's eyes fluttered open, revealing a sea of dimly lit ceiling tiles above her. She was lying in a cramped hotel room, with nothing but a small suitcase and a worn-out backpack beside her. The memories were hazy, but one thing was clear: she had no recollection of how she got there.

Tatyana slowly sat up, rubbing the weariness from her temples. Her dark hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall, tangled with knots from the night before. She swung her legs over the side of the bed and planted her feet firmly on the ground, as if anchoring herself to reality.

The room was small, but Tatyana knew it well. It was where she had fled after a falling out with her family back in Seoul. The tension between them still lingered, like an open wound that refused to heal. Her parents were traditionalists, while Tatyana's heart belonged to the city's vibrant art scene.

She stood up, wobbling for a moment as the room spun around her. A cup of lukewarm coffee sat on a rickety table, stained with last night's lipstick. Tatyana's gaze drifted towards the mirror on the opposite wall. Her features stared back at her: sharp cheekbones, full lips, and piercing green eyes that seemed to hold a world of emotions within them.

As she sipped the lukewarm coffee, memories began to resurface like bubbles in a carbonated drink. The laughter with her friends at the gallery opening, the debates with her brother over philosophy and politics, the long walks along the Han River under the stars... Her thoughts swirled in every direction, refusing to settle.

With a quiet determination, Tatyana began to gather her belongings. She tossed her backpack into the suitcase, along with a sketchbook filled with half-finished paintings and scribbled notes on poetry. The words flowed effortlessly onto the page, capturing the essence of this moment: uncertainty, longing, and the promise of new beginnings.

As she zipped up the suitcase, Tatyana smiled to herself. She knew what lay ahead wouldn't be easy, but with her art as a shield and her spirit as her armor, she would face whatever came next with courage and creativity.
