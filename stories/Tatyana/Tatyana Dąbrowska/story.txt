After completing her studies at the Academy of Fine Arts, she began working as an assistant designer for a prominent fashion house in Paris.

However, it wasn't until Tatyana returned to Poland that her true talent was discovered.

She drew inspiration from traditional folk art, mythology, and architecture, reinterpreting these elements for the modern era. Her runway shows became events in their own right, featuring live music, dancers, and installations that transported the audience to another world.

Despite her success, Tatyana remained committed to supporting emerging Polish designers and promoting cultural heritage. She collaborated with museums and galleries, creating bespoke pieces that told the story of Poland's complex history and identity.
