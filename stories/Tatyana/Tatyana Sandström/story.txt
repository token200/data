Tatyana Sandström stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the drizzly Swedish evening. She had been away for years, and the familiar streets of Stockholm still felt foreign after all this time. The rain seeped into her bones as she made her way to the small café on the corner, where she knew her friend would be waiting.

Lena was already there, huddled over a cup of coffee, her dark hair dripping wet. "Tatyana!" she exclaimed, as Tatyana dropped into the chair across from her. "I'm so glad you're finally here."

Tatyana smiled wryly, running a hand through her own tangled locks. She had left Stockholm in a hurry, with little more than a suitcase and a broken heart. It was years since she'd set foot in the city, and yet it still felt like home.

As they sipped their coffee, Lena asked the inevitable questions – how was life in Paris? Did she miss Sweden at all? Tatyana answered truthfully, about as much as she could without revealing too much. She had built a new life for herself across the Channel, one that was full and vibrant but still tinged with melancholy.

Lena listened attentively, her eyes never leaving Tatyana's face. The two friends had grown up together, exploring the winding streets of Östermalm and dreaming of futures yet to be written. They had been inseparable until... well, until Tatyana had left.

It was a conversation they'd had many times before – about why she'd stayed, or whether she'd ever return. But this time, as they sat in the dimly lit café, something felt different. Maybe it was the rain, or maybe it was just the quiet of the evening, but Tatyana felt like Lena understood her better than she had in years.

As the night wore on and the café emptied out, Lena leaned in close. "You know I'll always be here for you, no matter where life takes us," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Tatyana's eyes pricked with tears as she smiled at her friend. It was true – Lena would always be there, waiting on the other side of the sea. And in this moment, Tatyana knew that she could face whatever came next, knowing she had a home to come back to.
