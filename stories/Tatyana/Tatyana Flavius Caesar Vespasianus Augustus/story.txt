With unwavering determination and unshakeable resolve, Tatyana Flavius Caesar Vespasianus Augustus embarked on a journey that would change the course of history. She navigated treacherous alliances, battled fierce foes, and made impossible decisions all in the name of reclaiming Rome's former greatness.
