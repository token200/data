Mori Aber stepped out of his worn leather jacket and onto the cracked pavement, gazing up at the flickering streetlights. His eyes seemed to hold a thousand miles' worth of secrets, the weight of which he'd learned to carry like a well-worn saddle.

Aber had always been an enigma – a drifter with no fixed abode, no steady job, and even fewer attachments. People said he was a vagabond, that his life was one long string of misadventures and fleeting connections. Aber didn't argue with the label; it suited him just fine.

As he scanned the street, the flickering lights seemed to dance in time with the hum of the city's energy. It was like the world itself was humming a tune only Mori could hear. He nodded his head in time, lost in thought as he made his way towards the local diner.

The neon sign above the diner creaked and groaned in the gentle breeze, casting an otherworldly glow across the sidewalk. Aber pushed open the door, and the bell above it jingled in welcome. The waitress, a woman with piercing green eyes, looked up from polishing a mug.

"Hey, Mori," she said, as always. "You look like you've been up since dawn."

Aber chuckled – a low, rough sound that seemed to come from deep within his chest. "Just out for a stroll, ma'am," he replied, sliding onto the stool beside her.

The waitress brought him coffee and a plate of eggs, which Aber wolfed down with gusto. It was his favorite food in the world – a humble dish, yet one that always hit the spot after a long night's wanderings.

As he finished his meal, a young woman with bright pink hair walked into the diner, her eyes scanning the room until they landed on Mori. For a moment, their gazes locked, and Aber felt like he'd been punched in the gut.

"Hey," she said, finally breaking free from the spell. "Mori Aber."

Aber raised an eyebrow – a question mark of sorts. He didn't remember her; it wasn't as if he went around collecting memories like coins in his pockets.

"I think I know you," Mori said slowly, a plan forming behind his eyes.

The pink-haired woman smiled mischievously and slid onto the stool beside him. "We've been to places together, Mori Aber," she whispered. "Places only you'd understand."

Aber's eyes seemed to bore into hers, like they held a world of secrets. For a moment, the city around them melted away, leaving just two souls lost in the depths of their own private worlds.

And that was when Mori knew he had found something – or someone – worth holding onto for a little while longer.
