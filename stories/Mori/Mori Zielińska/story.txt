Mori Zielińska stood at the edge of the city, her eyes scanning the horizon as if searching for something only she could see. Her long, dark hair whipped about her face in the wind, and her slender fingers were clenched into fists as she struggled to contain a burst of adrenaline.

As a child, Mori had always felt like an outsider in the small town where she grew up. She was quiet and reserved, preferring the company of books and animals to that of her peers. But on this particular day, something about the air seemed different. The wind carried a subtle tang of decay, and Mori could feel it stirring something deep within her.

She took a deep breath, letting the scent fill her lungs, and began to walk. Her feet moved with a purpose, carrying her through the streets and alleys like a puppet on a string. People passed by, nodding or waving as they went about their day, but Mori's eyes were fixed on something beyond them.

As she walked, the buildings around her began to fade away, replaced by an endless expanse of fields and forests that stretched out into the distance. The sky above was a deep, foreboding grey, with clouds that seemed to twist and writhe like living things. Mori felt a shiver run down her spine as she realized that this was no ordinary day.

She had been feeling it for weeks now – a growing sense of unease that threatened to overwhelm her at any moment. Some said it was just nerves, while others whispered that it was something more sinister. But Mori knew what she felt. She could feel the world shifting beneath her feet, like an earthquake waiting to strike.

As she walked further out into the fields, the wind began to pick up speed, whipping about her with a fury that left her breathless. Mori stumbled, her foot catching on a hidden root, and for a moment, she felt herself tumbling through time itself.

When she finally managed to steady herself, Mori saw it. A figure standing in the distance, its back turned to her as if waiting for something – or someone. The wind howled around it like a chorus of lost souls, but it didn't seem to notice. It just kept waiting.

With a sense of purpose, Mori began to move towards the figure. She had no idea what it was, or why she was drawn to it, but something within her knew that this moment – this instant – held the key to everything. As she walked, the world around her seemed to come alive with an electric tension, like the universe itself was holding its breath in anticipation of what was to come.

And when Mori finally reached the figure's side, she saw that it was a young woman, no more than twenty years old, with eyes that were black as coal. The woman turned, and Mori felt a jolt run through her veins – for in those depths, she saw something ancient and evil staring back at her.
