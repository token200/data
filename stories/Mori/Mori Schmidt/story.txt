One day, Mori received an email from an anonymous source claiming to have information about a high-profile case she had been investigating for months. The sender requested a meeting at a small caf√© on the outskirts of town, and Mori couldn't resist the temptation to uncover the truth.

As she sat down across from her mysterious informant, a man with piercing green eyes, Mori felt a shiver run down her spine. Who was this person, and what did they want? The man introduced himself only as "Jack," but his words sent chills down Mori's spine - he had information about the very case she had been working on.

Mori Schmidt's mind racing with possibilities, she listened intently as Jack revealed a shocking twist: one of the key witnesses in the case was not who they claimed to be. The revelation shook Mori to her core, and she knew she had to get to the bottom of it.
