Mori Maria stepped out of the misty forest and into the bustling streets of the city. As a member of the prestigious Ryujin clan, she was no stranger to the whispers and stares that followed her everywhere. But tonight, she had come to the city's famous Red Lotus nightclub with a purpose.

As she made her way through the crowded room, Mori Maria's piercing green eyes scanned the room for any sign of trouble. She had received a tip about a rival clan seeking to disrupt the Ryujin's annual gala, and she was determined to put an end to it.

With her long, raven-black hair cascading down her back like a waterfall, Mori Maria wove through the throngs of partygoers with ease. Her sharp jawline and pointed chin gave her an air of quiet confidence that commanded respect from even the most hardened thugs.

As she reached the bar, Mori Maria flashed a radiant smile at the bartender, ordering a glass of sake with a flick of her wrist. "Mori Maria, but please, call me Moria," she said, tossing back the drink in one swift motion.

Just as she was about to make her way onto the dance floor, a burly man lunged from the shadows, a snarl twisting his face. Mori Maria recognized him instantly - Kaito, a known henchman of the rival Akakawa clan.

Without hesitation, Mori Maria sprang into action, her agility and strength allowing her to dodge Kaito's clumsy blows with ease. The fight was over in seconds, with Mori Maria standing victorious amidst the scattered crowd.

As the music restarted and the partygoers cheered, Mori Maria smiled wryly to herself, knowing that she had saved the Ryujin clan's gala from disaster. With her reputation as a fierce warrior solidified, Mori Maria sipped her second glass of sake, ready to dance into the night with the stars shining bright above.
