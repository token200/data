Mori Camara stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar surroundings of Ashwood Station. She had been away for three years, serving as an engineer in a remote research facility on the outskirts of town, but the call of home was too strong to resist.

As she made her way through the crowds, Mori's thoughts turned to the life she had left behind. Her parents were still living on the family farm, the land they had tilled for generations. She had always been close to them, and the silence that had settled over the house since her return was palpable.

Mori pushed open the creaky door of her childhood home, a wave of memories washing over her. The old wooden rocking chair sat in the same spot where she used to sit with her grandmother, listening to stories of their ancestors. The smell of fresh-baked bread wafted from the kitchen, carrying the scent of her mother's baking.

As she moved through the house, Mori noticed changes that had taken place during her absence. New furniture, new curtains, and even a small, sleek computer on the dining table. It was a far cry from the rustic simplicity of her childhood home.

Mori's parents met her in the living room, their faces etched with a mix of relief and curiosity. "Welcome back, Mori Camara," her mother said, using her full name for the first time that day. "We've missed you so much."

Over the next few days, Mori settled back into her old routine. She helped with the harvest, reconnected with friends from school, and even spent a few hours in her childhood bedroom, nostalgic for the simple pleasures of her youth.

As she sat on the porch that evening, watching the sun set behind the rolling hills, Mori felt a sense of peace settle over her. She was home, and though much had changed, some things remained constant â€“ the land, the family, and the sense of belonging that came with it.
