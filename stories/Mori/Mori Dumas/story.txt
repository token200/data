As they made their escape, Mori couldn't help but smile â€“ for once again, Morpheus "Mori" Dumas had outwitted the odds and claimed victory.

Though his exploits often landed him on the wrong side of the law, Mori knew that in the world of high-stakes thievery, reputation was everything. And Morpheus "Mori" Dumas, with his unyielding cunning and quick wit, remained the greatest thief Paris had ever known.
