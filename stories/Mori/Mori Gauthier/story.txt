Mori Gauthier stepped into the dimly lit tavern, her eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As a skilled mercenary and member of the prestigious Blackheart clan, she had seen her fair share of battles and bloodshed. The patrons fell silent as she made her way to the bar, their whispers dying down as they realized who was in the house.

The bard in the corner raised his mug in a silent toast, his eyes locking onto Mori's with a hint of curiosity. She flashed him a brief smile before taking a seat next to him. "What brings you to this fine establishment, Mori Gauthier?" he asked, his voice low and smooth.

Mori ordered a drink, her gaze sweeping the room once more before focusing on the barkeep. "I'm looking for information," she said, her voice firm but controlled. "Word is that a local lord has taken up arms against the kingdom. I aim to put an end to it."

The bard's eyes lit up with interest, and he leaned in closer. "Ah, you must be the one they call 'The Ghost of Blackhaven'," he whispered. Mori raised an eyebrow, her expression unreadable.

As she sipped her drink, a hooded figure slid into the bar, their eyes locking onto hers before quickly looking away. Mori's instincts went on high alert; this was someone who didn't want to be seen. She subtly nodded at the bard, who followed her gaze.

The stranger pushed back their hood, revealing a striking young woman with piercing green eyes. "You're looking for Lord Ravenswood," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. Mori's grip on her mug tightened as she leaned in closer. The woman continued, "He's made a pact with the Dark sorcerer, Xandros."

Mori's eyes narrowed; this was more than just a local lord's rebellion. It was a full-blown war, and she aimed to put an end to it. She nodded once, her mind already racing with strategies and tactics.

As the night wore on, Mori Gauthier listened intently to the stranger's tale, her eyes burning with determination. When she finally stood up to leave, the patrons knew they were in the presence of a force to be reckoned with â€“ The Ghost of Blackhaven had come, and war was near.
