Mori Salemi stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. The small town of Ashwood was quiet, its residents huddled indoors to escape the winter's chill. As she walked through the empty streets, the crunch of snow beneath her boots echoed through the stillness.

A freelance journalist, Mori had arrived in Ashwood on a tip about a local businessman who was rumored to be involved in some shady dealings. Her sources had hinted at a story of corruption and greed that went all the way to the top of the town's power structure.

As she made her way to the local café, Mori couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. She quickened her pace, glancing over her shoulder as if expecting someone to leap out from behind a lamppost.

Inside the café, Mori spotted a familiar face – the town's mayor, Harrison Wellesley. He smiled warmly as she approached, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "Mori, it's been too long! I didn't know you were in town."

"Just passing through," Mori replied, her tone neutral. "I'm working on a story about local business and politics. Thought I'd see if there was anything of interest."

Harrison leaned back in his chair, his smile faltering for a moment before he regained it. "Well, Ashwood's always been a model community. We prioritize our residents' well-being above all else."

Mori raised an eyebrow. She knew her sources had warned her that Wellesley was the one who really ran this town – not some benevolent figurehead. "That's exactly what I'm looking into," she said, her eyes locked on his.

Wellesley shifted uncomfortably in his seat, his smile growing a fraction wider. Mori sensed that she'd struck a nerve, but he wasn't going to give anything away just yet.

As the conversation continued, Mori gathered snippets of information – tidbits about questionable business deals and secret meetings with mysterious outsiders. She was starting to piece together a tangled web of corruption, one that implicated Wellesley himself.

But as the sun began to set, casting long shadows across Ashwood's streets, Mori realized she wasn't alone. A figure watched her from across the café – a hood pulled low over their face, their eyes gleaming with an unnerving intensity.

Mori's instincts screamed for her to leave, to get out of there before it was too late. But something about this story felt too big, too important. She leaned forward, her voice barely above a whisper: "I think I'm onto something, Mr. Wellesley. Something that could shake this town to its foundations."

And with that, the lights went down, plunging Ashwood into darkness – just as Mori's world was about to take a very drastic turn.
