Mori Moreno Martinez stepped into the crowded café, scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Luna, huddled in the corner, sipping on a coffee. Mori made her way over, weaving through the tables to reach the booth.

As she slid into the seat across from Luna, Mori asked, "What's new with you?" Luna smiled, "Just trying to get some work done before the weekend." Mori nodded sympathetically, taking in the stack of papers and books scattered around Luna. They were a student at the local art school, studying fine art.

The conversation flowed easily, covering everything from their shared love of anime to their favorite novels. Mori mentioned that she had been meaning to read "The Night Circus" for ages, but kept putting it off due to her busy schedule. Luna recommended it, and they made a plan to discuss it over dinner the following week.

After some time chatting, Luna glanced at her watch and stood up. "I should probably get going," she said, gathering her things. Mori followed suit, and as they stepped out of the café, Mori asked if she wanted to walk with her for a bit. The cool evening air was refreshing, and they strolled through the quiet streets, enjoying each other's company.

As they walked, Mori mentioned that she had been feeling overwhelmed lately, struggling to keep up with her coursework and extracurricular activities. Luna listened attentively, nodding along as Mori talked about her anxiety. "You're going to be just fine," Luna said reassuringly. "You've always been one of the most resilient people I know."

Mori smiled gratefully at her friend, feeling a weight lift off her shoulders. It was moments like these that reminded her why she valued her friendship with Luna so much. As they continued walking, Mori felt more centered, ready to tackle whatever challenges lay ahead.

Eventually, they reached the edge of town, where Luna dropped off Mori and headed back home. Mori watched her friend disappear into the darkness, feeling grateful for their friendship. "Thanks again, Luna," she called out, as Luna turned around with a smile. "I needed that."

With a wave goodbye, Mori continued on her own way, feeling lighter, more at peace.
