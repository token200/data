Kristaps Fuentes stepped off the bus and onto the cracked sidewalk, gazing out at the worn-down buildings that lined the street. The small town of Red Rock was never more than a stopover on his travels, but there was something about it that drew him in. Maybe it was the faded sign above the local diner, or the way the sunlight seemed to seep from the very pores of the earth itself.

As he walked towards the diner, Kristaps Fuentes noticed a figure watching him from across the street. The woman's eyes were piercing green, with a sharp jawline that spoke of a thousand unspoken stories. She smiled, and for an instant, Kristaps felt like he was drowning in her depths.

He pushed open the door to the diner and slid onto a stool at the counter, his eyes flicking towards the woman as she followed him inside. The waitress, a gruff but kind-hearted woman named Darla, raised an eyebrow as Kristaps Fuentes ordered a cup of black coffee.

"So, what brings you to Red Rock?" she asked, her tone neutral.

Kristaps took a sip of his coffee before answering, "Just passing through." He didn't feel like getting into it, not here. There was something about this place that seemed... fragile, like the threads on an old sweater.

Darla nodded thoughtfully, wiping down the counter with a dirty rag. As she worked, her eyes kept drifting towards Kristaps Fuentes. He could almost see her thinking about him, weighing him up like he was a piece of merchandise on sale.

Eventually, Darla leaned in close, her voice dropping to a whisper. "You're not from around here, are you?" She seemed to be asking more than just where he was from â€“ she was asking what had brought him to this place, and why.

Kristaps shrugged, feeling the heat rise up his neck. "No," he said finally. "I'm Kristaps Fuentes, from...elsewhere." He glanced out the window, towards the woman who still watched him with an intensity that made him shiver.
