In the bustling streets of Riga, Latvia, a young and talented basketball player was making a name for himself in the international community. Kristaps Krūmiņš, born to a family of athletes, had always been drawn to the sport. As a child, he would spend hours playing on the court with his friends, dreaming of one day becoming a professional player.

He trained tirelessly, honing his skills and studying the game with an intensity that earned him recognition from coaches and scouts worldwide.
