Despite the challenges she faced, Kristaps remained steadfast in her commitment to telling the stories that needed to be told. Her colleagues began to refer to her as a "thorn in the side of the establishment," but Kristaps knew that this was exactly what she wanted to be - a catalyst for change. As she looked out at the city skyline from her small apartment, Kristaps Ángel Silvestre felt a sense of pride and purpose, knowing that she was making a difference one story at a time.
