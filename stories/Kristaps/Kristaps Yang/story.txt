Kristaps Yang stepped into the dimly lit room, the soft hum of the fluorescent lights above casting an eerie glow on his face. As the lead investigator of the special crimes division, he had seen his fair share of gruesome scenes, but nothing could have prepared him for what lay before him.

The victim was a young woman, her eyes frozen in a permanent stare, her skin pale and clammy to the touch. Kristaps Yang's gaze swept over the room, taking in every detail - the scattered flowers, the torn curtains, and the small notebook lying open on the floor.

He knelt down beside the body, his trained eyes scanning the area for any signs of evidence. The notebook was filled with cryptic messages and symbols, but one phrase stood out: "The eyes that see are not the ones that look."

Kristaps Yang's mind was already racing with theories, but he knew he needed more information to piece together the events leading up to this tragic death. He radioed for backup, his voice steady despite the growing unease in his stomach.

As the forensic team arrived and began processing the scene, Kristaps Yang couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. The victim's eyes seemed to be watching him, even after she had passed away. He tried to push the thought aside, focusing on the task at hand, but it only added to his sense of unease.

Just as he was about to stand up and leave, Kristaps Yang noticed a small inscription etched into the wall beside the body: "The eyes that see are not the ones that look." He felt a shiver run down his spine as he realized this was more than just a random phrase - it was a warning.

He called for a second team to review the footage and witness statements, determined to unravel the mystery behind Kristaps Yang's latest case. As he left the crime scene, he couldn't help but wonder what other secrets lay hidden beneath the surface, waiting to be uncovered.

The next few days flew by in a blur of paperwork, interviews, and endless theories. But one thing remained clear: this was more than just a random act of violence - it was a carefully crafted game, designed to keep Kristaps Yang guessing until the very end.
