Kristaps Oja trudged through the snow-covered streets, his eyes fixed on the dimly lit building in front of him. As the last surviving member of his family, he had been left with nothing but memories and a burning desire for revenge against those who had destroyed his home.

The war that ravaged Latvia twenty years ago still lingered in his mind like an open wound. Kristaps's village was reduced to ashes, his parents killed in a senseless act of brutality. He himself was forced to flee, wandering the desolate landscape, searching for answers and a way to make amends.

Now, as he stood before the old Soviet-era building, Kristaps felt a familiar surge of anger. This was where it all began – where his family's fate had been sealed. The doors creaked in the wind as he pushed them open, revealing a dimly lit corridor lined with peeling paint and rusty pipes.

He navigated through the musty air, his footsteps echoing off the walls. Finally, he reached the room that held the secrets of his family's demise – the very place where his parents had met their end. A small plaque on the wall read "Comrade Zhukov", a name Kristaps knew all too well.

As if summoned by his thoughts, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was Ivan Zhukov himself, the man responsible for Kristaps's family's destruction. Their eyes locked in a fierce stare-down, the years of pent-up anger and resentment boiling over like a pot left unattended.

"I should have killed you," Kristaps growled, his voice barely above a whisper.

Zhukov sneered, his eyes cold as stone. "You're too late for that now, Oja. I've lived a good life, enjoyed my share of power and privilege."

Kristaps's hands clenched into fists. For the first time in years, he felt alive, driven by a burning need to make things right. With a fierce determination, he lunged at Zhukov, ready to face whatever lay ahead – justice, revenge, or perhaps something more.

In that moment, Kristaps Oja found his purpose.
