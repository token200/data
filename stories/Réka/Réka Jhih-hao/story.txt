Réka Jhih-hao stepped into the small café on the corner of Main and Elm streets, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee enveloping her like a warm hug. As she waited in line, her eyes wandered around the cozy space, taking in the vintage posters and worn wooden furniture. This was her favorite spot to people-watch and observe the world go by.

Réka Jhih-hao had always been drawn to this café, ever since she first discovered it during a particularly grueling exam period. She would sneak away from her studies to grab a coffee and collect her thoughts before diving back into her textbooks. Over time, the baristas got to know her, and they'd often save her favorite table by the window.

As she waited for her turn at the counter, Réka Jhih-hao couldn't help but think about her day ahead. She had a meeting with her professor to discuss her thesis proposal, and she was determined to nail it. Her passion for environmental engineering was palpable, and she knew that this project would be the turning point in her career.

The barista, a friendly woman named Lily, handed Réka Jhih-hao her coffee with a smile. "You know, Réka Jhih-hao, you're going to do great today," Lily said, as if reading her mind. Réka smiled and nodded, taking a sip of the rich, dark liquid.

With her coffee in hand, Réka Jhih-hao settled into her favorite table by the window and pulled out her notebook. She began to review her notes, making connections between seemingly disparate ideas and brainstorming ways to tackle the challenges ahead. As she worked, the sounds of the café provided a gentle hum of background noise – the clinking of cups, the chatter of patrons, and the occasional bell above the door.

Time flew by as Réka Jhih-hao delved deeper into her work. She was lost in thought, oblivious to the world outside, when Lily poked her head out from behind the counter. "Your meeting with Professor Lee starts soon," she reminded Réka, nudging her gently toward the door. With a final glance at the café, Réka Jhih-hao gathered her things and headed out into the day, ready to tackle whatever lay ahead with confidence and determination.
