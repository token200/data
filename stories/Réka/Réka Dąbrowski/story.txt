One source in particular caught her attention: an elderly woman who claimed to have witnessed a group of shadowy figures lurking around the town's abandoned mine. Réka's heart racing, she scribbled down notes furiously, eager to get to the bottom of the mystery.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting Ravenswood in a golden glow, Réka felt a sense of purpose wash over her. She was getting close, she could feel it. With every new lead and every whispered secret, Réka Dąbrowski was one step closer to uncovering the truth behind Ravenswood's sinister disappearances.
