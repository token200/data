One fateful evening, a wealthy businessman arrived at Réka Leblanc's office, frantic about his missing daughter. The young woman, Sophie, had been last seen leaving a high-end nightclub in the heart of Budapest. As Réka Leblanc listened intently to the businessman's plea, she knew that this case would be no ordinary one.

With a keen eye for detail and a sharp intuition, Réka Leblanc set out to unravel the tangled threads of Sophie's disappearance.

Just when it seemed like all hope was lost, Réka Leblanc stumbled upon an obscure clue that had been overlooked by everyone else.

With justice finally served, Réka Leblanc couldn't help but smile – it was just another day on the job for this clever and resourceful detective. As she left the clock tower with her team, she knew that no case was too impossible for her sharp mind and quick wit, and that Réka Leblanc would always be one step ahead of the game.
