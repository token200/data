Réka Keiko sat alone in her small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and flickering candles. She was a librarian, with eyes that had seen countless pages turn and stories unfold. Her dark hair was tied back in a ponytail, revealing a smattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose.

As she stared blankly at the computer screen in front of her, Réka's mind began to wander. She was supposed to be cataloging books for the library's new database, but her thoughts kept drifting away from it. She thought about her childhood, growing up in a small village on the outskirts of Budapest. She remembered the smell of freshly baked bread wafting through the streets, and the way the sunlight danced across the rooftops.

Réka's phone rang, snapping her back to reality. It was her best friend, Lili, calling from her own apartment just down the hall. "Hey, what's up?" Réka asked, answering in a distracted tone.

"Not much," Lili replied. "Just trying to finish this project for work. Want to come over and study together?"

Réka hesitated for a moment before agreeing. She grabbed her bag and headed out of her apartment, leaving the stacks of books behind. As she walked down the hall, she felt a sense of restlessness. It was as if the dusty pages were calling to her, urging her to turn back and continue cataloging.

When she arrived at Lili's apartment, Réka found her friend engrossed in a spreadsheet on her laptop. "What's going on?" Réka asked, plopping down beside her.

"I'm trying to get my work done," Lili replied, not looking up from the screen. "But I keep getting distracted by this new novel I started reading."

Réka smiled wistfully as she pulled out her own book from her bag – a dog-eared copy of "The Little Prince". She turned to Lili and said, "Sometimes I feel like that's all we're doing – cataloging our lives, instead of truly experiencing them."

Lili looked up, surprised. "You mean, like, with the books?" she asked.

Réka nodded. "Exactly. We spend so much time organizing and categorizing, but do we ever really read what's in front of us?"

Lili smiled back at her friend. "I think that's what makes life worth reading, Réka."

The two friends spent the rest of the evening lost in their books, and Réka finally felt like she was home – among the stories, words, and worlds that brought her so much joy.
