Legend had it that Zerzura was once home to an advanced civilization, one that possessed knowledge and technology far beyond anything the modern world could comprehend. Réka Hébert was determined to find proof of this claim, and she spent years pouring over dusty texts and scouring the dunes for any sign of the city's existence.
