Réka López sat at her desk, staring blankly at the stack of papers in front of her. As a freelance journalist, she had always thrived on deadlines and tight schedules, but lately, it seemed like every assignment was falling through.

Her phone buzzed with an incoming text from her editor: "Hey Réka, what's taking so long? The piece is due tomorrow."

Réka sighed and rubbed her tired eyes. She knew she needed a break, but the thought of explaining herself to her editor again made her stomach twist into knots.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was her best friend, Lila, who had just moved back to Budapest after spending a few years abroad. Réka hadn't seen her in ages, and the two had always been inseparable.

"What brings you here?" Réka asked, as she closed the laptop and gestured for Lila to take a seat.

"I'm here for good this time," Lila said with a grin. "I got a job at a coffee shop near the university, and I just needed some inspiration."

Réka laughed. "You're always full of inspiration. What's new?"

Lila took a deep breath. "I've been thinking about starting a blog again. Remember when we used to write for that old zine together? I had this idea for something that combines my passion for food, culture, and social justice."

Réka's ears perked up. She loved brainstorming ideas with Lila. They spent the next few hours tossing around suggestions, from cooking classes in migrant communities to investigative reporting on food waste.

As they talked, Réka realized that she had been so caught up in her own struggles that she'd forgotten why she started journalism in the first place – to tell stories that needed to be told. With Lila by her side, the ideas began to flow again.

Over coffee and cake at a nearby café, Réka and Lila made plans for a pilot blog post on food access in Budapest's marginalized neighborhoods. As they sipped their coffee and typed away on Réka's laptop, she felt a spark reignite within her – a sense of purpose that had been missing for weeks.

"Thanks for the wake-up call," Réka said, as Lila prepared to leave. "I think I've got my momentum back."

Lila smiled knowingly. "That's what friends are for."
