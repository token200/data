Réka Wolf stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the cool morning air enveloping her like a familiar hug. She had been away for too long, and the small town of Bratislava was starting to feel like home again.

As she made her way through the crowded station, Réka's eyes scanned the bustling streets, taking in the mix of old and new buildings that seemed to blend seamlessly into one another. Her thoughts turned to her latest photography project – a documentary series about the people and places of Slovakia's capital city.

Réka had always been drawn to the beauty and history that lay beneath Bratislava's modern façade. As a child, she spent hours exploring the narrow streets and alleys with her grandmother, listening to stories of their ancestors and the city's complex past. Now, as a successful photographer, Réka was determined to share these same stories with the world.

As she walked through the cobblestone streets, Réka stopped at a small café to grab a coffee and gather her thoughts. The owner, an elderly woman named Janka, recognized her immediately and smiled warmly. "Réka, dear, how long has it been?"

Réka smiled back, taking a seat at the counter. "Long enough, I think."

Janka laughed and refilled Réka's cup with steaming coffee. "Well, come and tell me what brings you back to Bratislava. You've been away for far too long."

Réka took a sip of her coffee, collecting her thoughts before launching into the latest news from her photography project. Janka listened intently, nodding along as Réka spoke about her plans to showcase the city's often-overlooked neighborhoods and stories.

As she finished speaking, Janka leaned in close and whispered, "Réka, I have something for you."

Réka raised an eyebrow, intrigued. Janka produced a small envelope from beneath the counter, which contained a handwritten note with a single address scrawled on it. Réka's eyes widened as she read the words – the long-abandoned Jewish cemetery on the outskirts of town.

"This is where my family used to be buried," Janka explained, her eyes shining with tears. "I've always felt drawn back to this place, and now I think you're meant to find out why."

Réka's heart swelled with emotion as she tucked the note into her pocket, feeling a sense of purpose wash over her. This was what she had been searching for – not just stories or images, but connection and meaning. As she left the café, Réka knew that this new project was going to be one of her most important yet.
