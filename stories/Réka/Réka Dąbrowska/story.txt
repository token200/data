Réka Dąbrowska was known for her striking green eyes and wild mane of curly hair, which seemed to have a life of its own. She was a free spirit, always chasing the next adventure and never staying in one place for too long.

As a young woman, Réka had traveled extensively throughout Europe, immersing herself in different cultures and learning new languages. Her love of history and art led her to become a freelance journalist, writing articles about the most fascinating historical sites and museums she encountered on her travels.

One day, while researching in Budapest, Hungary, Réka stumbled upon an intriguing article about the city's lesser-known Jewish quarter. Intrigued by the stories of refugees and emigrants who had passed through the area during World War II, she decided to embark on a solo journey to uncover more information.

Réka spent weeks poring over dusty archives and speaking with local historians, slowly unraveling the mysteries of the Jewish quarter. She discovered hidden synagogues, forgotten cemeteries, and even an abandoned Jewish school, now converted into a thriving art studio.

As she delved deeper into her research, Réka found herself drawn to the stories of the people who had lived and loved in this very quarter during wartime. Her passion project was taking shape, and she knew she wanted to share it with the world through a book or documentary film.

With each new discovery, Réka's connection to the Jewish community grew stronger. She began attending Shabbat services at a local synagogue and learning traditional recipes from her newfound friends. As she prepared to leave Budapest, the people she had met there came together to bid her farewell, presenting her with a beautiful handmade quilt embroidered with the words "Szerettem" - Hungarian for "I love you".

As Réka Dąbrowska departed Hungary, her heart swelled with gratitude and her mind buzzing with ideas. She knew that this journey was just the beginning of a new chapter in her life, one filled with stories to tell and hearts to connect.
