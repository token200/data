Réka Arias stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the desolate landscape before her. It had been years since she'd last set foot in Budapest, but the memories still lingered, like a fine dust on the corners of her mind.

She had returned to Hungary for one reason: to find answers about her mother's death. The official story was that Réka's mother, Szilvia, had drowned in the Danube River years ago, but Réka's instincts told her otherwise. She had always felt like there was more to the story, and now she was determined to uncover it.

As she made her way through the city streets, Réka couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. The air was thick with the scent of paprika and coffee, but beneath it all, a sense of unease lingered. She quickened her pace, her heels clicking on the pavement as she navigated the narrow alleys.

Eventually, she arrived at her mother's old apartment building, the one where Réka had spent countless hours playing in the garden as a child. The door was padlocked and rusty, but it looked like nothing had changed since she'd left all those years ago.

Réka produced her key from her pocket – one of the few things she'd kept from her mother's belongings – and unlocked the door. Stepping inside, she felt a shiver run down her spine as she took in the familiar creaks and groans of the old wooden floorboards.

She spent the rest of the day exploring every nook and cranny, searching for any sign that might lead her to the truth about her mother's death. The more she searched, the more convinced Réka became that Szilvia had been hiding secrets – secrets that only Réka could uncover now.

As night began to fall, casting long shadows across the city streets, Réka settled into a small café near the riverbank, sipping a coffee and staring out at the water. She couldn't shake the feeling that her mother was trying to communicate with her, whispering something just beyond the reach of her ears.

For the first time in years, Réka felt like she was on the right track. The answers were out there, waiting for her – but they would have to be found by herself, alone in this foreign city where her past and present collided.
