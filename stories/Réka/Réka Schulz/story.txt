Réka Schulz stepped into the small café, scanning the room for any sign of her friend, Emma. She spotted Emma sitting at a corner table, sipping on a cup of coffee and lost in thought.

Réka Schulz made her way over to the table, exchanging warm smiles with Emma as she sat down across from her. "Hey, Em," Réka said, her Hungarian accent softening the request for a hug.

Emma looked up, a hint of sadness still etched on her face. "Hey, Rée," she replied, using the nickname that only a few people were allowed to call her.

Réka Schulz slid into her seat and poured herself a cup of coffee from the pot on the table. The aroma filled the air as Réka took a sip, feeling the caffeine kickstart her day. She had been looking forward to this meeting all week - it was one of their rare solo café dates without Emma's partner, Mike.

As they chatted, Réka Schulz found herself opening up about her latest project at work. It was an exciting new initiative that she was leading, and she couldn't wait to share the details with Emma. Her friend listened intently, offering words of encouragement and support.

The conversation flowed effortlessly, like they were picking up right where they had left off a few weeks ago. Réka Schulz felt grateful for their strong bond - one that transcended distance and life's ups and downs.

As they finished their coffee, Réka Schulz glanced at her watch and realized how late it was getting. "I should probably get going," she said, gathering her things.

Emma nodded, a small smile on her face. "Yeah, me too. But don't worry, I'll make sure to catch up with you soon."

Réka Schulz stood up, giving Emma a hug before heading out into the crisp afternoon air. She felt invigorated and refreshed after their conversation - thanks in part to Réka Schulz's infectious energy and love for life.
