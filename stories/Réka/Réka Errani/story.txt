Réka Errani stepped into the dimly lit room, her eyes scanning the space with an air of caution. As a freelance journalist, she had developed a keen sense for spotting danger lurking beneath the surface. The whispers and rumors of corruption in the city's elite circles had been nagging at her for weeks, and she was determined to get to the bottom of it.

Réka's gaze landed on the figure seated behind the large oak desk. Viktor Kuznetsov, a high-ranking official with ties to several influential families, smiled warmly as he extended his hand. She shook it firmly, her mind racing with calculations.

"So, Réka Errani, I hear you're looking for information," Viktor said, his voice smooth as silk.

Réka nodded, her eyes locked on his. "I'm reporting on the allegations of embezzlement and cronyism that have been circulating in your department."

Viktor chuckled, the sound sending a shiver down Réka's spine. "I assure you, Ms. Errani, our finances are in order. And as for cronyism...well, I believe we've done an exemplary job of supporting local businesses and entrepreneurs."

Réka raised an eyebrow. She had done her research; Viktor's own business empire was riddled with shady dealings and sweetheart deals with corrupt officials. "That may be so," she said coolly, "but the people who really benefit from these practices aren't you or your department. They're the ones with deep pockets."

Viktor's smile faltered for a fraction of a second before he regained his composure. "I think we've covered enough ground for today, don't you, Réka?"

Réka shook her head, a spark of defiance igniting within her. "Not by a long shot," she replied, producing a small notebook and flipping through its pages.

Viktor's eyes narrowed, a flicker of unease dancing in their depths. For the first time that evening, Réka saw something besides warmth and charm emanating from him – anger.

The air grew thick with tension as Viktor leaned forward, his voice dropping to a menacing whisper. "I suggest you leave now, Réka Errani. Before things get... complicated."

Réka didn't flinch. Instead, she pulled out her phone and dialed a number, the sound of ringing growing louder in the silence.

As the room fell silent once more, Viktor's smile had transformed into a scowl. Réka knew then that she had crossed a line – one that would lead her straight into the heart of the corruption she was fighting against.
