Réka White stood at the edge of the city, gazing out at the endless expanse of darkness. The neon lights of Tokyo twinkled like stars in the night sky, but she felt no sense of wonder or awe. Instead, her mind was consumed by the weight of her past.

As a former member of an elite special forces unit, Réka had seen and experienced things that most people couldn't even imagine. She had fought in wars, uncovered conspiracies, and faced down danger at every turn. But it was all coming to an end now.

Réka's unit had been disbanded, and she was forced to leave the only life she had ever known behind. The memories of her comrades, the thrill of battle, and the sense of purpose that came with serving something greater than herself were all fading fast.

As she walked through the city streets, Réka felt lost and alone. She had no idea what the future held, or how to navigate this new world without her unit's support. The noise and chaos of the city seemed to amplify every sound, making it hard for her to focus.

But then, something caught her attention. A young girl, no more than ten years old, was standing on the sidewalk, staring up at Réka with wide eyes. "Are you...are you a superhero?" the girl asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Réka smiled wryly. "I'm not sure about that," she said. "But I used to be part of an elite team that protected this city."

The girl's eyes lit up. "Can I see your uniform? Can I ask you questions?"

Réka hesitated, unsure if she was ready to open herself up like that again. But there was something about the girl's curiosity and enthusiasm that touched her. She rummaged through her bag and pulled out a faded beret, which she handed over to the girl.

As they sat down on a nearby bench, Réka began to answer the girl's questions, sharing stories of her time in the unit and the missions she had completed. For the first time since leaving the unit, Réka felt like herself again – strong, capable, and connected to something bigger than her own struggles.

The girl listened with rapt attention, asking questions that Réka had never even considered before. As they talked, Réka realized that she didn't have to define herself by her past alone. She could forge a new path, one that would allow her to make a difference in this city and in the world, without being tied to an elite unit.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Réka stood up and handed the girl another question – what did she want to do with her life? The girl's eyes sparkled as she thought for a moment before answering: "I want to be a superhero too!"
