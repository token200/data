Réka Lin stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the worn sign that read "Körmend" in faded letters. She had been away from this small Hungarian town for what felt like an eternity, but a letter from her estranged grandmother had brought her back to the place she thought she'd left behind.

Réka's thoughts were consumed by memories of her childhood summers spent exploring the rolling hills and forests surrounding Körmend. Her grandmother, Szilvia, had always been a source of comfort and wonder, teaching Réka the old stories and songs that had been passed down through generations of their family.

As she walked through the quiet streets, Réka noticed the changes that time had brought. New buildings stood alongside the old ones, and the once-thriving factories now seemed abandoned. But it was the people who remained unchanged - the elderly woman on the corner still sold homemade pastries from a rusty cart, and the children playing in the park shouted with laughter as they chased each other around the swings.

Réka's eyes landed on a small, cluttered shop with a faded sign that read "Szilvia's Antiques." She felt a jolt of excitement as she pushed open the door, and was immediately enveloped by the scent of old books and dust. The shop was a treasure trove of memories, filled with trinkets and heirlooms that Réka had always admired from afar.

Behind the counter stood Szilvia herself, her eyes twinkling behind wire-rimmed glasses as she smiled at her granddaughter. "Réka! It's so good to see you, móni." The old woman wrapped a warm hug around Réka's shoulders, holding her close as if no time had passed at all.

Over tea and scones, Szilvia told Réka the story of how she'd written the letter, seeking forgiveness for past mistakes and welcoming her back home. As they sat in the quiet shop, surrounded by the artifacts of their shared history, Réka felt a sense of belonging wash over her. For the first time in years, she felt like she was home.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over Körmend, Réka knew that this journey was just beginning. She would spend the next few weeks helping Szilvia with the shop and listening to stories of their family's past. And as they sat together on the porch, watching the stars twinkle to life above, Réka felt her heart begin to heal - slowly, but surely, it was coming back home.
