Réka Salemi stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar scene before her. The old station was a relic of a bygone era, its wooden beams and faded signs a testament to a time long past. Réka had been back in Budapest for a few days now, but it still felt like a stranger's town.

As she made her way through the crowded streets, Réka couldn't shake the feeling of restlessness that had been building inside her. She had always known that leaving her small village was the right decision, but sometimes the city seemed to swallow her whole. The sounds, the smells, the endless stream of faces – it was overwhelming.

Réka ducked into a small café, ordering a cup of black coffee and taking a seat at the bar. The owner, an old man named József, knew her well enough to ask after her family. Réka smiled wryly, "They're all still back in the village, József. My mother's still tending to the garden, my father's still fixing broken fences." She paused, collecting her thoughts before continuing, "I'm not sure when I'll be able to go back."

As she sipped her coffee, Réka couldn't help but think about her childhood. Growing up in a small village had been idyllic, or so it seemed now. She remembered the long hours spent helping her mother with the garden, the way the sunlight filtered through the trees, casting dappled shadows on the ground. She remembered the sound of the river flowing gently past their doorstep.

Réka's reverie was broken by a gentle voice behind her. "Réka Salemi?" she turned to see an old friend, Szilvi, smiling at her from across the table. The two had grown up together, exploring the village and sharing secrets. Réka's heart swelled with nostalgia as they hugged each other tightly.

As they talked long into the night, Réka knew that even though she was adrift in this great city, a part of her would always remain in that small village, surrounded by the people and places she loved. And maybe, just maybe, someday she'd find her way back home.
