Réka Morgan stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the worn station. She had been on the move for weeks, ever since she'd left behind the life she once knew. The memories still lingered, like a faint scent on her skin – the smell of her mother's perfume, the taste of her father's whiskey.

Réka's gaze drifted towards the old, rusty sign above the ticket counter: "Welcome to Ravenswood". It was a name that stirred something deep within her, a sense of belonging she hadn't felt in years. Her parents had been part of this community, and when they'd left, Réka had followed them west, chasing the promise of a better life.

As she made her way through the station, Réka noticed the curious glances from the locals. She was used to it; people rarely looked at someone with such an unconventional name. But today, she felt a sense of defiance, like she'd shed not just her surname, but also the weight of her past.

Réka's thoughts drifted back to the argument that had driven her away from home. Her parents' voices still echoed in her mind: "You're not good enough", "You'll never make it on your own". She'd fought back, tears blurring her vision, but in the end, she'd walked out, leaving behind everything she knew.

The platform was quiet now, except for the soft chirping of birds outside. Réka pulled out a map and unfolded it, studying the route to her destination: an old family cabin on the outskirts of town. It was where she'd spent countless summers as a child, listening to stories of their ancestors' struggles and triumphs.

As she walked through the mist-shrouded forest, the trees seemed to close in around her, their branches creaking in the wind like whispers from the past. Réka felt a presence watching her, but when she turned, there was no one there. She quickened her pace, her heart pounding with anticipation.

The cabin came into view, its weathered boards worn smooth by time and rain. Réka's hands trembled as she pushed open the creaky door, releasing a musty scent into the air. It was home, at least for tonight. And in this moment, she knew that she'd finally found what she'd been searching for: a place to lay down roots, to rebuild herself from the ashes of her past.
