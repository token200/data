"Thank you for meeting with me," she said softly, her eyes locked on theirs. "I'm Réka Fournier, a journalist with the city's largest newspaper."

The source hesitated, then nodded, and began to spill their story. As Réka Fournier listened intently, her pen scratching furiously across her notebook, she knew that this was the break she had been waiting for.
