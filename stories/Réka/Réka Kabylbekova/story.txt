Réka Kabylbekova stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of the address she had scribbled on a crumpled piece of paper. The cold wind whipped through her dark hair as she wrapped her scarf tighter around her neck.

Born in Budapest, Réka had always felt like an outsider among her peers. Her love of astronomy and mathematics set her apart from her friends, who were content with the traditional Hungarian folk dances and patriotic hymns that filled their school days. ButRéka's heart belonged to the stars, and she spent every spare moment gazing up at the night sky.

As she made her way through the deserted station, Réka felt a sense of restlessness wash over her. She had left behind the familiarity of home to pursue a chance at stardom in Moscow – the world center of astronomy and mathematics. With a deep breath, she squared her shoulders and set off towards the city's bright lights.

Réka's eyes locked onto the faint glow of a small apartment building in the distance. She quickened her pace as she spotted a sign reading 'Maksimova Apartments'. According to her research, this was where Dr. Sofia Maksimova – a renowned astrophysicist and mentor – lived.

Réka's heart skipped a beat as she approached the entrance of the building. Her fingers trembled slightly as she pulled out her phone and dialed a number she had memorized from a friend's conversation with Dr. Maksimova.

To her surprise, Sofia answered on the first ring. "Ah, Réka! I've been expecting you," the voice said over the line.

Réka felt a mix of excitement and trepidation as she stepped into the elevator. What had brought Dr. Maksimova to receive calls from a young stranger in Budapest? And what did this portend for her own future?

As the doors slid open, Réka took a deep breath and stepped out onto the gleaming marble floor of Dr. Maksimova's office. The stars shone bright through the skylight above, and she felt a sense of belonging – as if she had finally found her place among the cosmos.

"Welcome, Réka," Sofia said with a warm smile. "Let us begin your journey."
