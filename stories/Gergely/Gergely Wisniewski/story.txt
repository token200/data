One fateful evening, a wealthy socialite named Lady Victoria arrived at the local police station, her usually composed demeanor ruffled by distress. She implored Gergely Wisniewski to help her find her stolen family heirloom, a priceless diamond necklace that had been passed down through generations of her family. Desperate for answers, she pleaded with him to take on the case.
