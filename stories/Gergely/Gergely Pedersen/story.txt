Gergely Pedersen stepped into the dimly lit pub, scanning the room for a familiar face. As he waited in line to order, he spotted a figure sitting alone at the bar - his old friend, Viktor. Gergely made his way over, taking a seat beside him.

"Viktor! Long time no see," Gergely said with a smile, clapping his friend on the back.

Viktor turned, a hint of a grin on his face. "Gergely Pedersen, it's been too long. How have you been?"

The two friends chatted for a while, catching up on old times and sharing stories about their lives since parting ways years ago. As they talked, Gergely Pedersen couldn't help but feel grateful for the chance encounter.

Just then, the bartender called out Gergely's name, signaling that his drink was ready. He stood up to collect it, taking a moment to glance around the pub once more before returning to Viktor.

As they sipped their drinks in comfortable silence, Gergely Pedersen couldn't help but think about how much he had missed his friend. Their paths had diverged after high school, with Gergely pursuing a career in music while Viktor focused on his business ventures. Yet despite the distance and different pursuits, their friendship remained strong.

As the night wore on, Gergely Pedersen found himself lost in conversation once more, reminiscing about old times and sharing stories of his musical journey. The connection between him and Viktor was palpable, a testament to the enduring power of true friendship.

Eventually, as the pub began to close, Gergely Pedersen stood up to bid farewell to Viktor. "It's been too long," he said, shaking his friend's hand firmly.

Viktor nodded in agreement, his eyes shining with understanding. "We should do this more often."

Gergely smiled, knowing that their friendship was one worth cherishing - and that their paths would continue to cross for years to come.
