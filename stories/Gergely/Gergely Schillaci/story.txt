Gergely Schillaci was a man shrouded in mystery. Few knew much about his past, but whispers of a troubled childhood and a stint in the Hungarian military had become the stuff of legend among those who knew him.

As a young man, Gergely had enlisted in the Hungarian army, hoping to leave his mark on the world. But the harsh realities of war soon took their toll, and he deserted under dubious circumstances. The exact details of what happened that day were lost to history, but rumors swirled that Gergely had been driven mad by the sounds of gunfire and the stench of death.

After his desertion, Gergely vanished from public view, only to reappear years later in the sleepy town of Szeged. There, he opened a small antique shop, where he spent his days haggling over prices and polishing antique trinkets.

But despite his quiet demeanor, whispers persisted that Gergely was more than just a simple merchant. Some claimed to have seen him disappear into the night, only to reappear at dawn with a new tale to tell or a strange artifact in tow. Others spoke of strange symbols etched into the walls of his shop, said to hold mystical powers.

One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Gergely received an unexpected visit from an old acquaintance - a former comrade-in-arms who had tracked him down for years. The man's eyes gleamed with a mix of curiosity and suspicion as he pushed open the door to the antique shop.

"Gergely, my friend," his companion said, his voice dripping with sarcasm, "I see you're still peddling your wares to the unwary. But tell me, what secrets do you keep hidden behind those enigmatic eyes?"

Gergely smiled, a hint of mischief playing on his lips. "Perhaps some things are better left unspoken," he replied, his voice low and measured.

The old comrade snorted in derision, but Gergely's gaze held him transfixed. For an instant, it seemed as though the world had narrowed to just two men, locked in a silent battle of wits and secrets.

Then, with a faint smile, Gergely turned back to his shop, leaving his companion to ponder the mysteries that lay within its walls. The old man shook his head, muttering to himself as he walked away into the night - for some secrets were indeed better left unspoken.
