Gergely Dan trudged through the rain-soaked streets, his eyes fixed on the pavement as if willing the droplets to disappear. A former detective with the Budapest Police Department, he had seen it all – from murder investigations to child abductions. But after a high-profile case went sour, leaving an innocent woman accused and wrongly imprisoned, Gergely's reputation was tarnished.

Now, at 55, he worked as a private investigator in his small office above the bakery on Andrássy Avenue. It wasn't exactly the most fulfilling job, but it paid the bills and gave him some semblance of purpose.

As he entered his office, a bell above the door rang out, signaling the arrival of his next client. A young woman, no more than 25 years old, hovered nervously by the window, clutching a small suitcase. She introduced herself as Szofi, and explained that her sister had gone missing three days ago.

Gergely listened intently, his mind racing with possibilities. He asked questions, made notes, and began to scan the room for any signs of surveillance. Szofi handed him a photograph – a snapshot of her sister's phone before it went dark. The image revealed nothing out of the ordinary, just a string of social media updates and a cryptic text message that read "Meet me at the lake."

Gergely nodded thoughtfully. Lake Balaton was over 100 kilometers from Budapest, far too far for someone to just disappear in such short notice. He knew his sister, Lili, had been missing for years before she was found dead in a similar situation – the killer was never caught.

He asked Szofi about her relationship with her sister. Her eyes welled up as she recounted their close bond and the last conversation they'd had. Gergely's instincts told him that there was more to this case than met the eye.

Just then, his phone rang. The Budapest Police Department was calling – a case that matched Szofi's description was reported at Lake Balaton. It seemed fate had caught up with him once again. With a resolute gaze, Gergely grabbed his trenchcoat and headed out into the rain-soaked night, ready to unravel another mystery.
