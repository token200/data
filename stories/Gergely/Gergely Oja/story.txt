As word of his talent spread, Gergely Oja was soon playing sold-out shows in Budapest's underground clubs, earning a devoted following among fans of experimental folk. His music was a fusion of old and new, with eerie synths conjuring up images of haunted forests and haunting melodies that seemed to summon the spirits of the past.

And yet, despite all the attention he received, Gergely Oja remained true to his roots, drawing inspiration from the traditional songs of Hungary and weaving them into his modern sound.

One night, as he took the stage at a packed club in Prague, Gergely Oja began to play with a quiet intensity that was both captivating and unnerving.
