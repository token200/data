Gergely Szymanski, known to his friends and family as Gerry, was a man with a penchant for adventure. Growing up in the small town of Żywiec, Poland, he had always felt suffocated by the monotony of rural life. As soon as he graduated from high school, he set off on a journey that would take him to the farthest corners of Europe.

Gerry's love affair with photography began during his travels, where he captured the beauty of street art in cities like Berlin and Prague. He became captivated by the world of documentation, not just of people and places but also of moments in time. His photographs told stories that needed to be heard and seen.

As a wandering photographer, Gerry's life was filled with fleeting moments of connection with strangers he met along the way. There was Maria in Barcelona, who introduced him to tapas and flamenco; Kostantin in Moscow, who took him on a tour of Soviet-era landmarks under the guise of history lessons; and finally, Eva in Vienna, where they danced to Mozart's melodies until dawn.

But it was his encounter with Janina that changed Gerry's life. She was a young woman from Krakow who joined him for a few days of exploration in Prague. As they wandered through the winding streets of the Old Town, Janina shared her stories about growing up in Poland during communism. The way she spoke made Gerry feel seen and understood in ways he never had before.

Janina left as suddenly as she appeared, leaving Gerry with more questions than answers. He continued to travel, but a new sense of purpose emerged within him. He decided to use his photography skills not just to capture moments but also to tell the stories that needed to be told – stories about people and places often overlooked by history books.

Gerry returned to Żywiec with a newfound passion for his home town's rich cultural heritage. His photographs showcased the lives of ordinary people who made extraordinary contributions to their communities. The stories he shared through his lens brought attention to forgotten corners of Poland, shedding light on the beauty and diversity that lay just beyond the edges of traditional narratives.

Years later, Gerry's photographs had become a staple in museums and galleries across Europe, telling the world about the power of ordinary people to shape extraordinary histories. And though he still roamed the continent, his true home remained Żywiec, where he had discovered not only his purpose but also a family of sorts – a group of friends who understood him like no one else did.
