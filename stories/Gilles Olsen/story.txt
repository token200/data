Gilles Olsen stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the small station as if searching for someone. It was a habit he'd developed over the years, one that had served him well in his line of work. As a freelance journalist, he'd spent countless hours on planes, trains, and automobiles, always keeping his wits about him.

He spotted a figure waiting by the exit and smiled to himself. That must be Élodie, his contact for this story. He walked towards her, his long legs eating up the distance between them.

"Bonjour, Gilles," she said, with a warm smile. "Welcome to Marseille."

Gilles nodded, taking in the sights and sounds of the bustling station. He'd been working on this piece for weeks, researching the connections between corruption and organized crime in the city's port.

"I've got my notes right here," Élodie said, handing him a folder filled with documents and photographs. "But I think we need to talk before we start."

Gilles nodded, tucking the folder into his bag as they walked out of the station. The sun was setting over the Mediterranean, casting a golden glow over the city.

"What's on your mind?" Gilles asked, leading Élodie through the winding streets of Marseille.

"It's not just about the port," she said, her voice low and serious. "It's about the entire system. Corruption goes all the way to the top, Gilles. You're dealing with some very powerful people."

Gilles whistled softly. He'd suspected as much, but he wasn't sure if he was ready for it.

"We need to tread carefully," Élodie continued. "I've got a source who's willing to talk, but we need to make sure they're protected. The last time someone came forward with information... well, let's just say it didn't end well."

Gilles nodded, his mind racing with the implications. This story had the potential to be big, but it also came with risks.

As they walked, Gilles pulled out his notebook and began to jot down notes. He was a man who liked to prepare, and he knew that this story would require all his skills and experience.

The two of them stopped at a small café on the waterfront, ordering coffee and sitting in silence for a moment as they took in the views.

"Thanks for meeting me," Gilles said finally, looking up at Élodie. "I owe you one."

Élodie smiled, her eyes sparkling with amusement. "Just be careful, Gilles. This city has a way of getting under your skin."

Gilles raised an eyebrow, but he knew she was right. He'd been working in Marseille for months now, and he could feel the city's energy coursing through his veins like blood.

As they finished their coffee, Gilles stood up, tucking his notebook into his bag. "I'm ready to start digging," he said, a sense of excitement building in his chest.

Élodie nodded, standing up beside him. Together, they walked out of the café and back onto the platform, where the train was waiting to take them on their next adventure.
