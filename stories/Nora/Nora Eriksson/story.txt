Nora Eriksson stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of her contact. As a journalist investigating the mysterious disappearance of several prominent business leaders in the small town of Ravenswood, she had received a cryptic tip that led her to this very place.

She spotted a figure in the corner, dressed in a long coat and wearing a wide-brimmed hat. "Nora Eriksson?" they called out, as if they knew exactly who she was.

Nora nodded, her heart rate quickening with anticipation. She approached the stranger cautiously, noticing that their features seemed to shift in the dim light of the station.

"You're the one I've been looking for," the figure said finally, producing a small key from their pocket. "I'm given to understand you have questions about the Ravenswood Enigma."

Nora's mind was racing as she took the key, her fingers wrapping around it like a lifeline. "What is this thing?" she asked, tucking the key into her bag.

The figure smiled wryly. "You'll find out soon enough," they said. "But for now, let me just say that Nora Eriksson, you're not who you think you are."

Nora's eyes narrowed. "What do you mean?"

"You're a piece of the puzzle, Nora Eriksson," her contact replied, before turning and disappearing into the crowd.

She stood there for a moment, the words echoing in her mind like a mantra. Who was she, really? What had happened to the people she'd been investigating?

As she walked away from the station, the key digging into her pocket, Nora felt a sense of determination wash over her. She would uncover the truth about Ravenswood, no matter what secrets lay hidden beneath its surface.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Nora Eriksson stepped out into the night, ready to face whatever lay ahead. The puzzle had just gotten a lot more interesting.
