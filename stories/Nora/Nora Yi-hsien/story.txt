Nora Yi-hsien was a woman of mystery, with a reputation that preceded her wherever she went. A master thief and con artist, she had a knack for getting in and out of the most secure locations without leaving a trace. Her true identity was unknown, but her skills were unmatched.

One night, Nora Yi-hsien received a message from an old acquaintance, inviting her to meet at a luxurious mansion on the outskirts of town. The pay was too good to pass up, and Nora Yi-hsien agreed to take on the job. She spent hours casing the location, studying the security cameras and alarms that protected the mansion.

As she entered the mansion, Nora Yi-hsien was greeted by her contact, a wealthy businessman who handed her a small briefcase filled with cash. "The package is in the safe room," he whispered, before disappearing into the night. Nora Yi-hsien smiled to herself, knowing that this was going to be an easy score.

She made her way to the safe room, avoiding the guards and security cameras with ease. Inside, she found a small box containing a valuable artifact, which she quickly retrieved and stuffed into her bag. As she left the mansion, Nora Yi-hsien couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. She had pulled off the heist without being detected.

But as she walked away from the mansion, Nora Yi-hsien noticed a figure watching her from across the street. It was a woman with piercing green eyes, and she seemed to be sizing Nora Yi-hsien up. For a moment, the two women locked eyes, before the mysterious woman vanished into thin air.

Nora Yi-hsien was left standing alone, wondering who the woman had been and what her game was. She shrugged it off, knowing that in her line of work, you couldn't trust anyone. With the artifact safely in hand, Nora Yi-hsien disappeared into the night, ready to take on her next mark.
