Nora Nieminen walked into the small café on the corner, her eyes scanning the crowded room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting in the back, sipping a cup of coffee and staring out the window. It had been months since they'd last seen each other, but Nora's thoughts of him still lingered.

She made her way through the crowd, exchanging smiles with regulars along the way. As she approached her friend's table, he looked up and caught her eye, a hint of a smile playing on his lips. "Nora Nieminen," he said, standing up to greet her.

They hugged warmly, and Nora settled into the seat across from him. It felt like no time had passed at all – they fell into their old rhythm of easy conversation and laughter. The café's owner, a friendly woman named Maria, brought over a tray of freshly baked pastries, which Nora eagerly devoured.

As they chatted, Nora couldn't help but notice the way her friend's eyes crinkled at the corners when he smiled. It was a small thing, but it made her feel all warm inside. They talked about everything and nothing – their jobs, their families, their favorite books and movies.

At one point, Nora mentioned that she'd been working on a new writing project, and her friend's eyes lit up with interest. "Tell me more," he said, leaning forward in his seat. And so Nora launched into a passionate explanation of her ideas, losing herself in the process.

As the afternoon wore on, the café began to empty out. Maria came over to refill their coffee cups, and Nora caught her friend's gaze, feeling a spark of connection between them. It was as if no time had passed at all – they were back to where they'd started, lost in each other's company.

As Nora prepared to leave, her friend walked her out into the cool evening air. They stood on the sidewalk, looking up at the stars beginning to twinkle overhead. "I've missed you, Nora Nieminen," he said, his voice low and sincere. And Nora knew exactly how she felt.
