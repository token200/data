Nora Piątek was a brilliant and resourceful young artist living in the vibrant city of Krakow, Poland. With her wild curly brown hair and bright green eyes, she had a way of capturing the essence of her surroundings on canvas.

As a child, Nora had always been fascinated by the intricate patterns and colors of traditional Polish folk art. She spent hours watching her grandmother, Babcia Piątek, weave beautiful tapestries in their cozy apartment. The stories Babcia would tell her about the mythology and history behind each design sparked Nora's imagination, inspiring her to create her own unique style.

Growing up, Nora's art teacher encouraged her to explore different mediums, from painting to sculpture.
