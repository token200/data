Nora Järv stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar landscape of Helsinki's eastern suburbs. It was a place she knew well, where the smell of freshly baked rye bread wafted from the local bakery and the sounds of laughter and arguments mingled in the air.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Nora felt a sense of nostalgia wash over her. This was where she had grown up, where she had explored the woods and swum in the lakes as a child. It was where she had first met her late mother, who had taken her under her wing and taught her everything there was to know about Finnish folklore.

Nora's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps behind her. She turned to see her best friend, Sofia, hurrying towards her with a look of concern etched on her face.

"Nora, I've been looking all over for you," Sofia said, as she caught up to Nora on the sidewalk. "Your phone's been blowing up with calls from your grandma. What's going on?"

Nora hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. But Sofia was someone she trusted, and besides, her grandma would never keep a secret.

"It's just my mom," Nora said finally, trying to simplify things. "She's been acting really weird lately, and I think she might be planning something."

Sofia raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean?"

Nora sighed, feeling the familiar weight of responsibility settle onto her shoulders. Her mother had always been a bit of a mystery, but this was different. This felt like something big.

As they walked through the streets, Sofia filled Nora in on what she'd heard about her mom's plans. Apparently, it involved a series of cryptic phone calls and whispered conversations with some shady characters.

Nora's mind was racing by the time they reached their favorite café. She took a deep breath, trying to clear the fog from her thoughts.

"I think I know what my mom is up to," Nora said finally, her voice barely above a whisper. "I think she's been working on this folklore project for years – and now that it's almost finished, she's planning to reveal something huge."

Sofia's eyes widened in surprise. "What kind of thing?"

Nora shrugged, feeling the familiar thrill of adventure course through her veins. "That's still a mystery," she said with a smile. Together, they sat down at a table and ordered their coffee, ready to take on whatever lay ahead.

After all, when you're from Helsinki, nothing surprises you – but sometimes, that's exactly what you need.
