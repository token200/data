Nora KalÄ“ja sat at her small wooden desk, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and scribbled notes. She was a woman of few words, with piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into those she met. Her long, dark hair was often tied back in a tight bun, revealing a face etched with deep lines and scars.

As a skilled healer, Nora had spent years studying the ancient traditions of her people. She was well-versed in the art of herbalism, able to coax even the most reluctant plants into bloom. Her hands moved with a precision that belied their rough exterior, as if they were delicate flowers themselves.

But Nora's greatest gift lay not in her knowledge of potions and remedies, but in her ability to listen. She had spent years honing this skill, learning to hear the whispers of those who came to her for aid. In a world where words were often used as a shield, Nora was able to see beyond them, to the hearts that beat beneath.

It was on one such day that a young woman named Ava stumbled into Nora's small cottage. Her eyes were red-rimmed from crying, and her voice trembled with fear. "I've lost my child," she whispered, over and over again. Nora listened, her face a mask of compassion. She handed Ava a steaming cup of tea, and led her to the garden outside.

There, amidst the riot of colors and scents, Nora revealed a small, delicate flower that bloomed only once a year. It was a symbol of hope, of resilience in the face of loss. As Ava gazed upon it, her tears slowed, and then finally stopped. For the first time in weeks, she felt a glimmer of peace.

Nora smiled softly, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "This is what healing looks like," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "It's not about fixing the wounds, but about finding the beauty that can be found within them." As Ava left Nora's cottage, she felt lighter, freer. She knew that she would carry the memory of this small flower with her always, and that one day, it would bloom again in her heart.
