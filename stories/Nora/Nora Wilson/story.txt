Nora Wilson trudged through the rain-soaked streets of Portland, her umbrella blowing inside out in the strong gusts of wind. A free-spirited artist, she was no stranger to braving the elements, but tonight felt different. Tonight felt like a reckoning.

As she turned onto her street, the neon lights of her apartment building flickered to life, welcoming her home. Nora pushed open the door and stomped inside, shaking the rain off her coat. She hung it up on the hook and made a beeline for the kitchen, where she grabbed two mugs and filled them with steaming hot coffee.

Nora Wilson took a sip of her coffee and let out a deep breath, feeling the warmth spread through her chilled bones. She pulled out a sketchbook from behind the couch cushion and began to draw, lost in the world of lines and colors that brought her so much joy.

But even as she created, her mind wandered back to the argument she'd had with her best friend, Rachel, earlier that day. They'd been at odds for weeks, their friendship strained by differing opinions on everything from politics to art. Nora had tried to brush it off, but the wound still lingered.

Just then, the doorbell rang, shrill in the quiet evening. Nora sighed and made her way to answer it, hoping against hope that Rachel wouldn't be there. But when she opened the door, instead of her friend's familiar face, she was met with a surprise visitor: Jack, an old flame from high school who'd reappeared in Nora Wilson's life just as unexpectedly.

Jack stood on her porch, his eyes shining with a mix of excitement and apology. "Hey, Noreen," he said, using the nickname only she called him by. "I know we've been apart for years, but I had to come see you. I'm sorry about what happened between us."

Nora's heart skipped a beat as she took in Jack's words. She felt a spark of attraction ignite within her, tempered by memories of their tumultuous past. But as she looked into his eyes, she saw something there that gave her pause â€“ a glimmer of hope, perhaps, or maybe just plain old-fashioned curiosity.

"What do you want, Jack?" Nora Wilson asked finally, her voice firm but guarded. She knew that the answer would depend on what he said next.
