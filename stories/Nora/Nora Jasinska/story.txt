Nora Jasinska stepped into the dimly lit jazz club, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She had heard that Jack Harris, the legendary saxophonist, would be performing tonight, and she was determined to catch his set.

As a music journalist, Nora had written extensively about Jack's career, and she had developed a deep appreciation for his unique sound. She had met him once before, at a conference in New York City, but their conversation had been cut short when he was rushed off stage due to a sudden illness.

Nora took a seat at the bar, ordering a whiskey as she waited for the music to start. She had always loved Jack's improvisational style, and she couldn't wait to see him in action. As the band began to play, Nora felt a surge of excitement coursing through her veins.

Just as the opening chords struck her ears, Jack Harris emerged from the shadows, his saxophone case slung over his shoulder. He took a deep breath, raised his instrument to his lips, and let out a soulful wail that sent shivers down Nora's spine.

As the night wore on, Nora found herself lost in the music, her notebook and pen forgotten on the table. She had written countless reviews of Jack's performances over the years, but she knew that this one would be different. There was something special about the way he played tonight, a depth and emotion that seemed to come from somewhere deeper within him.

As the final notes faded away, Nora rose from her seat, applauding along with the rest of the audience. She made her way backstage, determined to get some words of wisdom from the man himself. As she found Jack sitting in his dressing room, sipping a cup of coffee, she couldn't help but feel grateful for this chance encounter.

"Mr. Harris," Nora said, trying to sound casual despite the excitement building inside her. "I'm so glad I caught your set tonight. You were incredible."
