Nora Sandström stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. It had been months since she'd last seen her old friend, and the excitement of being reunited with Lena was palpable.

As she spotted Lena across the room, Nora's face broke into a wide smile. She made her way over to the table, where Lena was sipping on a cup of coffee.

"Nora Sandström!" Lena exclaimed, standing up to greet her friend. "It's been ages!"

Nora laughed and hugged Lena tightly. "I know, it feels like an eternity since we last spoke," she said, settling into the chair across from Lena.

The two friends spent the next hour catching up on each other's lives, discussing everything from their jobs to their love lives. Nora was amazed at how much Lena had changed – her hair was shorter, and she seemed more confident than ever before.

As they chatted, Nora couldn't help but notice the way Lena's eyes sparkled in the dim light of the café. She felt a pang of jealousy, wondering what it would be like to see those same sparkling eyes looking at her.

But for now, Nora was content to simply enjoy Lena's company. The two friends talked and laughed together, lost in their own little world of nostalgia and reminiscence.

As the evening wore on, Nora realized that she had been feeling a bit lost lately – uncertain about her place in the world and her future. Talking with Lena made her feel more grounded, like she was reconnecting with a part of herself that she'd forgotten existed.

"Thank you for tonight, Lena," Nora said, as they parted ways outside the café. "I needed this."

Lena smiled and hugged Nora tightly. "Anytime, Nora Sandström. We're not done yet – there's still so much to catch up on."
