Nora Yan had always been fascinated by the world of science fiction. As a child, she spent hours poring over books and watching old VHS tapes of her favorite shows. So when she stumbled upon an obscure comic book store in her neighborhood, it was like hitting the jackpot.

The store's owner, a kind-eyed old man named Joe, took Nora under his wing and taught her everything he knew about the medium. He introduced her to the works of Frank Miller, Alan Moore, and Neil Gaiman - writers who had inspired some of the most iconic characters in science fiction history.

As she delved deeper into the world of comics, Nora began to notice that some of these characters seemed...familiar. Like a friend from childhood. And then it hit her: she was staring at a character that looked uncannily like herself.

It turned out that Joe had been working on a secret project - a comic book series featuring a young protagonist named Nora Yan, a brilliant and feisty scientist who found herself trapped in a world of advanced technology and intergalactic politics. The more Nora read about her namesake, the more she felt a connection to the character.

But as much as she wanted to believe that Nora Yan was just a fictional creation, Nora couldn't shake off the feeling that there was something real about her. Something special.

As the days turned into weeks, Nora found herself becoming more and more obsessed with the comic book series. She spent hours poring over each issue, searching for clues about the world of Nora Yan. And then, one night, it hit her - a phrase written in the margins of one particularly rare issue: "The universe has chosen you, Nora."

From that moment on, Nora knew that she was meant to be Nora Yan. The science fiction writer and artist who had created her was actually...her.
