Nora Salamanca, the daughter of Gus Fring's arch-nemesis Hector Salamanca, walked down the dimly lit alleyway with purpose. Her piercing green eyes scanned the area, searching for any sign of her target.

As a skilled assassin and hitwoman, Nora had honed her skills in the shadows of Albuquerque's underworld. With a reputation for being merciless and efficient, she had earned the nickname "The Phantom" among those who knew her.

Nora's thoughts drifted back to her past, when she was just a teenager, living with her father in Mexico City. Hector's brutal actions had left an indelible mark on her, fueling her desire for revenge against those who had wronged her family.

She arrived at the designated location, a seedy bar on the outskirts of town, where her source had informed her that her target would be making an appearance. Nora slipped inside, blending in with the crowd as she waited for her quarry to arrive.

The door swung open and a young man, no more than 25 years old, walked in. Nora's eyes locked onto him, her gaze piercing through the darkness. This was her man â€“ a high-ranking member of a local crime family who had been causing trouble for her father's business.

Without hesitation, Nora made her move, slipping behind the bar and using her agility to take down the young man with swift efficiency. As he slumped against the wall, Nora smiled, a cold, calculating smile that sent shivers down the spines of those around her.

She had done it again, proving herself to be one of the deadliest assassins in the business. And yet, as she turned to leave, Nora couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more to this hit than met the eye. A nagging sense of unease settled in the pit of her stomach, fueling a burning desire for justice.

For Nora Salamanca, there was no escape from the darkness that drove her. She was forever bound to the shadows, forced to confront the demons that haunted her every step. But she wouldn't have it any other way. The Phantom would always reign supreme, feared and respected by all who crossed her path.
