Nora Mercier stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the quaint town below. The once-thriving industrial center had seen better days, but there was something about this place that drew her in. Perhaps it was the promise of a fresh start or the whisper of secrets hidden within its crumbling walls.

As she made her way through the deserted streets, Nora Mercier couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. She quickened her pace, her hand instinctively reaching for the small notebook tucked away in her pocket. It was a habit she'd developed after years of relying on her wits to survive.

The town's dilapidated shops and eateries lined the main street, each one bearing the scars of time. Nora Mercier passed by the old diner, its neon sign flickering like a dying heartbeat, and continued down the hill toward the river. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and decay, but she breathed it in deeply, feeling a sense of peace wash over her.

As she reached the river's edge, Nora Mercier spotted an old man sitting on a bench, his eyes fixed intently on the water. He seemed out of place among the town's faded grandeur, but there was something about him that drew her in. She approached cautiously, not wanting to startle him, and took a seat beside him.

"Mind if I join you?" she asked, trying to sound nonchalant despite the flutter in her chest.

The old man turned, his eyes squinting with age, but a hint of warmth crept into their depths. "Not at all," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "I'm just watching the river flow."

Nora Mercier smiled wistfully, feeling an inexplicable connection to this stranger. She pulled out her notebook and began to sketch the river's winding path, the old man watching with interest as she worked.

For the first time in years, Nora Mercier felt like she was home.
