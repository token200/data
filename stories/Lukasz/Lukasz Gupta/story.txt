Lukasz Gupta was known for his unique approach to art. As a sculptor, he spent most of his days hunched over his workbench, surrounded by half-finished pieces and scraps of clay. His friends and family often joked that Lukasz Gupta was more comfortable with dirt than people, but they were wrong. Despite his rough exterior, Lukasz Gupta had a heart of gold.

One day, while wandering through the city streets, Lukasz Gupta stumbled upon a small children's hospital. The sounds of crying children and beeping machines filled the air as he pushed open the door. He was immediately struck by the sheer number of people caring for these tiny humans – nurses, doctors, and volunteers all working tirelessly to make their patients feel better.

Feeling inspired, Lukasz Gupta decided to create a special piece of art just for the children's hospital. He spent hours collecting clay and shaping it into small figurines of animals, people, and fantastical creatures. When he finished, he had created a menagerie of over 50 pieces, each one unique and full of character.

The next morning, Lukasz Gupta arrived at the hospital to find that his creations had already been set up in the main lobby.
