Lukasz Kentaro was a man of mystery and intrigue. A master of disguise and deception, he had made a name for himself in the dark alleys of Tokyo's underbelly. His reputation as a skilled thief and con artist was whispered about in hushed tones by those who knew him.

Despite his dubious profession, Lukasz Kentaro had a certain charm that drew people to him.
