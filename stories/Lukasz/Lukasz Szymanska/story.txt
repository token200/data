His attention to detail and dedication to authenticity earned him a reputation as one of the top restorers in the country.

As the years passed, Lukasz Szymanska continued to hone his craft, always seeking ways to improve and expand his services. He became known for his ability to coax even the most stubborn engines back into working order, and his shop became a mecca for car enthusiasts. Despite his success, however, Lukasz remained humble, always willing to lend a helping hand or offer advice to those in need.

For Lukasz Szymanska, there was no greater joy than seeing an old car come alive under his skilled hands. His passion had taken him on an incredible journey, and he knew that as long as he had the garage and the tools to create, there would be no end to the beauty and wonder of restoration.
