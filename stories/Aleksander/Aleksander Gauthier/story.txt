Aleksander Gauthier stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station as if searching for a ghost. It had been years since he'd set foot in Ravenswood, the town where his family had made their fortune on coal mining. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and decay, a reminder that not everything here was as it seemed.

Gauthier's thoughts were consumed by the letter he'd received from an unknown sender. It hinted at a dark secret buried beneath Ravenswood, one that threatened to upend his entire world. He couldn't shake the feeling that someone – or something – was watching him, waiting for him to take a step forward.

As he made his way through the deserted streets, the buildings seemed to loom over him like sentinels. Gauthier's family had always been pillars of the community, but now it felt like they were hiding something from him. The once-mighty factory that had brought prosperity to Ravenswood now stood as a symbol of decline.

Gauthier stopped at the local pub, where he knew the bartender would pour him a whiskey without question. Inside, the fire crackled and spat, casting flickering shadows on the walls. He asked about the letter, but the bartender's expression was guarded, as if he'd rather die than talk about it.

Outside, the night air seemed to press in around Gauthier, making his skin prickle with unease. The darkness felt like a living thing, one that pulsed with a malevolent energy. He wondered if he had made a mistake coming back to Ravenswood – or if this was just the beginning of something much bigger.

A gust of wind carried the faint sound of whispers, but when Gauthier spun around, there was no one there. The voices seemed to be coming from all directions at once, echoing off the buildings and reverberating through his own mind. He knew then that he wasn't alone in Ravenswood. Someone – or something – had been waiting for him.

As the night wore on, Gauthier became increasingly convinced that the letter was more than just a prank. It was a warning, one that hinted at an ancient evil lurking beneath the town's surface. The thought sent a shiver down his spine and left him with only one question: what did he plan to do about it?
