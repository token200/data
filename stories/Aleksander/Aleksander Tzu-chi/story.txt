After weeks of searching, Lin finally found himself standing before an unassuming door in a remote village.

Aleksander Tzu-chi began to guide Lin on a journey of self-discovery, sharing secrets and teachings passed down through generations. With each passing moment, Lin felt his understanding of the world expand, as if the very fabric of reality was being woven before him.

As the night wore on, Lin realized that he had found not only the elusive master but also a mentor for life itself – Aleksander Tzu-chi. And so, under the wise guidance of this mystical qigong master, Lin embarked upon a path that would change his destiny forever, guided by the wisdom and teachings of Aleksander Tzu-chi.
