Aleksander's ultimate goal was to infiltrate the highest echelons of power and manipulate global events from behind the scenes. He was driven by a desire to right the wrongs of his past and secure a better future for himself and those he cared about.

One fateful night, Handschuh received a cryptic message from an unknown source. The message read: "The Phoenix is rising." Intrigued, Aleksander began to dig deeper, uncovering a web of conspiracy that threatened to upend the very foundations of international politics.

With his skills honed to perfection, Handschuh embarked on a perilous journey to unravel the truth behind the mysterious message.
