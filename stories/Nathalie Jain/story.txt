Nathalie Jain stepped into the crowded cafe, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. It had been months since she'd last seen her grandmother, Mala, and the smell of freshly brewed coffee wafting through the air was like a warm hug.

As she waited in line, Nathalie's mind wandered back to her childhood summers spent at Mala's side in this very cafe. She remembered the way Mala would tell stories of their ancestors' journeys from India to America, and the laughter that would erupt as they devoured plates of steaming naan bread.

When it was finally her turn to order, Nathalie spotted a familiar figure at the counter - her grandmother, sitting alone with a cup of coffee and a warm smile. Mala's silver hair was styled in its signature braids, and her eyes sparkled behind a pair of reading glasses perched on the end of her nose.

"Nathalie!" Mala exclaimed, as Nathalie wrapped her arms around her in a tight hug. "It's so good to see you, beta."

Beta, or child, was an affectionate term used by Indians to address their younger relatives. Nathalie felt a lump form in her throat as she pulled back and took in the look of her grandmother - tired eyes and a worn face, but still radiating warmth and love.

Mala motioned for Nathalie to take a seat beside her, and as they sipped their coffee together, Nathalie asked about Mala's latest adventures. It turned out that Mala had recently started teaching English at the local community college, and was loving every minute of it.

As they chatted, Nathalie found herself opening up to Mala in ways she hadn't with anyone else in a long time. She told her about her struggles as a freelance writer, and her frustrations with the online world that seemed to value clicks over substance. Mala listened attentively, nodding her head and making supportive noises.

But when Nathalie mentioned her recent feelings of disconnection from her Indian heritage, Mala's expression turned serious. "You are not defined by your culture or your background, beta," she said gently. "Your strength lies in who you are today - a smart, compassionate woman with so much to offer the world."

Nathalie felt tears prick at the corners of her eyes as she listened to Mala's words. It was exactly what she needed to hear - a reminder that she was more than just her ancestors' stories or traditions.

As they finished their coffee and prepared to part ways, Nathalie hugged Mala tightly once more. "Thank you for being my rock, Grandma," she whispered.

Mala smiled, her eyes shining with love. "I'll always be here for you, beta. Now go out there and make me proud."
