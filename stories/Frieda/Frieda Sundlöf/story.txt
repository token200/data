She felt an instant connection to the piece, sensing that it held a story of its own. The shopkeeper, a wispy-haired man with a kind smile, noticed her interest and approached.

"Ah, you've found the Lovestruck Lullaby," he said, his voice low and soothing. "A true beauty, isn't it?"

Frieda's eyes lit up as she gently lifted the music box from its shelf. She turned the lid, releasing a soft, melancholic tune that seemed to fill the air with longing.

Back in her own home, Frieda carefully wound the music box and listened as it played its haunting melody. As she sat in silence, lost in thought, Frieda felt a sense of satisfaction wash over her. Another piece added to her collection, but also a new puzzle to unravel – one that promised to reveal the story behind the Lovestruck Lullaby.
