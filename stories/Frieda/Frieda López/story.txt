Frieda López stared out the rain-soaked window of her small apartment, watching as the droplets slid down the pane like tears from a broken heart. It was a sentiment that resonated deeply with her, for she had been carrying around a sense of sorrow and longing for what felt like an eternity.

As a freelance writer and artist, Frieda López had always found solace in the creative process. She spent most of her days lost in the world of words and colors, churning out stories and paintings that seemed to capture the essence of the human experience. But lately, even those outlets hadn't been enough to lift her spirits.

Her mind kept wandering back to him - to the way he used to smile at her, to the way his eyes crinkled at the corners when he laughed, to the way his voice sounded like music in her ears. It had all felt so real, so true, just a short time ago. Now, it seemed like a distant memory, a fleeting dream that she couldn't quite grasp.

Frieda López sighed and turned away from the window, wandering over to her easel and picking up a brush. She dipped it in paint and began to block out the shapes of a landscape - rolling hills, towering mountains, the endless expanse of a blue sky. It was a familiar scene, one that she had painted countless times before, but today it felt different.

As she worked, Frieda López's thoughts began to wander back to her childhood, to the stories her abuela used to tell her about love and heartbreak. She remembered how those stories would make her feel - small and safe and loved. And suddenly, a sense of clarity washed over her.

Frieda López put down her brush and stepped away from the canvas, feeling a renewed sense of purpose. Maybe, just maybe, she could find a way to channel this pain into something beautiful. She picked up her phone and dialed a number, her heart pounding with anticipation as she waited for an answer.

It rang several times before a voice picked up on the other end - warm, familiar, and full of love. "Hola, m'hija," it said. Frieda López smiled, feeling a sense of peace wash over her once again. Maybe, just maybe, this heartbreak wouldn't be so bad after all.
