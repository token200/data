Frieda Altmann stood at the edge of the old wooden pier, her eyes scanning the murky waters of the lake. The air was heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, but she barely noticed it. Her mind was consumed by the words etched into the weathered sign that creaked in the breeze: "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."

It was a cruel joke, really. Frieda had entered this forsaken place with a sense of determination and purpose. She'd inherited her great-aunt's old Victorian house from a distant relative she'd never met, and now it was hers to fix up or tear down as she pleased.

The once-grand mansion loomed before her, its turrets and gargoyles covered in ivy and moss. Frieda had always felt a connection to this place, ever since she was a child listening to her great-aunt's tales of the old days. Her aunt had been a recluse, but when she did talk, it was always about this very house and its secrets.

As Frieda stepped onto the pier, the wooden boards creaked beneath her feet. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, feeling the cool lake air fill her lungs. For a moment, she let go of her doubts and fears. This was it – her chance to turn back the clock and restore this place to its former glory.

But as she turned to make her way up to the house, she caught sight of something peculiar. A small, leather-bound book lay open on the porch step, its pages fluttering in the breeze. Frieda's heart skipped a beat as she stooped to pick it up. The words were written in a language she couldn't understand.

Without thinking, Frieda turned the page and the words shifted into German – her great-aunt's native tongue. A shiver ran down her spine as she read the entry: "For those who come after me, beware the whispers in the night." Suddenly, the creaking of the sign seemed less like a cruel joke and more like an ominous warning.

Frieda felt a presence behind her and turned to see the old pier stretching out into the darkness. The words on the sign seemed to pulse with a new meaning – a message from beyond the grave.
