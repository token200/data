Despite her tough exterior, Frieda had a heart of gold. She was always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need, whether it was making a cake for a birthday party or providing warm bread to the local food bank.

Frieda Kovalchuk's love of baking had been instilled in her from a young age by her mother, who had taught her the secrets of traditional Ukrainian cooking. As she grew older, Frieda experimented with new recipes and techniques, eventually opening her own bakery in Willow Creek.
