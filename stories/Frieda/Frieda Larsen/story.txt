Frieda Larsen stepped out into the crisp winter air, her eyes scanning the snow-covered streets of Copenhagen. She breathed in deeply, feeling a sense of freedom that only came with being alone. Her dark hair whipped about her face as she walked, her black coat fluttering behind her like a cape.

As she turned a corner, Frieda spotted a small café tucked away between two larger buildings. She quickened her pace, excitement building in her chest. This was the place where she could escape the prying eyes of her neighbors and friends, where she could lose herself in the quiet hours before dawn.

Frieda pushed open the door, a bell above it ringing out as she stepped inside. The café was dimly lit, the only sound the soft hum of the espresso machine and the occasional clink of cups on saucers. She spotted the owner, an old woman named Kirsten, wiping down the counter with a white apron.

"Kirsten!" Frieda called out, waving a hand in greeting. "I'm so glad I found you open."

Kirsten looked up, a hint of a smile on her face. "Ah, Frieda! Come to haunt me again?"

Frieda laughed, taking a seat at the counter next to Kirsten's favorite chair. She ordered a strong black coffee and leaned back against the counter, letting out a contented sigh.

"Life is so dull sometimes," she said, staring into the crema-topped liquid in her cup. "People always talking about their families and work and whatnot. I just want to be left alone with my thoughts."

Kirsten nodded sympathetically, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "You're a true artist, Frieda. Your mind is your canvas, your brushstrokes bold and expressive. Don't let anyone dull that spark within you."

Frieda smiled, feeling a warmth spread through her chest. She took another sip of coffee, letting its bitter taste wash over her like a balm. For a few fleeting moments, she was alone with her thoughts, lost in the swirling storm of her own mind.

As the night wore on, Frieda left the café as quietly as she had arrived, the snow-covered streets whispering secrets to her as she disappeared into the darkness.
