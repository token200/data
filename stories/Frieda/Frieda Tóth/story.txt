Frieda Tóth's eyes sparkled like dark honey as she poured steaming cups of coffee for her clients at Budapest's Café Noz. The city outside was alive with the sounds of Hungarian folk music and chatter, but within the cozy café, Frieda was the conductor, orchestrating a symphony of conversations.

As a renowned tarot reader, Frieda had built a reputation for being able to unlock even the most closely guarded secrets of her clients' pasts. With her raven-black hair tied back in a neat bun and her eyes shining like two bright stars, she listened intently to their stories, searching for patterns and hidden truths.

One morning, as the sun streamed through the café's windows, Frieda noticed an old man sitting alone at a table near the fire. He was a stranger, dressed in worn, earthy tones that seemed out of place among Budapest's fashionable crowd. Yet, there was something about him – perhaps it was the weight of his eyes or the gentle line of his jaw – that drew her attention.

As the morning wore on, Frieda found herself glancing over at the old man, wondering what stories he might tell if only he would open up. So, when a spot opened up beside him, she seized it, introducing herself with a warm smile.

Over steaming cups of coffee, Frieda and the stranger – whose name was István, she discovered – began to share their secrets. István spoke of his life in rural Transylvania, where he had lived off the land and learned the ancient ways of his people. He told of his love for literature and poetry, and how he had spent years collecting rare books from Europe.

As they talked, Frieda's cards – a deck of ancient symbols and silken threads that seemed to shimmer in the light – lay across the table between them, weaving their own tale. The Wheel of Fortune turned, suggesting change on the horizon for István; the Eight of Cups indicated a deep longing for something lost.

Frieda nodded thoughtfully as she finished reading István's cards. "Your heart is carrying a heavy burden," she said softly. "But I believe you will find your way back to the land of your childhood – and the literature that has always called to you."

István smiled, his eyes shining with gratitude. As they parted ways outside the café, Frieda felt a gentle breeze rustle her hair, carrying the whispers of secrets shared between two strangers on a Budapest morning.
