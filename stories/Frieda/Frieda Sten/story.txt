Frieda Sten stepped out of her small apartment and onto the bustling streets of Copenhagen, the cool morning air carrying with it the promise of a new day. As a freelance journalist, she had grown accustomed to working on her own terms, chasing down leads and interviewing sources in the city's vibrant underbelly.

Her latest investigation was about to pay off – a cryptic tip had led her to a seedy bar on the outskirts of town, where rumors swirled about a local gangster with ties to organized crime. Frieda had spent hours poring over police reports and interviewing informants, and she was convinced that this was the break she needed.

As she made her way through the crowded streets, Frieda's mind whirred with possibilities. She had always been drawn to the darker corners of life, where the truth lay hidden beneath a veneer of respectability. Her colleagues often teased her about being too close to the edge, but Frieda knew that was what drove her – the thrill of discovery, the rush of adrenaline when she stumbled upon something big.

She pushed open the door to the bar, a bell above it jingling out a tired warning. The patrons looked up as she entered, their faces a mix of curiosity and hostility. Frieda flashed her journalist's ID and took a seat at the bar, ordering a coffee as she pulled out her notebook.

The bartender, a gruff but kind-eyed man named Lars, slid her a black coffee cup with a flick of his wrist. "You're looking for someone, I reckon?" he said, his voice low and measured. Frieda nodded, taking a sip of the bitter brew. Lars leaned in close, his eyes scanning the room before focusing on hers.

"I might know something," he whispered. "But you have to promise me one thing – if you take what I tell you, you have to use it. No spinning it for the papers or sensationalizing it for the headlines. You've got a reputation for being fair, Frieda Sten."

Frieda's heart skipped a beat as she nodded, her mind racing with possibilities. She knew that this was just the beginning of something big – and she was ready to see it through, no matter where the trail led.
