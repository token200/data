Frieda Baktybekova, aka "The Kazakh Queen," was known for her fierce competitiveness on and off the ice. Born in Almaty, Kazakhstan, Frieda's passion for figure skating began at a young age, encouraged by her parents who were both accomplished skaters themselves.

As she grew older, Frieda's determination and work ethic earned her a spot on the Russian national team. Her stunning performance at the World Junior Championships in 2013 catapulted her to international stardom, with her triple axel and flawless technique leaving judges and spectators alike awestruck.
