Frieda Salamanca, the infamous Queen of the Cartel, sat in her plush office, surrounded by the opulence of her own making. Her sharp eyes scanned the room, taking in every detail, from the golden accents to the carefully placed artwork.

She was a woman who commanded respect, and yet, she wore her power like a velvet cloak. Frieda's past was shrouded in mystery, but one thing was certain: she had built an empire from the ground up.

As she listened to her advisor, Victor, discuss the latest business ventures, Frieda's mind wandered back to the early days. Growing up on the streets of Mexico City, she had been forced to fight for every scrap of food and every penny. But that was before she met him – her partner in crime, her confidant, and her lover.

Frieda's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her phone buzzing. She picked it up, and a low, husky voice spoke on the other end. "Frieda, we have a problem."

She listened for a moment, her expression unchanging. "What kind of problem?" she asked, her tone dripping with ice.

"It's the Americans," Victor replied in the background. "They're getting too close to our operation."

Frieda's eyes narrowed. She didn't like being threatened, but she knew how to handle it. "Tell them I'm not interested in playing games," she said, her voice firm. "But I will give them an ultimatum: back off, or face the consequences."

There was a pause before Victor spoke up again. "Frieda, we can't just—"

"I know what you're thinking, Victor," Frieda interrupted, her patience wearing thin. "But this is my show, and I'll do whatever it takes to protect it." She ended the call, leaving Victor to wonder what he had just gotten himself into.

As she sat back in her chair, a small smile played on her lips. The Queen of the Cartel was not someone to be underestimated. Frieda Salamanca would stop at nothing to keep her empire intact, and no one dared to cross her. Not yet, anyway.
