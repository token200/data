The critic was blown away by the flavors and complexity, declaring Frieda Björkvist's bakery a must-visit destination.

As word of her talents spread, Frieda found herself catering to celebrities and foodies from all over the world. But no matter how busy she became, she remained committed to using only the freshest ingredients, sourced locally whenever possible, to maintain the integrity of her craft.
