Bogdan Kiss stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. The snowflakes fell gently from the sky, casting a serene silence over the abandoned platform. He had been traveling for days, fleeing the memories that haunted him.

As he walked through the town, the biting wind whipping his dark hair into a frenzy, Bogdan couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. It was a sensation he'd grown accustomed to since leaving his hometown behind. His eyes scanned the crowded streets, but everyone seemed to be going about their daily business as if they were blind to him.

Bogdan had always been a man of mystery. People whispered about him in hushed tones - the enigmatic stranger with an uncanny ability to read people like a book. But the truth was far more complicated. Growing up, he'd been shunned by his community for being different, for possessing a sense of intuition that seemed almost... supernatural.

As he walked through the town square, Bogdan spotted a small caf√© tucked away between two larger buildings. The sign above the door read "Mihai's" in bold letters, and something about it drew him in. He pushed open the door and was enveloped by the warm scent of coffee and pastry.

Inside, the atmosphere was cozy and intimate. Mihai himself, a stout man with a bushy beard, looked up from his newspaper as Bogdan took a seat at the counter. "The usual?" he asked with a smile.

Bogdan nodded, ordering the same black coffee that had become his habit since leaving home. As he waited for his drink to arrive, he noticed an old woman sitting alone in the corner, her eyes fixed intently on him.

When Mihai handed him his coffee, Bogdan noticed the woman hadn't moved. "You're not from around here, are you?" she asked, her voice like silk.

Bogdan raised an eyebrow. "No," he replied, taking a sip of his coffee.

The old woman leaned forward, her eyes piercing. "I know what you are, Bogdan Kiss."

He felt a shiver run down his spine. How did she know his name? "What do you mean?" he asked, setting his cup down.

She smiled, revealing crooked teeth. "Your kind always knows. The ones with the special gift. You hide in plain sight, pretending to be like everyone else."

Bogdan's eyes narrowed. Who was this woman, and how did she know him? But as he looked into her eyes, he felt a spark of recognition ignite within him.

For the first time in years, Bogdan felt like someone truly saw him. He smiled back at Mihai's wife, and for an instant, they connected on a level that went beyond words.

In that moment, Bogdan Kiss knew he'd found something more than just a stranger to share his coffee with - he'd discovered a kindred spirit, one who understood the weight of being different. And as the snow continued to fall outside, Bogdan felt a sense of peace settle over him, like the first wisps of dawn breaking on a new horizon.
