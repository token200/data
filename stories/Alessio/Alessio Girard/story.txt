Alessio Girard stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station. The sea air carried the scent of salt and seaweed, transporting him to the summer of '68. He had always been drawn to this place, where the Mediterranean stretched wide like a canvas of blue.

As he made his way through the quiet streets, Alessio's thoughts wandered back to his childhood. His mother used to tell him stories of their family's history, of how they had fled Sicily in search of a better life. He remembered the long nights spent listening to her voice, weaving tales of love and loss.

Alessio's footsteps led him to the beach, where he found himself standing at the water's edge. The waves lapped gently against the shore, their rhythmic motion soothing his restless mind. He closed his eyes, letting the sun warm his skin as he breathed in the salty air.

As he stood there, memories began to surface. He remembered playing with the boys on the beach, laughing and chasing each other through the waves. There was also Maria, his first love, whose smile had lit up the entire world. She had left town just before he graduated, bound for a life of her own in Rome.

The wind carried the scent of jasmine as Alessio walked along the shore, his feet tracing the path that led to the old lighthouse. He remembered his father's words: "La verità è nel mare, Alessio." The truth is in the sea. His eyes scanned the horizon, and for a moment, he thought he saw something – a shadowy shape, disappearing beneath the waves.

Alessio felt a shiver run down his spine as he turned to leave. He knew that this place held secrets, hidden truths that only revealed themselves to those who listened closely. As he walked back through the streets, the sound of the sea growing fainter with each step, Alessio realized that some things remained unsaid – some truths left hidden beneath the waves.

He found himself standing in front of his mother's old house, its windows empty and still. For a moment, he hesitated before stepping inside. The silence enveloped him like a shroud, but it was a familiar comfort. Alessio Girard smiled wistfully to himself, knowing that some things never changed – the sea remained constant, holding secrets that only revealed themselves to those who listened closely.
