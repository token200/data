Alessio Liepiņš stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the chill of the Baltic evening air slapping him in the face. It had been years since he'd last set foot in his hometown of Riga, Latvia. As a young man, Alessio had been full of dreams and ambitions, but life had taken a different turn.

Now, at 35, he found himself back in Riga, seeking solace from the monotony of his job as an accountant in a small firm in Berlin. The memories of his homeland still lingered within him, however – the sound of the sea crashing against the shore, the smell of traditional Latvian cuisine wafting from the streets.

As he made his way through the quiet streets, Alessio couldn't help but feel a sense of disconnection. Everyone seemed to know everyone else here, their faces familiar yet somehow distant. He felt like an outsider, a ghost haunting the city he once called home.

Despite this, Alessio was determined to make the most of his time in Riga. He spent his days wandering along the Daugava River, taking long walks through the Old Town's cobblestone streets, and indulging in the local cuisine. The smell of fresh pierogies wafting from the food stalls on the market square was a siren call to his senses.

One evening, as he strolled along the riverbank, Alessio spotted her – an elderly woman with kind eyes and a gentle smile. She sat alone on a bench, watching the stars twinkle overhead, their reflection rippling in the water below. There was something about her that drew him in, perhaps it was the same sense of longing he felt.

"Ašvēnīt, mēs šeit ezīme" – "Hello, we're sitting together" – Alessio said softly, breaking the spell.

The woman turned, and their eyes met. She nodded kindly and introduced herself as Gudrūna, a retired teacher with a love for stories and songs. As they chatted through the night, Alessio found himself opening up in ways he never had before. He spoke of his dreams, both big and small, and listened intently to hers.

Gudrūna shared tales of her childhood, growing up during wartime, of her husband's lost years in the forest. Her voice crackled with emotion as she recounted stories that Alessio couldn't help but feel were meant for him alone.

The stars above seemed to whisper secrets to Alessio, guiding him towards this unexpected connection. He felt a sense of belonging he'd never experienced before – not in Berlin or anywhere else. In Riga's quiet, gentle rhythms, he had stumbled upon something truly special.
