As a child, Alessio would spend hours exploring the woods, collecting leaves, twigs, and other natural materials to use in his art. His parents, both artists themselves, encouraged his creativity and nurtured his talent from a young age.

For Alessio Garcia Marquez, art was not just a passion but a way of life.
