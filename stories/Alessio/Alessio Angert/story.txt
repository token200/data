Alessio Angert stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the dimly lit station. The air was heavy with the scent of saltwater and the distant tang of tar. It was a smell that brought him back to this place – Portofino.

As he made his way through the crowded streets, Alessio's thoughts were a thousand miles away. His mind lingered on the argument he'd had with his brother, Luca, just days before. The tension between them still lingered, like an open wound.

Alessio's eyes wandered to the sea, where the sun was beginning its lazy descent into the horizon. He knew that tonight would be a night to remember – the stars aligned perfectly for one thing: his favorite sailing trip with his best friend, Maria.

Their small sailboat, 'La Bella Vita', bobbed gently in the harbor, awaiting their return. Alessio's heart swelled with excitement as he quickened his pace. He arrived at the dock just as Maria was finishing up the final preparations for departure.

The wind picked up as they pushed off from shore, and Alessio felt a sense of freedom wash over him. The waves crashed against the hull, sending spray flying high into the air. Maria laughed and shouted words he couldn't quite catch above the din.

As they sailed out to sea, the world seemed to melt away. The horizon stretched before them like an endless canvas, painted with shades of pink and gold. Alessio closed his eyes, letting the rush of wind and spray wash over him.

For one night, at least, he could forget about Luca's anger and the weight that had been bearing down on him. All that mattered was this – the sail, the sea, and Maria's quiet strength by his side.

They rode the waves, their spirits buoyed by the sheer joy of it all. And when they finally steered 'La Bella Vita' back towards the harbor, Alessio knew he'd found a sense of peace he hadn't known in months – one that would carry him through even the most turbulent of storms to come.

As they tied off and stepped onto dry land, Maria turned to him with a smile. "Tonight," she said, her eyes sparkling in the fading light, "we sailed away from our worries."
