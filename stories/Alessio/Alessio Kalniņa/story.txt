Alessio Kalniņa stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. The dim fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over the empty seats and faded advertisements for long-defunct companies. He had been traveling for hours, but finally, he had arrived in Riga, Latvia.

As a freelance writer, Alessio had grown accustomed to the nomadic lifestyle. He had spent years crisscrossing Europe, taking on gigs and assignments that allowed him to stay one step ahead of his creditors. But despite his love of adventure, there was something about this city that drew him in. Perhaps it was the history, or the culture, or simply the way the light seemed to fall on the crumbling buildings like a ghostly mist.

Alessio's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps behind him. He turned to see an older woman with piercing green eyes and hair as white as snow, standing in the doorway of the station. She wore a simple yet elegant black dress that seemed to glow in the dim light, and Alessio felt a shiver run down his spine.

"Kā?" she asked, her voice low and husky. "Where are you from?"

Alessio shrugged, feeling a sense of unease wash over him. "Just passing through," he replied, trying to sound nonchalant.

The woman's eyes narrowed, as if she saw right through his lie. But instead of calling him out on it, she smiled and reached into her pocket for a small piece of paper.

"I have a proposition for you, Alessio Kalniņa," she said, handing him the paper with a stern expression. "Come to my office tomorrow at noon. We'll discuss the details."

And with that, she turned and vanished into the crowd, leaving Alessio staring after her in confusion. Who was this woman? What did she want from him? And what lay behind those piercing green eyes?

Despite his reservations, Alessio found himself making a decision on the spot. He tucked the paper into his pocket and made his way out of the station, feeling like he was stepping into the unknown.
