One evening, at a small jazz club in Shilin, Alessio Jhih-hao met his future collaborator, a talented violinist named Liang. The two quickly discovered that their creative energies complemented each other perfectly, and soon they were working on a new project - an eclectic fusion of Taiwanese folk music and European classical.

As the months passed, Alessio's name began to circulate in Taipei's artistic circles. His unique blend of styles had drawn attention from critics and collectors alike, and he found himself fielding offers from galleries and festivals around the world. But despite his success, Alessio remained true to his roots, always seeking to honor the traditions that had shaped him.

For Alessio Jhih-hao, it was never about choosing between his heritage or his art - it was about embracing both, with all their complexities and contradictions.
