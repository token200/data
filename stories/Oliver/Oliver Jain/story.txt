Oliver Jain stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station. As the lead detective on the special crimes unit, he was no stranger to chaos. But there was something about this case that had him feeling off-balance.

The victim was a young woman named Sophia Patel, who had gone missing three days ago. Her family had received a cryptic message demanding ransom in exchange for her safe return. Oliver's team had been working tirelessly to track down the culprit, but so far, they had hit a dead end.

As he made his way through the crowded station, Oliver spotted a figure lurking in the shadows. He quickened his pace, his instincts on high alert. The figure didn't flinch as Oliver approached, revealing a young woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair.

"Can I help you?" Oliver asked, his hand resting on the grip of his gun.

The woman smiled wryly. "Just waiting for someone," she said, her voice husky. "I'm looking for Olivia Lee."

Oliver's ears perked up. Olivia was a witness who had come forward with information about Sophia's disappearance. But there was something in the woman's demeanor that didn't add up.

"Who are you?" Oliver demanded.

The woman chuckled. "My name is Lily Chen," she said, her eyes glinting with amusement. "But I think we can call each other by our first names."

Oliver's gut told him to trust no one in this situation. He slowly backed away from the woman, his eyes locked on hers. "I need to ask you some questions," he said, pulling out his notebook.

As Lily began to talk, Oliver listened intently, trying to read between the lines. He knew that Olivia Lee was a crucial piece of evidence, and if this woman was indeed connected to Sophia's disappearance, she would stop at nothing to get what she wanted.

But as the conversation wore on, Oliver couldn't shake off the feeling that Lily Chen was hiding something. And he was determined to find out what it was.
