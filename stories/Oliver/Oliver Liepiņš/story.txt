Oliver Liepiņš was a man consumed by his craft. A master woodworker, he spent most of his days hunched over his workbench, sanding and shaping pieces of wood into intricate works of art.

As a child, Oliver had been fascinated by the way wood could be transformed from a simple log into something beautiful and functional. He would spend hours watching his father work in their small workshop, mesmerized by the way the wood grain seemed to come alive under his skilled hands.

Growing up, Oliver was always drawn to the darker side of woodworking - the use of rich, dark woods like ebony and walnut. His friends would tease him about his obsession with these "poisonous" woods, but Oliver knew that it was what gave his work its depth and complexity.

As he grew older, Oliver's skills only improved. He began taking on commissions from wealthy clients who sought out his unique creations - intricately carved furniture pieces that seemed to defy gravity. His workshop became a hub of activity, with tools clanging and wood shavings scattered everywhere.

But despite his success, Oliver couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. He felt restless, like there was more to life than just creating beautiful objects out of wood. He began to feel like he was trapped in a never-ending cycle of creation and consumption - building things that others would eventually discard or forget about.

One day, Oliver received an unusual request from a mysterious client. The man asked him to create a single piece of furniture - a wooden box - with no discernible purpose or function. Oliver was baffled, but also intrigued. He threw himself into the project, experimenting with different woods and techniques until finally, he created something truly remarkable.

The box itself was beautiful, its surface adorned with intricate patterns that seemed to shift and change as one looked at it from different angles. But what really set it apart was the sense of... nothingness that emanated from it. It was as if the box had a presence all its own, a feeling of emptiness that drew you in.

Oliver realized then that he didn't have to create just for others - he could create for himself too. The wooden box became a symbol of his newfound freedom, a reminder that even in the most mundane tasks, there was room for beauty and complexity. From that day forward, Oliver's work took on a new depth, as if the darkness he had once feared had finally become his greatest ally.
