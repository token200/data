Oliver García Fernández was a man of mystery, with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair that fell across his forehead in a perpetual swoop. He was a journalist by trade, but his true passion lay in uncovering the hidden truths that others preferred to keep buried.

Born and raised in the bustling streets of Madrid, Oliver had always been drawn to the dark alleys and crumbling buildings that lined the city's ancient neighborhoods. As a young boy, he would spend hours exploring these narrow passageways with his abuela, listening intently as she whispered stories of the city's forgotten history.

As he grew older, Oliver's fascination with the unknown only deepened. He began to write articles for the local newspaper, shedding light on the corruption and exploitation that had long plagued the city's most vulnerable populations. His fearless reporting earned him a reputation as a muckraking journalist, and his byline became synonymous with courage and conviction.

But Oliver's true calling lay elsewhere. In the dead of night, he would sneak out of his apartment to scour the city for clues. He would interview shady characters on street corners, dig through dusty archives in forgotten libraries, and pour over cryptic documents hidden away in the attics of ancient buildings.

And then, one fateful evening, it happened. Oliver stumbled upon a mysterious folder buried deep within a dusty archive room, its contents encrypted and sealed with an eerie red wax stamp bearing a single word: "Erebus".

As he unraveled the threads of the mystery, Oliver found himself hurtling down a rabbit hole of intrigue and deception that led him to some of the darkest corners of Madrid's underbelly. He spoke with a whispered conspiracy involving powerful politicians, corrupt business magnates, and even whispers of a centuries-old cult operating in secret.

Oliver knew he had stumbled upon something big – but also, terribly, terrible. The fate of his investigation hung precariously in the balance, threatened by every move he made, from the phone calls to the cryptic messages and coded messages that littered his digital calendar.

Would Oliver be able to bring this truth to light before it was too late? Or would Erebus consume him whole?
