Oliver's rise to power began with a series of calculated moves in the corporate world, where he quickly rose through the ranks and became a respected executive. But it wasn't until he stumbled upon an underground organization that his true potential was revealed. The group, known only as "The Archon," recognized Oliver Fliesbach's unique skillset and offered him a place among their ranks.

As a member of The Archon, Oliver used his talents to help the group further their agenda, always working in the shadows to achieve their goals.
