Oliver Koskinen sat alone in his dimly lit flat, staring blankly at the wall as he tried to shake off the remnants of another restless night's sleep. As a renowned detective specializing in paranormal cases, Oliver had seen it all – from ghostly apparitions to supernatural entities lurking in the shadows.

Just as he was starting to feel like he'd hit rock bottom, his phone rang, shattering the silence. It was Emily, his trusted partner and confidant, asking him to meet her at the old mansion on the outskirts of town. Rumors swirled that a group of thrill-seekers had set up an overnight investigation, hoping to catch a glimpse of something inexplicable.

As Oliver arrived at the mansion, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The air was thick with an otherworldly energy, and he could practically taste the fear emanating from his skin. Emily greeted him with a warm smile, her eyes gleaming with excitement.

"Oliver Koskinen, I have a feeling this is going to be a long night," she whispered, as they stepped into the musty foyer.

Their team of investigators fanned out across the property, setting up equipment and conducting interviews. Oliver wandered the halls, his trained mind scanning for any signs of anomalies. It wasn't long before he detected an unusual pulse – a low-frequency vibration that seemed to emanate from the attic.

As they ascended into the darkness above, Oliver's intuition grew stronger. He could feel the presence closing in around them, its power suffocating and oppressive. Suddenly, Emily grabbed his arm, her grip like ice. "Oliver Koskinen," she whispered urgently, "I think we're not alone."

In that instant, a cold breeze swept through the attic, extinguishing their lanterns and plunging them into total darkness. Oliver's eyes adjusted slowly, revealing an unholy scene before him: ghostly apparitions swirling around a spectral child, its eyes locked onto his with an unblinking stare.

The room fell silent as the group of investigators froze in awe. And then, without warning, everything went black.

When Oliver came to, he was lying on the cold floor, his head pounding and his memories hazy. Emily helped him to his feet, her expression worried but relieved. As they stumbled down from the attic, Oliver couldn't shake off the feeling that this night had marked a turning point – one in which their understanding of the unknown would forever change.
