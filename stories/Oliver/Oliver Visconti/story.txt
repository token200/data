Oliver Visconti stepped out of the misty morning air and into the grand foyer of the Visconti estate. He stretched his lean frame, his bright blue eyes scanning the opulent decorations as he made his way to the kitchen. The year was 1920, and the world was on the brink of change.

As a member of one of Rome's most influential families, Oliver had always been surrounded by privilege and expectation. His father, the aging Duke of Visconti, ruled with an iron fist, yet Oliver felt suffocated beneath his own weight. He longed for adventure, for excitement beyond the stifling walls of their palatial home.

In the kitchen, he found his loyal servant, Alessandro, busily preparing breakfast. The old man looked up as Oliver approached, a knowing glint in his eye. "Master Oliver, today is a special day," he whispered, handing him a steaming cup of coffee.

Oliver raised an eyebrow but said nothing, intrigued. As the morning progressed, Alessandro handed him various letters and messages from acquaintances, each with a hint of excitement and curiosity. It seemed that Oliver's estranged uncle, Leo, had recently arrived in Rome, bearing news of a long-forgotten business venture.

Leo's words spoke of profit, of potential, but also of hidden dangers lurking in the shadows. Intrigued, Oliver decided to take a chance on his family's legacy and meet his uncle. As he descended into the bustling streets, the sounds and smells of Rome exploded around him â€“ horses' hooves, merchants hawking their wares, food vendors calling out for customers.

Upon arriving at Leo's modest villa on the outskirts of town, Oliver was greeted by a charismatic figure with piercing green eyes and an unyielding smile. The air crackled with tension as Oliver learned about his uncle's plan: to invest in a fledgling film industry, with potential for untold riches.

Oliver listened intently, sensing the possibilities unfolding before him like a map waiting to be charted. His family's legacy, shrouded in tradition and expectation, might finally find its place in this vibrant city of dreams and possibility.

As he left Leo's villa with his uncle by his side, Oliver knew that the world beyond the Visconti estate was calling, inviting him to leave his mark.
