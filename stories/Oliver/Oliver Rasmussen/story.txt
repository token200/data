Oliver Rasmussen stepped out of his small apartment and into the crisp morning air, gazing up at the grey sky. He lit a cigarette, feeling the familiar sting of nicotine as he took a long drag.

As a freelance journalist, Oliver had grown accustomed to working on his own terms, chasing stories that others deemed too obscure or too expensive to pursue. But it was a habit that often left him feeling restless and unfulfilled.

He checked his phone for what felt like the hundredth time that morning, scanning the headlines for any sign of something – anything – worth writing about. That's when he saw it: a small article on a local blog about a long-abandoned asylum on the outskirts of town, rumored to be haunted by the ghosts of former patients.

Oliver had always been fascinated by the supernatural and the darker corners of history. This was the kind of story that would make his editor green with envy – or at least, it would give him something to write about.

He grabbed his camera gear and set off for the asylum, navigating through crumbling stone walls and overgrown gardens as he made his way deeper into the decaying complex. The air inside reeked of rot and decay, and Oliver's skin prickled with gooseflesh as he snapped photos and took notes.

As he explored the abandoned wards and playrooms, Oliver began to piece together a timeline of the asylum's troubled past – tales of abuse, experimentation, and tragedy that seemed to seep from every crumbling brick. It was a story of human suffering, of lives lost and forgotten.

But as the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the empty halls, Oliver started to feel a creeping sense of unease. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched – that unblinking eyes were trained on him from the darkness.

Shrugging it off as mere paranoia, Oliver packed up his gear and left the asylum behind, but not before noticing something strange: a small, hidden room tucked away in a forgotten corner of the ward. Inside, he found a series of cryptic journals belonging to one of the asylum's former patients – a girl who had disappeared under mysterious circumstances.

It was a lead Oliver couldn't ignore. He made a mental note to dig deeper into the girl's story and follow it wherever it might lead. As he walked back through the fading light, he felt a spark of excitement ignite within him – this could be the story that finally gave his career the push it needed.
