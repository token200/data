Oliver Errani stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, his eyes scanning the space for any signs of danger. As a private investigator, he had seen his fair share of shady characters and deceitful dealings, but there was something about this particular case that had him on edge.

He was meeting with a mysterious woman named Sophia, who claimed to have information about his missing sister, Luna. Oliver's heart ached at the mention of her name; it had been years since she vanished, and he had all but given up hope of ever finding out what had happened to her.

Sophia emerged from the shadows, her long black hair cascading down her back like a waterfall of night. Her eyes locked onto Oliver's, and for a moment, they just stared at each other. It was as if time stood still, and all that existed was the two of them, suspended in this moment of uncertainty.

"Oliver," Sophia said finally, her voice husky and confident. "I have what you're looking for."

With that, she produced a small USB drive from her handbag and handed it to Oliver. He took it with a mix of trepidation and hope, his mind racing with possibilities.

As he plugged the drive into his laptop, a flurry of images and documents began to pour onto the screen. Oliver's eyes scanned through them quickly, but one thing stood out above the rest: a small note, scribbled on a piece of paper in crude handwriting.

"For Luna," it read.

A chill ran down Oliver's spine as he realized that this was the first real lead he had been given since his sister went missing. He felt a surge of determination course through him; he would follow this thread no matter where it led, even if it meant putting himself in harm's way.

Sophia watched Oliver with a calculating gaze, her eyes never leaving his face. For a moment, Oliver thought he saw something there - a glimmer of recognition, perhaps? - but it was quickly extinguished, replaced by an icy mask that made him wonder if he had misread the entire situation.

"What do you know about Sophia?" Oliver asked aloud, breaking the silence.

Sophia smiled, her lips curling upwards in a cold smile. "I'm just a concerned citizen," she said, her voice dripping with sincerity. "I want to see justice served."

Oliver wasn't sure if he believed her, but one thing was certain: this case had just taken a very unexpected turn. He tucked the USB drive into his pocket, his mind already racing with possibilities and plot twists. The game had begun, and Oliver Errani was ready to play.
