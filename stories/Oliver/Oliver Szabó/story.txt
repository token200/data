Oliver Szabó stepped into the dimly lit café, the scent of freshly brewed coffee enveloping him like a warm hug. It was his favorite spot in all of Budapest, where the world outside seemed to melt away and he could lose himself in thought.

As he took a seat at his usual table by the window, the waitress came over to take his order. Oliver smiled and asked for his usual: a strong black coffee, extra shot. She nodded and disappeared into the back, leaving him alone with his thoughts.

Oliver was a man of few words, but those who knew him understood that he carried a weight within him, a burden that he carried every day. His eyes, a deep shade of brown, seemed to hold a world of sadness, a world that he rarely shared with anyone.

As he waited for his coffee, Oliver's gaze wandered out the window, taking in the cityscape below. The sun was setting over the Danube, casting a golden glow over the rooftops and bridges. It was moments like these that he felt most at peace, as if the world had slowed down and all that mattered was the present.

The coffee arrived, and Oliver took a sip, feeling the rich flavor wash over him. He closed his eyes, letting the aroma fill his senses, and began to think about the letter in his pocket.

It was from an old friend, someone he hadn't heard from in years. The letter had been cryptic, but it had piqued Oliver's curiosity, making him wonder what secrets lay hidden beneath the surface of their friendship.

As he sat there, lost in thought, a young woman entered the café and took a seat at the table beside him. She was laughing with her friends, completely carefree, and Oliver couldn't help but feel a pang of envy. Who was this person, with her bright smile and infectious laughter? What had she found that brought her so much joy?

Oliver watched her for a moment longer, before looking away, feeling the familiar weight of his own sadness settle back into place. He took another sip of his coffee, letting the bitterness wash over him, and began to wonder if he would ever find his own way out of the darkness.

The café was quiet once again, with only the sound of the coffee machine breaking the silence. Oliver finished his drink and left, disappearing into the night, lost in his thoughts once more.
