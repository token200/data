Oliver Chih-chieh was a young and ambitious journalist who had just landed his first job at a prestigious newspaper in Taipei. With a keen eye for detail and a passion for storytelling, Oliver quickly made a name for himself as one of the most talented reporters in the city.

One day, while investigating a tip about a corruption scandal involving a local government official, Oliver received a cryptic message from an anonymous source claiming to have information that could bring down the corrupt politician. The message read: "Meet me at the old windmill on the outskirts of town at midnight. Come alone."

Oliver's instincts told him that this was an opportunity he couldn't miss, so he decided to take a chance and show up at the designated time. As he approached the abandoned windmill, he noticed a figure waiting in the shadows. The figure stepped forward, revealing a woman with a determined look on her face.

"My name is Mei-Ling," she said, handing Oliver a small folder filled with documents and recordings of the politician's illicit activities. "I used to work for his office, but I couldn't stomach what was going on anymore. I'm willing to come forward as long as you agree to protect me."

Oliver was torn between his duty as a journalist and his desire to protect this mysterious source. But he knew that he had to act quickly, before the politician's goons caught wind of Mei-Ling's betrayal.

As Oliver delved deeper into the scandal, he realized that it went far beyond just corruption - it was a web of deceit and greed that had ensnared many innocent lives. With Mei-Ling's help, Oliver managed to expose the truth, bringing the politician down in a spectacular fashion.

The next day, Oliver's article made headlines across Taiwan, with his name as the author. As he walked out of the newspaper office, he was met with cheers and congratulations from his colleagues. Oliver Chih-chieh had proven himself to be a force to be reckoned with in the world of journalism.

Despite the success, Oliver couldn't shake off the feeling that Mei-Ling's fate was far from certain. He knew that she would have to live in hiding for a while longer, but he was determined to help her find justice and protection. For Oliver Chih-chieh, this was just the beginning of his journey as a journalist - one that would take him to the darkest corners of corruption and deceit, but also to the highest reaches of truth and redemption.
