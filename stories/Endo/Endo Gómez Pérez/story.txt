Endo Gómez Pérez stepped out of the sweltering Cuban heat and into the cool, dimly lit world of his small record store. The sign above the door read "La Vida es un Disco" - Life is a Record - and it was a mantra that Endo lived by.

As he carefully selected each vinyl, ensuring they were in pristine condition for the next customer, Endo's mind wandered back to the tumultuous days of his youth. Born into a family of passionate music lovers, Endo had grown up surrounded by the sounds of Fidel Castro's speeches, Buena Vista Social Club, and American jazz legends like Duke Ellington.

Despite living under the strict rule of Fidel, music remained an escape for Endo. As a teenager, he spent countless hours listening to forbidden records in his small apartment above his family's bakery. These illicit tunes introduced him to the likes of Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Billie Holiday - sonic explorers who opened his eyes to new worlds.

Years passed, and Cuba began to change. The American embargo was lifted, and Endo found himself caught in the crossfire of revolution. As the government imposed strict controls over media and cultural expression, Endo's passion for music became a double-edged sword. Though he secretly continued to play records, sharing them with like-minded friends who shared his love of the classics.

One fateful night, as Endo curated a playlist for a small, underground gathering, he stumbled upon an obscure LP by Spanish guitarist Andrés Segovia. Entranced by its haunting melodies and poetic lyrics, Endo felt a sudden rush of memories - from whispered conversations with friends in secret jazz clubs to moonlit walks along Havana's Malecón.

La Vida es un Disco had been born out of this moment of serendipity. With each record carefully selected, curated and presented, Endo aimed to bring his fellow Cubans back to the beauty of music as a source of solace, comfort, and connection. As he placed another prized vinyl in its protective sleeve, Endo smiled - for in the world of records, there was always room for rediscovery and rebirth.

In this store filled with tales from yesteryear and today's hits, customers often asked how many records were actually on the shelves. "Un millón de dos," they'd say with a chuckle (a million and two), as if in jest. Endo would smile knowingly, though - it was his truth: music is life itself; each record holds a story, waiting to be unearthed, shared, or cherished for generations to come.
