Endo Taylor stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the unfamiliar town. The once-thriving industrial city now lay in decline, its steel mills silenced and its streets lined with boarded-up storefronts. He wore a coat with a faded label from a long-abandoned factory, a constant reminder of his own troubled past.

Endo had grown up on these streets, the youngest son of two migrant workers who'd fought to make ends meet in this bleak landscape. His family struggled to keep up appearances, always dressed for Sundays and Wednesdays when their neighbors wouldn't be watching. But there was no escaping the weight of his father's mistakes - a failed union vote that had left them destitute, followed by years of hard labor for pennies.

Despite it all, Endo had learned to adapt, to find beauty in the discarded remnants of industry. As a teenager, he'd spent hours scouring salvage yards for scraps to repair and repurpose into something new - bike parts, gears from old engines, whatever could be made into something useful.

Years later, with no prospects at home, Endo set out to make his own way, selling scavenged goods on street corners and in dingy markets. He learned to see the value in discarded things - a rusty wrench that could hold water pressure, an engine block turned into a planter for wildflowers. And though his customers might view him as nothing more than a shady trader, Endo knew he was creating something from nothing.

One day, while exploring an abandoned factory on the outskirts of town, Endo stumbled upon a small, functional kiln buried beneath the rubble. It sparked something within him - the idea that even in decay and ruin, there were still resources to be found. Over the next few weeks, he secretly rebuilt the kiln, using salvaged bricks and metal scraps to create a furnace capable of reshaping metal.

Word spread quietly among the town's artists and craftspeople about Endo Taylor, the scavenger who could turn discarded steel into works of art. Before long, his studio was swamped with requests from local galleries and collectors, all clamoring for a piece of his unique creations. It wasn't easy - there were still struggles, still moments of doubt when the doubts crept in about where he'd come from and what his worth truly was.

But Endo had seen enough to know that sometimes, it's not what you start with but what you can shape into something new that matters most.
