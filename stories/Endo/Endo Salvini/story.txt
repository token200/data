Endo Salvini stood alone on the windswept beach, her long, dark hair whipping about her face like a madwoman's veil. The pale moon cast an ethereal glow over the waves as she breathed in deeply, feeling the salty spray fill her lungs. It was moments like these that Endo Salvini found solace – away from the prying eyes of society and the weight of her family's expectations.

As a member of the wealthy and influential Salvini clan, Endo had always felt trapped by the very name that preceded hers. Her parents, Lord Arin Salvini and Lady Camilla Salvini, had pushed her to excel in every aspect of life – politics, art, music – as if one misstep would bring shame upon their esteemed family. But Endo Salvini's heart belonged to something different. She longed for the freedom to follow her own path, to dance with the waves and feel the rush of the ocean against her skin.

Tonight was no exception. As she watched the stars twinkle above, Endo Salvini felt an overwhelming urge to escape. To leave it all behind and start anew, under a new name, in a place where nobody knew who she truly was. The thought sent shivers down her spine, and for a moment, she forgot to breathe.

Just as she was about to take the leap, Endo Salvini heard the sound of footsteps approaching. Her heart sank as she saw her parents emerge from the darkness, their faces lit by the moon's pale light. They were here to remind her of her duties, to prod her towards a life of duty and responsibility.

Endo Salvini bit back a sigh, knowing that it was futile. She would have to continue playing the role expected of her – no matter how much it burned within her. For now, she would don the mask of her family's legacy, but in her heart, she knew that Endo Salvini would always be searching for something more – a life untethered by expectation, free to dance with the waves and follow her own path.
