Endo Kovács was a master of disguise and deception. With a quick wit and a silver tongue, he could talk his way out of - or into - just about any situation. Born to a family of traveling performers, Endo had grown up learning the art of misdirection from a young age.

As a child, he would watch in awe as his parents transformed into different characters for each show. He learned how to adapt, how to change his appearance and voice to fit whatever role was required. By the time he reached adulthood, Endo was a skilled impersonator, able to convincingly play anyone from a lowly servant to a high-ranking noble.

One day, Endo received an offer from a mysterious patron who wanted him to assume the identity of a wealthy merchant named Richard Langley. The job was simple: attend a high-society gathering and gather information on the guest list. Easy enough for someone with Endo's talents, but the catch was that he would have to maintain the charade for several days, with no opportunity to escape or reveal his true nature.

Endo accepted the challenge, immersing himself in the role of Richard Langley. He studied the merchant's mannerisms and speech patterns, practicing until they felt natural. When the day of the gathering arrived, Endo took a deep breath and stepped into character. For two days, he played the part of Richard with perfect accuracy, charming the guests and gathering the information the patron required.

As the sun began to set on the final evening, Endo couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over him. He had done it - he had pulled off the impossible and lived to tell the tale. But as he turned to leave, he caught a glimpse of something that made his heart skip a beat: a small note in the corner of the room, bearing a single message scrawled in elegant script: "Well done, Endo Kovács. You are hired."

Endo's eyes narrowed as he read the words. Who was this patron, and what did they want from him? He knew that his life would never be the same again - that he had stumbled into a world of espionage and deception from which he might never escape.
