In the scorching desert town of Red Rock, a lone figure emerged from the dusty horizon. Kaito "Endo" Angert was his name, and he was known for being one of the deadliest bounty hunters in the west.

With his rugged, weathered face and piercing blue eyes, Endo looked like a man who had seen it all. His jet-black hair was slicked back, revealing a distinctive widow's peak that added to his intimidating presence. He wore a well-worn leather duster coat, adorned with numerous pockets and pouches, each containing an assortment of deadly traps and tricks.

Endo's reputation preceded him, striking fear into the hearts of outlaws and fugitives alike. His exceptional tracking skills and uncanny ability to read people made him nearly unbeatable in his line of work. He had lost count of how many enemies he had dispatched over the years, but one thing was certain: no one crossed Endo Angert without facing the full force of his wrath.

As he rode into town on his trusty steed, a hooded figure emerged from the shadows, eyeing him with a mixture of curiosity and hostility. "What can I do for you?" Endo growled, hand resting on the butt of his holstered pistol.

The figure hesitated before speaking in a hushed tone, "There's a man hiding out in Red Rock, known only as 'Blackjack' McCoy. He's rumored to be hoarding a stash of gold worth a king's ransom."

Endo raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the prospect of a high-stakes bounty. "Name and location?" he demanded.

The hooded figure handed over a crumpled piece of paper with Blackjack's name scribbled on it, along with a crude map leading to his supposed hideout. Endo nodded curtly before vanishing into the crowd, disappearing like smoke into the desert wind.

As night fell, Red Rock was bathed in an eerie, moonlit glow. The residents huddled indoors, whispering tales of Blackjack's notorious exploits and Endo's legendary skills. Meanwhile, outside, a lone figure sat perched atop a rocky outcropping, eyes fixed on the darkness beyond the town's limits.

In this unforgiving land of outlaws and lawmen, one thing was certain: when Endo Angert set his sights on a target, no one was safe from his deadly wrath.
