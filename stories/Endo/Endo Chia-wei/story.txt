Endo Chia-wei was a name whispered in awe by those who knew him as "The Ghostwriter." A master of anonymity and deception, he had built a reputation for being able to weave words into spells that could alter the course of lives.

Born Endo Chia-wei, he grew up on the streets of Taipei, where his talent for language and storytelling was honed in the makeshift publishing houses of old. As a young man, he began writing novels under various pseudonyms, always staying one step ahead of the law. But it wasn't until he turned to non-fiction that his true power emerged.

With each new article or essay, Endo Chia-wei seemed to uncover hidden truths about Taiwan's most powerful figures. His words dripped with a subtle venom, making even the most entrenched officials squirm in their seats. Colleagues whispered among themselves, unsure if they could trust what he said.

Despite his talent, Endo Chia-wei remained elusive. Few had ever seen him in person, and those who claimed to have done so spoke of an enigmatic figure shrouded in shadows. Some said he was a master forger, able to create entire backstories from scratch. Others believed him to be a conduit for the spirits themselves, channeling their voices through his words.

One journalist, determined to uncover Endo Chia-wei's true identity, tracked him down to a cramped café in the heart of the city. Over steaming cups of coffee, she challenged him directly: "How do you manage to get so close to the truth?"

Endo Chia-wei leaned forward, his eyes glinting with amusement. "It's not about getting close to the truth," he said, his voice low and hypnotic. "It's about knowing exactly what people want to believe."

The journalist shook her head, unsure if she had just been outsmarted or schooled. As she left the café, she couldn't help but wonder: was Endo Chia-wei truly a master of words, or was he simply a puppeteer controlling the strings of those around him?
