With each passing night, Endo's resolve hardened, fueled by her determination to expose the truth behind her father's cryptic message. As she faced off against corrupt officials and underworld figures, her skills as a spy were put to the test. Her resourcefulness and quick thinking allowed her to stay one step ahead of her adversaries, but at what cost?
