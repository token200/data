In the heart of Moscow, where the snowflakes danced like ballerinas on the wind, Endo Satylganova walked alone through the city streets. Her eyes were fixed on the ground, her feet carrying her toward an unknown destination. She was a woman with secrets, with a past shrouded in mystery.

As she turned a corner, Endo's thoughts drifted back to her childhood. Growing up in a small village, she had always felt like an outcast. Her parents, both scientists, had been working on a top-secret project when she was just a teenager. Their disappearance on the day of her 18th birthday still haunted her dreams.

Endo's gaze rose to meet the frosty air as she paused outside a nondescript building. She raised her hand to knock, and after a brief pause, the door creaked open. A figure beckoned her inside, its features obscured by shadows.

The room was dimly lit, with only a few flickering candles illuminating the space. Endo's eyes adjusted slowly, taking in the rows of dusty shelves lined with ancient tomes and strange artifacts. In the center of the room, a single chair sat facing her, waiting.

"Welcome, Endo Satylganova," a low voice spoke from behind her. She spun around, but it was too late. The figure stepped forward, its features finally revealed â€“ a woman with piercing green eyes and long silver hair.

"You've come seeking answers," the woman stated, as if reading Endo's mind. "But are you prepared for what you might find?"
