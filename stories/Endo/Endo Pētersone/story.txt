Endo Pētersone was a man with an extraordinary gift – he could sense the vibrations of any song ever played. As a child, Endo would sit quietly in class as his classmates sang nursery rhymes and children's songs. He felt it first - the vibration of the melody, the resonance of the harmony. His teacher, Mrs. Krišpīne, noticed his unusual reaction one day and approached him.

"Endo, what is wrong?" she asked.

"I feel... something," Endo replied, his eyes closed as if channeling the vibrations.

Mrs. Krišpīne took a chance, handed Endo her own harmonica, and started playing "Ode to Joy." As the notes danced through the air, Endo's eyes fluttered open, and he smiled.

"It's beautiful," he whispered.

From that moment on, people recognized the vibrations in Endo. They'd take him to music halls, concerts, or just play their favorite tunes near him. He listened, absorbed, and responded. Some claimed he could even "feel" the lyrics, emotions, and stories behind a song.

Years went by, and Endo became a sort of musical mystic. People from all walks of life would seek his counsel on music, seeking guidance on what to play or when. Governments approached him for concerts that required inspiration, artists asked for critiques based on Endo's unique perspective, and even musicians sought solace in his empathy.

One day, a renowned composer, Jānis, heard about Endo through the word of mouth. Seeking an innovative touch, he invited the mystic to his studio. As the evening unfolded with Chopin's Nocturne, Endo rose from his chair and began swaying. The melody danced around him like wisps of smoke. Suddenly, a note caught his eye - an imperfection in Jānis' arrangement.

The composer watched, taken aback, as Endo pointed to a particular chord progression. "Try it this way," Endo whispered. And just so, the music reworked itself.

It was then that Jānis grasped Endo's gift – and his own.
