As she waited for her turn to order, Sophia couldn't help but notice the intricate designs on the walls - delicate sugar flowers, hand-piped borders, and patterns that seemed to dance across the surface.

When it was finally Sophia's turn, she ordered a slice of the bakery's famous "Sunset Cake," which Endo Moreno Martinez assured her was his personal favorite.
