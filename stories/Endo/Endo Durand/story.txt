Endo Durand stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the bustling streets of 19th century Paris. The young woman's eyes scanned the crowded pavement, taking in the sounds of horse-drawn carriages and vendors hawking their wares. She was on a mission to meet her contact, a man known only as "Le Renard" - the Fox.

As she walked, Endo Durand adjusted the small pouch at her waist, containing a few precious francs and a note with a cryptic message. Her full name, Endo Durand, was not one that she often shared with strangers, but Le Renard had proven himself to be trustworthy in the past.

After a few minutes of navigating the winding streets, Endo finally spotted Le Renard waiting for her at a quaint café. He was an older man, with a wild shock of white hair and piercing green eyes that seemed to gleam with amusement as he beckoned her over.

"Ah, Mademoiselle Durand," he said, using the formal title she preferred when dealing with strangers. "I see you're right on time."

Endo smiled, taking a seat across from Le Renard at a small table by the window. The older man leaned in close, his voice taking on a conspiratorial tone.

"I have information about your sister," he whispered. "The one who went missing three years ago. I believe she may still be alive."

Endo's heart skipped a beat as her mind racing with possibilities. She had given up hope of ever finding her sister, Élise, but Le Renard's words sparked a new sense of determination within her.

"What do you know?" Endo asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Le Renard hesitated, glancing around the café before responding in hushed tones. "I'll tell you everything," he promised. "But first, we need to get out of here. The Comte de Bourbon is looking for me, and I don't want to be caught by his men."

Endo nodded, already knowing that she was in this with Le Renard. Together, they would follow the trail of clues and uncover the truth about her sister's disappearance - no matter where it might lead.

As they left the café behind, Endo Durand felt a sense of purpose wash over her. She was ready to take on whatever lay ahead, armed with nothing but her wit, determination, and a deep-seated desire to find her sister and uncover the truth.
