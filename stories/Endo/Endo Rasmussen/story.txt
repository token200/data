Endo Rasmussen stood at the edge of the rooftop, his eyes scanning the city below. The rain-soaked streets glistened like polished onyx, and the neon lights of the skyscrapers cast a kaleidoscope of colors across the wet pavement. It was moments like these that he felt most alive.

Endo was a man with a troubled past, one who had seen his fair share of darkness and heartache. But it was also the stuff of which legends were made – the quiet intensity, the piercing gaze, and an aura of mystery that surrounded him like an impenetrable cloak.

Rumors swirled around him like whispers in the night: that he was a former hitman, a ghost hunter, or even a member of some clandestine organization. Some said he had the touch of fate, that his mere presence could alter the course of events.

Endo didn't bother to deny any of it. He just smiled to himself and turned back to the city, letting the wind whip through his hair as he walked towards the edge once more.

He was searching for something tonight – a lead on an old case from years past, one that had haunted him for decades. It was a mystery involving a young girl who had gone missing under suspicious circumstances. The police had never found her, and Endo knew he might be the only one left to unravel the tangled threads.

The rain poured down harder now, casting a rhythmic beat against his ears as he navigated through the shadows. His eyes scanned every alleyway, every abandoned building, for any sign of the trail that led him deeper into the darkness.

And then, like a ghostly apparition, it materialized before him – a faded business card, tucked away in a dusty corner of a forgotten café. A single word was scribbled on it: "Echo".

Endo's heart quickened as he recognized the name. This could be the break he'd been waiting for. He took out his phone and dialed a number, his eyes locked onto the city below.

"Nightshade," a low voice answered.

"You're going to owe me one tonight," Endo said, before disappearing into the night.

The darkness swallowed him whole, leaving behind only the faintest echo of his footsteps on the wet pavement.
