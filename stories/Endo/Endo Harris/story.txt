Endo Harris trudged through the dusty streets of Tokyo, his eyes scanning the crowded alleys for any sign of life. As a private investigator, he'd seen it all - the dark underbelly of the city's glamorous facade. His latest case had him on high alert, following a trail of cryptic clues that led him to this very neighborhood.

Endo spotted a small café tucked between two towering skyscrapers. The faded sign read "Mori no Hi," and he could swear he'd seen it before - though he couldn't quite place where. He pushed open the door and was enveloped in the scent of incense and stale coffee.

A woman with piercing green eyes sat at a table near the back, her gaze fixed on a small notebook. She looked up as Endo approached, a flicker of recognition crossing her face. "Harris," she said softly. "I've been expecting you."

Endo's instincts told him to be cautious, but there was something about this woman that put him at ease. Maybe it was the way she smiled, like the first rays of sunlight peeking through the clouds.

"I'm looking for information on a... package," Endo said, his voice neutral. The woman nodded, and with a gentle gesture, she motioned to an empty chair across from her.

The café's proprietor, an elderly man with wispy gray hair, emerged from the kitchen to refill their cups. As he worked, Harris noticed a small tattoo on the woman's wrist - a kanji character that roughly translated to "Night Bird." He made a mental note; it could be the key to unlocking this case.

The woman closed her notebook and leaned forward, her voice barely above a whisper. "I have something for you, Endo. A... friend has gone missing. I need you to find out what happened to him."

Harris raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. This case just got a whole lot more interesting. "Tell me everything," he said, pulling out his notebook and pen.

The woman began to speak, her words tumbling forth in a rush of excitement and trepidation. Harris listened intently, his mind racing with possibilities and theories. As the night wore on, the darkness outside seemed to recede, replaced by a sense of purpose - and a hunger for answers that only Endo Harris could satisfy.
