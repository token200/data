As a teenager, Endo had stumbled upon a hidden world of computer undergrounds, where like-minded individuals gathered to share knowledge and push boundaries. Entranced by the endless possibilities, he devoted himself to mastering every skill imaginable. He spent countless hours poring over lines of code, crafting intricate algorithms that allowed him to outsmart even the most sophisticated security systems.
