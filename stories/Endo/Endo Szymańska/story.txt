Endo Szymańska stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station with a mix of curiosity and trepidation. She had never been to this part of Poland before, and the rumors about the local folklore had only piqued her interest. As she made her way through the crowded station, Endo's thoughts turned to the mysterious artifact she had acquired in Prague - an ancient tome bound in black leather.

The book was said to hold the secrets of the old ones, and Endo was determined to unlock its secrets. She had spent years studying the arcane arts, but this particular text was rumored to hold the key to unlocking new dimensions. With a deep breath, she tucked the book into her bag and set off into the unknown.

As she walked through the streets, Endo noticed that people were watching her with an unnerving intensity. She quickened her pace, feeling like she was being followed by unseen eyes. It wasn't until she stumbled upon a small, rundown cafe that she felt a sense of relief wash over her. The owner, a gruff but kind-hearted woman named Kasia, greeted her with a warm smile.

Over a cup of black coffee, Endo revealed to Kasia the true nature of her presence in town - and the artifact she carried. To her surprise, Kasia listened intently, her expression growing more serious by the minute. "You're looking for the old ones," she said finally, "but be warned, Endo Szymańska, those secrets come at a price."

Endo's eyes narrowed, her grip on the book tightening. She had expected resistance, but not this level of hostility. Kasia leaned forward, her voice barely above a whisper. "The old ones are not to be trifled with. Are you prepared for what lies ahead?"

For a moment, Endo hesitated, weighing the risks and benefits. But something about Kasia's words resonated deep within her. She nodded, a sense of determination burning in her chest. "I'm ready," she said finally.

With those two words, Endo Szymańska sealed her fate - and embarked on a journey that would change her life forever.
