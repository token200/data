Endo Simon sat alone in his dimly lit apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and half-empty whiskey glasses. It was a typical Wednesday evening for him - just another night of lost dreams and shattered promises.

Simon had once been a renowned detective in Tokyo's underbelly, known for his razor-sharp mind and unflappable demeanor. But after a string of high-profile cases went cold, he found himself struggling to stay relevant in a city that never slept.

As he nursed his drink, Simon's mind wandered back to the case that had changed everything - the infamous Yamauchi murder. He had been on the verge of solving it when it slipped through his fingers like sand in an hourglass. The memory still burned within him like a festering wound.

Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. Simon hesitated for a moment before rising from his seat to answer it. To his surprise, it was an old acquaintance - Takeshi, a former colleague who had also hit rock bottom.

Takeshi looked just as worn out as Simon felt, with sunken eyes and a tired expression. "I heard you were still solving cases," he said gruffly. "Thought I'd drop by to see if you needed any help."

Simon hesitated, unsure if he should trust Takeshi after years of betrayal. But something in the old man's demeanor put him at ease, and before long, they had set up a makeshift office in Simon's living room.

As they pored over case files and discussed strategies, Simon began to feel the spark reignite within him. Maybe, just maybe, this was his chance to redeem himself - to prove that he still had what it took to be one of Tokyo's top detectives.

Takeshi leaned back in his chair, a sly grin spreading across his face. "You know, Endo Simon, I've been looking at the Yamauchi case from a different angle. There's something you missed all those years ago."

Simon's ears perked up. This could be it - the break he needed to solve the case and clear his name.

"What is it?" he asked eagerly, feeling a glimmer of hope that had been missing for too long.

Takeshi just chuckled, the sound low and gravelly. "Let's just say I've got something that'll change everything."
