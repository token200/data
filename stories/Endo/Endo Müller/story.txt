In the dimly lit café, Endo Müller hunched over a cup of cold coffee, her eyes fixed on the worn wooden table in front of her. The flickering fluorescent lights above cast eerie shadows on her face, accentuating the sharp angles of her features.

Endo Müller was a woman of few words, but her piercing green eyes told stories of their own. They seemed to bore into those she met, as if searching for something hidden beneath the surface. It was this intensity that drew people to her, even as they felt uneasy in her presence.

As she sipped her coffee, Endo Müller's mind wandered back to her childhood on the remote island of Hokkaido, where the rugged landscape and harsh winters had taught her to be self-sufficient. She had grown up speaking only Japanese, but after moving to Tokyo, she had learned to speak English with a precision that bordered on perfection.

Despite her tough exterior, Endo Müller had a secret: she was an avid poet. By night, she would scribble verses in a worn leather notebook, pouring out her emotions onto the page. Her poetry was raw and honest, like a cry from the heart. She found solace in the words, which helped her process the complexities of life.

A knock at the door broke Endo Müller's reverie, and she looked up to see a familiar face - her friend, Kaito. He slid into the booth across from her, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he smiled. "Hey, Müller-san," he said, using her full name with affection.

Endo Müller raised an eyebrow, but couldn't help smiling back at him. It was a rare moment of levity, one that she savored. As they chatted, Endo Müller's guard dropped ever so slightly, revealing glimpses of the person beneath her tough exterior. And for Kaito, it was enough to know that his friend was still vulnerable, still full of poetry and emotions waiting to be unlocked.

As they parted ways, Endo Müller felt a sense of peace settle over her, like a gentle rain on a summer's day. She knew she would carry this moment with her, a reminder that even in the darkest corners, there was always room for light.
