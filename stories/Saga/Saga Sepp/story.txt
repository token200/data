Saga Elara Sepp was a name that commanded respect on the streets of Kaelin's Reach. A former member of the city guard, Saga had seen her fair share of battles and bloodshed. But after a falling out with the council, she found herself forced to leave the only home she had ever known.

Now, Saga wandered the land as a lone mercenary, taking on jobs from whoever would pay her. She was a skilled fighter, but her past haunts still lingered in the shadows of her mind. Some said she was cursed, that the weight of her memories drove her to seek out danger at every turn.

Despite this reputation, Saga's skills were undeniable. Her sword arm was strong and true, slicing through armor like it was paper. And yet, there was something more to her than just brute force – a quiet intelligence, a sharp mind that always seemed to be one step ahead of her foes.

One day, a hooded figure approached Saga in the bustling market square of Willowdale. They handed her a small pouch containing a generous sum of gold and whispered a single phrase: "The Night Queen awaits." Saga raised an eyebrow – who was this mysterious patron, and what did they want from her?

As she followed the figure through the winding streets, Saga couldn't help but wonder if she'd made a mistake taking on this job. But something about the Night Queen's reputation drew her in – perhaps it was the whispered rumors of dark magic, or maybe it was simply the thrill of the unknown.

Whatever the case, Saga Elara Sepp knew that she had to see this through. For her own sake, and for the sake of those who cared about her. She would uncover the truth behind the Night Queen's summons, no matter what dangers lay ahead.
