Saga Lewis stared out at the grey, rain-soaked streets of Newhaven, her mind a million miles away. As the lead investigator for Scotland Yard's most elite taskforce, she had seen her fair share of horrors, but none as disturbing as this latest case.

A young woman had been found dead in an alleyway, her body eerily posed with a single rose petal pressed to her chest. The only clue was a small note attached to the victim's wrist, bearing a cryptic message that sent shivers down Saga's spine: "The truth lies in the shadows."

As she pondered the meaning behind the words, Saga's thoughts drifted back to her own troubled past. Her life had been marked by tragedy from a young age – her parents' mysterious disappearance when she was just a teenager – and a subsequent stint in foster care that left emotional scars.

But it was only when she joined Scotland Yard that Saga began to channel her demons into something more productive. She threw herself into the job, fueled by a burning desire to prove herself and bring justice to those who had been wronged.

As she delved deeper into the case, Saga's team of experts uncovered a web of deceit that led from the seedy underbelly of Newhaven to the highest echelons of society. It was clear that this murder was no ordinary crime – it was a twisted game of cat and mouse between two adversaries with a deadly obsession for each other.

With every new revelation, Saga felt herself drawn closer to the truth. But as she peered into the shadows, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched, that some unseen force was guiding her toward the killer's identity.

Suddenly, her phone buzzed with an incoming call from her boss, instructing her to take a break and head home. Saga felt a spark of frustration ignite within her – she was so close. But she knew better than to ignore her gut. As she hung up the phone, a gust of wind swept through the alleyway, extinguishing the flickering streetlights. In the darkness, Saga spotted something that made her blood run cold.

A single rose petal had been left on the ground beside the victim's body, this time bearing a message in bold letters: "I'm still watching."
