Saga Gupta sat at her desk, staring blankly at the stack of files in front of her. As a private investigator specializing in paranormal cases, she had seen it all - from ghostly apparitions to supernatural entities lurking in the shadows.

Her latest case was no exception. The wealthy businessman, Mr. Jenkins, had hired her to investigate the strange occurrences at his mansion. Doors slamming shut on their own, objects moving by themselves, and unexplained noises in the dead of night had driven him to the brink of madness.

Saga sighed and rubbed her temples. She had been investigating for hours, but so far, she had found nothing concrete. No signs of forced entry or exit, no witnesses, and no leads on who might be responsible.

Just as she was about to give up, her phone rang. It was Mr. Jenkins himself, frantic with worry. "Saga, I've just seen something that makes me think we're dealing with more than just a simple haunting," he said. "One of my staff members reported seeing a figure in the garden - tall, thin, and with eyes that glowed like embers."

Saga's heart skipped a beat. She had dealt with cases involving supernatural entities before, but never one as specific as this. She asked Mr. Jenkins to send her the employee's statement, and promised to get back to him soon.

Back at her office, Saga pored over the statement, looking for any clues that might explain what was happening. That's when she noticed it - a small detail that had been overlooked by everyone else. The staff member had mentioned that the figure in the garden had spoken to them in a language they couldn't understand.

Saga knew exactly what this meant. She had studied ancient mythology and linguistics, and she recognized the pattern of the voice as belonging to an entity from Hindu mythology - the Yakshini.

According to legend, the Yakshini was a malevolent spirit that could possess individuals and cause chaos in their lives. Saga's gut told her that Mr. Jenkins' mansion was indeed haunted by one of these entities.

She picked up the phone and dialed Mr. Jenkins again. "I think I know what we're dealing with," she said, trying to keep her voice steady. "But I'll need your permission to perform a ritual to cleanse the property."

Mr. Jenkins hesitated for a moment before agreeing. Saga knew that this was going to be a long and difficult night ahead. But she was ready for it.
