Saga Németh stood at the edge of the grand ballroom, surveying the crowd with an air of quiet confidence. Her piercing green eyes scanned the room, taking in the intricate details of the gilded chandeliers and the sea of elegant attire that seemed to shimmer like the stars on a clear night.

As the youngest daughter of the wealthy and influential Lord and Lady Wembly, Saga had grown up with the weight of expectation on her shoulders. She was expected to marry well, to produce an heir, and to embody the very essence of refinement and poise. But Saga was different. She had always felt trapped by the conventions that bound her, longing for something more.

As she watched, a group of giggling debutantes caught her eye, their bright dresses fluttering like butterflies as they danced across the floor. Saga's gaze followed them, her thoughts drifting to the music room where she spent most of her free time, lost in the world of books and imagination.

She had always been an outcast among her peers, preferring the quiet solitude of her own company to the raucous laughter and whispered gossip that filled the ballroom. But Saga's mother had made it clear that this was not a tolerated lifestyle – she would be expected to join the others, to dance and flirt and play the part of the perfect young lady.

Just then, Lord Wembly appeared by her side, his eyes twinkling with amusement as he grasped her hand. "Time for your first dance, Saga," he said, drawing her onto the floor. She felt a pang of resentment, but pushed it aside, smoothing out her gown and allowing him to lead her into the fray.

As they twirled across the dance floor, Saga's mind wandered back to the music room, where she had spent countless hours lost in the pages of a tattered old novel. Her name was Saga Németh, daughter of Lord and Lady Wembly – but to herself, she was something more: a dreamer, a rebel, a seeker of adventure and escape.

The night wore on, with Saga playing her part as a dutiful young lady, all the while harboring secrets and desires that would one day set her free from the constraints of her noble upbringing.
