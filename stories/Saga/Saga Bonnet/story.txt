Despite the chaos and commotion, Saga Elara Bonnet remained calm and centered, a state she had cultivated over many years of travel and exploration. She knew that in order to truly experience the world, one must be open to new experiences and willing to take risks. And so, Saga Elara Bonnet set out on her next adventure, determined to uncover the secrets hidden within the ancient ruins that loomed on the outskirts of town.

As she approached the entrance to the ruins, a young apprentice approached her, eager to learn from the famous adventurer herself.
