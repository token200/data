Saga Fournier stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the quaint town of Ashwood. As she collected her suitcase, she couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her. It had been years since Saga Fournier last set foot in this charming town, where she grew up exploring the rolling hills and dense forests with her siblings.

As a child, Saga Fournier was always fascinated by the old stories and legends that seemed to seep from every stone wall. She spent countless hours listening to her grandmother's tales of ancient magic and forgotten deities. But as she grew older, Saga Fournier became disillusioned with the world around her. The narrow-mindedness and superstition of the townsfolk began to wear her down.

Now, as a renowned archaeologist, Saga Fournier had dedicated herself to unraveling the secrets of the past. Her latest expedition had brought her to Ashwood, in search of a long-lost artifact rumored to hold the key to unlocking the mysteries of ancient magic.

As she made her way through the town, Saga Fournier couldn't help but notice the curious glances cast her way. The townsfolk seemed wary of outsiders, and the stranger with the piercing green eyes and raven-black hair was no exception.

Determined to prove herself, Saga Fournier pushed open the creaky door to the local tavern and stepped inside. The air was thick with smoke and the smell of ale, but she scanned the room quickly, her eyes adjusting to the dim light. And then, in the corner, she saw him - a tall, brooding figure with piercing blue eyes that seemed to bore into her very soul.

For a moment, Saga Fournier felt a jolt of recognition, as if she had stumbled upon a long-lost friend. But it was quickly snuffed out by the uncertainty that had plagued her for so long. Who was this stranger, and what did he want from her?

With a quiet determination, Saga Fournier turned on her heel and disappeared into the night, leaving behind a trail of unanswered questions and unresolved doubts. For now, she would focus on unraveling the secrets of Ashwood's ancient past - but little did she know, the mysterious stranger was just beginning to uncover the truth about Saga Fournier herself.
