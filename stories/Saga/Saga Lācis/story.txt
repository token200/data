Saga Lācis stood atop the windswept hill, her eyes scanning the vast expanse of the Baltic Sea. The waves crashed against the shore below, their rhythmic pulse echoing through her very being. She closed her eyes, letting the salty air fill her lungs as she whispered a prayer to the sea goddesses.

As the daughter of a powerful sorcerer and a mysterious sea-witch, Saga had always felt an affinity for the ocean's power. Growing up in the small coastal village of Ventspils, she spent countless hours exploring the rocky shores, learning the secrets of the tides and the language of the creatures that dwelled beneath.

As she opened her eyes, a school of silver fish darted past her feet, their shimmering scales catching the fading light of day. Saga smiled, feeling the familiar sense of belonging to this wild and unforgiving landscape.

But despite her connection to the sea, Saga's path had been marked by darkness and uncertainty. Her father's powerful magic had come at a terrible cost, binding him to the will of the ruthless sorceress, Krišjānis Barons. And now, as she approached her own coming of age, Saga was faced with the daunting task of breaking free from his hold.

She felt the familiar presence of her mother's spirit, watching over her from the realm of the dead. The sea-witch had been a mysterious and feared figure in life, but to Saga, she represented freedom – a wild and untamed force that threatened to consume everything in its path.

As the stars began to twinkle overhead, Saga took a deep breath and whispered another prayer to the sea goddesses. This time, her words were different, forged from a determination that burned within her heart. She would not be bound by her father's magic; she would forge her own path, one that wound through the waves and into the unknown.

As the darkness gathered around her, Saga felt the ocean's power surging beneath her feet. The wind howled and whipped across the shore, but she stood firm, a thread of defiance connecting her to the vast expanse of the sea. And in that moment, she knew that nothing could ever hold her back again.
