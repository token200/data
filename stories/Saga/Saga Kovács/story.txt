Saga Kovács was a 25-year-old Slovakian musician known for her hauntingly beautiful voice and genre-bending music. Born in Bratislava, she grew up surrounded by traditional folk melodies, but it wasn't until she stumbled upon American indie-folk that she found her true sound.

As a child, Saga would spend hours listening to the radio, mesmerized by the stories of Woody Guthrie and Joni Mitchell. She began writing her own songs as soon as she could hold a guitar, pouring her heart out onto paper. Her parents, both artists themselves, encouraged her creativity, but warned her that making a living from music was a far cry from stable.

Despite their concerns, Saga persevered, forming bands with local musicians and honing her craft at festivals across Europe. She studied music theory in college, learning to balance her folk roots with the complexity of electronic production. It paid off: after releasing a series of EPs on independent labels, she caught the attention of Berlin-based collective Rough Music.

Their offer was both an opportunity and a challenge: would Saga's unique blend of traditional Slovakian instrumentation and modern sounds appeal to global audiences? The answer came when "Rivera", her breakout single, went viral across Europe. Suddenly, music critics were raving about Saga's 'fearless fusion' and festival bookers clamored for headlining slots.

With Rivera as her anthem, Saga Kovács began touring non-stop: playing tiny clubs in Prague to massive stadiums in Moscow, each show a testament to her boundless energy and versatility. She collaborated with Berlin-based producer, Dorian, creating an album that blended the best of both worlds – rootsy folk beats and modern electronic textures.

But as success snowballed, Saga began to question whether staying true to her artistic vision was still possible under the pressure. Was she selling out or taking it further? As she pondered this in crowded hotel rooms between shows, her social media was flooded with messages from fans: "You're a role model for young musicians everywhere." With that thought at the forefront of her mind, Saga took a step back to regroup – and found inspiration.
