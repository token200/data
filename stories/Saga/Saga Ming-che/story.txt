Saga Ming-che was a young and ambitious astrologer who had always been fascinated by the mysteries of the universe. Born in a small village on the outskirts of China's ancient capital, Xi'an, she had spent her childhood gazing up at the stars, trying to decipher their secrets.

As she grew older, Saga Ming-che became increasingly obsessed with the art of astrology, spending countless hours studying the movements of the planets and the positions of the stars. She was especially drawn to the legendary I Ching, an ancient Chinese divination text that promised to reveal hidden truths about the human condition.

One day, a wealthy merchant from Xi'an arrived in Saga Ming-che's village seeking her expertise on matters of business and fortune. He had heard of her remarkable abilities as an astrologer and was willing to pay handsomely for her services. Saga Ming-che agreed to meet with him, but only if he could answer a few questions of his own.

The merchant, eager to prove his worth, posed a series of riddles to Saga Ming-che, who listened intently before responding with cryptic answers that left the merchant both intrigued and perplexed. As they spoke, Saga Ming-che's eyes seemed to gleam with an otherworldly intensity, as if she was seeing into the very fabric of reality itself.

Despite her enigmatic demeanor, the merchant found himself drawn to Saga Ming-che, sensing a deep intelligence and inner wisdom that went beyond mere mortal comprehension. He offered her a significant sum of money for her services, but Saga Ming-che declined, saying only that she had yet to fulfill her own destiny.

The merchant departed, none the wiser but deeply impressed by Saga Ming-che's extraordinary abilities. As he left the village, he couldn't help but wonder what other secrets Saga Ming-che held within her mind - and whether she would ever reveal them to the world. The villagers watched with knowing glances as she returned to her studies, lost in the celestial dance of the stars, seeking answers that only the universe itself could provide.
