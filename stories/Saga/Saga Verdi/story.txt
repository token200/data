Saga Verdi stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar town. She had been traveling for weeks, ever since she'd received that cryptic letter from an old acquaintance. The words "meet me at Ravenswood" still echoed in her mind, but she knew nothing about this place.

As she collected her luggage, a chill ran down Saga's spine. There was something unsettling about Ravenswood - the way it seemed to whisper secrets on the wind, the shadows that seemed to move of their own accord. She shook off the feeling and followed the signs to town center.

The streets were narrow and winding, lined with buildings that seemed to lean in, as if sharing a secret. Saga wandered aimlessly, taking in the sights and sounds of this place she'd never been before. People watched her from doorways, their eyes narrowing as they took in her striking features: the wild tangle of curly hair, the pale skin, the piercing green eyes.

Eventually, she found herself standing outside a large, ancient-looking building with a sign that read "Ravenswood Manor". A gust of wind swept past her, carrying with it the faint scent of rose petals and decay. Saga felt a shiver run down her spine as she pushed open the creaking door and stepped inside.

A figure emerged from the shadows, tall and imposing, with piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through her. "Welcome, Saga Verdi," he said, his voice low and husky. "I've been waiting for you."

Saga felt a jolt of surprise as she took in the stranger's features - the sharp jawline, the silver hair, the eyes that seemed to hold a thousand secrets. There was something about him that stirred up memories she couldn't quite place.

"Who are you?" Saga asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

The stranger smiled, his lips curling up in a gentle smile. "I'm someone who knows your story, Saga Verdi," he said. "And I have a feeling that it's only just beginning."

As the stranger's words hung in the air, Saga felt a shiver run down her spine. She knew then that she had stumbled into something much bigger than herself - something dark and mysterious, with secrets that would shake her to her very core.
