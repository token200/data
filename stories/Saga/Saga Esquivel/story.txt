She knew that her findings would be met with skepticism at first, but she was undaunted - she was Saga Esquivel, after all, and she had a reputation for being one of the most fearless explorers on the planet.

As she emerged from the forest, Saga couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. She had faced her fears and pushed beyond the boundaries of what was thought possible.
