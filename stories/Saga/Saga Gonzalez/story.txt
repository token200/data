Saga Gonzalez was known for her fearless spirit and unwavering dedication to social justice. As a young lawyer, she had already made a name for herself in the community by taking on high-profile cases that highlighted the struggles of marginalized groups.

One day, Saga received a call from a local non-profit organization, asking for her help with a case involving a group of immigrant workers who were being exploited by their employer. The company was owned by a wealthy businessman who had a reputation for using underhanded tactics to get ahead.
