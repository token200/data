As she began to investigate, Saga noticed a small piece of fabric caught in the window lock of one of the burglarized houses. She carefully plucked it out and examined it under her magnifying glass. The fabric was from a bespoke suit, unique to only one tailor in Ravenswood Hills. Saga's mind racing with possibilities, she decided to pay a visit to the tailor.
