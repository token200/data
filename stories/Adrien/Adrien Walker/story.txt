With a newfound sense of clarity, Adrien Walker turned and walked back to the edge of the rooftop. He took one last look at the city below before turning to head back inside. As he stepped off the rooftop, he felt refreshed and renewed, ready to take on whatever challenges lay ahead as Adrien Walker, architect and urban planner extraordinaire.
