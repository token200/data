It was on one such investigation that Adrien Novak received a cryptic message from a mysterious source claiming to have discovered a long-lost artifact with the power to manipulate time itself. The message read: "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone." Intrigued, Adrien Novak decided to take a chance and investigate further.

As he approached the clock tower, Adrien Novak couldn't shake off the feeling that he was being watched. He cautiously made his way inside, his heart pounding in his chest. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was an elderly woman with piercing green eyes, who introduced herself as the guardian of the artifact.

"Welcome, Adrien Novak," she said, her voice dripping with an otherworldly authority. "I have been waiting for you. You see, this artifact has been hidden away for centuries, and I need your expertise to unlock its secrets." With that, she handed him a small, intricately carved box.

Adrien Novak's eyes widened as he opened the box, revealing a glowing crystal nestled in a bed of velvet.
