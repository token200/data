Adrien Lin stepped into the dimly lit caf√©, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting in the corner, nursing a cup of coffee and staring intently at his laptop screen. Adrien Lin's heart skipped a beat as she made her way towards him.

It had been six months since they'd last spoken, and Adrien Lin couldn't help but feel a sense of longing whenever their paths crossed. She slid into the seat across from him, trying to play it cool despite the flutter in her chest.

"So, how's life treating you?" she asked, attempting to sound casual.

Adrien Lin smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he turned to face her. "It's been okay, I guess," he replied, his voice low and smooth. "Just trying to finish this project and get back on track."

Adrien Lin nodded sympathetically. She knew what it was like to feel lost and uncertain about the future. But she also knew that Adrien Lin had a way of finding his footing, no matter how rocky the road.

As they chatted, Adrien Lin couldn't help but notice the way her friend's eyes sparkled in the dim light. She remembered the first time they'd met, when he'd been this awkward and gangly teenager trying to make friends. Now, Adrien Lin was struck by the confidence and poise that radiated from him.

"So, what's new with you?" she asked, trying to steer the conversation towards more lighthearted topics.

Adrien Lin chuckled. "Just trying to figure out my next move," he said. "I've been thinking about taking a break from coding and traveling for a bit."

Adrien Lin's heart skipped another beat at the mention of travel. She'd always known that Adrien Lin was adventurous at heart, but she had no idea just how far he'd be willing to take it.

As they talked longer, Adrien Lin found herself feeling more and more at ease. It was like no time had passed at all, and yet everything felt new and different. As the night drew to a close, Adrien Lin smiled up at him, her heart full of gratitude for their friendship.

"Thanks for tonight," she said, standing up to leave. "I needed this."

Adrien Lin's eyes met hers, his expression softening in understanding. "Anytime, Adrien Lin," he replied, his voice low and gentle.
