As a young man, Adrien had always been fascinated by the concept of time travel. He spent countless hours pouring over theories and conducting experiments in his makeshift laboratory, much to the chagrin of his family and friends. Despite their concerns, Adrien remained undeterred, convinced that he was on the brink of a major breakthrough.

Years turned into decades as Adrien continued to work tirelessly on his project. His dedication paid off when he finally succeeded in building a functioning time machine. Overjoyed by his achievement, Adrien decided to test his invention by traveling back to a pivotal moment in history.

Adrien Lewis stood before the ancient Egyptian pyramids, marveling at their sheer scale and grandeur. He had always been fascinated by this particular era, and now he was experiencing it firsthand. As he wandered through the bustling streets of Alexandria, Adrien felt as though he had traveled not just through time, but also through the very fabric of his own being.
