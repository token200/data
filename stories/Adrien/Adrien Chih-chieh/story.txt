In the sweltering summer of 1950s Taiwan, a young boy named Adrien Chih-chieh lived in the midst of poverty and hardship. His family, like many others in their small village, struggled to make ends meet amidst the rapidly changing landscape of post-war Taiwan.

Adrien was an unusual child for his time and place. He had a passion for science fiction novels, which he devoured from the few books that made it past the government's censorship laws. His love for fantasy worlds and futuristic ideas set him apart from his peers, who were more interested in learning traditional farming skills or watching performances by traveling troupes.

One day, while exploring the countryside, Adrien stumbled upon an old, worn-out telescope hidden among the reeds of a nearby pond. Intrigued by its beauty and craftsmanship, he carefully cleaned it and began to use it to explore the night sky. As he gazed up at the stars, he imagined himself flying through the galaxies alongside the heroes of his favorite novels.

Adrien's fascination with science fiction led him to become an avid reader and learner. He spent countless hours poring over textbooks on physics, mathematics, and engineering, dreaming of one day building his own spaceship or creating innovative technologies that would change the world.

Despite his family's humble means, Adrien's determination and hard work earned him a coveted spot at Taiwan's prestigious National Taiwan University. There, he befriended like-minded individuals who shared his passion for science fiction and innovation. Together, they formed an underground club, where they discussed the latest scientific discoveries and explored new ideas.

As Adrien delved deeper into his studies, he began to notice parallels between his love of science fiction and the harsh realities of Taiwan's industrialization. He saw how science and technology could be harnessed to drive progress and improve lives, rather than simply serving the interests of a privileged elite.

Adrien's vision for a brighter future resonated with many young minds in Taiwan, including his own family members who had initially dismissed his passion as impractical. As he graduated at the top of his class, Adrien knew that his journey was only just beginning â€“ to bridge the gap between science fiction and reality, and to build a better world for all people.

Years later, when asked about the source of his inspiration, Adrien would smile and recall the worn-out telescope that had sparked his imagination. The stars he gazed at under its lens had shown him a brighter path, one where science fiction became science fact, and innovation transformed lives.
