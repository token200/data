Danuta Corberó was a brilliant and enigmatic scientist who had dedicated her life to unraveling the mysteries of the universe. With her wild curly hair and thick-rimmed glasses, she looked like she belonged in a science fiction novel, but don't let her appearance fool you – this woman was a force to be reckoned with.

Danuta Corberó's latest discovery had sent shockwaves throughout the scientific community: she had found a way to harness the energy of black holes. The implications were mind-blowing – with her technology, humanity could potentially travel across vast distances in a matter of seconds.
