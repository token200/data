As she walked through the bustling streets of New York City, Dorota's eyes scanned the crowded sidewalks, searching for anyone who might be struggling. She spotted a young woman, clutching a suitcase and looking frazzled, and immediately approached her. "Excuse me," Dorota said with a smile, "but are you okay? Do you need any help?"

The woman looked up, startled, and nodded gratefully as Dorota took the suitcase from her hands. "Thank you so much," she said, her voice shaking. "I'm just trying to get to my new apartment, but I got lost in the subway."

As they rode through the city, Dorota chatted with the woman, asking her about her job and where she was moving from. Her kindness and warmth put the woman at ease, and soon they were laughing like old friends.

When they arrived at the apartment complex, Dorota handed the woman a piece of paper with a phone number on it. "If you need anything or get lost again, just call this," she said. The woman thanked her profusely and hugged Dorota tightly before hurrying off to settle into her new home.

As Dorota watched the woman disappear around the corner, she felt a sense of satisfaction wash over her. She had made a difference in someone's day, and that was all the reward she needed. Her full name echoed in her mind - Dorota Anna Thomas - as she continued on her way, lost in thought.
