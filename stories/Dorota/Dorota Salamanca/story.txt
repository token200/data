Dorota Salamanca stepped out into the crisp morning air, her high heels clicking on the stone pavement. She took a deep breath, savoring the scent of freshly baked croissants wafting from the nearby café. As she made her way down the staircase, the sound of her designer gown rustling against the wood echoed through the hallway.

In a world where wealth and power were everything, Dorota was one of the most powerful women in New York City's high society. Her late husband, Frank, had left her a vast fortune and a title that she wore with pride: Countess of Ankh-Morpork. But more than that, she had inherited his empire.

As she entered the grand foyer, Dorota's eyes scanned the room for her assistant, Lady Whistledown. She spotted her hovering by the door, clutching a steaming cup of tea.

"Good morning, Dorota," Lady Whistledown said with a curtsy. "You have a meeting with the Duchess of Buckingham at 11 am."

Dorota nodded, taking the cup from Lady Whistledown's hands. "Thank you, dear. I need something to calm my nerves."

The Countess smiled wryly as she sipped her tea. She had always been a master manipulator, using her wit and charm to get what she wanted. But with Frank gone, she was no longer sure who her true allies were.

As the morning wore on, Dorota made her way through the crowded streets of Manhattan, exchanging pleasantries with acquaintances and politicians alike. She had a reputation for being ruthless in business, but few people knew about her own personal struggles.

Despite the glamour and sophistication that surrounded her, Dorota felt trapped and isolated. Her late husband's death had left a void in her life, one that she couldn't fill no matter how many designer gowns or luxury cars she accumulated.

She arrived at the Duchess's estate just as the clock struck 11 am. As she was ushered into the opulent drawing room, Dorota could feel the weight of her own ambition bearing down on her. She knew that to survive in this world, she had to be willing to do whatever it took – even if it meant sacrificing a part of herself.

With a calculated smile, Dorota extended her hand to the Duchess. "Thank you for seeing me, Your Ladyship."

The Duchess's eyes sparkled with curiosity as she shook Dorota's hand. "I'm always happy to discuss business, Countess Salamanca."

As they sat down across from each other, Dorota knew that this was just the beginning of another day in her high-stakes game of power and politics. And she was ready to play.
