Dorota Nowak stood in front of the mirror, her eyes fixed on the person staring back at her. A woman who had given up so much for someone else, only to find herself lost and alone once again.

She was a survivor, a fighter, but also a liar. To everyone except herself. Dorota's life had been one long web of deception, woven from threads of desperation and hope. She had left her small village in Poland with nothing but a suitcase full of dreams and a determination to make a new life for herself.

Years later, she found herself working as a maid for the wealthy and reclusive family that lived in the grand estate on the outskirts of town. Their children were spoiled and entitled, but Dorota didn't mind; it was her duty to take care of them, to keep their dirty secrets hidden behind closed doors.

But there was one person who saw beyond her disguise – the family's youngest son, Henry. He was kind and gentle, with eyes that sparkled like stars on a clear night. And for the first time in years, Dorota felt a glimmer of hope that she might finally be able to escape the life she had created.

As she went about her daily routine, cleaning and dusting, Dorota found herself watching Henry more and more. She saw the way he smiled at his sister, the way he laughed with his friends, and it broke her heart. This was what life should be like – free from lies and deception, without the weight of secrets and obligations.

One day, as she was dusting the library, Dorota caught Henry looking at her again. She felt a shiver run down her spine as their eyes met, but this time, it wasn't just a fleeting glance. This time, they held each other's gaze for what felt like an eternity.

For a moment, Dorota forgot about her past, forgot about the lies and the deceptions. All she saw was Henry, and the possibility of a new future, one where she could be herself without fear of judgment or rejection.
