Dorota Liebad stepped out of the crowded streets and into the dimly lit alleyway, her eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of her quarry. A former KGB agent turned private investigator, Dorota had been hired by a wealthy client to track down a missing person - her own sister.

As she peered around the corner, Dorota spotted a figure huddled in the darkness. She quickened her pace, her heels clicking on the cobblestone pavement. The figure slowly rose to its feet, revealing a young woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair.

"Darja?" Dorota asked, her voice low and urgent.

The woman hesitated for a moment before nodding, her eyes darting nervously around the alleyway. "Dorota," she whispered.

Without another word, Darja turned and sprinted down the alley, leaving Dorota in hot pursuit. The two sisters tore through the winding streets of Moscow, their footsteps echoing off the buildings.

As they ran, Dorota's mind flashed back to her childhood - the countless hours spent playing hide-and-seek with her sister, the endless laughter and whispers shared between them as teenagers. How had it come to this?

Darja darted into a narrow doorway, beckoning Dorota to follow. She ducked inside just as their pursuers emerged from the shadows, shouting threats and insults in broken Russian.

Inside, Darja collapsed onto a pile of crates, gasping for breath. "Dorota," she whispered again, her voice barely audible.

"What happened?" Dorota asked, crouching beside her sister.

"I got caught up in something big," Darja said, glancing around the cramped space before meeting Dorota's gaze. "Something that could put us both in danger."

As they talked, the sounds of their pursuers grew fainter, replaced by the hum of city life outside. The sisters sat in silence for a moment, each lost in her own thoughts.

Finally, Darja spoke up, her voice laced with determination. "We'll get out of here together, Dorota. We'll find our way out, no matter what."

Dorota smiled, a fierce glint in her eye. "We always have, sister. Always."
