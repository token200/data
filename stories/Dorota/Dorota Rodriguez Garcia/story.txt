Backstage, Dorota's bandmates gathered around her, congratulating her on a show well done. "You absolutely killed it out there," one of them said, beaming with pride. Dorota smiled, feeling a sense of validation and belonging. She knew that she was exactly where she was meant to be – center stage, surrounded by the music that had always defined her.
