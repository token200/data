I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Dorota DiCaprio. However, I did some research and found that Kate Winslet played the role of Rose DeWitt Bukater in the movie Titanic (1997), which was a famous film starring Leonardo DiCaprio.

Assuming you are referring to Kate Winslet's character, here is a 400-word short story:

It had been twenty years since Rose DeWitt Bukater stepped onto the ill-fated ship, RMS Titanic. Now, as an elderly woman, she sat on her porch, surrounded by memories of a lifetime. The once-vibrant roses that adorned her garden now withered in the gentle breeze, much like her own spirit.

Rose's thoughts drifted back to the night of the Titanic's sinking, when Jack Dawson, the penniless artist, had entered her life and changed it forever. She recalled their whirlwind romance, their laughter, and the promises they made to one another. The memories were bittersweet, a reminder that love can be both beautiful and cruel.

As she rocked gently in her chair, Rose's gaze fell upon an old photograph on the mantlepiece. It was a picture of Jack, taken on his last day at sea. She remembered the way he smiled at her, the way his eyes sparkled in the sunlight, and the way his hand fit perfectly in hers.

A soft knock at the door interrupted Rose's reverie. It was her granddaughter, Emma, who had come to visit from across town. The two spent hours reminiscing about Jack and the Titanic, their conversations filled with laughter and tears.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the garden, Rose took Emma's hand and led her to the backyard. There, in the old rose bushes, they planted a new rose, its petals a delicate shade of pink. It was a small gesture, but one that represented the enduring power of love.

"This is for Jack," Rose said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Emma looked at her with curious eyes and asked, "What happened to him, Grandma?"

Rose smiled, her eyes misty with memories. "He died on the Titanic, in a tragic accident. But his spirit lives on in my heart, just as this new rose will bloom into something beautiful."

As they stood there, surrounded by the beauty of nature, Rose knew that Jack's memory would continue to flourish, much like the roses that had once bloomed so vibrantly.
