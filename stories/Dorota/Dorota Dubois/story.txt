Dorota Dubois, a.k.a. Lady Mary's loyal lady's maid, sat quietly in the corner of the grand ballroom, watching as her mistress prepared for the evening's festivities. The opulent chandeliers cast a warm glow over the assembled guests, but Dorota's eyes were fixed on Lady Mary herself.

As she expertly applied a delicate layer of powder to her mistress's cheekbones, Dorota couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and loyalty towards her charge. She had been serving Lady Mary for nigh on 20 years, and in that time, had become more than just a simple maid - she was a trusted confidante, a guardian, and a friend.

Lady Mary's thoughts, however, were elsewhere. Tonight marked a turning point in her life - tonight, she would be meeting the Duke of Hastings for the first time. Rumors swirled about his brooding nature and scandalous past, but Lady Mary was not one to believe gossip. She saw beyond the facade, and knew that beneath it lay a man of great intelligence and wit.

As the clock struck eight, Lady Mary took her final look in the mirror, smoothing out her gown and adjusting her gloves. Dorota watched as she gave herself a reassuring smile, before turning to face the evening ahead.

"Shall I help you into your carriage, milady?" Dorota asked, offering her arm.

Lady Mary smiled graciously, taking Dorota's hand in hers. "I think not, dear Dorota. Tonight, I intend to make an impression. See that I am well-attended and properly cared for."

Dorota nodded, a small smile playing on her lips as she watched Lady Mary glide into the night, a vision of elegance and poise.

As the hours passed, Dorota remained at Lady Mary's side, discreetly attending to her mistress's needs and keeping a watchful eye out for any signs of trouble. But tonight, despite the whispers of scandal and suspicion, Lady Mary radiated confidence and joy, like a star shining brightly in the darkness.

And as she disappeared into the crowd, Dorota Dubois smiled to herself, knowing that her mistress was exactly where she was meant to be - in the arms of love itself.
