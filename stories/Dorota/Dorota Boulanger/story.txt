In the sleepy town of Ravenswood, where the misty dawn air clung to the streets like a damp shroud, a young woman named Dorota Boulanger walked alone, her footsteps echoing off the old stone buildings. She was a curious soul, with eyes that sparkled like stars on a clear night and hair as black as the forest that loomed beyond the town's limits.

Dorota Boulanger had always felt like an outsider in Ravenswood, where everyone knew everyone else's business and whispered secrets to each other behind their hands. She preferred the solitude of the woods, where the only sound was the rustle of leaves underfoot and the hooting of owls in the distance.

As she walked, Dorota Boulanger noticed a faint light flickering in the window of an old cottage on the outskirts of town. Curiosity got the better of her, and she quickened her pace, her heart beating with excitement. She had always been drawn to mysteries and secrets, and this strange light seemed like the perfect puzzle to unravel.

As she approached the cottage, Dorota Boulanger saw that it was abandoned, the windows shattered and the door hanging crookedly on its hinges. But the light inside remained steady, casting a warm glow over the overgrown garden. She pushed open the creaking door and stepped inside, her eyes adjusting to the dim light.

The cottage was small, with walls lined with dusty books and strange artifacts that Dorota Boulanger couldn't identify. In the center of the room, a single candle burned brightly, casting shadows on the walls like a dance troupe performing in the darkness. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she approached the flame, feeling an inexplicable connection to this place.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows â€“ an old woman with eyes that twinkled like stars, just like Dorota Boulanger's own. "Welcome, young one," she said, her voice low and soothing. "I've been waiting for you."
