She had always been drawn to the arts, spending her childhood painting and playing music in her small studio apartment. As she grew older, Dorota's passion for creativity only intensified, leading her to pursue a degree in fine art from a prestigious university.

After graduating, Dorota spent several years working as a freelance artist, taking on commissions and selling her work at local galleries.

As she walked off stage, Dorota's thoughts turned to her next project. She had been working on a new series of paintings, inspired by the same raw energy that drove her music.
