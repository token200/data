Growing up, Claudia Lāce was fascinated by the ancient arts of magic, often sneaking into her mother's studies in order to learn more about the intricacies of spellcasting. As she grew older, her natural talent and dedication earned her a place among the esteemed Council of Mages.

One fateful evening, as the full moon hung low in the sky, Claudia Lāce received an urgent message from the council summoning her to their chambers.
