One day, while working on a tip about a high-profile embezzlement scheme, Claudia received a cryptic message from an anonymous source claiming to have information about the scandal. She was intrigued, and her curiosity got the better of her as she decided to meet with the source in person.

As she walked into the dimly lit caf√©, Claudia's eyes scanned the room for any signs of her contact. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows, and she recognized the familiar face of her anonymous source. It was none other than Jack, a former business associate of the accused embezzler.
