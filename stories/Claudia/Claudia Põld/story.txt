I couldn't find any information on the character "Claudia Põld". Could you provide more context or details about who Claudia Põld is? Is she from a book, movie, TV show, or perhaps a video game?

If you'd like, I can create a new story based on my understanding of the name "Claudia" and add Estonian suffixes (-Põld) to give it an authentic touch. Please let me know how I should proceed!
