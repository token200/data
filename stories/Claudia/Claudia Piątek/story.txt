**The Lost City**

Claudia Piątek stood at the edge of the excavation site, her eyes scanning the terrain for any sign of the fabled city she had spent years searching for. As an archaeologist, she had encountered countless artifacts and ruins, but none compared to the allure of this long-lost metropolis.

Legend spoke of a hidden city deep within the Polish forest, where the ancient Celts had forged their most powerful magic. Claudia was determined to uncover its secrets, no matter the cost.

With her team by her side, she began the painstaking process of excavation. Days turned into weeks as they carefully unearthed the earth, revealing layers of history beneath. The air grew thick with anticipation as each new discovery was revealed: pottery shards, ancient texts, and mysterious symbols etched into the walls.

But it wasn't until they stumbled upon a hidden chamber deep within the heart of the city that Claudia's journey truly began. As she stepped across the threshold, the room fell silent, and an eerie energy seemed to emanate from the air itself.

This was it – the lost city of the Celts.
