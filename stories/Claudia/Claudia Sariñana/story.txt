Claudia Sariñana stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar town. She had been on the move for months, ever since the memories began to fade like watercolors in the rain. The only constants were the whispers of her name on the wind and the feeling of being watched.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Claudia noticed the people passing by, their faces a blur. She tried to focus on the sounds around her - the chirping birds, the rumble of engines in the distance, but it was like trying to grasp sand between her fingers. The town seemed frozen in time, and she was just a ghost drifting through its streets.

She stopped at a small café, the door creaking as she pushed it open. Inside, the owner, an elderly woman named Maria, looked up from behind the counter. "Hola, Claudia," she said, her voice like a warm breeze on a summer day.

Claudia smiled, trying to muster up some sense of familiarity. "Hola, Maria." She ordered a coffee and sat at a table by the window, watching as people went about their daily lives.

As she sipped her coffee, Claudia began to feel a creeping sense of unease. It was as if someone was sitting across from her, whispering in her ear. She spun around, but there was no one there. The feeling only intensified as she tried to focus on the world outside - the way the sunlight danced through the leaves, the laughter of children playing in the park.

Suddenly, Claudia's eyes landed on a photograph tacked to the wall near Maria's counter. A group of friends, laughing and smiling, their faces familiar yet distant. She felt a jolt of recognition, as if she was staring at her own reflection. Who were these people? And why did she feel like they belonged in her life?

Maria noticed Claudia's fascination with the photograph and approached her table. "That's my daughter," she said, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "She was your friend once, long ago."

Claudia's mind reeled as Maria began to tell her stories of their time together - the way they used to dance under the stars, the laughter they shared around campfires. The memories were like sparks igniting a flame, burning away the fog that had shrouded her for so long.

For the first time in months, Claudia felt herself coming back to life, the world around her sharpening into focus. She looked at Maria and smiled, feeling a sense of belonging she hadn't known in years. "Gracias, Maria," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.
