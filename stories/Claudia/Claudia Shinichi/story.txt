Claudia Shinichi was a 25-year-old freelance journalist who had always been drawn to the darker side of human nature. Her latest assignment had brought her to the small, coastal town of Ravenswood, where a series of gruesome murders had taken place over the past month.

As she stepped off the train and onto the platform, Claudia felt a shiver run down her spine. The air was thick with the scent of saltwater and decay, and the dimly lit streets seemed to whisper secrets in the wind. She lugged her battered suitcase behind her, following the familiar outline of the town's winding main street.

At the local tavern, where she hoped to gather information, Claudia spotted a figure huddled in the corner, nursing a whiskey-stained glass. His eyes locked onto hers, and he nodded slightly before returning to his drink. She approached him cautiously, sensing an air of caution around this mysterious stranger.

"My name is Claudia," she said softly, introducing herself.

"I'm Koji Tanaka," he replied, his voice low and measured.

Claudia's journalist senses tingled as Koji shared a cryptic tale of a childhood spent watching the town's fishermen navigate treacherous waters. According to him, Ravenswood was plagued by an ancient curse – one that fed on fear and despair.

"I've heard stories," Claudia said, her ears perked up with intrigue. "Something about a ghostly figure in black?"

Koji leaned in, his eyes gleaming in the dim light. "The Kuro-oni," he whispered, using a single word. "Some say it's an omen of death."

As they conversed, Claudia became increasingly convinced that there was more to this tale than met the eye. A small, enigmatic smile began to form on her lips.

"Can I ask you something?" she said, eyes sparkling with curiosity.

Koji nodded once more, his gaze unwavering.

"Why did you come to Ravenswood?"

For a fleeting instant, Claudia thought she saw something like fear flicker in Koji's eyes before it vanished. His mask slipped back into place, revealing only an unreadable expression.

"I came seeking answers," he replied finally, his voice neutral once more.

Claudia sensed that there was still much to uncover, much more hidden beneath the surface of Ravenswood than initially met the eye. She scribbled furious notes in her notebook as Koji Tanaka sipped his whiskey, lost in thought – perhaps forever bound by the secrets he had shared with this stranger and the mysterious forces that lurked beyond the town's crumbling shoreline.
