Claudia Leblanc stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. She had been traveling for hours, but it was still hard to shake the feeling that she was being watched. As a private investigator, she had grown accustomed to the quiet moments, the alone time before diving headfirst into a case.

The station master approached her, nodding in greeting. "Welcome back to Willow Creek, Miss Leblanc."

"Thanks," Claudia replied, tucking her bag behind her shoulder. She had arrived just as the last train of the day was leaving, but she knew that would be all right for now.

As she walked out into the crisp evening air, Claudia felt a pang of nostalgia wash over her. Willow Creek was where it all started – her own investigation agency, and the case that had changed everything. It was a small town with big secrets, and she had made a name for herself digging up those secrets, one by one.

She walked to her car, parked in the designated lot outside the station. The engine roared to life beneath her hands as she slipped it into gear. The drive from the station took only a few minutes – long enough for Claudia to think about the case that had brought her back.

A wealthy businessman had gone missing, and his family was frantic with worry. His daughter, Emily, was beside herself, begging Claudia to find out what had happened to him. But there was something about this case that didn't feel right. The man's family seemed... nervous. Too eager to be found safe and sound.

Claudia pulled up outside her office – a small, unassuming building on the outskirts of town. She knew everyone in Willow Creek by name, but she wasn't sure anyone truly knew what went on behind the closed doors of her agency. The only one who had been close was an old friend, Alex – someone Claudia hadn't spoken to in years.

As she stepped inside, the silence enveloped her like a cloak. It was late now, and most people were gone for the day. But then, there was a knock at the door. Claudia's heart quickened as she rose from her chair to answer it.

Alex stood on the other side, a mixture of fear and determination etched across his face. "Claudia – I need your help."

"Come in," she said quietly, ushering him inside with a nod.

The question was already burning inside him: what secrets had he uncovered? And Claudia knew that this time, nothing would be left unturned until the truth came to light.
