Her parents, both musicians themselves, encouraged her to pursue her dreams, and Danila Lewis's love for art only grew stronger as a result.

After high school, Danila Lewis decided to attend a prestigious music conservatory in the city, where she honed her skills as a singer-songwriter and guitarist. She spent countless hours practicing and perfecting her craft, determined to make a name for herself in the music industry.
