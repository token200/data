Danila Thompson sat at his cluttered desk, staring blankly at the stack of unpaid bills in front of him. As a struggling writer, he had always dreamed of making it big, but so far, his writing had fallen on deaf ears.

A former journalist, Danila had given up on the idea of making a living from his stories after his newspaper closed down due to financial difficulties. Now, at 35, he was starting over, trying to build a new career as a freelance writer.

Despite his lack of success, Danila refused to give up. He spent every spare moment working on his latest manuscript, pouring his heart and soul into the story of a small-town girl who had made it big in Hollywood.

As he worked, Danila's mind wandered back to his own childhood dreams of becoming a writer. Growing up, he had always been fascinated by stories and the way they could transport you to another world. He spent hours scribbling away in his notebook, creating entire worlds and characters with ease.

But life had other plans. After high school, Danila had taken on a series of dead-end jobs to make ends meet, all while secretly writing in his spare time. It wasn't until he was in his early twenties that he finally mustered up the courage to submit his work to a few literary magazines.

It wasn't long before he received a rejection letter from one magazine after another. Devastated and unsure if he had what it took, Danila gave up on writing altogether.

But something inside of him refused to die. He picked up his pen once again, determined to make a name for himself in the world of literature.

As the hours ticked by, Danila's fingers began to ache from typing away on his laptop. His eyes grew tired from staring at the screen, but he didn't stop. Not yet.

Just as he was starting to lose steam, Danila heard a knock at the door. It was his best friend, Rachel, who had stopped by to check in and see how things were going.

"Hey, man," she said, noticing the look of determination on his face. "You've been working non-stop for hours. How's it going?"

Danila smiled wearily, rubbing his tired eyes. "It's going," he replied, trying to convey a sense of hope that he couldn't quite find the words for.

Rachel nodded sympathetically and sat down beside him. "I believe in you, Danila," she said softly. "You're one of the most talented writers I've ever met."

Danila smiled, feeling a surge of gratitude towards his friend. Maybe, just maybe, Rachel was right. Maybe he did have what it took to make it as a writer.

As the two friends chatted on, Danila's mind began to wander once again to his manuscript. What if he didn't give up? What if he kept writing, even when the world seemed to be telling him that he wasn't good enough?

He leaned back in his chair, feeling a sense of determination wash over him. It was time to take another shot at making it big as a writer. The clock on his wall read 11:45 PM - and Danila knew exactly what he had to do next.
