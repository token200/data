Danila Morel was a man with a past shrouded in mystery. Few people knew much about him, except that he had an uncanny ability to appear at the right place at the right time. Some said he was a ghost, while others claimed he was a spy.

One thing was certain: Danila was a man of immense resourcefulness and determination. He lived by his wits and his fists, always landing on his feet no matter what life threw at him. His eyes were piercing green, with a sharp intelligence that seemed to see right through you.
