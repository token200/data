Danila Szabo was a man of few words, but his actions spoke volumes. A former soldier, he had seen his fair share of battles and had emerged with a unique set of skills that served him well in his post-military life.

As a private investigator, Danila Szabo spent most of his days navigating the dark underbelly of the city, searching for clues and piecing together puzzles that others couldn't solve.
