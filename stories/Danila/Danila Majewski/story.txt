The few times he had been spotted, he seemed to be on a mission, quickly completing tasks before disappearing into thin air.

One day, a young woman named Sophia stumbled upon an old photograph in the bakery's archives. It was a faded black-and-white image of a man with piercing blue eyes, sporting a mischievous grin. The caption read "Danila Majewski, 1923." Sophia felt a shiver run down her spine as she realized that this might be the key to unlocking Danila Majewski's mysterious past.
