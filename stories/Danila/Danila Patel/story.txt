Danila Patel sat at his small desk, staring blankly at the stack of unpaid bills in front of him. As an aspiring artist, he had always dreamed of making it big, but the harsh reality was that he was barely scraping by. His part-time job as a graphic designer didn't pay enough to cover his living expenses, let alone support his passion for painting.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was his best friend and confidant, Rohan. "Hey, man, I brought over some food," he said, holding up a plate of steaming hot curry.

Danila's stomach growled in appreciation as Rohan sat down beside him. They chatted quietly for a while, discussing everything from their jobs to their personal lives. Danila confided in Rohan about his struggles with money and art, feeling a weight lift off his shoulders as the friend listened attentively.

Just then, Rohan's eyes landed on an old sketchbook lying open on Danila's desk. "Wow, you've been working on some amazing pieces!" he exclaimed, pointing to one of Danila's most striking portraits. "You have such talent!"

Danila blushed, feeling a surge of pride and gratitude towards his friend. "Thanks, man," he said, smiling weakly.

Rohan handed him a folder with a proposal inside. "I got you an interview at this new gallery downtown," he announced. "It's going to be for a group exhibition on emerging artists, and they're interested in showcasing your work."

Danila's eyes widened as the reality of Rohan's words sunk in. This could be his big break! He felt a rush of excitement and hope that he hadn't felt in months.

As they finished their meal and parted ways, Danila couldn't shake off the feeling of gratitude towards his friend. Rohan had always been there for him, supporting him through thick and thin. And now, with this new opportunity on the table, Danila knew that he could finally make a name for himself as an artist.

The days leading up to the exhibition flew by in a whirlwind of activity – preparing paintings, writing statements, and rehearsing presentations. Finally, the night arrived, and Danila stood nervously beside his artwork at the gallery opening. The room buzzed with art lovers, collectors, and critics, all eager to see what the new talent had to offer.

Danila's heart pounded as he waited for feedback – would this be his moment to shine?
