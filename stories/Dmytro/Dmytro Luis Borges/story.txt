I think there may be a small mistake. The fictional character I am assuming you are referring to is not Dmytro Luis Borges, but rather Jorge Luis Borges, an Argentine writer.

Here's a story about Jorge Luis Borges:

It was a drizzly evening in Buenos Aires when Jorge Luis Borges stepped into the old café on Calle Ugarte. The air was thick with the scent of coffee and the flickering candles cast eerie shadows on the walls. Borges took a seat at the bar, ordering a whiskey as he scanned the room for familiar faces.

Suddenly, he noticed an old man sitting in the corner, his eyes fixed intently on him. As Borges watched, the old man began to recite a poem from memory:

"In a tavern of Ushuaia,
where time has no meaning,
a stranger appears.
He is my double, yet I am not
he.
We sit together, drinking wine."

Borges felt a shiver run down his spine as he listened. The poem was familiar, but its origin was unknown to him. Who was this old man, and why did he seem so...familiar?

The barista interrupted Borges's reverie, serving him a fresh whiskey. As Borges took the glass, the old man began to nod at him.

"You are reading my book," he said in a raspy voice.

Borges blinked. "How can that be?" he asked, intrigued.

"Time is a flat circle," the old man replied with a sly smile.
"In it, we all exist and do not exist
in the same moment."

As Borges listened to the old man's words, he felt his mind expand and contract simultaneously. He had written about similar concepts in his stories - "The Library of Babel", "Funes el Memorioso" – but never quite like this.

As the night wore on, the barista asked Borges if he wanted another round. He did, nodding to himself as he replied. And that's when it hit him: the old man was not just a stranger in the café, but a version of himself from another timeline – one where time itself had become fluid.

In that moment, Borges knew his stories were more than just fictional tales. They were portals to other worlds, hidden dimensions waiting to be explored.
