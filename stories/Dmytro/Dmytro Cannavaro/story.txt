I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Dmytro Cannavaro. However, I did find a famous Italian-Spanish footballer named Fabio Cannavaro who played as a centre-back for several clubs, including Juventus and Real Madrid.

If you would like, I can write a story about a fictional version of this character instead?
