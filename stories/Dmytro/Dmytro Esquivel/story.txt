The installation consisted of a large, dark room filled with rows of glowing orbs that seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy.

Visitors could walk through the space, surrounded by the soft glow of the orbs, which seemed to reverberate with a sound that only Dmytro Esquivel knew.

Dmytro Esquivel's inspiration for "Echoes in the Abyss" came from his fascination with the mysteries of the deep ocean. He had spent countless hours studying the unique ecosystems and bioluminescent creatures that thrived in the darkest depths of the sea. The orbs, made from a specialized glass that refracted light in ways not seen before, were designed to evoke the shimmering scales of anglerfish or the eerie glow of jellyfish.

As visitors navigated the space, they began to notice strange occurrences â€“ sounds seemed to emanate from nowhere, and the orbs appeared to be moving on their own. Some reported feeling a sense of disorientation, as if the room was shifting around them. Others claimed to have seen shadowy figures lurking just beyond the edge of perception.

Despite the unsettling atmosphere, Dmytro Esquivel's "Echoes in the Abyss" was receiving widespread critical acclaim.
