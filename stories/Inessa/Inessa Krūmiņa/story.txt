As Inessa Krūmiņa trekked through the dense jungle, her eyes scanned the landscape for any sign of the fabled metropolis. The air was thick with humidity and the sounds of the forest provided a constant symphony of warnings and temptations. She moved stealthily, aware that one misstep could prove disastrous in this unforgiving environment.
