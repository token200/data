Her work had taken her to every corner of the globe, from war-torn cities to quaint small towns.

One day, while researching a story on environmental degradation in rural Quebec, Inessa stumbled upon an unusual tale. A group of local farmers had been using an innovative method of composting their waste to create fertile soil for their crops.
