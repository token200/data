Kaido Mendes was known for his cunning and ruthlessness. A wealthy businessman, he had made a name for himself in the cutthroat world of finance, but beneath the surface, he was driven by a deep-seated ambition to rule.

With eyes that seemed to bore into those he met, Kaido exuded an aura of confidence and power. His sharp jawline and chiseled features were accentuated by his perfectly coiffed hair, giving him an air of invincibility. Few dared to cross him, for they knew that his wrath was not to be trifled with.
