Kaido Lefevre stepped out of his sleek black sedan and onto the rain-soaked streets of Paris. He was a man of mystery, with piercing blue eyes and jet-black hair that fell to his shoulders. His sharp jawline and angular features gave him an air of sophistication, but there was something unsettling about him that made people keep their distance.

Kaido was a billionaire entrepreneur with a reputation for ruthlessness in business. He had built his empire from scratch, using every trick in the book to get ahead. But beneath the surface, he was haunted by a dark past and driven by a desire for revenge against those who had wronged him.

As he walked through the city streets, Kaido's eyes scanned the crowds for any sign of the man he was looking for: Victor Laurent, a former business partner who had betrayed him and stolen his most valuable asset. The memory of that betrayal still burned within him, fueling his every move.

Kaido stopped at a small café on the corner of Rue de Rivoli and arrivederci street, ordering a black coffee from the barista. As he waited for his drink, he scanned the room once more, his eyes narrowing as he spotted a woman sitting in the corner, typing away on her laptop.

She was a beauty, with long blonde hair and piercing green eyes that sparkled like emeralds in the dim light of the café. Kaido's interest piqued, he made his way over to her table, his long strides eating up the distance between them.

"Mind if I join you?" he asked, flashing a charming smile as he sat down beside her.

The woman looked up, startled, and Kaido was struck by the flash of recognition in her eyes. "I'm afraid so," she said, her voice husky and confident.

Kaido raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "Really? I could have sworn I've seen you before."

The woman smiled, a sly smile that sent shivers down Kaido's spine. "Perhaps you have," she said, leaning in close to whisper, "I'm Victor Laurent's sister."
