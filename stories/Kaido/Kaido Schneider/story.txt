Kaido Schneider was a man consumed by his past. A former soldier, he had seen his fair share of battles and lost count of the number of friends he'd made along the way. The memories still lingered, haunting him like a ghost.

As he walked through the city streets, Kaido couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. His eyes scanned the crowds, searching for any sign of trouble. It was a habit he'd developed over the years, one that had saved his life more than once.

Kaido's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps behind him. He turned to see a young woman approaching him, her eyes filled with concern.

"Mr. Schneider?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Kaido nodded, his instincts on high alert. "Yes?"

The woman hesitated before speaking again. "I've been sent by the government to offer you protection."

Kaido's expression remained skeptical. He'd heard it all before – promises of safety and security that always seemed to fall short.

"What makes them think I need protection?" Kaido asked, his tone firm but guarded.

The woman hesitated again, her eyes darting nervously around the crowded street. "We've received reports of... unsavory characters in your vicinity," she stammered.

Kaido raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. Unsavory characters? That was a new one.

The woman took a deep breath before speaking again. "We believe you're being targeted because of your... extracurricular activities."

Kaido's eyes narrowed, his mind racing with possibilities. Extracurricular activities? What did she mean?

The woman hesitated once more before revealing the truth: Kaido was being hunted by a shadowy organization that had been tracking him for months.

As the news sunk in, Kaido felt a familiar sense of unease creeping over him. He knew he couldn't trust anyone – not even this mysterious government agent.

But something about her words struck a chord within him. Maybe it was the desperation in her eyes or the hint of fear that trembled beneath her surface. Whatever it was, Kaido found himself accepting the offer of protection, at least for now.

With a curt nod, Kaido agreed to work with the government. He knew he couldn't stay hidden forever – but for now, it seemed safer than facing whatever dangers lay ahead alone.
