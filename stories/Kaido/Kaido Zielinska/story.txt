Kaido Zielinska stepped out of the rain-soaked streets and into the dimly lit tavern. The sign above the door creaked in the wind, reading "The Red Griffin" in faded letters. Kaido had heard whispers about this place being a hub for information and clandestine meetings. As a skilled mercenary, they always kept their ears open for opportunities.

The patrons turned to gaze at Kaido, their faces a mix of curiosity and suspicion. The bartender, a gruff old man with a thick beard, nodded in their direction. "You're the one they call Zielinska, right? I've heard a lot about you."

Kaido smiled wryly, their eyes scanning the room for potential threats or allies. They had built a reputation as a reliable and ruthless fighter, but also knew when to hold back. The bartender slid a mug of ale down the bar towards them without being asked.

As Kaido sipped their drink, a hooded figure slipped onto the stool beside them. "You're looking for work, Zielinska?" they asked in a low voice. "I have a proposal that requires your unique skills."

Kaido raised an eyebrow, intrigued. They had worked with various factions and governments, taking on missions both high-stakes and morally ambiguous. This could be the break they needed to further their career.

The hooded figure produced a small notebook from beneath their cloak, filled with cryptic notes and sketches. "I represent a... client who needs someone to retrieve an artifact from an ancient ruin. The catch? It's said to be cursed."

Kaido's eyes widened as they devoured the information. This was exactly the kind of risk they craved â€“ a chance to prove themselves and collect a hefty payday. They nodded, tucking the notebook into their jacket pocket.

The hooded figure handed Kaido a small pouch containing a few gold coins and a vial of potent elixir. "Be warned, Zielinska: the ruin is said to be filled with traps and unspeakable horrors. You'll need all your wits about you."

Kaido smiled once more, this time at the prospect of the challenge ahead. With their trusty sword and a healthy dose of skepticism, they set out into the darkness, ready to face whatever lay within the ancient ruin.
