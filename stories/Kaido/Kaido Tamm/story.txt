Kaido Tamm stood at the edge of the dock, his piercing blue eyes gazing out at the vast expanse of the Baltic Sea. The salty air whipped through his dark hair, which was slicked back in a messy manner that spoke to his rugged, independent nature. A grizzled fisherman and smuggler, Kaido had spent years navigating these waters, evading the authorities and making a name for himself as one of the most cunning men on the sea.

As he scanned the horizon, his eyes narrowed, taking in the subtle signs of the ever-changing weather patterns that dictated his every move. A light wind carried the scent of diesel fuel and engine grease, a signal that a ship was nearby - but not too close, lest it arouse unwanted attention.

Suddenly, a sleek black boat chugged into view, its engines purring smoothly as it came alongside the dock. Kaido's eyes locked onto the figure at the helm, a young woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair that fell in tangled locks down her back. He nodded once, curtly acknowledging her presence before turning his attention to the cargo holds beneath the boat.

A faint rustle of fabric caught his eye as she gestured for him to follow her. Kaido's instincts told him something was off - but he had spent too long honing his skills to trust his gut completely. He shouldered a battered leather duffel, which swung against his thigh as he followed the woman aboard.

She led him to the rear of the boat, where a makeshift cargo hold reeked of sweat and dampness. In the center, a crate wrapped in canvas and twine waited for him - Kaido's eyes flickered with excitement as he recognized the markings: a rare shipment of Baltic amber, its value making it highly sought after by collectors.

But something about this felt off, too. As Kaido reached out to lift the lid, a sudden noise echoed across the water, growing louder with each passing moment - the unmistakable thrum of a helicopter.
