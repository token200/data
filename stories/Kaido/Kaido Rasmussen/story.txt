Kaido Rasmussen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station with a mix of nostalgia and unease. It had been ten years since she'd last set foot in Ravenswood, the town where her family had once lived before disappearing under mysterious circumstances.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Kaido couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. She'd always felt like an outsider in Ravenswood, and now, with her return, she wondered if anyone would even remember her name – Kaido Rasmussen, a girl who had left without explanation.

Kaido's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of rustling leaves behind her. She turned to see an elderly woman approaching, her face lined with wrinkles and her eyes twinkling with warmth. "Well, well, well," the woman said, her voice like music. "If it isn't Kaido Rasmussen, back in town."

Kaido's heart skipped a beat as she hesitated, unsure of how to respond. The woman, noticing her unease, smiled and took Kaido's hand in hers. "Come on, dear. Let's get you settled. I'm Agnes, the owner of this little station. We haven't seen much of each other, but I'm glad you're home."

As they walked through the town, Agnes filled Kaido in on the changes that had taken place since her departure. New families had moved in, and the old ones were slowly fading away. But amidst all the change, one thing remained constant: the sense of unease that lingered over Ravenswood like a shadow.

Kaido Rasmussen felt it too, a heavy weight pressing down on her shoulders. She knew she couldn't stay forever, but for now, she was home – if only for a little while. And with Agnes by her side, she felt a glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, she could finally find the answers she'd been searching for all these years.
