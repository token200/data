Kaido James stepped off the plane, his eyes scanning the arrivals lounge as if searching for someone. Or something. He had been to this airport countless times before, yet he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.

As a former Special Forces operative turned mercenary, Kaido had seen his fair share of battles and bloodshed. But there was something about this mission that didn't sit right with him. Maybe it was the client - a wealthy tech mogul with a reputation for ruthlessness - or maybe it was the rumors of a top-secret government operation.

Whatever it was, Kaido knew he had to be careful. He made his way through customs and into the crowded airport terminal, where his contact waited for him.

"Kaido," the woman said, her voice low and smooth. "Good to see you."

"Not as good to see you, Rachel," Kaido replied, flashing a wry smile. "What's the story?"

Rachel handed him a small folder containing the mission briefing. As he scanned it quickly, his eyes narrowed.

"Government operation?" he repeated, his tone incredulous.

"That's right," Rachel said. "Project Erebus. Rumor has it that you're to extract a scientist and bring them to safety."

Kaido raised an eyebrow. "And what makes me think I'm the only one for this job?"

Rachel shrugged. "Client said you were the best man for the task. But let's be clear, Kaido - this is not going to be a cakewalk. You'll need to be prepared for anything."

Kaido nodded, tucking the folder into his backpack. He knew what Rachel was implying - that this mission would test him in ways he wasn't sure he was ready for.

As they made their way to the waiting vehicle, Kaido couldn't shake the feeling of unease. Something about this mission didn't feel right. But he pushed on, fueled by his instincts and a healthy dose of skepticism.

He arrived at the agreed meeting point, a nondescript warehouse on the outskirts of town. The air was thick with tension as he spotted the scientist being extracted from a secure facility.

Kaido's eyes locked onto the woman in question - Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a renowned expert in advanced biotechnology. He nodded to Rachel, who gave him a discreet signal before melting into the shadows.

As Kaido approached Dr. Rodriguez, he felt his training kicking in. Something didn't feel right.
