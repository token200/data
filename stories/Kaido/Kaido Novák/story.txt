Kaido Novák was an enigmatic figure known only by his alias, "The Shadow Weaver." Rumors swirled about his past, with some claiming he was once a member of a powerful organization, while others whispered that he was a former spy. Whatever the truth may have been, one thing was certain: Kaido Novák was a master of deception and misdirection.

With an uncanny ability to blend into the background, Kaido Novák could weave in and out of the shadows like a ghostly apparition. His eyes seemed to bore into those he encountered, as if searching for hidden secrets or vulnerabilities. Those who crossed his path often felt a shiver run down their spine, as if they were being sized up by an unseen adversary.

Kaido Novák's latest target was a wealthy businessman named Marcus Thompson, who had made a fortune through shady dealings and ruthless tactics. The Shadow Weaver had been tracking Thompson for weeks, gathering intel on his every move. It wasn't until Kaido Novák received an invitation to one of Thompson's high-stakes poker games that he knew it was time to make his move.

Dressed in a black tuxedo, Kaido Novák arrived at the exclusive club like a phantom from another world. He mingled with the guests, all while keeping a watchful eye on Thompson.
