Kaido Eriksson stood at the edge of the frozen lake, his eyes fixed on the horizon. The snow-covered trees surrounding him seemed to stretch up to the sky like skeletal fingers, their branches creaking in the biting wind. It was a landscape he knew all too well, one that held both beauty and terror.

As a former Swedish engineer, Kaido had spent years working on the Vattenfall hydropower plant, designing and building systems to harness the power of Sweden's mighty rivers. But it was the ice that had ultimately claimed him. The year before, while testing new equipment on this very lake, he'd fallen through the surface and been swept away by the rushing water.

The accident had left Kaido with a rare condition known as "ice-induced dissociative amnesia." Every time he came close to water, his memories would fade like mist in the sun. It was as if his mind had chosen to protect itself from the trauma of that fateful day.

Now, Kaido had returned to the lake, determined to confront his past and reclaim his memories. He wore a thick parka, insulated gloves, and carried an emergency kit with him, just in case. The wind howled through his hair as he trudged across the ice, each step feeling like a battle against the elements.

As he walked, Kaido felt his mind begin to fog over, memories slipping away like sand between his fingers. He tried to focus on the sensation of the cold air on his face, the way it stung and numbed him. But the more he concentrated, the more elusive his thoughts became.

Just when Kaido was about to give up, a vision flickered into existence. It was a fleeting image of himself standing at the edge of the lake, laughing with colleagues as they worked on the hydropower plant. The memory felt real, yet distant – like a photograph that had been left out in the sun too long.

Kaido's eyes narrowed, trying to grasp the edges of the recollection. It was a start, he told himself. He took another step forward, onto the ice, and let the cold air wash over him once more. This time, when his memories began to fade, he was ready – prepared to hold on to the fleeting glimpse of his past, no matter what it took.
