Isabel Krūmiņš beamed with pride as strangers complimented her work, asking thoughtful questions that revealed their deep understanding of her art. It was clear that Isabel's talent had resonated with a wider audience, far beyond her hometown.

As the night wore on, Isabel found herself lost in conversation with a local curator, discussing the intersection of nature and culture in her artwork. The curator praised Isabel's bold use of color, stating that it seemed to evoke a sense of place and belonging in viewers.

Isabel Krūmiņš felt a surge of gratitude toward this stranger-turned-fan, recognizing that her art had not only touched their heart but also opened doors to new connections.
