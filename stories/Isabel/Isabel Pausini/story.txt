I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Isabel Pausini. However, I did find out that there is an Italian singer and songwriter by the name of Eros Ramazzotti's ex-wife, Edoardo Bennato had been in a relationship with the Italian singer and actress, Adriano Celentano's daughter but most famously known was married to the former italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema.
