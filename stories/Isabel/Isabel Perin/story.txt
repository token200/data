Isabel Perin was known for her striking green eyes and razor-sharp wit, but few people knew that behind those piercing gazes lay a heart of gold. As a renowned detective in the city of Ashwood, she had solved some of the most heinous crimes in recent memory.

One fateful evening, a distraught Mrs. Jenkins arrived at Isabel Perin's office, begging for her help in finding her missing daughter, Sophia.
