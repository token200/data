Isabel Thomas had always been a free spirit, never content to stay in one place for too long. As a young woman, she had a restless energy that drove her to explore new places and meet new people. After completing her degree in anthropology, Isabel had spent several years traveling the world, immersing herself in different cultures and learning as much as she could.

Despite her love of adventure, Isabel was also a romantic at heart. She believed in fairy tales and true love, and had given up hope of ever finding it after one particularly painful breakup. That was until she met Jack, a fellow traveler who shared her passion for exploration and good food. The two of them spent months traveling together, laughing and arguing over nothing.

As their journey came to an end, Isabel found herself feeling a sense of loss. She had grown to love the freedom of the open road, and the thought of settling down in one place was daunting. Jack, sensing her unease, proposed a compromise: they would spend the next few months traveling together, but then part ways. Isabel agreed, knowing that it was the only way she could truly move on.

The months that followed were some of the happiest of Isabel Thomas's life. She and Jack traveled to new destinations, rekindled old friendships, and tried new foods. But as the summer drew to a close, Isabel began to feel the familiar pang of restlessness. She knew it was time to start thinking about her future, and what that might hold.

As she sat on the beach, watching the sun set over the ocean, Isabel felt a sense of peace wash over her. She knew that no matter where life took her next, she would always carry Jack's memory with her. And as she closed her eyes, she felt a spark of excitement for what the future might hold â€“ for Isabel Thomas, at least.
