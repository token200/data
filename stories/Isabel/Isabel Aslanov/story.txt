Isabel Aslanov sat at her desk, staring out the window as she poured over lines of code. She was a brilliant programmer, known for her lightning-fast reflexes and unparalleled attention to detail. Her dark hair was tied back in a tight ponytail, revealing a smattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose.

As she worked, Isabel's mind wandered to her latest project - an AI system designed to help people with disabilities. She had lost her brother, Alex, to a tragic accident when he was just 19, and it had driven her to pursue this work. The AI system would be able to assist those who were unable to communicate for themselves.

Just then, the phone rang. Isabel's mother, Natalya, answered it and hung up, turning to her daughter with a concerned look on her face.

"Isabel, your cousin Viktor is in town. He says he needs to talk to you."

Viktor was an old friend of Isabel's from childhood, but they had drifted apart as they grew older. She wasn't sure what he wanted to discuss, but she knew she couldn't avoid him forever.

Isabel took a deep breath and headed out the door. The cool evening air hit her like a slap in the face as she walked down the street to Viktor's apartment building. When she arrived, she was greeted by his nervous smile.

"I'm so glad I caught you," he said, ushering her into his apartment. "I've been wanting to talk to you for weeks."

Viktor launched into an explanation of why he had come - a business proposition that involved investing in Isabel's AI system. Isabel listened intently, her expression unreadable.

As she listened, however, she couldn't shake the feeling that Viktor was hiding something. He seemed evasive, almost dishonest. She asked him questions about his company and the specifics of the proposal, but he dodged each one with ease.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Isabel stood up. "I think I've heard enough," she said, her voice firm but polite. "Thank you for coming to visit, Viktor."

Viktor looked taken aback by her sudden change in demeanor. "Okay... well, maybe we can talk about this another time?" he suggested, quickly gathering his things and making a hasty exit.

Isabel watched him go with a sense of relief washing over her. She knew that she had made the right decision - at least, for now. She turned to leave, but not before catching sight of something on Viktor's phone screen. A message from an unknown number: "Cancel all meetings with Isabel Aslanov."
