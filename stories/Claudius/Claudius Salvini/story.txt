Claudius Salvini stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of saltwater and diesel fuel filling his lungs. He had been away for months, and it felt like an eternity since he'd set foot in this small coastal town. As he made his way through the crowded station, he spotted her waiting for him on the other side - his sister, Sophia.

Sophia was a vision of elegance in her long, dark coat, her hair pulled back into a sleek bun that accentuated her striking features. She flashed a bright smile as Claudius approached, and he couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia wash over him. He had always looked up to his sister - not just because she was older, but because she embodied the kind of strength and resilience he often lacked.

The siblings made their way through the station, exchanging hushed greetings with acquaintances along the way. As they walked out into the bright sunlight, Claudius couldn't help but notice the changes in Sophia. She seemed... different. More confident, more assured. He asked her about it as they strolled along the beachside promenade.

"Everything okay?" he said, his brow furrowed with concern. "You seem... changed."

Sophia chuckled and leaned against him on the railing. "I've been taking some time for myself," she said. "Getting out of my own head, I suppose. It's funny how sometimes we need to step back from our problems before we can truly see a way forward."

As they walked, Claudius watched as Sophia effortlessly navigated the crowds of tourists and locals alike, her presence commanding attention without seeming to seek it. He realized that he had been feeling lost lately - struggling to come to terms with his own place in this world. But in watching Sophia move through her day with such purpose and poise, he felt a spark ignite within him.

As the sun began to set over the ocean, Claudius turned to Sophia with newfound determination. "I think I'm going to start taking some time for myself too," he said, his voice filled with a sense of resolve he hadn't felt in months. "Thanks for showing me the way, sis."

Sophia smiled and leaned into him once more. "That's what big sisters are for," she said, her eyes shining with warmth.
