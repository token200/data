Intrigued, Claudius Bauer decided to pay a visit to his contacts in the underworld, determined to get to the bottom of this tantalizing tip-off.

As he sipped on a lukewarm coffee at a dingy café, Claudius Bauer struck up a conversation with an unlikely informant: a scrappy little street artist named Rachel. With her bold graffiti tags and irreverent spirit, Rachel seemed an unlikely candidate for providing valuable intel – but Claudius Bauer had learned to trust his instincts.
