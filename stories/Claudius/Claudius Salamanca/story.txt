Claudius 'The Cat' Salamanca sat in his favorite armchair, sipping his whiskey and surveying the chaos that had erupted from his kitchen. His infamous plate of sopapillas lay abandoned on the floor, a testament to the explosive arguments he'd just had with his brother-in-law, Gus Fring.

As the notorious kingpin of Albuquerque's underworld, Claudius was known for his cunning and ruthless tactics. But despite his fearsome reputation, he had a soft spot for sopapillas – they reminded him of his childhood in El Paso, where his mother would fry them to perfection in the family kitchen.

Just then, his phone rang. It was Mike Ehrmantraut, Claudius's trusted lieutenant and all-around straight-shooter. 'Mike, what's the word?' Claudius asked, his voice low and gravelly.

'Gus Fring wants you to meet him at the compound,' Mike replied. 'He says it's about your "plate of sopapillas".'

Claudius snorted. He knew exactly why Gus was calling – he wanted to take a swipe at Claudius's reputation for being a little too...flaky.

When Claudius arrived at the compound, Gus greeted him with his usual icy stare. 'Claudius, I hear you're having some...indigestion issues.'

Claudius chuckled, a low, menacing sound. 'Just enjoying my sopapillas, Gus. You know how it is.'

Gus raised an eyebrow. 'You're not going to get into another one of your arguments with the brothers, are you?'

Claudius shook his head, still grinning. 'Nah, I've got too many other fish to fry – or should I say, sopapillas to fry?'

The tension between them dissipated, and Gus nodded curtly before turning back to the meeting.

As Claudius left the compound, he couldn't help but think about his complicated relationship with Gus. Despite their differences, they'd always had a begrudging respect for each other – mostly because both men were skilled enough to have managed to survive in the cutthroat world of Albuquerque's underworld.

Claudius smiled to himself as he walked back to his car. He was known as 'The Cat', and for good reason: he could get out of any situation with ease, all while keeping a cool head and a sharp wit.

And when it came down to it, that was the key to being the best in the business – always staying one step ahead, and never letting your enemies get the better of you.
