As a skilled detective, he relied on his ability to notice minute details that others might overlook.

One drizzly afternoon, Claudius Sandstrom received a cryptic message from an anonymous source. The note read: "Meet me at the old oak tree in the park at midnight." Intrigued by the mystery, Claudius decided to investigate further. He spent hours researching possible suspects and potential motives, pouring over police records and conducting interviews with acquaintances.

At midnight, as the rain began to clear, Claudius made his way to the designated spot. The old oak tree stood tall and still, casting long shadows across the deserted park. A figure emerged from the darkness, beckoning him closer. Claudius' instincts told him that this person might be connected to the mysterious message.

As the stranger approached, Claudius Sandstrom noticed a peculiar scar above their left eyebrow, which seemed out of place on an otherwise unassuming face.
