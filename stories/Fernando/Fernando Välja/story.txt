Fernando Välja was known for his striking features and sharp wit, but it was his passion for photography that truly set him apart. Growing up in Tallinn, Estonia, he spent countless hours exploring the city's cobblestone streets with a camera slung around his neck, capturing the beauty in every nook and cranny.

As a young man, Fernando worked as an assistant to some of Tallinn's most renowned photographers, honing his skills and building a reputation for his keen eye. But it wasn't until he stumbled upon an abandoned windmill on the outskirts of town that he found inspiration for his own unique style.

The windmill, with its weathered wooden slats and rusty gears, seemed to whisper tales of the past to Fernando. He saw in it a reflection of the city's complex history – a blend of old-world charm and industrial decay. For months, he returned to the windmill, camera in hand, capturing its intricate textures and colors.

Word of Fernando's photographs spread quickly through Tallinn's art circles, and soon he was exhibiting his work alongside some of Estonia's most established artists. But it wasn't until he stumbled upon an old family album, hidden away in his grandfather's attic, that his true voice as a photographer emerged.

The album, filled with faded black-and-white portraits of Fernando's ancestors, revealed a story of love, loss, and resilience. As he delved deeper into the album, Fernando began to see his own life through new eyes – as a tapestry woven from threads of tradition and innovation.

Fernando's photographs became more than just visual representations of the world around him; they were personal odes to the people and places that shaped his identity. His portraits of Tallinn's residents captured the quiet strength and humor of everyday life, while his landscapes revealed the city's rugged beauty and emotional depth.

Years later, Fernando Välja would look back on those early days in the windmill as a turning point in his career – a moment when he discovered his true voice as a photographer. And though his style continued to evolve, one thing remained constant: his passion for capturing the stories that make us human.
