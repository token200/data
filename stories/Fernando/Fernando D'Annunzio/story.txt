I must correct you - I couldn't find any information on a notable historical figure named Fernando D'Annunzio. However, I believe you may be thinking of Gabriele D'Annunzio, an Italian poet and politician.

Here's a story about him:

It was a sweltering summer evening in 1914, and the Italian city of Fiume (now known as Rijeka, Croatia) was abuzz with excitement. Gabriele D'Annunzio, one of Italy's most celebrated poets, had arrived in town to rally support for his ill-fated military campaign.

D'Annunzio was a complex figure - part poet, part patriot, and part dictator-in-waiting. His charisma and passion were undeniable, but also often divisive. As he stood on the steps of the city's cathedral, he addressed the crowd with a fiery oration, decrying the Italian government's failure to recognize Fiume as an independent state.

The crowd was entranced, hanging on his every word like moths to a flame. D'Annunzio's message resonated deeply with many who felt disillusioned with Italy's slow pace of progress and nationalist politics. They saw in him a hero, a champion of freedom and self-determination.

As the night wore on, D'Annunzio rallied his followers, calling them to arms against what he perceived as Italian imperialist ambitions. The crowd surged forward, their fervor palpable. The city was soon awash with revolutionary fervor - Fiume had become a battleground for the ideal of independence.

Over the next few months, D'Annunzio's movement would gain momentum, culminating in a military coup that would change the course of Italian history. But as he led his troops into battle, the poet's passion began to give way to authoritarianism - and the lines between heroism and madness grew increasingly blurred.

Years later, as historians would retrospectively label him an "autarchist dictator," D'Annunzio's legacy remained shrouded in controversy. His Fiume was a city of idealism, of poetry and politics that had blurred into madness. The poet's greatest creation - the city-state of Carnaro - had become a tragic experiment, forged from the fires of revolutionary fervor.

In the end, it was not his poetry that defined him, but rather the politician he became - one who had so zealously pursued his ideal of Italy and freedom, only to sacrifice everything on the altar of power.
