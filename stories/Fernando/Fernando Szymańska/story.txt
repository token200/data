As a child, Fernando would spend hours listening to records of Andrés Segovia, mesmerized by the Spanish master's expressive playing style.

As he grew older, Fernando's interest in music only deepened. He began taking lessons with a local teacher, who encouraged him to explore his own unique sound.
