Fernando's most famous work, "The Forest at Dusk," had become an iconic representation of Latvian culture. The painting depicted a dense forest bathed in golden light, with trees stretching up towards the sky like giant sentinels. It was a testament to Fernando's skill as an artist and his deep connection to the natural world.
