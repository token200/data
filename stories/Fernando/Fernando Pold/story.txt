Fernando Pold was known for his uncanny ability to find himself in the most absurd situations. As a professional snail trainer, he had spent years perfecting the art of coaxing sluggish creatures into racing form.

One fateful day, Fernando Pold decided to enter his prized snail, Gary, into the annual Snail Racing Championship being held at the prestigious Garden Grove Stadium. He spent hours polishing Gary's shell and fine-tuning his training regimen.

As the big day approached, Fernando Pold couldn't help but feel a sense of nervous anticipation. What if Gary didn't perform well? What if he was disqualified for some minor infractions?

The day of the championship arrived, and Fernando Pold arrived at the stadium with Gary securely stowed away in his custom-made snail carriage. As they took their place at the starting line alongside other competitors, Fernando Pold couldn't help but feel a sense of pride in his underdog snail.

As the starting gun fired, the racers – including a pair of menacing-looking slug robots and a team of tutu-clad gerbils – shot off like, well, not exactly rockets. Gary, however, was lagging behind. Fernando Pold watched with bated breath as his beloved snail struggled to keep up.

Just when it seemed like all hope was lost, Fernando Pold's quick thinking and expert coaching kicked in. He expertly adjusted the course, funneling Gary into a narrow tunnel that would allow him to make a last-ditch sprint for the finish line.

In a stunning upset, Fernando Pold and Gary crossed the finish line first, narrowly beating out the slug robots by a hair. As they accepted their trophy and basked in the adoration of the crowd, Fernando Pold beamed with pride. He had done it – his hard work and dedication had paid off.

For the next year or so at least, Fernando Pold would be hailed as the greatest snail trainer in history. And when he walked into the Garden Grove Stadium's hall of fame ceremony wearing Gary on his shoulder, he couldn't help but smile knowing that he was Fernando Pold – the man behind one of the most improbable victories the championship had ever seen.
