I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Mykola Kortajarena. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created for a specific purpose.

However, I can create a story about a character with this name. Here it is:

Mykola Kortajarena was a mysterious figure known only by his first and last names. He was a master thief and con artist who had evaded the law for years. With his quick wit and charming smile, he could talk his way out of any situation.

One day, Mykola Kortajarena received a message from an old acquaintance, requesting a meeting at a high-stakes poker game. The stakes were high, but Mykola was always up for a challenge. He arrived at the casino, dressed in his finest attire, and took his seat at the table.

As the game began, Mykola Kortajarena's skills were put to the test. He played with precision and confidence, outmaneuvering his opponents at every turn. But just as he thought he had won, a new player joined the table - a young woman with piercing green eyes and a mischievous grin.

The woman, who introduced herself as Sophia, was no ordinary poker player. She was a skilled thief and con artist, rivaling Mykola Kortajarena in cunning and wit. The two of them engaged in a game of cat and mouse, each trying to outdo the other.

As the night wore on, Mykola Kortajarena found himself drawn to Sophia's charms. He couldn't help but wonder what secrets she hid behind her captivating smile. But he knew better than to let his guard down - not around someone like Sophia.

In the end, it was a draw, with both players walking away with a hefty sum of money. As they left the casino together, Mykola Kortajarena couldn't help but feel a spark of attraction towards Sophia. He wondered if their next encounter would be one of chance or fate. Only time would tell.
