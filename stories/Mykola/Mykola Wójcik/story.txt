Mykola Wójcik was a man of few words, yet his piercing gaze could see right through you. A former soldier, he had returned from the trenches with a unique skillset – one that allowed him to navigate the shadows.

After leaving the army, Mykola settled in Warsaw, where rumors began to circulate about a mysterious figure who could move undetected through the city's underbelly. Whispers of his expertise as a "walker" spread quickly among the locals, earning him both notoriety and fear.

Mykola's services were sought after by those with more pressing concerns: thieves seeking advice on evading the police, spies looking for information about potential targets, or merely those desperate to keep a secret hidden. He was always careful who he took on as clients; some required too much risk, and Mykola didn't want his skills compromised.

One evening, Mykola received an unusual request from a wealthy merchant named Jakub. The man claimed to have stumbled upon something extraordinary – a valuable artifact with potential to destabilize the entire city. The only problem was that it belonged to him. 

Mykola agreed to meet Jakub at a secluded mansion on the outskirts of town. There, amidst velvet drapes and flickering candelabras, he discovered an ornate box adorned with intricate symbols. As Mykola carefully opened it, a faint hum filled the air.

"This is no ordinary trinket," Jakub confessed. "My ancestors claimed it had magical properties."

Intrigued by the merchant's words, Mykola agreed to help him hide the artifact from those who might exploit its power. He set about walking through shadows across the city – navigating narrow alleys and secret courtyards – until they reached a hidden chamber beneath Jakub's mansion.

Within this subterranean space, Mykola helped Jakub conceal the box within a false wall. The merchant offered Mykola a promise: as long as he kept his identity concealed, he would be rewarded with a substantial sum of gold whenever he chose to leave Warsaw.

Thus began Mykola Wójcik's life as a shadow walker, ever-watchful and ever-ready. His secrets remained buried within the city itself – protected by whispers of an enigmatic figure who moved unseen in the night.
