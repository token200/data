As a renowned painter and lithographer, he had always been drawn to the city's mystique, its intricate balance between Eastern and Western influences. Mykola Kalējs took a deep breath, feeling the cool air fill his lungs as he began his daily walk along the Daugava River.

As he strolled, he pondered the latest project that had been occupying his mind - a collection of lithographs inspired by Latvian folklore. Mykola Kalējs was known for his ability to capture the essence of his subjects, to convey the emotions and stories behind the myths and legends.
