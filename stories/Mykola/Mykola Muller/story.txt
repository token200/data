As a young artist, Mykola's work was met with skepticism by some, who saw him as too radical in his approach. But he refused to be deterred, driven by a fierce determination to express himself authentically.

He remained true to himself and his art, using the platform he had built to spread awareness about social justice causes that were close to his heart. His paintings became a reflection of his activism – vibrant depictions of marginalized communities, poignant portraits of struggle and resilience.

Despite his success, Mykola Muller never lost sight of his humble beginnings. He continued to live in his small apartment, surrounded by his beloved art supplies and eclectic record collection. At night, he would often put on his favorite vinyl records and lose himself in the swirling rhythms and melodies.

One evening, as Mykola Muller was preparing for an upcoming exhibition, his phone rang. It was a fellow artist, inviting him to collaborate on a new project that combined music and visual art. The idea sparked something within Mykola – he knew instantly that this was what he had been searching for all along. And so, with renewed energy, he began working on the project, the sounds of his beloved records echoing in the background as he brought his vision to life.
