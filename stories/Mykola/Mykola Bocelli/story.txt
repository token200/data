I couldn't find any information on a character named Mykola Bocelli. It is possible that this character does not exist in my knowledge database or may be a fictional character that has not been created yet.

However, I can suggest an alternative story about a famous opera singer who shares a similar name with the fictional character:

Luciano Pavarotti was an Italian operatic tenor renowned for his powerful and wide-ranging voice. Born on October 12, 1935, in Modena, Italy, he was one of the most celebrated singers of the 20th century.

As a young boy, Luciano Pavarotti would often sing with his family's folk group, which exposed him to the world of opera at an early age. He began training as a professional singer while still in high school and eventually won a national singing competition that led him to study music in the United States.

Luciano Pavarotti's career spanned over five decades, during which he performed with some of the world's leading orchestras and operas houses. His iconic performances, including his rendition of "Nessun Dorma," have become synonymous with opera itself.

Throughout his life, Luciano Pavarotti was recognized for his charitable work, particularly in supporting Italian organizations that helped those affected by poverty and disease. He also traveled extensively around the world to promote unity and understanding between different cultures through music.

Luciano Pavarotti's legacy continues to inspire new generations of singers, opera enthusiasts, and music lovers worldwide.
