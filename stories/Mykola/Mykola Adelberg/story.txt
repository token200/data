It was on one such dreary winter evening that Mykola received a visit from the local police commissioner, his usually composed demeanor ruffled by the latest string of high-society burglaries. The affluent residents of St. Petersburg were being robbed blind, with the thief leaving behind only a small, delicate music box as their calling card.

Intrigued by the peculiar nature of the crimes, Mykola agreed to take on the case, and his investigation began in earnest. He spent countless hours poring over the evidence, searching for any thread that might lead him to the enigmatic thief.

One fateful night, as the snow fell gently outside, Mykola received a cryptic message from an unknown sender, taunting him with the location of the next music box. With his instincts on high alert, he set out into the darkness, following the trail to a remote mansion on the outskirts of town. There, he found himself face-to-face with the thief, and in a flash of insight, Mykola unraveled the mystery.

As the music box's melody faded away, Mykola stood victorious, his reputation as one of St. Petersburg's greatest detectives solidified. And though he had solved the case, he knew that there were still secrets lurking in the shadows, waiting to be uncovered by the man known only as Mykola Ivanovich Adelberg.
