Mykola Mäkinen, a Finnish archer from Helsinki, had always been fascinated by the art of shooting. Growing up in a small wooden cabin on the outskirts of the city, he would often spend hours practicing his aim in the forest, watching the sunlight filter through the trees.

As a child, Mykola was captivated by the stories of Finnish national hero Vaino Voitola, who won gold at the 1900 Paris Olympics. He dreamed of one day competing on that stage himself, and so he dedicated himself to perfecting his craft. Years of training paid off when, at the age of 25, Mykola qualified for the Olympic trials.

The year was 1928, and Mykola stood nervously in front of the judges' table, his bowstring taut and his heart pounding. The crowd roared as he released his shot, and the sound of the arrow flying through the air seemed to echo through eternity. When the scores were announced, Mykola had made it to the final round.

It was a tense moment as the archers took their places at the shooting line. One misstep would mean elimination. The judges' eyes narrowed as they counted down the seconds, and then... silence.

The scoreboard flashed, displaying the names of the top three competitors: Mäkinen, France's Paul Desmedt, and the American Jack McDonald. Mykola had done it! He took his place on stage, alongside the other finalists, as the crowd erupted in cheers.

The day before the final round, Mykola wandered through the streets of Paris, feeling both elated and nervous. As he walked along the Seine, he spotted a small café where Vaino Voitola used to meet with friends. He took a seat outside, ordering a warm cup of coffee as he pondered his next move.

The morning of the final round arrived, and Mykola stood tall at the shooting line, his eyes scanning the crowded arena. The whistle blew, and he released another arrow. It sailed through the air, hitting its mark with precision. The crowd erupted once more, and this time it was for all to see – Mykola Mäkinen had won the gold medal.

Tears of joy streaming down his face, Mykola raised his arms in triumph as the national anthem played on repeat. It was a moment that would stay with him forever – a testament to his perseverance and dedication to his craft.
