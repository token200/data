Mykola Eriksson stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the small station in front of him. It was a place he hadn't visited in years, yet the memories came flooding back as if no time had passed at all.

As a child, Mykola had spent summers with his grandparents in this very town. His grandfather, a kind old man named Panteleimon, had taught him how to fish and tend to the garden that surrounded their small cottage. It was there that Mykola's love for nature and solitude was first forged.

But life had taken its toll on Mykola since then. He'd left this quiet existence behind to chase his dreams in the city, only to find himself lost and unfulfilled. The world seemed too big, too loud, and he couldn't shake the feeling that a part of him would always remain here.

Mykola's footsteps led him up the winding path that connected the station to the old cottage. He hadn't expected his grandparents' place to be standing alone, but there it was, its wooden beams weathered to a soft silver.

As he pushed open the creaky door, Mykola was enveloped by the scent of fresh herbs and baking bread. His grandmother's kitchen was just as he remembered – warm and inviting. He closed his eyes, letting the memories wash over him once more.

Mykola spent the next few days reconnecting with nature, sitting on the same bench where he'd spent hours as a child, watching the sun set behind the hills. It was as if he'd never left this place, yet everything felt different now.

One evening, while walking along the riverbank, Mykola stumbled upon an old wooden boat half-hidden in the reeds. He hadn't seen boats like that here since he was a boy. Something about it stirred him, drawing him closer. As he pushed the boat into the water, its familiar contours felt like a part of his very soul had come back home.

For the first time in years, Mykola Eriksson felt at peace. The world still seemed vast and overwhelming, but standing there on the river's edge, surrounded by nature, he knew exactly where he belonged – here, among the trees and reeds, with nothing more than the wind and his thoughts to keep him company.

In that moment, the city's din faded away, replaced by a soft hum of crickets and rustling leaves. Mykola smiled, knowing that he'd found what he'd been searching for all along – not a destination, but a refuge within himself.
