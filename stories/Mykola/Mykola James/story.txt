Mykola James stepped out of his worn leather satchel, stretching his weathered arms above his head as he took in the crisp morning air. A former soldier, Mykola had grown accustomed to the ruggedities of life on the road. His weary eyes scanned the small market square, where locals went about their daily routines.

As a retired mercenary, Mykola's skills were no longer required by any country's military, but his talents as a survivalist and scavenger made him an invaluable resource in this unforgiving world. He had earned a reputation for being able to navigate even the most desolate landscapes with ease.

Mykola wandered through the stalls, inspecting offerings of fresh produce, scraps of metal, and dusty trinkets. The vendor who sold his usual supply of tinned beans smiled at him as he reached into his satchel. "The usual, Mykola. Thirty cents."

He handed over a crumpled bill, carefully counting out the exact amount before pocketing it. As he continued through the market, he kept a sharp eye on his surroundings, alert for any signs of trouble.

A small girl wandered into his path, eyes wide with curiosity as she gazed up at Mykola's imposing figure. He crouched down beside her, offering a gentle smile. "Hello there, little one. What brings you out today?"

She hesitated before answering in a squeaky voice, "My dad says I need to learn how to find food in the wild."

Mykola chuckled, recalling his own days of surviving on scraps and berries. "Ah, well, that's a valuable skill indeed. Would you like some lessons from me?"

The girl nodded enthusiastically as Mykola pulled out a tattered map from his satchel. He unfolded it, revealing a crude illustration of the surrounding landscape. With a practiced hand, he pointed out edible plants and safe sources of water.

As they sat together in the market square, Mykola James felt a sense of purpose wash over him. For all his years on the battlefield, he had never truly found belonging – but sharing this knowledge with others seemed to bridge that gap.

The sun beat down upon them as the morning wore on, casting long shadows across the dusty ground. When it was time for her to return home, Mykola handed the girl a small pouch containing a handful of seeds and a dried apricot. "For your next lesson," he said with a wink.

As she skipped away, laughing at a stray dog, Mykola stood up, tucking his map back into his satchel. The market square seemed a little brighter, its inhabitants a little more hopeful – and for that moment, the world felt like it might be just a little bit easier to navigate.
