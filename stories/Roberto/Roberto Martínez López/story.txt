One player who benefited from Martínez López's unique approach was star striker Juan Pérez. He found himself increasingly at the center of attention during games, as his intuitive understanding of space allowed him to exploit weaknesses in opposing defenses. It wasn't uncommon for Martínez López to call him over after scoring a goal, praising his instincts and encouraging him to keep exploring those "hidden spaces".

As the season wore on, speculation grew about whether Martínez López would be promoted to manage the first team. His passion and dedication to the game were inspiring, and many fans believed he was due for a chance to prove himself at the top level.
