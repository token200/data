Roberto Kozłowski was not your average man. He had a past shrouded in mystery, with rumors of his work as an undercover agent and black market art dealer swirling like a perpetual cloud over his head.

His latest gig brought him to the streets of New Orleans, where he'd been hired by a wealthy collector to track down a rare 19th-century painting. The artist had disappeared under suspicious circumstances, leaving behind only a handful of cryptic clues.

As Roberto sipped on a whiskey at the bar, he watched a group of shady characters huddled in the corner, speaking in hushed tones about a supposed lead. He signaled to his contact, a sultry singer named Lola who'd promised him more information than she was willing to share.

"What's the score?" Roberto asked, flashing his trademark charm as he slid onto the stool beside her.

Lola leaned in close, her voice barely audible over the din of the jazz band. "I heard it from someone who claims to have seen the painting change hands," she whispered. "It might be at a warehouse on the outskirts of town."

With a nod, Roberto lit a cigarette and stepped out into the night air. He hailed a cab, instructing the driver to take him to the warehouse in question. As they sped through the streets, he pulled out his phone, dialing a number that only he knew.

"Hey, it's me," he said when someone answered on the other end of the line. "I've got eyes on the target. What do you want me to do?"

There was a pause before the voice at the other end of the line spoke up, low and gravelly. "Get in, Roberto. We need that painting."

Roberto exhaled slowly as the cab pulled up to the warehouse entrance. He grabbed his bag and stepped out into the night, ready to face whatever lay ahead. This was what he did best – the art of negotiation.

As he slipped inside, the shadows swallowing him whole, he smiled wryly to himself. Bring it on.
