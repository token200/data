Roberto "Robbie" Moreau was known for his charisma and confidence on the streets of New Orleans. A native son, he had grown up surrounded by the vibrant jazz scene and rich history of the city. As a young man, Robbie had worked as a musician himself, playing the saxophone in various bands around town.

But after a series of bad luck and personal setbacks, Robbie found himself struggling to make ends meet. He took on odd jobs here and there, but nothing seemed to stick. That was until he stumbled upon an old, mysterious shop tucked away in the French Quarter. The sign above the door read "Curios and Antiques," but the owner, a kind-eyed woman named Madame LeRoux, claimed it was much more than that.

Madame LeRoux took Robbie under her wing, teaching him the art of reading people and situations. She showed him how to navigate the complexities of human nature, and how to use that knowledge to his advantage. Robbie proved to be a quick learner, and soon he was working as a freelance consultant for Madame LeRoux's clients.

As Robbie honed his skills, he began to take on more ambitious projects. He would pose as a wealthy businessman or high-society type, using his charm and wit to extract information from those around him. His reputation grew, and he became known as one of the best in the business.

But despite his success, Robbie never forgot his humble beginnings. He remained fiercely loyal to Madame LeRoux, who had given him a second chance at life. And as he sat in her shop, surrounded by the trappings of her mysterious world, Robbie couldn't help but think that his full name - Roberto Moreau - was apt. After all, he had discovered a new passion for manipulation, and a talent for getting what he wanted.

Years later, Robbie would still sit in Madame LeRoux's shop, spinning tales of his adventures to anyone who would listen. And though his exploits were often exaggerated or entirely fabricated, one thing was certain: Roberto Moreau was a man who knew how to get what he wanted.
