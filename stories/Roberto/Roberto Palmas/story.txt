It was on a drizzly autumn evening when Roberto received a call from his old friend, Sophia. She was frantic, her voice trembling as she begged Roberto to meet her at the local caf√©. When he arrived, she was pacing back and forth, her eyes wide with worry.

"Roberto Palmas," she said, "I've made a terrible mistake. My sister's been missing for three days and I think something terrible has happened to her."

Roberto's expression softened, his gaze filling with concern. He listened attentively as Sophia recounted the events leading up to her sister's disappearance. As they spoke, Roberto's mind began to piece together the puzzle, his keen instincts on high alert.

With a gentle touch, Roberto placed a hand on Sophia's shoulder, calming her down. "Don't worry, we'll find your sister," he promised. Together, they began to investigate, retracing the steps Sophia and her sister had taken before their disappearance.
