The meeting was a turning point in Roberto's career. Not only did he land a major record deal, but he also discovered a new passion for music production. He spent the next few months working on tracks alongside the producer, pouring his heart and soul into the album.

When the album was finally released, it was met with critical acclaim and commercial success. Roberto Martinez Lopez had officially made his mark in the art world, proving that his talents extended far beyond the canvas. And though he continued to paint and create, music became an integral part of his creative process, a testament to the power of collaboration and exploration.
