Roberto Bernard sat at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of files in front of him. As the head of security for the prestigious Bellvue Hotel, he took pride in keeping its guests and employees safe from harm. But tonight was different. Tonight, a mysterious threat had been reported by one of their staff members.

As Roberto began to sift through the reports, his mind flashed back to his own troubled past. He had grown up on the streets, fending for himself at a young age. His natural talent for martial arts and detective work had eventually led him to join the police force, where he quickly rose through the ranks. But after a high-profile case went sour, he was forced to retire.

Now, as head of security at Bellvue, Roberto was determined to use his skills for good once again. He combed over the reports, looking for any pattern or connection between the threats. The staff member who had reported it claimed that strange noises could be heard coming from the abandoned wing on the third floor.

Roberto's gut told him something was off. He couldn't shake the feeling that this was more than just a prankster or a bored employee trying to get attention. He made his way to the abandoned wing, his eyes scanning every inch of the dusty hallway.

As he reached the room where the noise had originated, Roberto felt a chill run down his spine. Something didn't feel right. The air was thick with an eerie silence, and for a moment, he thought he could have sworn he heard whispers coming from within.

Suddenly, the lights flickered and went out, plunging Roberto into darkness. He drew his flashlight and swept it around the room, searching for any sign of movement. And then, just as quickly as they had gone out, the lights came back on.

Roberto was left standing in an empty room, wondering if he had imagined the whole thing. But as he turned to leave, he caught a glimpse of something out of the corner of his eye – a small piece of paper on the floor, with a message scrawled on it: "You'll never keep me contained."

Roberto's heart sank. This was more than just a prankster or a disgruntled employee. Whoever was behind this had gone to great lengths to taunt him and make him feel like he wasn't in control. He knew that he needed to dig deeper, to uncover the source of this mysterious threat before it was too late.

As he made his way back to his office, Roberto couldn't shake off the feeling that he was being watched. He knew that he had a long night ahead of him, but he was ready for whatever lay in store. For Roberto Bernard, security at Bellvue was more than just a job – it was a calling.
