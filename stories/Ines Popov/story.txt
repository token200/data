Ines Popov stepped out of her small, cluttered apartment and into the bustling streets of Moscow. She had just received a letter from her estranged father, inviting her to meet him for coffee at a quaint café in the city center. It had been years since they'd last spoken, and Ines had all but given up hope of ever reconciling with him.

As she made her way through the crowded sidewalks, Ines couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions swirling inside her. She was both curious about what her father wanted to say and apprehensive about facing him after so long.

She arrived at the café just as he was getting there, his eyes scanning the room for hers before finally settling on her with a faint smile. Ines felt a pang in her chest as she watched him take a seat across from her, his features familiar yet somehow distant.

"So, it's really you," he said, breaking the silence. "I've thought about you so many times over the years."

Ines pulled out a chair and sat down beside him, her voice barely above a whisper. "Dad... what do you want?"

Her father took a deep breath before speaking. "I know I haven't been the most supportive parent, Ines. I've always put my own dreams ahead of yours. But I realize now that was a mistake."

Ines felt a lump form in her throat as she looked at him, searching for any sign of remorse or apology. Instead, she saw something else entirely – a deep sadness and regret.

"I'm sorry," he said again, his voice cracking. "I want to make it right with you. I want to get to know you like the father I should have been."

Ines took a moment to process her emotions before responding. She looked around the café, taking in the familiar sights and sounds of Moscow she'd grown up with but never truly experienced.

"I'd like that," she said finally, her voice stronger now.

Over coffee, Ines and her father talked long into the night, sharing stories and laughter as they delved back into their complicated past. For the first time in years, Ines felt a sense of peace wash over her, knowing that she had her father's blessing – and love – once more.

As the stars began to twinkle above, Ines leaned over and pressed her hand against his. "Thank you," she whispered.

Her father smiled back at her, his eyes shining with tears. "Anytime, kiddo."
