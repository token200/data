Andris Ozolina stepped off the train and onto the platform, her bright blue eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of life. She had been away for months, studying abroad in Europe, and was eager to reconnect with her friends back home.

As she made her way through the crowd, Andris's mind began to wander back to her time in Berlin. She had spent countless hours exploring the city's vibrant art scene, attending gallery openings and discussing everything from philosophy to pop culture with her fellow students.

But despite the many amazing experiences she'd had, Andris couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. She longed for the familiarity of home, for the comfort of knowing exactly where she was and what lay ahead.

As she emerged from the station, Andris spotted a familiar figure waiting for her on the sidewalk - her best friend, Maya. The two friends had grown up together, exploring the woods behind their houses and sharing secrets in the dead of night.

"Hey, Ozolina!" Maya called out, waving enthusiastically as Andris approached. "Welcome home!"

Andris smiled, feeling a wave of relief wash over her. It was good to be back, surrounded by people who knew her and loved her for who she was.

Over the next few weeks, Andris settled back into life in Portland, reconnecting with old friends and making new ones. She started taking classes at a local art studio, where she discovered a talent for pottery and quickly became hooked on the tactile sensation of shaping clay into something beautiful.

As she worked on her latest piece - a delicate, ceramic vase - Andris couldn't help but feel grateful for the journey that had brought her back home. Her time abroad may have been filled with adventure and self-discovery, but it was her roots in Portland that truly made her feel whole.
