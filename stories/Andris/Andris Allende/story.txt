Andris Allende stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the unfamiliar streets of San Sebastián. As he made his way through the bustling streets, he couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement wash over him. He had always been drawn to the beauty of Spain, and now, at 25, he had finally saved up enough money to spend three months studying abroad.

Andris Allende was a literature major, and he had chosen San Sebastián because of its rich history and cultural significance. He had heard that the city was home to some of the most beautiful works of Basque literature, and he couldn't wait to dive in and learn more about his own heritage.

As he wandered through the streets, Andris Allende stumbled upon a small café tucked away in a quiet alleyway. The sign above the door read "Café del Mar", and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted out into the street, enticing him to come inside.

 Inside, the café was cozy and intimate, with walls lined with old books and wooden tables scattered about. Andris Allende took a seat at the bar and ordered a cup of coffee, striking up a conversation with the bartender, a friendly woman named Sofía.

As they talked, Andris Allende learned that Sofía was not only a great coffee connoisseur but also a lover of literature. They spent the next hour discussing everything from the works of Ortega y Gasset to their shared favorite authors, including García Márquez and Isabel Allende (Andris's great-aunt).

Sofía recommended several books for Andris Allende to check out while he was in town, including a collection of Basque poetry that she said would change his perspective on the world. Andris Allende left the café with a new book in hand, feeling grateful for the chance encounter and excited to dive back into his studies.

Over the next few weeks, Andris Allende settled into his new routine, spending hours exploring the city's literary scene and engaging in lively discussions about books and culture. He began to feel more at home in San Sebastián, and he knew that this experience would stay with him for the rest of his life. As he packed his bags to leave, Andris Allende felt a sense of gratitude towards Sofía and the city that had welcomed him with open arms.
