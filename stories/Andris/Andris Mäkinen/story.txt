Andris Mäkinen was a name whispered among the Finnish folk, a mystifying figure shrouded in secrecy. Some said he was a retired spy, while others claimed he was a master thief or even a genius scientist. The truth, however, remained unknown.

Rumors swirled around Helsinki like wisps of fog on a winter's morning. Andris Mäkinen had been spotted at high-stakes poker games in exclusive underground clubs, always with an air of quiet confidence that commanded attention. Others claimed he was the mastermind behind the city's most daring art forgeries.
