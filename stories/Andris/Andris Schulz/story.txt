Andris Schulz stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the familiar streets of Hamburg. It was a cold autumn evening, and the air was crisp with the smell of saltwater and smoke from the ships in the harbor. He had been away for two years, serving as an officer on a cargo ship that sailed to the farthest corners of the globe. But now, he was home.

As he made his way through the bustling streets, Andris couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. The city seemed smaller than he remembered, and yet, everything felt just as vibrant and alive as it had all those years ago. He thought back to his childhood, playing on the beach with his friends, exploring the canals and warehouses of the old port.

Andris's thoughts were interrupted by a shout from behind him. "Schulz! Over here!" It was his best friend, Viktor, who he hadn't seen in months. Andris turned to see his friend running towards him, a big grin plastered on his face.

The two friends grew up together in this city, exploring the waterfront and sharing stories of their dreams for the future. Andris had always been the more ambitious one, determined to make a name for himself in the world of shipping. Viktor, on the other hand, had always been content with living life as it came along.

Over a plate of Schnitzel at a small tavern near the harbor, Andris filled Viktor in on his adventures on the high seas. He told him of the storms he had weathered and the far-flung ports he had visited. Viktor listened intently, his eyes wide with excitement.

As they ate and drank, Andris couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness. Two years at sea was a long time to be away from home. He missed his family, and the quiet life that he used to know so well. But as he looked around at the bustling streets of Hamburg, he knew that he had come back for more than just sightseeing.

"I've got an idea," Andris said to Viktor, his voice low and conspiratorial. "I want to start my own shipping company."

Viktor's eyes widened in surprise. "You're serious?"

Andris nodded. "I'm dead serious."
