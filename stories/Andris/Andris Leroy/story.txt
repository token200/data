Andris Leroy stepped off the train and onto the platform, his worn leather boots scuffling against the worn stone floor. He took a deep breath of the salty air, letting it fill his lungs as he gazed out at the endless expanse of ocean stretching before him.

As a private investigator, Andris had seen his fair share of drab, grey cities, but there was something about this small coastal town that drew him in. Perhaps it was the promise of anonymity or the thrill of unraveling a mystery that seemed to cling to its residents like sea fog.

Andris had been hired by a local woman named Ava, whose sister had gone missing under suspicious circumstances. The police were stumped, and Ava knew Andris's reputation for being one of the best in the business. He had agreed to take on the case, and now he was here, ready to start digging.

As he walked through the deserted streets, Andris noticed the way the townspeople watched him with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. They seemed wary of outsiders, but he suspected there was more to it than that. Something beneath the surface was waiting to be uncovered.

He stopped at the local café, where Ava waited for him, her bright blue eyes sparkling with gratitude as she took his hand in hers. "Thank you, Andris," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I don't know what I would do without you."

Over steaming cups of coffee, Andris filled Ava in on the details of his investigation so far. He had been to the missing woman's apartment, spoken with her friends and acquaintances, but every lead seemed to end in a dead-end.

As they walked along the beach, watching the sun set behind the waves, Andris noticed something strange. A piece of paper caught his eye, partially buried in the sand. He picked it up, smoothing out the wrinkles, and his heart skipped a beat as he read the words scrawled on it: "They're watching you."

Andris's eyes met Ava's, a spark of excitement igniting within him. This was it – the break they had been waiting for. Together, they would follow this lead, no matter where it might take them.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the world in a warm orange glow, Andris Leroy knew he had just begun to unravel a thread that could change everything.
