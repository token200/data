Andris White stepped into the dimly lit bar, the faint scent of whiskey and smoke wafting through the air. As he made his way to the counter, the bartender eyed him with a mixture of curiosity and disdain. "What can I get you?" Andris White asked, his deep voice a stark contrast to the rowdy atmosphere.

The bartender raised an eyebrow before slapping down a glass of whiskey without a word. Andris White took a sip, the burn spreading through his chest as he surveyed the room. A familiar figure sat in the corner, nursing a beer and staring into space. Andris White's eyes narrowed; it was their old friend, Kaida Reyes.

The two had grown up together, sharing countless nights like this, filled with laughter and secrets. But after high school, life took them down different paths. Kaida became a successful artist, while Andris White wandered aimlessly, searching for purpose. They'd lost touch over the years, but Andris White couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about Kaida's presence.

As he watched, Kaida raised her head and locked eyes with him across the room. A faint smile played on her lips before she turned back to her beer. Andris White felt a pang of guilt, wondering if he'd been the cause of their drift apart. He took another sip of his whiskey, the burn dulling as he began to approach Kaida.

The air was thick with tension as they sat down together, neither speaking. It was like no time had passed at all, yet everything felt different. Andris White reached out and brushed a strand of hair behind Kaida's ear, their fingers touching for the first time in years. A spark of electricity ran through him, followed by a wave of nostalgia.

As they talked, Andris White realized that Kaida was hiding something â€“ or someone. Her eyes kept darting towards the door, as if expecting someone to burst through at any moment. He didn't press her for details, content to simply be near her again. The night wore on, filled with stories and laughter, but beneath the surface, Andris White sensed a storm brewing.

As they parted ways, Kaida leaned in and whispered, "Meet me tomorrow." Andris White nodded, his heart racing with anticipation. For the first time in years, he felt like he was heading in the right direction, with his old friend by his side. The night may have been filled with uncertainty, but one thing was certain: Andris White would be there to face it head-on with Kaida Reyes by his side.
