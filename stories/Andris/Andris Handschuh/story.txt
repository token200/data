Andris Handschuh was a man shrouded in mystery. A former soldier, he had seen his fair share of battles and had been left with scars both physical and emotional. He had served in various parts of the world, but no place felt like home.

After leaving the military, Andris wandered aimlessly, taking on odd jobs to pay the bills. It was during one such gig that he stumbled upon an antique shop tucked away in a quiet corner of town. The owner, an old man named Max, took a likley to Andris and offered him a deal: work for him in exchange for room and board.

Andris accepted, and soon found himself apprenticing under Max's skilled hands. He learned the art of restoration, working tirelessly to bring old furniture back to life. As he worked, Andris began to uncover secrets about his past that he had long suppressed. He discovered a talent for woodworking and an affinity for antique clocks.

Years passed, and Andris became an expert in his field. Customers raved about his work, and the shop became a staple of the community. Max grew old and retired, leaving Andris the reins of the business. But with success came new challenges. A rival antique dealer, known only as "The Collector," began to circle, seeking to poach Andris's customers.

One night, Andris received an invitation from The Collector to meet at a mansion on the outskirts of town. He arrived to find himself face-to-face with a woman unlike any he had ever met. She was cold and calculating, with eyes that seemed to bore into his soul.

"So, you're the one they call the 'Handschuh,' I presume?" she said, her voice dripping with malice. "I've heard so much about your little shop. But tell me, Andris... what do you truly do?"

Andris felt a shiver run down his spine as he realized that The Collector was not just after his business â€“ she wanted something more. Something from his past. He stood tall, his heart pounding in his chest.

"I restore," he said quietly. "I bring old things back to life."

The Collector smiled, her eyes glinting with amusement. "Ah, yes... the art of restoration. How quaint."

Andris's instincts told him that this was a trap, and he was right. He turned on his heel and walked away, leaving The Collector to stew in her own venom. But as he made his way back to the shop, he couldn't shake the feeling that his past was closing in around him, like the ticking of an antique clock...
