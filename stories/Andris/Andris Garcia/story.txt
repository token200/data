Andris Garcia trudged through the rain-soaked streets of Riga, her eyes fixed on the pavement as she navigated the crowded sidewalks. As a freelance journalist, Andris had grown accustomed to working alone, but today was different. She was on a mission to meet with an anonymous source who claimed to have information about a high-profile corruption scandal.

As she turned a corner, Andris spotted a nondescript building and quickened her pace. She had been researching this story for weeks, pouring over financial records and conducting interviews with former city officials. But it was this source that might finally provide the proof she needed.

Andris pushed open the door to the building and stepped inside, her eyes adjusting to the dim lighting. A figure emerged from the shadows, dressed in a long coat that seemed out of place in the sweltering summer heat.

"Who are you?" Andris asked, trying to keep her voice steady.

The figure pulled back its hood, revealing a face she had seen in news footage before. It was Viktor Kuznetsov, a former Russian oligarch with a reputation for ruthlessness.

"I'm here about the corruption," Viktor said, his voice low and gravelly. "I have evidence that will blow this whole thing wide open."

Andris's heart skipped a beat as she pulled out her recorder and notebook. This was it – the break she had been waiting for.

But just as things were starting to come together, Andris noticed something strange. Viktor seemed...off. His eyes darted nervously around the room, and his words seemed laced with hidden meaning.

Andris's instincts told her that this source was not what he seemed. She made a mental note to dig deeper, to uncover the truth behind Viktor's motives.

As she left the building, Andris felt a sense of unease settle in the pit of her stomach. She had Andris Garcia on her hands now – the journalist who would stop at nothing to expose the truth – and that was exactly what could get her killed.
