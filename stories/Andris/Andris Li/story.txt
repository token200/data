Andris Li stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the city. The sounds of car horns and chatter from the street below were muffled by the tall skyscrapers that seemed to stretch on forever. As a tech entrepreneur, he had spent countless hours staring at screens and brainstorming new ideas, but tonight he needed something more.

At 32, Andris had made a name for himself in the startup world with his innovative app development company. He had invested heavily in artificial intelligence and machine learning, predicting that they would revolutionize the way people interacted with technology. His latest project, an AI-powered personal assistant called "Echo," was about to launch to great fanfare.

But Andris's mind wasn't on Echo tonight. It was on his grandmother, Māra, who had passed away six months ago. A traditional Lithuanian from a small village in the countryside, she had always been proud of her heritage and encouraged Andris to stay connected to it despite his success. He remembered the countless hours they spent cooking traditional dishes together, sharing stories about their ancestors, and practicing ancient dances.

As he took a deep breath, feeling the cool night air fill his lungs, Andris felt a sense of nostalgia wash over him. He thought about all the times Māra had urged him to find meaning beyond his work, to explore the world beyond his high-rise office building. She would say things like, "Andris, my boy, there's more to life than just code and screens."

Suddenly, an idea struck him like a spark of lightning. He quickly pulled out his phone and began scribbling notes in a messaging app with his old friend, Dainius, who was also from Lithuania. Together, they started brainstorming a new project – a platform that combined traditional folk music and dance with modern technology to preserve the country's cultural heritage.

Over the next few weeks, Andris poured his heart into this new venture, working tirelessly alongside Dainius to bring it to life. He named it "Kultūros Zaspa" (Cultural Wave) and envisioned a global platform where people could share and learn about Lithuania's rich history and traditions. It was a way for him to honor Māra's memory and keep her spirit alive.

As Andris looked out over the city once more, he felt a sense of purpose wash over him. He knew that this new project would be his legacy, not just as a tech entrepreneur but as a guardian of Lithuania's cultural heritage.
