Andris Ángel Silvestre stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the unfamiliar station. As he made his way through the bustling crowd, a sense of unease settled in the pit of his stomach. Andris Ángel Silvestre had always been drawn to the unknown, but this was different – he was returning to his hometown after years away.

The streets of his childhood seemed unchanged, yet everything felt different now. The faces that passed by on the sidewalk were familiar, but the way they looked at him was not. Andris Ángel Silvestre felt like an outsider, a stranger in his own skin.

As he walked through the quiet neighborhood where he grew up, memories came flooding back. He recalled playing soccer with his friends, exploring the woods behind their houses, and sharing laughter over dinner. But those carefree days were now just that – memories.

The knock on his door broke the silence, and Andris Ángel Silvestre's heart skipped a beat as he saw his mother standing before him. Her eyes, once bright with warmth, now seemed tired and worried. She invited him in, and they sat down at the kitchen table, exchanging awkward small talk.

The weight of years hung between them, and Andris Ángel Silvestre struggled to find the right words. His mother asked about his work, his relationships, his dreams – but he couldn't shake the feeling that she already knew the answers. That she had always known the truth about him: that he was restless, that he would never stay in one place for too long.

As the evening drew to a close, Andris Ángel Silvestre stood up, feeling a sense of restlessness wash over him once more. He nodded at his mother and stepped out into the night air, the city lights a reminder that even though home was where the heart was, his heart still wandered.
