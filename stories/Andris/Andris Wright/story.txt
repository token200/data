Andris Wright was a man with a singular passion - the pursuit of forgotten knowledge. As a renowned archaeologist, he had spent his life digging up relics from bygone eras, only to uncover secrets that few others dared to touch.

It began on a dusty dig in rural Mongolia, where Andris had unearthed a mysterious stone tablet etched with strange symbols. The locals claimed it was an ancient prophecy, foretelling the coming of a great calamity. Intrigued, Andris devoted himself to deciphering the code, pouring over texts and consulting experts from around the world.

As he delved deeper into his research, Andris began to experience vivid dreams - visions of desolate landscapes, burning cities, and towering structures that seemed to touch the sky. He became convinced that these were harbingers of a catastrophic event, one that would reshape the course of human history.

Despite the skeptics' doubts, Andris persevered, driven by an unyielding determination to unravel the mystery. His colleagues dubbed him "The Questor," and whispers of his work spread like wildfire through academic circles.

Years passed, and Andris's reputation grew, drawing the attention of wealthy collectors and powerful governments. Some offered him vast sums for access to his findings, while others sought to discredit him for fear that the truth would be too disturbing to share.

One day, as Andris pored over an ancient text in a dusty library, he stumbled upon a cryptic passage that seemed to unlock the secrets of the prophecy. The words danced on the page, shimmering like stars in the dim light:

"When the keystone is turned,
The world shall be reborn.
In darkness, the light will shine,
And all that's been forgotten shall be known."

A shiver ran down Andris's spine as he read the final phrase aloud. He knew that this was it - his life's work had finally paid off. The secrets of the prophecy were within reach.

With the keystone turned, the world would change forever.
