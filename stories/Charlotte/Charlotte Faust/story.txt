She pushed open the door, her eyes scanning the dimly lit room filled with an assortment of strange and wondrous objects.

The shopkeeper, an old man with piercing green eyes, looked up from behind his counter and smiled. "Welcome, Charlotte Faust," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "I've been expecting you. I have just the thing for a collector of your caliber."

Charlotte's eyes lit up as she browsed through the shelves, her fingers trailing over the intricate carvings and mysterious symbols etched onto the artifacts.
