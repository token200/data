Charlotte Rasmussen adjusted her spectacles and gazed out at the fog-shrouded streets of Copenhagen. As a journalist, she'd grown accustomed to the misty veil that seemed to cling to every corner of the city like a damp shroud. But today was different. Today, she had a lead.

Rumors had been circulating about a long-abandoned asylum on the outskirts of town, where a mysterious figure was said to be holding court. The whispers spoke of a ghostly presence, one that seemed to draw in the curious and the brave with equal allure.

Charlotte's editor had dismissed the rumors as mere fantasy, but she knew better. She'd spent years sniffing out stories like this, following threads of gossip and rumor that often led her down dark alleys and hidden corners. And she was convinced that this one was worth exploring.

She made her way through the deserted streets, her footsteps echoing off the buildings. The fog swirled around her ankles, making it seem as if the very ground itself was alive and moving. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she pushed open the creaking door of the asylum's entrance.

Inside, the air was heavy with dust and decay. Charlotte coughed, covering her mouth with a handkerchief. The halls stretched out before her like a twisted maze, lined with doors that seemed to lead nowhere. She wandered deeper into the heart of the building, her eyes adjusting to the dim light.

And then she saw it – a faint glow emanating from one of the rooms. Charlotte's heart quickened as she approached the door, her hand reaching out to grasp the rusty handle. The room beyond was small and cramped, lit by a single candle that cast flickering shadows on the walls.

A figure sat in the corner, shrouded in darkness. Charlotte felt a jolt of fear, but it was tempered by a sense of excitement. Who – or what – was this mysterious presence? And why had she been drawn to them?

As she stepped forward, the candle's flame seemed to flicker in response, illuminating a face that was both familiar and strange. It was then that Charlotte realized who she was looking at: herself.
