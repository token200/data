One evening, as Charlotte was preparing for a new exhibition, she received an unexpected visit from her grandmother, Liina Mägi. Liina had traveled from their family's ancestral home in the countryside to offer words of encouragement and advice. "Remember, Charlotte, your art is not just about creating beauty – it's also about telling stories," she said with a warm smile.

Charlotte listened intently, feeling a sense of gratitude for her grandmother's wisdom. She knew that Liina had always been a source of inspiration, and now more than ever, she felt motivated to share the story of her homeland through her art.

The night before the exhibition, Charlotte stood in front of her latest masterpiece, titled "Tallinn's Twilight."
