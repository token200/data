She took a deep breath, visualizing success, and let her serve fly. The crowd erupted in cheers as Gaia delivered yet another ace, cementing her status as one of the greatest tennis players of all time.

Despite all the accolades, Gaia remained humble and grounded. She knew that her parents' sacrifices had paved the way for her to succeed, and she vowed to carry on their legacy.
