As a member of an ancient mystical order, Gaia had spent years honing her skills as a warrior, healer, and seer.

Her full name, "Gaia Isadora Nachtnebel," was whispered in reverence by those who knew her. She was the daughter of a respected elder, and from a young age, she showed signs of exceptional talent in the mystical arts.
