Jessica Jones sat in her dimly lit apartment, sipping on a whiskey as she stared blankly at the TV. The news was filled with stories of superheroes and villains, but to her, they were just a distraction from the real battle - her own demons.

She had thought that after taking down Kilgrave, the Purple Man who had held her captive for years, things would get easier. But the memories still lingered, haunting her every step. The flashbacks to her brutal captivity, the feeling of helplessness and powerlessness.

As she gazed out the window, Jessica's mind wandered back to the first time she had seen Luke Cage. He was this rugged, brooding guy who had walked into her life like a storm, changing everything forever. They had fought together, saved each other, and in the end, they had found love.

But even now, as she looked at him standing across the room, Jessica couldn't shake off the feeling of unease. Luke was always there for her, but sometimes she felt like he didn't truly understand what she went through. The trauma, the PTSD, it all still lingered, and no one seemed to get it.

Just then, the doorbell rang, breaking the silence. Jessica got up to answer it, expecting it to be Luke with another one of his antics. But to her surprise, it was Matt Murdock - a.k.a. Daredevil.

Matt looked different today, his eyes sunken from lack of sleep and concern etched on his face. "Jess, I've been looking for you," he said, as if the two of them were old friends sharing a secret.

"What is it?" Jessica asked warily, sensing something was off.

"It's something bigger than just us," Matt replied, his voice low and urgent. "I think we're in over our heads here. The Hand is getting more powerful by the day, and if they catch wind of what we know..."

Jessica raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite herself. She knew that Matt had been investigating the Hand for months, but she also knew how deep the rabbit hole went.

"Come on," she said finally, shouldering her jacket. "Let's go talk to the other gang."

As they walked out into the night, Jessica felt a spark of determination ignite within her. She may not have the superpowers that others took for granted, but she had something just as powerful - her own strength, and a resolve that would stop at nothing.

With Matt by her side, Jessica knew she could face whatever came next. They were in this together now, and if it killed them, so be it.

As they stepped into the shadows, Jessica Jones smiled to herself, feeling alive for the first time in months.
