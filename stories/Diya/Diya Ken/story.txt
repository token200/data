One stormy night, Diya Ken received a call from an anonymous source claiming to have information about a string of gruesome murders that had been terrorizing the city's underworld. The caller handed over a cryptic message that led Diya Ken on a treacherous journey through Akakor's seedy underbelly.

As she delved deeper into the case, Diya Ken encountered a cast of shady characters who seemed to be hiding secrets behind their charming smiles and piercing gazes.
