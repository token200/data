People from all over Willow Creek came to see her stunning images, and soon, her bakery was flooded with customers asking about her photography. Diya Sandstrom, the quiet baker behind the camera, had become an unlikely sensation.

As she basked in the attention, Diya realized that her passion for photography was not a secret, but a part of who she was all along. She began to incorporate more of her photographs into her bakery's decorations, and soon, "Sweet Treats" was transformed into a haven of whimsy and wonder.
