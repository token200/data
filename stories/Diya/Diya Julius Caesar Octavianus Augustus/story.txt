In the sweltering summer of 14 AD, Diya Julius Caesar Octavianus Augustus sat upon his throne, surveying the vast expanse of the Roman Empire he had built. Born to a senator's daughter and a former slave, Octavianus' rise to power was nothing short of remarkable.

Together, they had brought stability to a tumultuous era, establishing the Principate that would endure for centuries.
