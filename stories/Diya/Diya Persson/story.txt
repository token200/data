Diya Persson sat in her small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty textbooks and scraps of paper covered in her own messy handwriting. As a junior at UC Berkeley, she was supposed to be studying for her upcoming exam on Marxist theory, but her mind kept wandering back to the protest she had attended over the weekend.

It had been a long day, filled with chants of "Hey, hey, ho, ho, neoliberalism's got to go!" and the sound of drums beating in unison. Diya had felt alive for the first time in months, like she was finally doing something meaningful. She was part of a group that called itself the "Berkeley Brigade," and they were determined to make their voices heard.

But now, as she stared blankly at her notes, Diya couldn't shake off the feeling of unease. She had always been drawn to politics, ever since her parents had immigrated to the US from Sweden with little more than a suitcase full of hope. But the more she learned about the issues plaguing their adopted country, the more overwhelmed she felt.

Was it even possible for individuals like herself – a young woman of Indian descent, raised on a diet of social justice and activism – to make a real difference? Or was she just another cog in the machine, spinning her wheels in a system designed to crush dissent?

Diya's thoughts were interrupted by the ring of her phone. It was her best friend, Aisha, calling from New York. "Hey, girl! How are you doing?" Diya hesitated, unsure if she should share her doubts with Aisha. But something about her voice put her at ease.

"I'm just feeling really lost, Aisha," Diya admitted. "I feel like I'm not making any progress, and that it's all just a bunch of empty rhetoric."

Aisha listened patiently on the other end of the line. When Diya finished talking, she said, "You know what, Diya? Activism isn't about making progress – at least, not yet. It's about showing up, even when you don't feel like it. It's about holding onto your ideals, even when they make you uncomfortable."

Diya felt a spark ignite within her. Maybe Aisha was right. Maybe this wasn't about achieving some sort of grand victory; maybe it was just about being present in the struggle. And as she hung up the phone and looked around at her cluttered apartment once more, Diya saw something that gave her hope.

A poster on her wall, scrawled by her own hand in bright blue marker: "Hope is not a strategy – it's a beginning."
