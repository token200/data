She proved to be a quick learner, devouring texts on astrology, alchemy, and the mysteries of the universe. Her grasp of these subjects was unparalleled, and soon she was sought out by pilgrims and seekers from all over the land.

One fateful day, a wise old sage arrived in Ashoka, bearing news of a celestial alignment that would grant Diya Perin unimaginable power. The stars had aligned to create a singular opportunity for her to tap into their energies, amplifying her abilities beyond anything she could have ever imagined.
