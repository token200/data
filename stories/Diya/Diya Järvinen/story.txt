Born and raised in Helsinki, Finland, Diya had grown up surrounded by the vibrant cultural scene of the city. She had always been fascinated by the complexities of human nature and the secrets that lay beneath the surface of everyday life.

After studying journalism at the University of Helsinki, Diya landed her first job at a local newspaper, where she quickly made a name for herself as a rising star in the industry.
