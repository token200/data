Diya Faure stepped out of her sleek, black Audi, adjusting her designer sunglasses as she gazed up at the Art Deco skyscraper. She was here for a meeting with her former business partner, Rohan. Their partnership had been nothing short of meteoric, with their tech startup making headlines and raking in millions.

But that was three years ago. Since then, things hadn't quite gone as planned. Diya had invested heavily in the company, while Rohan had reaped most of the benefits, opting out just when they were about to hit it big. She'd tried to get him back on board, but he'd refused, citing his own interests.

Now, Diya was here to negotiate a settlement. The letter from Rohan's lawyers had been straightforward: he wanted her to give up most of the shares in exchange for a paltry sum. Easy money for someone like her who had built an empire from scratch. But something about it didn't sit right with her.

As she made her way into the lobby, Diya was greeted by the smooth voice of her assistant, Jasmine, who handed her a glass of chilled champagne and whispered, "Good luck, boss."

Diya smiled wryly, feeling a flutter in her chest. It had been too long since she'd felt this anxious. She took a sip of her drink, steadying herself before walking into the elevator.

The penthouse suite was opulent, with floor-to-ceiling windows offering breathtaking views of the city. Rohan sat behind his massive mahogany desk, looking every inch the successful businessman he once was.

"So, Diya," he said, as she took a seat across from him, "I suppose we need to get down to business."

Diya's eyes narrowed. She knew exactly what he wanted. "We'll see about that."

The negotiations were tense, with both of them trying to outmaneuver each other. But Diya had one advantage: her years of experience in the cutthroat world of tech.

Finally, after hours of haggling, Rohan threw up his hands in frustration and stormed out of the room. Diya watched him go, a triumphant smile spreading across her face. She'd done it. She'd outsmarted him.

As she left the building with Jasmine by her side, Diya felt an overwhelming sense of satisfaction wash over her. This was just the beginning of something new â€“ a fresh start for someone who had been wronged in the past. And as she climbed into her Audi and started the engine, a spark of determination ignited within her.
