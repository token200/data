Diya Gupta walked into the bustling café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She had agreed to meet her friend, Raghav, here an hour ago, and was starting to worry that he might have stood her up.

As she waited, Diya took a seat at the bar and ordered a coffee. She pulled out her phone and began to browse through social media, catching up on the latest news and updates from her friends back home.

Just as she was starting to feel like Raghav had forgotten about their meeting, a voice called out from across the room. "Diya! Over here!"

Diya turned to see Raghav waving at her from a corner table. She smiled and made her way over, feeling a surge of excitement and relief.

Raghav was already seated with a large cup of coffee in front of him. "Sorry I'm late," he said, as Diya sat down across from him. "Traffic on the highway was a nightmare."

Diya raised an eyebrow. "You're kidding me? You know that's the most direct route to my place?"

Raghav chuckled. "I know, but sometimes I like to take the scenic route. It gives me time to think and process everything that's going on in my life."

Diya nodded sympathetically. She knew that Raghav had been going through a tough time lately. His parents were getting divorced, and he was struggling to come to terms with the new reality.

As they chatted, Diya found herself listening intently as Raghav opened up about his feelings. She offered words of encouragement and support, drawing on her own experiences with loss and change.

After a while, the conversation turned to lighter topics – their favorite books, movies, and music. Diya was surprised by how much she enjoyed Raghav's company, even though they had been friends since childhood but hadn't really talked in years.

As the afternoon wore on, Diya realized that she had forgotten all about her worries. She felt at peace, knowing that Raghav was there to support her, just as he would want her to be there for him.

As they prepared to part ways, Diya turned to Raghav and said, "I'm so glad we met up today, Diya Gupta." Raghav smiled back, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "Me too, Diya. Me too."

With a warm feeling in her heart, Diya left the café, feeling grateful for the friendship that still held such strength and meaning in her life.
