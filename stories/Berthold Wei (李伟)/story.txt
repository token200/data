Berthold Wei, or Lee Wei as he was known to his friends and acquaintances in Hong Kong, sat at his cluttered desk, staring out the window at the bustling streets below. His dark eyes, a deep shade of brown that seemed almost black, were lost in thought, his mind consumed by the latest development in his latest venture.

As a financier and entrepreneur, Berthold had made a name for himself on both sides of the Pacific. He had built a reputation for being ruthless in business, but also fiercely loyal to those he deemed worthy. His latest project, a cutting-edge biotech firm, was on the cusp of a breakthrough that could change the course of human history.

But Berthold's mind was not solely focused on his work. A nagging feeling had been growing inside him for weeks now, a sense of unease that he couldn't quite shake. It started with small things: a missed phone call from an unknown number, a suspicious email from an old associate, a strange dream in which he saw himself standing at the edge of a precipice.

As he sat there, lost in thought, his assistant burst into the room, a look of panic on her face. "Berthold, we have a problem," she said, her voice trembling. "Our investors are threatening to pull out unless you can provide them with concrete proof that our product will succeed."

Berthold's eyes snapped back into focus as he leaned forward, his hands clasped together in front of him. He knew exactly what this meant - the loss of millions, maybe even tens of millions, in investment. His mind racing, he began to think of every trick in the book, every way to sweeten the deal and keep his investors happy.

But just as he was about to launch into a speech, a knock at the door interrupted him. It was an old acquaintance from Shanghai, someone Berthold had known for years but had never really considered close. "Berthold, I heard you were working on something big," he said, a sly grin spreading across his face.

"What are you talking about?" Berthold asked warily, sensing that this man might know more than he was letting on.

"Oh, just rumors and whispers," the man replied, waving his hand dismissively. "But I think I can help you with your... little problem."

Berthold's eyes narrowed as the man walked in, a sly glint in his eye. He knew that this encounter might just be the turning point he needed, but at what cost?
