Hailey Eglītis stepped into the dimly lit art gallery, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of her missing masterpiece. As an artist herself, she knew the importance of originality and authenticity, and the loss of her piece was like a punch to the gut.

The exhibition was being held at an old warehouse on the outskirts of town, and Hailey had specifically requested this location for its industrial vibe and eclectic atmosphere. But now, as she made her way through the crowded space, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

Hailey Eglītis approached a group of collectors gathered around a display table, where one of their pieces – a seemingly identical replica of her own work – sat prominently on display. She recognized the vendor immediately, his slick smile and slicker-than-slick demeanor making him all too familiar.

"What's going on here?" Hailey demanded, her voice rising above the hum of conversation.

The vendor cleared his throat, his eyes darting nervously around the room before landing back on Hailey Eglītis. "Just an... arrangement," he stammered. "A collaboration."

Hailey raised an eyebrow, suspicion etched on her face. She knew that look all too well; it was the same one she'd seen on his face when they first met at a gallery opening six months prior.

She demanded to know more, but the vendor brushed her off, claiming he had nothing to say on the matter. As Hailey Eglītis turned to leave, she noticed a figure standing by the back wall – a young woman with striking features and an air of quiet confidence that seemed almost... familiar.

Their eyes met for a moment before the woman quickly looked away, but not before Hailey Eglītis caught a glimpse of her necklace – a small silver pendant bearing an uncanny resemblance to one she herself wore.
