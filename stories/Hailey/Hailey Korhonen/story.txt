Hailey Korhonen was known for her infectious laugh and unwavering optimism in the small town of Willow Creek. A free-spirited artist, Hailey spent most of her days lost in her own world, surrounded by paint-splattered canvases and half-finished sculptures.

As she wandered through the local market, Hailey's bright yellow sundress drew attention from passersby. Her wild curly hair bounced with each step, as if it too were eager to explore the world beyond the confines of her studio. The sweet scent of freshly baked pastries wafted through the air, enticing Hailey to stop and sample a few treats.

The connection between art and memory was palpable, and Hailey felt an instant kinship with this stranger-turned-friend.
