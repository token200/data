Francesco Morgan was a man with a reputation for being untouchable. As a former hitman, he had left a trail of bodies and broken lives in his wake. But after a stint in prison, Francesco had finally begun to lay low, hiding out in the small town of Ashwood, where no one knew his true identity.

He took up residence in a dilapidated old house on the outskirts of town, where he spent his days tinkering with engines and working odd jobs to make ends meet. It was an attempt at a new life, one that didn't involve violence or deception.

But it wasn't easy. Old habits died hard, and Francesco found himself drawn into a web of underworld intrigue whenever he least expected it. A local gangster had taken an interest in him, seeing potential for leverage against the competition. The gangster's goons would show up at his doorstep every now and then, offering 'business opportunities' that required Francesco to draw upon his old skills.

At first, Francesco tried to resist, but eventually he relented, taking on small jobs that allowed him to keep his head down while still staying busy. He worked with the local mechanic to fix cars for the gangster's associates, quietly collecting paychecks while keeping a close eye on the goons whenever they came knocking.

As time passed, Francesco began to see Ashwood as home, even though it was still a far cry from his old life. The townsfolk were wary of him at first, but eventually warmed up to his quiet demeanor and willingness to lend a hand. He became a bit of a local legend, with whispers about the 'quiet hitman' who kept to himself.

But beneath his tough exterior, Francesco was still haunted by the ghosts of his past. Late at night, when the streets were empty and the fireflies danced in the darkness, he would take long walks through the woods, lost in thought as the memories came flooding back.

It was then that Francesco knew he couldn't stay hidden forever. He needed to find a way to make amends for the mistakes of his past, or at least come to terms with them before it was too late. And so, under the cover of night, Francesco Morgan began to forge a new path, one that led away from the shadows and into the light.
