Francesco "Frankie" Pelz was a man with a passion for restoring old cars to their former glory. Growing up in a small town in Italy, Frankie had always been fascinated by the way things worked, and his father, Giovanni, a skilled mechanic himself, taught him everything he knew.

As a young man, Frankie spent every spare moment tinkering with engines, replacing parts, and fine-tuning systems. He developed a keen eye for detail and a knack for problem-solving that served him well in his future career as a classic car restorer.

After completing his studies, Frankie moved to the United States, where he settled in Los Angeles and began working at a prestigious restoration shop. It was there that he honed his skills, working on some of the rarest and most valuable cars in the world.

One day, a wealthy client walked into the shop with a beautifully restored 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO. The car had been owned by a famous racing driver, and its value was estimated to be over $10 million. Frankie was assigned to work on the car, and he threw himself into the project with gusto.

For weeks, Frankie worked tirelessly, meticulously cleaning and polishing the car's chrome fixtures, reupholstering the leather seats, and fine-tuning the engine. He spent countless hours researching the car's history and studying its unique design elements, determined to create a truly authentic restoration.

As the work progressed, Frankie began to feel an emotional connection to the car. He could almost imagine the racing driver behind the wheel, feeling the rush of adrenaline as he sped down the track. He named the car "La Divina" after the famous Italian opera by Verdi, which seemed fitting for a vehicle that embodied such elegance and sophistication.

When the restoration was complete, Frankie stepped back to admire his handiwork. La Divina was transformed into a work of art, with every detail meticulously recreated to perfection. The client was thrilled with the result, and Frankie's reputation as a master restorer spread far and wide. From that day on, he was known as Francesco "Frankie" Pelz, the man who could bring even the most unlikely cars back to life.

Years went by, and Frankie continued to work on some of the rarest and most valuable cars in the world. He remained humble and dedicated, always striving for perfection in every project he undertook. And though his name became synonymous with classic car restoration, Frankie never forgot where he came from, always staying true to his passion for mechanics and his love for La Divina, the beautiful Ferrari 250 GTO that had started it all.
