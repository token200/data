Dace Marrone's hands moved with precision, weaving a intricate pattern on the worn wooden table. The dim lighting of the small café cast shadows across his face, accentuating the sharp angles of his jawline and the intensity in his eyes. As he worked, the sounds of the café – hushed conversations, clinking dishes – receded into the background, leaving only the soft scratch of his pen against paper.

Dace was a man consumed by memories, each one etched into the lines on his face like the faint creases on an old book's spine. His eyes, once bright with laughter and life, now held a deep sadness that seemed to weigh him down with every passing day. Yet, even in the midst of sorrow, there was an air of quiet determination about him.

As he scribbled notes, a name began to take shape on the page – a name that had haunted Dace for years. His brother, Luca, had been taken from him in a senseless act of violence when they were just teenagers. The pain of losing him still lingered, a hollow ache that threatened to engulf Dace at any moment.

But as he wrote, something strange began to happen. The memories that flooded his mind – the laughter, the arguments, the late-night conversations in the dead of summer – they didn't bring him down this time. Instead, they brought him a sense of peace, like a quiet calm settling over him like a soft blanket.

Dace's hand paused, and he looked up from the paper, his eyes scanning the room as if searching for something – or someone. For a moment, his gaze lingered on a figure sitting in the corner, sipping a cup of coffee. The stranger's face was obscured by shadows, but there was something about them that caught Dace's attention.

As he watched, the stranger slowly stood up and began to walk towards him. The air seemed to vibrate with tension, like a string being pulled tight. When the stranger reached his table, they smiled – a small, tentative smile that spoke of secrets and shared experiences.

"Your brother," the stranger said, their voice barely above a whisper. "I know what happened to him."

Dace's eyes narrowed, his pen poised in mid-air as he searched for the words to respond. For years, he had carried this secret alone – the weight of it crushing him at times, other times leaving him numb.

But now, as the stranger spoke those five words, something shifted inside Dace. The memories that haunted him still lingered, but they no longer defined him. He smiled, a small, tentative smile, and leaned forward, his eyes locking onto the stranger's.

"Tell me," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.
