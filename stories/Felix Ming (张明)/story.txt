Felix Ming, also known as Zhang Ming in his hometown, was a man with a passion for art and music. Growing up in the small town of Jinan, China, he spent most of his childhood listening to classical music and sketching the landscapes that surrounded him.

As a teenager, Felix began to explore his artistic side more seriously, teaching himself to paint and play the piano. His love for music was so strong that he would often sneak into the local concert hall at night to practice on the grand piano. The echoes of Tchaikovsky's melodies still lingered in the empty halls, where Felix had spent countless hours lost in his own creative world.

After completing high school, Felix left Jinan to pursue a degree in fine arts from Beijing University. There, he was exposed to a world of modern art and artists who challenged conventional norms. His experiences during this period shaped him into the artist he would become.

In Beijing's vibrant art scene, Felix met fellow creatives who shared his passion for self-expression. They spent countless nights exploring galleries
