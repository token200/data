Sami Korolev stepped into the small, cluttered office, her eyes scanning the room with a practiced air of indifference. She had been hired to investigate a string of high-profile break-ins at some of Moscow's most exclusive museums and galleries.

As she sat down across from her contact, a nervous-looking young man named Sasha, Sami couldn't help but feel a twinge of boredom. This was the fifth time in as many months that she had been called in to handle a particularly puzzling case.

"So, Sasha," she began, pulling out a notebook and pen, "tell me again what you've learned about these break-ins."

Sasha fidgeted with his hands, glancing around the room nervously. "I-I don't know if I'm supposed to be sharing this information," he stammered.

Sami raised an eyebrow. She had dealt with plenty of nervous witnesses before; it was always a sign that they were hiding something. "Come on, Sasha," she coaxed, her voice low and soothing. "You're not in trouble just because you're trying to help me out."

With a sigh, Sasha launched into a detailed description of the break-ins: how he had seen shadowy figures lurking around the museum's security systems; how he had discovered suspicious packages hidden among the exhibits; and how he had stumbled upon a cryptic message scrawled on the wall of one of the galleries.

Sami listened attentively, her mind racing with possibilities. She pulled out her phone and diailed a number, waiting for someone to pick up on the other end.

"Hey, Ivan," she said, when the voice answered. "I need you to run some checks for me. See if there's any connection between these break-ins and our old friend, Vasiliev."

The line went silent for a moment before Ivan responded, his voice gruff with skepticism. "Vasiliev? The former thief? What makes you think he's involved?"

Sami smiled to herself as she listened to Ivan's hesitant reply. She had been following Vasiliev for months, ever since his string of daring heists had gone sour and he had gone into hiding.

"It's the MO," she said finally, when Ivan had finished his questions. "The break-ins are too precise, too calculated. It looks like someone is trying to send a message."

Ivan snorted. "And what makes you think Vasiliev would be behind it?"

Sami leaned forward, her eyes locked on Sasha's anxious face. "Because, Ivan, I have a feeling that our thief wants me to think otherwise."
