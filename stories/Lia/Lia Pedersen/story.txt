Lia Pedersen stepped out of the small caf√© and onto the bustling streets of Copenhagen. As she breathed in the salty sea air, her eyes scanned the crowded sidewalk, searching for any sign of her contact. She had been waiting for what felt like hours, and her patience was wearing thin.

Just as she was about to give up, a figure emerged from the crowd. It was Henrik, a former colleague turned informant. He nodded discreetly at Lia before falling into step beside her.

"You're early," Lia said, trying to sound nonchalant despite the sense of urgency that had been building inside her for days.

Henrik hesitated before responding. "I have some information about your sister's disappearance."

Lia's heart skipped a beat as she recalled the countless sleepless nights and fruitless investigations that had followed in Anna's wake. Her younger sister had vanished without a trace three months ago, leaving behind only whispers of a mysterious encounter with a suspicious individual.

"What is it?" Lia pressed, her grip on Henrik's arm tightening.

Henrik glanced around nervously before leaning in close. "I overheard something from an associate of one of the individuals involved. They mentioned a name - Kasper Jensen."

Lia's mind racing as she processed this new information. Kasper was known to be a ruthless crime lord, with connections all the way up to the highest levels of Danish society.

"Do you have any proof?" Lia asked, her voice low and even.

Henrik hesitated before producing a small USB drive from his pocket. "This contains some... evidence. But be warned, it's not for the faint of heart."

Lia took the drive, feeling its weight settle into her palm like a tangible piece of truth. She tucked it into her bag and led Henrik to a nearby park bench.

As they sat down, Lia pulled out her phone and began to scroll through the files on her encrypted storage. The contents were disturbing - photographs of Anna, documents detailing Kasper's involvement in her sister's disappearance, and a cryptic message that read: "She will never be found."

Lia's eyes locked onto Henrik's as she confronted him with a single question: "Why did you agree to help me?"

Henrik shifted uncomfortably before responding. "I... I thought it was the right thing to do. Your sister deserved better than to be discarded like trash."

The words hung in the air, heavy with unspoken regret and shared guilt. Lia felt a surge of anger, but something about Henrik's desperation stayed her hand.

"Thank you," she said finally, offering him a small smile. "But this isn't over yet. I have a plan to expose Kasper and bring Anna home."

Henrik's eyes narrowed, a glimmer of hope flickering in their depths. Together, they sat on that bench, the city unfolding before them like a tangled web waiting to be unraveled.
