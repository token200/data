Lia Liebad stood at the edge of the cliff, her toes curled over the precipice as she gazed out at the endless expanse of sea. The wind whipped through her dark hair, tangles forming and snapping back into place with each gust. Her eyes, an arresting shade of indigo, narrowed against the sun's piercing light.

As a child, Lia had always felt suffocated by the constraints of her life in New Eden City. The strictures imposed by her influential family, the expectations placed upon her as a future leader, had threatened to stifle her very soul. But out here, on the windswept coast, she could lose herself.

Lia's thoughts turned to the letter she'd received that morning. It was an invitation from the distant city of Zha'thik, one that promised freedom and discovery beyond anything she'd ever known. The words had danced across the page like a siren's call, beckoning her toward adventure and escape.

She took a deep breath, feeling the salt spray on her lips as she gazed out at the horizon. New Eden City was behind her now; Lia knew it in her bones that this was where she truly belonged. Not among the stately edifices and narrow alleys of her childhood home, but amidst the untamed beauty of Zha'thik.

As she stood there, a gust stronger than any other swept through, sending Lia stumbling backward onto the grassy slope below. Her hands grasped at nothingness, and for an instant, time seemed to bend around her. The cliff's edge blurred into infinity, and she felt herself soaring free.

Somehow, Lia managed to regain her footing. She took a step forward, feeling the familiar solidity beneath her feet. It was still there – the world was still solid, after all – but for an instant, she'd let go of its boundaries. And in that fleeting moment, she knew that nothing would ever be the same again.

With renewed resolve, Lia turned to make her way back down to the winding streets below. The sea air filled her lungs once more as she descended into the city's bustle, unaware of the whispers and watchful eyes that had tracked her movements from afar. For Lia Liebad was not one to be underestimated; her heart, though unassuming, beat with a fire that would not be contained for long.
