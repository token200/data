Lia Zariņa stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar landscape of Riga's old town. As she made her way through the crowded streets, the smell of sauerkraut and roasting meats wafted through the air, transporting her back to summers spent at her family's food cart on the city's markets.

She had returned to Latvia after a decade away, her career as an architect in London left behind. Her mother lay sick with cancer, and Lia couldn't bear the thought of being far from home as she fought for every precious day. The diagnosis had been a wake-up call – Lia had put her own life on hold while caring for her sister and helping their parents run the family business.

Now, Lia took on small projects around the city, working closely with local artisans to design buildings that honored Latvia's rich cultural heritage. It wasn't the same fast-paced world she was used to in London, but there was something satisfying about seeing a piece of wood or stone transformed into beauty. She had even started taking classes at the Academy of Fine Arts, where her hands moved clumsily over clay and paint.

As Lia walked through the town square, she spotted friends gathered around an outdoor concert by a local ensemble playing traditional Latvian instruments. Her own mother would have loved this – the sound, the energy, the sense of community that filled the space. Lia felt tears prick at her eyes as she listened to the music, memories flooding back of nights spent dancing in the same square with friends.

For weeks, Lia worked tirelessly, trying to get everything ready for her mother's hospital visit. She designed a special garden room, with windows that opened onto a tranquil courtyard, where her mother could sit and watch the sun set over the rooftops. As she left the city center and headed back to the hospital, Lia felt a glimmer of hope. Her mother had been in remission for months, and Lia was determined not to let her worry – or anything else – define the next chapter of their lives.

For now, as Lia stood on the platform, watching the stars twinkle over Riga's historic spires, she felt a sense of peace settle into her heart. This place – its rough edges and worn surfaces – had always been home to her.
