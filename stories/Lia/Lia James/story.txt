Lia James sat in her small apartment, staring blankly at the wall as she listened to the sound of rain pattering against the windowpane. It was a familiar sensation, one that brought a sense of comfort and calmness to her troubled mind.

As a private investigator, Lia had seen her fair share of dark alleys and seedy underbelly of the city. But tonight, with the storm raging outside, she felt like an outsider in her own world. The memories of past cases haunted her, each one etched into her psyche like a scar.

She thought about the last case she worked on - a missing persons investigation that had left no leads or witnesses. The girl's family was still searching for answers, and Lia couldn't shake off the feeling of guilt that lingered inside her. She had promised to find out what happened, but every door she tried led to a dead-end.

The sound of rain grew louder, as if the city itself was trying to drown out the echoes of her doubts. Lia stood up and walked over to the window, pulling back the curtains to let in some fresh air. The rain-soaked streets were deserted, save for one person standing under an awning - a woman with piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into Lia's soul.

She felt a shiver run down her spine as their gazes met. Who was this stranger? What did she want from Lia? But before she could take another step forward, the woman vanished into thin air.

Lia's heart skipped a beat as she spun around and checked her apartment. The room seemed empty, but something told her that the stranger was still there - watching her, waiting for her to make a move.

As the storm subsided, Lia felt a surge of adrenaline coursing through her veins. This was what she had been missing - a spark of excitement, a hint of danger that came with every case. She picked up her phone and dialed a number - an old acquaintance who owed her a favor in return for a past service.

"I need your help," Lia said, trying to keep her voice steady over the line. "I have a feeling this storm is about to bring something big."

The other end was quiet for a moment before her acquaintance replied, "We'll meet at the usual place tomorrow night. Come alone."

Lia nodded, even though she knew the person on the other end couldn't see it. She felt a sense of anticipation building up inside her, like the storm outside was finally clearing the way for something new and mysterious to emerge.
