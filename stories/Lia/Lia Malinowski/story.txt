Lia Malinowski stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the cityscape. The soft glow of the streetlights below illuminated the towering skyscrapers, casting long shadows across the sidewalk. She took a deep breath, feeling the cool night air fill her lungs.

As she turned to leave, her eyes landed on a figure standing in the corner of the rooftop. It was her friend, Sofia. Sofia's dark hair was mussed, and her bright pink lipstick had smudged, giving her an edgy, impulsive look.

"Lia, I told you we shouldn't have come out here tonight," Sofia said, exasperation etched on her face. "It's too late. My brother is going to kill me."

Lia raised an eyebrow. "What's going on?"

Sofia sighed and walked over to the edge of the rooftop, joining Lia at the railing. They stood in silence for a moment, watching as the city came alive below them.

"My brother, Viktor, he's been acting strange lately," Sofia began, her voice barely above a whisper. "He's been getting these phone calls, and every time he answers, his face goes white. I think it has something to do with our mother."

Lia's expression turned serious. Their mother had passed away a year ago, under mysterious circumstances. The police had never found any leads, but rumor had it that Viktor was involved.

"What kind of phone calls?" Lia asked, her mind racing.

"I don't know," Sofia admitted. "But the last time he got one, he just hung up and ran out of here, slamming the door behind him. I followed him, but he disappeared into thin air."

Lia's eyes narrowed. This was getting more complicated by the minute.

"We need to find out what's going on with Viktor," Lia said firmly. "And we need to do it tonight."

Sofia nodded, a small smile playing on her lips. Together, they turned and walked off the rooftop, disappearing into the night.
