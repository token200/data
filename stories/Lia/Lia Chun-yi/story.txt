Lia Chun-yi stepped into the dimly lit tea house, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of her sister, Mei. It had been months since their mother's passing, and the weight of grief still lingered in Lia's heart. She took a deep breath, letting the scent of jasmine tea fill her lungs, as she made her way to the counter.

"Welcome, Lia Chun-yi," the owner, Mrs. Lin, said with a warm smile. "I've got just the thing to soothe your nerves."

Lia ordered a cup of the strongest green tea, one that would surely calm her racing thoughts. As she waited, her mind wandered back to their childhood, spent playing in the gardens of their ancestral home. Mei had always been the more adventurous of the two, while Lia preferred the quiet comfort of books.

Just then, Mei walked in, a look of exhaustion etched on her face. "Lia Chun-yi, I'm so sorry I'm late," she said, collapsing onto the stool beside her sister.

The two sat in silence for a moment, sipping their tea and watching as Mrs. Lin expertly crafted intricate designs with the steam from their cups. Finally, Mei spoke up, her voice barely above a whisper. "I had a dream last night, Lia Chun-yi. A dream of Mother's garden, full of life and color."

Lia's eyes locked onto her sister's, a spark of hope igniting within them both. Perhaps, just perhaps, their mother was trying to tell them something. Over the next few weeks, the sisters found themselves spending more time in the gardens, searching for any sign of their mother's presence.

One morning, as they sat among the blooming cherry blossoms, Lia turned to Mei and smiled. "I think we're being called," she said softly. "Lia Chun-yi believes that our mother is trying to guide us." Mei nodded in agreement, a sense of peace settling over her shoulders. Together, the sisters closed their eyes, listening for the whispers of their mother's garden, where love and hope bloomed forever.
