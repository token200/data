Lia Marrone had always been fascinated by the world of antique music instruments. As a young child, she would spend hours in her grandfather's dusty attic, running her fingers over the intricate carvings on an old viola or examining the delicate mechanisms of a vintage harmonica.

As she grew older, Lia's passion for antique instruments only intensified, leading her to pursue a degree in musicology and instrument restoration. She spent years honing her skills, working with master craftsmen and collectors to uncover hidden gems among the dusty shelves of auction houses and estate sales.

But it wasn't until she stumbled upon an obscure catalog listing from the 1920s that Lia discovered her true calling. The item was a rare, handcrafted contrabass viola built by Italian luthier, Alessandro Bianchi, in the early 1900s. The instrument was said to have once belonged to none other than renowned cellist, Salvatore Di Marino.

Lia's eyes widened as she read about the viola's storied past. She became obsessed with tracking down any remaining information or documentation about the instrument, convinced that it held the key to unlocking a piece of history.

Months turned into years, and Lia's search took her from dusty archives in Rome to obscure collector clubs in New York City. Finally, after countless dead ends and false leads, she received an email from a prominent musicologist who claimed to have information about Salvatore Di Marino's contrabass viola.

Excited, Lia rushed to the musicologist's office, her heart pounding with anticipation. As she sat down across from him, he revealed that the instrument was indeed being stored in a private collection, guarded by one of the most reclusive collectors in the world. Lia knew then and there that this was the break she had been waiting for.

Determined to bring the contrabass viola out of hiding, Lia Marrone began making discreet inquiries among the collector's inner circle, determined to reclaim her prize.
