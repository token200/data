Determined to get to the bottom of things, Lia began questioning the factory's employees, gathering information and piecing together the puzzle. She spent countless hours pouring over documents, attending meetings, and even sneaking into the factory at night to gather intel.

As she dug deeper, Lia discovered a web of deceit that went all the way to the top. The businessman was indeed involved in some shady dealings, and it seemed that he had been using his wealth and influence to silence anyone who dared to speak out against him.
