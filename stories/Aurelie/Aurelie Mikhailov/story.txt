Aurelie Mikhailov stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the sleepy town of Ravenswood. As the daughter of a famous Russian ballerina, she had grown up with the spotlight on her every move, but after years of training and performance, Aurelie had traded her tutu for a life of anonymity.

With a suitcase slung over her shoulder, she made her way to the small café where she had arranged to meet her contact. Inside, a hooded figure waited by the window, their face obscured by shadows.

"Aurelie Mikhailov," they whispered, as if introducing a ghost from the past. "I see you're still here."

Aurelie's hand instinctively went to the small pistol hidden in her coat pocket. She had been warned about these kinds of meetings, but she had no choice – her sister was in danger.

"I need your help," she said, taking a seat across from her contact. A burly man with a scruffy beard and a thick accent, he nodded curtly before producing a small folder filled with photographs.

"These are the men involved in your sister's kidnapping," Aurelie said, scanning the images. She recognized several of them from past cases – ruthless mercenaries with no qualms about using violence to get what they wanted.

The contact handed her a phone, and on the screen she saw a video message from her sister, taunting her captors and begging for help. Aurelie's jaw clenched as she dialed the number of the local police department, but she knew it was a long shot – in this town, corruption ran deep.

As she spoke with the contact, hatching a plan to infiltrate the mercenaries' hideout, Aurelie couldn't shake the feeling that she was playing into their hands. But for her sister's sake, she would do whatever it took – even if it meant risking everything.

"I'll be back," she said finally, as she stood to leave. The contact nodded in approval, a small smile creasing their face before they vanished into the shadows, leaving Aurelie Mikhailov to navigate the treacherous streets of Ravenswood alone.
