It was a warm summer evening in Florence, and the city's elite had gathered at the grand Palazzo Pitti to celebrate the marriage of Zofia de' Medici, daughter of Lorenzo and Lucrezia, to the wealthy merchant, Leonardo degli Albizzi.

As the sun dipped below the Arno River, the guests began to mingle, their fine silks and velvets rustling as they moved through the crowded halls. Zofia, resplendent in a gown of emerald green silk, smiled graciously as she was presented to her husband-to-be. Her dark hair was styled in the latest fashion, adorned with delicate pearls that sparkled like diamonds in the candlelight.

The wedding feast had just begun when Zofia's brother, Lorenzo, stood up to make a toast. "To my dear sister, Zofia de' Medici," he said, his voice booming across the hall. "May your marriage bring you joy and prosperity. May Leonardo degli Albizzi be a worthy husband to our beloved Zofia."

The guests erupted into applause, and Zofia blushed at the praise. She had always been the more reserved of the two siblings, content to spend her days studying philosophy and poetry rather than pursuing the intrigues of court life. But she was determined to make her marriage work, for the sake of her family and their reputation.

As the night wore on, Zofia took to the dance floor, her partner Leonardo twirling her around with a skill that belied his years. She laughed and spun, feeling carefree for the first time in months. Perhaps, she thought, this marriage would be more than just a duty – perhaps it could bring her true happiness.

But as the evening drew to a close, Zofia couldn't shake the feeling that there was something missing. Something that only time would reveal. She smiled and curtsied to the guests one last time, before slipping out of the ballroom with Leonardo by her side.

The night air was cool and crisp, filled with the scent of blooming jasmine. As they strolled through the gardens, Zofia leaned in close to Leonardo and whispered a question: "What do you truly want from me, my dear husband?"

Leonardo's eyes locked onto hers, his expression softening into something that looked almost like love. And for a moment, Zofia de' Medici knew that this was just the beginning of a great adventure – one that would change her life forever.
