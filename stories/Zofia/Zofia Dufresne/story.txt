Zofia Dufresne was a woman of mystery, with an air of quiet confidence that commanded attention without ever seeking it. Her raven-black hair was always impeccably styled, framing her heart-shaped face and piercing green eyes. Despite her striking features, Zofia remained an enigma, with a past shrouded in secrecy.

As she walked through the bustling streets of Paris, Zofia's long coat billowed behind her like a dark cloud, drawing admiring glances from passersby. She was a creature of habit, always stopping at the same small caf√© on Rue de Rivoli for a cup of strong coffee and a croissant.

One drizzly afternoon, as she sat sipping her coffee, Zofia noticed a young artist watching her from across the room. His bright blue eyes sparkled with curiosity, and his sketchbook lay open on the table in front of him, filled with hasty drawings of Zofia's profile.

For a moment, their gazes locked, and Zofia felt a shiver run down her spine. She looked away, pretending not to have noticed, but the artist's eyes followed her, never once leaving hers. He finished his coffee in silence, then gathered his things and approached Zofia's table.

"Mademoiselle Dufresne?" he asked, his voice hesitant. "May I? I was wondering if I might sketch you for a portrait."

Zofia raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the young artist's audacity. She nodded, and he began to draw, capturing her likeness with remarkable accuracy.

As the afternoon wore on, Zofia found herself lost in conversation with the artist, discussing art, literature, and life itself. For the first time in years, she felt a sense of connection, of belonging.

When the sun dipped below the horizon, casting Paris in a warm orange glow, Zofia stood up to leave, feeling a pang of sadness at parting from this kindred spirit. "Thank you for seeing me, Monsieur...?" she said, her voice trailing off as he finished introducing himself.

"Lucas," he replied, smiling wistfully. "I'll see you again, Zofia Dufresne?"

She smiled back, a rare and radiant smile, before disappearing into the rainy night, leaving Lucas to wonder if he'd truly seen her or just imagined the whole encounter.
