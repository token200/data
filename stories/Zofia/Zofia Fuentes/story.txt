She had always been driven to uncover the truth, no matter how difficult or uncomfortable it might be. With a keen eye for detail and a quick mind for research, Zofia had built a reputation as one of the most respected investigative journalists in the city.

One day, while working on a story about local politics, Zofia received a cryptic tip from an anonymous source that led her to a hidden meeting between several high-ranking officials. Intrigued and determined, she followed the lead and found herself at the doorstep of a nondescript office building.
