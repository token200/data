Zofia Kenji stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar station. She had been traveling for days, trying to escape the memories that haunted her. As a skilled detective, she had seen her fair share of dark alleys and twisted minds, but nothing could have prepared her for the personal demons that lingered within.

Her parents had always warned her about the dangers of meddling in other people's business, but Zofia Kenji was no stranger to taking risks. She had built a reputation as one of the best investigators in the city, with a keen eye for detail and an unyielding determination to uncover the truth.

As she made her way through the bustling station, Zofia Kenji spotted a small caf√© tucked away in a corner. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted out onto the platform, enticing her to come inside. She took a seat at the bar and ordered a cup of black coffee, her eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble.

A young woman with piercing green eyes caught her attention, sitting alone at a table by the window. There was something about her that seemed...off, like she was hiding secrets behind those piercing gazes. Zofia Kenji's instincts told her to approach her, to get to the bottom of what was really going on.

As she sipped her coffee, Zofia Kenji noticed a figure watching her from across the room. He was tall and lean, with piercing blue eyes that seemed to bore into her very soul. She felt a shiver run down her spine as their gazes met, and for a moment, they simply stared at each other.

Suddenly, the stranger vanished into thin air, leaving Zofia Kenji wondering if she had imagined the whole encounter. But as she turned back to the young woman by the window, she noticed something that made her blood run cold - a small note on the table, with a single phrase scrawled in red ink: "They're watching you."

Zofia Kenji's eyes narrowed as she reached for her phone, dialing a number that would set off a chain reaction of events. She was no stranger to danger, but this time, it seemed like the whole world was closing in on her. As she stood up to leave, Zofia Kenji knew that she had just stumbled into something much bigger than herself - and she was ready to dig deeper, no matter what secrets lay hidden beneath the surface.
