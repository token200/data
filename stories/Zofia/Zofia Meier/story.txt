One day, a young apprentice named Elara arrived at Zofia Meier's workshop, eager to learn the ancient art of weaving. Zofia Meier took the girl under her wing, teaching her the secrets of thread selection, tension control, and color harmony. As Elara learned with each passing day, she became increasingly entranced by Zofia Meier's passion for her craft.
