Marija Wagner stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. As a freelance journalist, she had grown accustomed to being on the move, always chasing the next big story. But this latest assignment had brought her to the rural town of Ravensburg, nestled deep in the heart of Germany's Black Forest.

Marija had spent hours researching the town's history and mythology, pouring over dusty tomes and speaking with locals who claimed to have seen strange creatures lurking in the shadows. She was determined to uncover the truth behind the rumors of a ghostly figure known only as "Die Frau im Wald" - The Woman of the Woods.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Marija noticed a figure watching her from across the way. A woman with long, curly brown hair and piercing green eyes seemed to be studying her every move. Marija felt a shiver run down her spine as their eyes met, but the woman simply nodded before disappearing into the crowd.

Undeterred, Marija continued her search for answers, visiting local taverns and inns where she gathered tales of Die Frau's supposed appearances. It wasn't until she spoke with the town's elderly healer, Frau Müller, that she began to piece together a more sinister narrative. According to Frau Müller, Die Frau was once a wronged woman who had been brutally murdered by her husband in a fit of jealousy.

As Marija delved deeper into the story, she found herself becoming increasingly entangled with the dark history of Ravensburg. She began to question whether the rumors were true - was Die Frau truly a ghostly presence haunting the town's woods? Or was it simply a manifestation of the collective guilt that lingered long after the murder had taken place?

Marija Wagner knew that she still had much to uncover, but for now, she felt a sense of unease wash over her. She had always prided herself on being a seeker of truth, but as she walked through the silent streets of Ravensburg, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched - and that Die Frau im Wald was waiting for her.
