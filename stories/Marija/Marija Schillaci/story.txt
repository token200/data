Marija Schillaci was a free-spirited artist who had always been drawn to the world of music. Growing up in a small town in Italy, she spent most of her childhood listening to her mother's old vinyl records and learning how to play the accordion. As she grew older, Marija's love for music only deepened, and she began to teach herself how to play the guitar.

Despite her passion for music, Marija had always felt stifled by the small town life. She yearned for adventure and excitement, and so after completing high school, she packed her bags and set off on a journey to explore the world. She traveled to Paris, where she studied art at the École des Beaux-Arts, and later to New York City, where she honed her skills as a street performer.

It was in New York that Marija met her future partner, Luca. He was a photographer who had been working on a documentary about the city's underground music scene, and Marija was immediately drawn to his passion and energy. Together, they formed a creative partnership that spanned both art and music.

Marija Schillaci began writing songs that reflected her love of travel and adventure, and soon she was performing at small clubs around the city. Her music was raw and emotional, with lyrics that spoke to the hearts of anyone who had ever felt lost or alone. As her popularity grew, so did her confidence, and Marija found herself taking center stage in both her art and life.

Years went by, and Marija's name became synonymous with the New York music scene. She continued to tour and perform, always pushing herself to create something new and original. And through it all, she remained true to her roots, drawing inspiration from the Italian countryside where she had grown up.

Despite the many successes that Marija Schillaci had achieved, she never forgot where she came from, and always made time for the people and places that mattered most. As she took the stage each night, her guitar in hand, she knew that she was exactly where she was meant to be – on the cusp of something new and exciting, with music as her guide.
