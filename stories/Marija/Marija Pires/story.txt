Marija Pires sat in the dimly lit café, nursing her coffee and staring out at the rain-soaked streets of Lisbon. A photographer by trade, she had spent years capturing the city's beauty through her lens, but tonight she felt like a stranger in her own home.

As she lost herself in thought, a young boy with bright pink hair walked into the café, drawing the attention of everyone around him. Marija watched as he ordered a hot chocolate and took a seat at the bar, his eyes scanning the room until they landed on hers.

For a moment, they just looked at each other – the boy's gaze full of curiosity, Marija's expression guarded. But then, in an instant, the boy was smiling and making his way towards her, a bright smile spreading across his face.

"Hi," he said, sitting down beside her. "I'm João."

Marija raised an eyebrow. "And I'm Marija."

João's eyes sparkled with mischief. "I've seen your work, Marija Pires. You're amazing."

Marija felt a flush rise to her cheeks as she fumbled for her camera bag. "Thanks," she muttered.

As they sipped their coffee and talked, Marija found herself opening up to João in ways she never thought possible. He was an artist, too – a musician with a voice like honey – and his passion was infectious.

Before she knew it, the café had emptied out and the rain outside had slowed to a gentle patter. The boy stood up, brushing off his jeans. "Want to take a walk with me?" he asked, offering Marija his arm.

Without thinking, she took it. They strolled through the deserted streets, talking about everything and nothing. As they walked, Marija felt like she was seeing Lisbon for the first time – through João's eyes, full of wonder and possibility.

Eventually, they found themselves at the edge of the city, overlooking the Tagus River. The stars were starting to twinkle overhead, and the sound of the water lapping against the shore created a soothing melody.

Marija looked over at João, feeling a connection she couldn't quite explain. "Thank you for tonight," she said softly.

João's smile faltered for a moment before he smiled again – this time with a depth that made Marija's heart skip a beat. "Anytime, Marija Pires."

As the night wore on, and the stars shone brighter overhead, Marija knew that something had shifted inside her. Maybe it was João, or maybe it was Lisbon itself – but whatever it was, she felt like she'd stumbled upon a new story, one that would unfold in ways she couldn't yet imagine.
