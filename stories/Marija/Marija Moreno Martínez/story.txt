Marija Moreno Martínez stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of familiarity. She had been away from her homeland of Cuba for nearly a decade, and the sights and sounds were still overwhelming.

As she made her way through the crowded hall, Marija's mind wandered back to her childhood, playing on the sun-kissed beaches of Varadero with her siblings and cousins. Her abuela used to take them fishing, teaching them about the importance of perseverance and respect for the natural world.

But life had taken a different path. After completing her studies in Havana, Marija had been recruited by a international non-profit organization to work on sustainable development projects in Africa. She spent years working in the Democratic Republic of Congo, helping communities establish their own renewable energy systems.

Despite the challenges she faced, Marija's experiences had shaped her into a resilient and determined individual. She was now ready to return home, eager to reconnect with her family and community, and share her knowledge and skills with others.

As she walked through the station, Marija noticed a group of young people gathered near the exit, enthusiastically discussing a new initiative to create a community garden in an abandoned lot on the outskirts of Havana. They recognized her immediately, and welcomed her into their midst with warm smiles.

Marija's eyes lit up as she listened to their ideas and plans. She remembered similar projects from her time in Africa, but also saw the potential for innovation and creativity here in Cuba. Together, they hatched a plan to bring together local farmers, artists, and community leaders to create a thriving ecosystem that would benefit everyone.

Over the next few weeks, Marija immersed herself in the project, working tirelessly with the team to develop a comprehensive plan. She shared her expertise on permaculture and sustainable agriculture, and helped facilitate connections between the different stakeholders.

As the garden began to take shape, Marija watched with pride as the community came together, sharing their skills and resources to create something truly special. The garden became a beacon of hope, symbolizing the power of collaboration and determination in the face of adversity.

For Marija, this was more than just a project – it was a homecoming. She knew that she would always carry her Cuban heritage with her, but it was this moment, surrounded by people who had welcomed her back with open arms, that felt like a true return to herself.
