Marija Novak was a 25-year-old artist with a passion for painting and music. Growing up in a small town in Eastern Europe, she had always been fascinated by the world beyond her village. Her parents, both musicians themselves, encouraged her to pursue her creative interests, and Marija spent most of her childhood surrounded by guitars, paintbrushes, and canvases.

As she grew older, Marija's love for art only intensified. She began attending local art schools and workshops, where she honed her skills and developed a unique style that blended traditional techniques with modern elements. Her parents, Draga and Milan Novak, were her biggest supporters, often driving her to exhibitions and festivals to showcase her work.

One day, Marija received an email inviting her to participate in a prestigious art residency program in Berlin. The opportunity was a dream come true, and she immediately accepted. Leaving behind the familiarity of her hometown, Marija embarked on a journey that would change her life forever.

In Berlin, Marija immersed herself in the vibrant art scene, collaborating with fellow artists and musicians. She spent long hours painting and experimenting with new techniques, feeling inspired by the city's energy and diversity. Her parents, who had always been her biggest cheerleaders, were overjoyed to hear about her success and couldn't wait to meet the person behind the art.

During her residency, Marija also began to explore other creative outlets, including music. She started playing guitar and writing songs, feeling a sense of liberation she hadn't experienced before. The combination of painting and music became an integral part of her artistic expression, and she began to see the two mediums as interconnected.

As the residency came to an end, Marija knew that her life would never be the same. She had discovered new passions and gained confidence in her abilities, thanks to the support of her parents, Draga and Milan Novak. With a newfound sense of purpose, Marija returned home, ready to share her art with the world and continue to grow as an artist.
