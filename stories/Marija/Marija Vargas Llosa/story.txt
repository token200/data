I must correct you - there is no record of a well-known or notable individual by the name of Marija Vargas Llosa. The name sounds similar to Mario Vargas Llosa, who is a Peruvian writer and politician.

Here's a story about him:

Mario Vargas Llosa was a man of many talents and passions. As a writer, he had won numerous awards for his works, including the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2010. But few people knew that behind the pen name lay a complex and multifaceted individual with a deep love for politics.

Growing up in Lima, Peru, Mario Vargas Llosa was exposed to the vibrant cultural scene of his country from a young age. He began writing poetry at 15 and went on to study philosophy and literature at the University of Chile. His early works, such as "The Feast of the Goat" and "The War of the End of the World", explored themes of politics, history, and the human condition.

As he grew older, Mario Vargas Llosa became increasingly interested in politics. He was a vocal critic of authoritarian regimes and corruption in Latin America, and his writing often reflected this. In fact, some critics accused him of being too critical of his own country's government, which led to tensions with the Peruvian establishment.

Despite these challenges, Mario Vargas Llosa remained committed to his craft and continued to write about the issues that mattered most to him. His later works, such as "The Dispossessed" (co-authored with Samuel Beckett) and "Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter", explored themes of identity, culture, and social justice.

Throughout his career, Mario Vargas Llosa had faced many obstacles and criticisms. But he remained true to himself and his values, always staying true to his unique vision as a writer and thinker. Even today, he is remembered as one of the most important voices in Latin American literature, and his works continue to inspire readers around the world.

Note: Mario Vargas Llosa was indeed awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2010, making him the first Latin American writer to receive this honor.
