After completing her degree in journalism, Marija landed an internship at a prominent news agency in Rome. She quickly proved herself to be a rising star, with a keen eye for detail and a passion for investigative reporting.

Despite the risks, Marija continued to dig deeper, pouring over documents and conducting interviews with sources who were willing to come forward. Her story, which exposed widespread embezzlement and cronyism, sent shockwaves through the Italian government and media.

As a result of her reporting, Marija received numerous death threats and was even subjected to intimidation tactics by those she had named in her story. However, undeterred, she continued to push forward, using her platform to bring about change and accountability.

Marija's reporting also caught the attention of some unexpected quarters - the Vatican.
