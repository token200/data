Marija Durand stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the desolate landscape. The station was a relic of a bygone era, its wooden beams weathered to a silvery grey that seemed to blend seamlessly into the mist-shrouded hills. Marija breathed in deeply, feeling a sense of restlessness settle over her like a shroud.

She had left behind the hustle and bustle of city life, seeking solace in the rural countryside where her ancestors had once lived and worked the land. Her grandmother, Babica, had passed down to her a small patch of neglected fields and a dilapidated farmhouse that Marija hoped to restore to its former glory.

As she walked towards the house, Marija noticed a figure watching her from across the yard. A young man with piercing blue eyes and dark hair, who seemed as out of place as she was. He wore a faded denim jacket and carried a worn leather satchel slung over his shoulder.

"Dragan," Marija called out, a name that echoed through her memories like an old friend. "What brings you here?"

Dragan's gaze lingered on her face before he nodded, a hint of a smile playing on his lips. "Just passing through," he said, his voice low and smooth as honey.

Marija's instincts told her otherwise – that Dragan was hiding something, but she couldn't quite put her finger on it. She decided to push aside her curiosity for now and focused on the task at hand: clearing the overgrown weeds from Babica's old vegetable garden.

The days blended together in a haze of hard work and quiet contemplation. Marija spent long hours tending to the land, coaxing life back into the withered soil. She felt a sense of peace settle over her as she worked, the rhythms of nature lulling her into a state of serenity.

As evening drew near, Dragan would appear in the doorway, his eyes locked on hers, their conversations sparse but rich with unspoken meaning. Marija began to wonder if perhaps this stranger was more than just a passing visitor – perhaps he held a piece of her own past within him, waiting to be rediscovered.
