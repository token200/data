Marija Pedersen stepped into the crowded caf√©, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She had been searching for weeks, trying to track down her estranged father, and finally, she had received a tip that he might be in Helsinki.

As she waited in line, Marija's mind wandered back to her childhood. She remembered her mother telling her stories about her father, a man with a wild heart and a quick smile. But after her mother's passing, Marija had been left to care for herself, and her father had disappeared without a word.

When it was finally her turn to order, Marija asked the barista if he knew anything about a man matching her father's description. The barista shook his head, but Marija noticed a look of curiosity in his eyes, and she pressed him for more information.

"I'll ask around," he said finally, and Marija left with a sense of hope. She spent the rest of the day asking questions, showing photos of her father to anyone who would look at them.

As the sun began to set, Marija received a call from an unknown number. "Hello?" she answered, her heart racing.

"Is this Marija Pedersen?" a voice asked on the other end of the line.

Marija's eyes widened as she recognized the voice. It was her father's old partner, the one who had always been tight-lipped about their relationship.

"Yes," Marija said finally, her voice shaking with excitement.

There was a pause, and then her father's voice came on the line. "Marija, I'm so sorry. I've been living in hiding for years, afraid of what would happen if you found me."

Marija felt a mix of emotions: anger, sadness, and above all, relief. She had finally found her father, after all these years.

"I want to see you," Marija said, her voice firm.

There was another pause, and then her father spoke up. "I'll come to your place tomorrow morning."

Marija nodded, even though he couldn't see her. "Okay," she said.
