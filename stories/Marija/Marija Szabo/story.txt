The day of the competition arrived, and Marija Szabo's Sweet Treats was buzzing with activity. As they set up their display, Marija couldn't help but feel a sense of pride in all that she had accomplished.

As the judges made their way through the stalls, sampling each entry, Marija held her breath, anxiously awaiting their verdict. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, they announced the winner: Szabó's Sweet Treats! Marija let out a triumphant whoop as she hugged Szilvia tightly, tears of joy streaming down her face. It was moments like these that made all the hard work worth it – proving to herself and everyone else that Marija Szabo was indeed a force to be reckoned with in the world of baking.
