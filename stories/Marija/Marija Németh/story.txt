Marija Németh stepped into the small café, scanning the crowded room for her friend, László. She spotted him hunched over a cup of coffee, his eyes fixed on his laptop screen as he typed away. Marija smiled to herself, remembering how much he hated being interrupted.

As she approached their table, László barely looked up, his fingers flying across the keyboard. "Hey, Marija! Long time no see," he muttered, not even breaking stride from his typing.

Marija chuckled and settled into her seat, sipping on a steaming cup of coffee herself. She loved days like this – lazy Sundays with no plans, just László's constant stream of coding updates to keep her entertained.

László finally looked up, catching Marija's eye as she took in the chaos around them. The café was bustling with students working on their own projects, each lost in their own little world. It reminded Marija of how much she admired László's dedication to his craft – he'd spent countless hours perfecting his coding skills.

"So, what's new?" Marija asked, trying to sound nonchalant despite her curiosity.

László took a deep breath and began explaining the latest project he was working on. As he spoke, Marija listened intently, nodding along as he talked about data structures and algorithms. Her eyes lit up with excitement; she'd always been fascinated by the way computers worked.

Their conversation flowed effortlessly, like they'd done this countless times before. It was moments like these that Marija cherished – quiet Sundays spent with a friend who truly understood her passions.

As László finished his explanation and closed his laptop, Marija leaned back in her chair, feeling content. She knew she could always count on him to be there for her, whether it was discussing coding or just sharing stories about their lives.

The café's bustle receded into the background as Marija gazed at László, grateful for their friendship and the comfort of each other's company.
