Aare Hoffmann stepped into the smoky dimness of his favorite bar, the Red Griffin. The patrons turned to regard him, their faces illuminated by the faint glow of cigarette butts and whiskey-stained glasses. Hoffmann's eyes scanned the room, locking onto familiar figures huddled in corners or nursing solitary drinks.

He made his way through the crowd, weaving between tables with a practiced air of nonchalance. Behind the bar, Gertie polished a mug with a dirty rag, her eyes following Hoffmann's approach. She slid him a whiskey, the amber liquid glowing like a miniature sun as it reached his outstretched hand.

As he took a sip, the door swung open and a chill breeze swept in, carrying the scent of rain on its heels. A figure emerged from the darkness, their features indistinct beneath a fedora pulled low over their face. Hoffmann's eyes narrowed; only one person wore such an accessory in this city.

The stranger slid onto a stool beside him, ordering a coffee from Gertie with a smooth, practiced tone that belied a hint of tension beneath the surface. Hoffmann raised an eyebrow as he accepted his own refill, the liquid burning its way down his throat like a promise.

"You're looking for something, I take it?" Hoffmann said, voice low and even, as they sipped their drinks in silence.

The stranger's eyes flicked up, meeting Hoffmann's with a spark of calculation. "I've heard you have...information. About the Volskh case."

Hoffmann chuckled, the sound dripping with irony. "Ah, no one asks for help. They just expect it out of hand."

Their gazes locked once more, this time with an air of mutual understanding that sent a shiver down Hoffmann's spine. He leaned back in his stool, letting the whiskey work its magic.

"You want to know what I know?" Hoffmann asked finally, voice dripping with reluctance. "Or just to waste my time?"

The stranger smiled, revealing a flash of white teeth as they set their coffee aside. For a moment, Hoffmann saw something flicker across their features – a glimmer of desperation, perhaps – before it was extinguished beneath the surface.

"I'll take both," the stranger replied, voice firm and resolute.

Hoffmann raised an eyebrow once more, but this time, no hint of amusement remained. He set his glass aside, readying himself for what lay ahead.
