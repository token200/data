I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named "Aare Kenji." If you could provide more context or details about this character, I'd be happy to help.

However, if you'd like, I can create a short story based on a completely new and original character. Here's a 400-word story about a character named Aare Kenji:

In the dimly lit alleys of Tokyo's Shinjuku district, a figure emerged from the shadows. His name was Aare Kenji, a mysterious individual with an air of confidence that commanded respect. With piercing green eyes and jet-black hair, he moved with an effortless elegance that belied his rugged past.

Aare's story began on the streets of Tokyo, where he grew up as an orphan living in a rundown hostel. He learned to fight from a young age, using his fists and wit to survive the harsh realities of life. But it was a chance encounter with a martial arts master that changed everything.

Under the tutelage of Master Tanaka, Aare discovered a new passion – Kyokushin karate. For years, he trained tirelessly, honing his skills in the ancient art. As he grew stronger and more agile, Aare began to realize his true potential as a warrior.

Now, at 25, Aare Kenji was on a mission to avenge his mentor's murder. The Tokyo underworld had turned against him, and it was up to him to protect the innocent and bring justice to those responsible.

With his trusty katana by his side, Aare stalked through the streets, searching for any sign of his enemies. His eyes scanned the rooftops, ever vigilant for any hint of danger. It was a lonely existence, but one he had grown accustomed to.

As he walked, the neon lights of Shinjuku's skyscrapers reflected off his skin, casting an eerie glow on his face. Aare's thoughts turned to Master Tanaka, and the lessons he had taught him. "A true warrior must always be prepared for battle," he whispered to himself.

Suddenly, a whisper in his ear made Aare spin around. A figure emerged from the shadows – a young woman with piercing blue eyes, identical to those of Master Tanaka's daughter. She introduced herself as Emiko, and revealed that she had been searching for Aare for months.

"Will you help me find my father's killers?" Emiko asked, her voice trembling.

Aare nodded, his eyes locked on the horizon. "Together, we'll make sure justice is served."

And with that, the unlikely duo set off into the Tokyo night, their footsteps echoing through the alleys as they vowed to bring an end to the darkness that had consumed Aare's world.
