But despite his best efforts, Aare Williams couldn't shake off the feeling that he was missing something. The more he investigated, the more puzzled he became. It was as if the case was deliberately designed to confuse and mislead him.

Just when Aare Williams thought he had hit a dead end, he received an unexpected phone call from an anonymous source claiming to have information about the missing businessman. The voice on the other end hinted at a larger conspiracy involving corrupt politicians and powerful business interests.
