Upon hearing of his remarkable talents, Lily begged him to help her revive her deceased companion. With tears in her eyes, Aare Persson carefully accepted the task and set to work.

Under the watchful gaze of Aare Persson, a soft glow emanated from his hands, enveloping the lifeless rabbit's body. As if awakened by an unseen force, the rabbit began to twitch and stir. Lily's eyes widened in wonder as her beloved pet rose to its feet, its fur fluffed with renewed vitality.
