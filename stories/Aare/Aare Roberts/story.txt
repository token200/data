Aare Roberts stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the drizzly afternoon sky. He had arrived in Ravenswood just an hour ago, but already he could feel the town's weight settling upon him like a shroud.

A journalist by trade, Aare had been sent to Ravenswood to cover the mysterious disappearance of the town's beloved mayor. Theories abounded - from the local sheriff's insistence that it was a robbery gone wrong to the whispers of a cult operating in the shadows.

As he gathered his belongings, Aare couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. He had been investigating the case for weeks now, and yet every lead seemed to end in a dead-end alleyway. The town's residents were tight-lipped, reluctant to speak of their mayor or the events surrounding his disappearance.

With a nod to himself, Aare set off into the rain-soaked streets of Ravenswood. He made his way to the local diner, where he knew the sheriff would be waiting for him. Over a cup of black coffee, the sheriff revealed a few new details - a suspicious conversation between two town officials, a security camera caught a glimpse of something suspicious on the night of the mayor's disappearance.

Aare scribbled furiously in his notebook, his mind racing with possibilities. He asked to speak to the townspeople, hoping that someone might be willing to share what they knew. The sheriff hesitated before handing Aare a piece of paper - an address scrawled on it by a local resident.

"Be careful," the sheriff warned, as he took the paper back. "Not everyone in this town is telling you the truth."

Aare smiled wryly, knowing that was exactly what he had been counting on. He tucked the paper into his pocket and set off towards the address - a small cabin on the outskirts of town.

As he approached the cabin, Aare could feel an energy emanating from within. He took a deep breath and knocked on the door. The silence that followed was palpable, before finally, it swung open to reveal a hooded figure.

"Welcome," the figure said, its voice barely above a whisper. "I've been expecting you."

Aare's instincts screamed at him to retreat, but something in the figure's words made him pause. Maybe this wasn't just another dead-end lead...
