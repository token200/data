Aare Czarnecki was known for his peculiar profession - he was a professional line-stander. With a keen eye for spotting the best spots to wait in line, Aare had built a reputation as one of the most sought-after line-standers in the city.

One sunny Saturday morning, Aare found himself waiting in line outside a popular new restaurant that had just opened its doors to the public. As he stood patiently beside the crowd of excited diners, he checked his watch for what felt like the hundredth time that day. He was there for the new limited-edition menu item, and no one was going to get ahead of him.

Just as Aare was starting to feel restless, a harried-looking woman approached him with a plea in her eyes. "Excuse me," she said, out of breath. "I need someone to wait in line for me. I have a meeting that just started and I completely forgot my lunch reservation." Aare smiled sympathetically and agreed to take on the task.

As the hours ticked by, Aare became an unlikely social fixture among the crowd. People began to strike up conversations with him, asking about everything from his favorite foods (pastrami sandwiches) to his line-standing strategies. "You're so calm," someone said, impressed. "How do you do it?" Aare smiled wryly and replied, "It's all about preparation and a bit of luck."

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the restaurant doors swung open and Aare was greeted by the sight of a delicious-looking burger waiting for him at the counter. He took his food and began to make his way through the crowd, earning nods of gratitude from those he had waited in line for.

As he walked away from the restaurant, Aare couldn't help but think about how much he loved his job as Aare Czarnecki, professional line-stander extraordinaire. It was a strange profession to be sure, but it suited him perfectly - and now, people were willing to pay top dollar for his services.
