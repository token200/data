I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Aare Wagner. It's possible that you may have misspelled the name or that Aare Wagner is not a well-known character. If you could provide more context or details about who Aare Wagner is, I'd be happy to try and help.

However, if you'd like, I can create a short story based on your request for a 400-word character sketch of Aare Wagner. Please let me know what kind of character you envision Aare Wagner to be (e.g., superhero, fantasy creature, historical figure) and I'll do my best to craft an engaging story around them.

Once I have this information, I can begin writing the story.
