Aare Novák stepped into the dimly lit bar, his eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. As a retired intelligence agent, he had spent years navigating the shadows, gathering intel and pulling off high-stakes operations. But now, with his retirement, he was looking to slow down and enjoy the fruits of his labor.

Aare Novák took a seat at the bar, ordering a whiskey on the rocks as he waited for his contact to arrive. He had been expecting her for hours, but the rain outside seemed to be keeping people off the streets. Just as he was starting to get anxious, a figure emerged from the gloom, shaking the rain off their coat.

It was Sophia Patel, an old colleague and friend. "Aare, it's good to see you," she said, slipping onto the stool beside him. "I see you're still enjoying the finer things in life."

Novák smiled wryly. "Someone has to keep the agency in business, even if I'm not around anymore." He signaled the bartender for another round and leaned back into his seat.

Sophia raised an eyebrow. "What brings you here tonight? We didn't exactly have a falling out, but...I don't know, something felt off."

Novák sighed, his eyes drifting toward the rain-soaked streets outside. "I got pulled in on one too many jobs after retirement, Sophia. It's like my body was screaming at me to stop, but my mind just wouldn't listen." He took a sip of his drink, feeling the burn all the way down.

Sophia nodded sympathetically. "You're not getting any younger, Aare. Maybe it's time to focus on the things that really matter." Novák snorted, taking another swig of his whiskey.

"I'll tell you what matters," he said, a hint of defiance creeping into his voice. "It matters that I get my whiskey just right, that my shoes are polished to a shine, and that I can sit in a bar without anyone recognizing me for who I used to be." Sophia laughed, clinking her glass against Novák's.

For a moment, the past felt like it was exactly where it belonged – behind them.
