Aare Viljanen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station for any signs of life. He had been traveling for hours, and the thought of finally reaching his destination was almost too much to bear. Aare Viljanen had always been a wandering soul, never staying in one place for too long, but there was something about this journey that felt different.

As he made his way through the station, Aare Viljanen noticed a small caf√© tucked away in a corner. He pushed open the door and was enveloped by the warm scent of freshly brewed coffee. The barista, an elderly woman with kind eyes, looked up from her book and smiled at him.

"Welcome to our humble abode," she said, wiping her hands on a towel. "What can I get for you?"

Aare Viljanen took a seat at the counter and perused the menu. He had always been a simple man, preferring the straightforward flavors of a good cup of coffee over anything more elaborate.

"I'll have just black coffee, please," he said, his deep voice rumbling.

The barista nodded and began to pour him a steaming cup. As she handed it to him, Aare Viljanen noticed a small piece of paper on the counter with his name scribbled on it in hasty handwriting.

"Who wrote this?" he asked the barista, nodding towards the paper.

She looked up at him, her eyes clouding over for a moment. "That was left by a traveler who passed through here last week," she said quietly. "They said you were the only one they knew would be able to find their way."

Aare Viljanen took the cup from her and raised it to his lips, feeling a sense of purpose wash over him. He had always been a solitary figure, but there was something about this moment that made him feel like he was exactly where he was meant to be.

He finished his coffee in silence, lost in thought as the barista watched him with a knowing glance. When he finally set the cup down, she smiled and patted him on the back.

"Safe travels, Aare Viljanen," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.
