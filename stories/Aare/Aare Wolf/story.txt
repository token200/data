Aare Wolfsong was known for his wild mane of curly brown hair and piercing green eyes that seemed to see right through you. The villagers called him the Wolf, but only those who knew him well dared to call him by his full name. He was a free spirit, a wanderer with no fixed abode, and he liked it that way.

Aare Wolfsong had grown up on the streets, surviving by his wits and his fists. But as he grew older, he began to realize that there was more to life than just scrapping for scraps. He started to sing, and not just any singing – the kind of soulful howling that could be heard for miles.

People would gather around him whenever he sang, mesmerized by the raw emotion in his voice. Some said it was like nothing they had ever heard before – a mix of human sorrow and wolf's wildness. Others claimed to have seen shadowy figures lurking at the edge of the forest when Aare Wolfsong sang.

As word of his talent spread, people began to call him the Wolf Singer, or simply The Wolf. But Aare Wolfsong knew that he was more than just a performer – he was a storyteller, a weaver of myths and legends that had been passed down through generations.

One night, as the full moon hung low in the sky, Aare Wolfsong stood on the outskirts of the village, his voice soaring into the darkness. The villagers huddled together, their eyes fixed on him with a mix of awe and fear. And when he finished singing, the wind carried his final words away into the night: "The wild ones are always waiting, deep in the heart of the forest."

As the crowd dispersed, whispers began to spread about Aare Wolfsong's latest tale – one that spoke of an ancient pact between humans and wolves, a bond forged from blood and magic. Some said he had made it himself, while others claimed it was just another one of his wild stories.

But as for Aare Wolfsong, he knew the truth: he was merely a vessel for the voices of those who came before him – a wolf's howl echoing through the ages.
