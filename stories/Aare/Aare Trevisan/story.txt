With an uncanny ability to blend into the shadows, Aare Trevisan had made a name for himself on the streets of Paris.

One night, while casing a high-society gala, Aare Trevisan spotted her – a stunning woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. Her name was Sophia Patel, a wealthy socialite with a reputation for being untouchable. Intrigued by the challenge, Aare Trevisan began to weave a web of intrigue around Sophia, playing on her deepest desires and insecurities.
