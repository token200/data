As the sun began to set over Mogadishu, Aare Abdi returned to his office, exhausted but exhilarated by the progress he had made. He sat back in his chair, took a deep breath, and let out a satisfied sigh. It had been another productive day for Aare Abdi, and he couldn't wait to see what the future held for Abdi Innovations.
