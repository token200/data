Aare Jansone was known for his peculiar profession – he was a professional mourner. Yes, you read that right – a professional mourner. In Latvia, where he hailed from, it was an old tradition to hire mourners for special occasions like weddings and funerals. And Aare was the best in the business.

He would don black clothes, dark makeup, and a heavy cloak, and then proceed to make anyone's eyes water with his ear-shattering wails and exaggerated gestures. People would pay him handsomely to attend their loved ones' funeral, or even their friend's wedding. The idea was that by making everyone cry, he would somehow ensure the happy couple's marriage would be long-lasting.

Aare took pride in his work. He'd show up at the most unexpected places – a birthday party, a new baby's arrival – and unleash his raw, gut-wrenching sobs. People loved him for it; they thought it added to the atmosphere of mourning or celebration. But Aare wasn't one to take himself too seriously. He knew that beneath all the wails and tears, he was bringing people together.

One day, a young woman named Līga approached Aare with an unusual request. Her grandmother had passed away just days ago, but her family was planning to hold a celebratory dinner that evening. They wanted Aare to attend – not as a mourner, but as a performer. The twist? Līga's grandmother used to tell hilarious stories and jokes about Aare's antics, and the family wanted him to recreate those moments for their tribute.

Aare was hesitant at first, but something in Līga's eyes made him agree. He spent hours rehearsing his most outrageous sobs and gesticulations, trying to do justice to her grandmother's memory. As he took the stage that evening, surrounded by the family and friends, Aare felt a strange sense of purpose.

With each joke and wail, he transported everyone back to laughter-filled afternoons with Līga's grandmother. The room was filled with tears – not just from sadness, but also from nostalgia and joy. When it was all over, Aare stood tall, exhausted but triumphant, knowing that his profession had brought people closer together.

And so, the tradition of professional mourning continued in Latvia – thanks to Aare Jansone, who found a way to turn grief into comedy, and make everyone's heart full once again.
