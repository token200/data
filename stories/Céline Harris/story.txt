Céline Harris stood at the edge of the bustling city, her eyes fixed on the horizon as if searching for something just out of sight. The wind whipped through her long, dark hair, carrying with it the whispers of passersby and the wail of sirens in the distance.

She was a wanderer, a drifter without a destination or purpose beyond the next step. Her past was shrouded in mystery, and she preferred it that way. Few people knew much about Céline, except that she had a smile that could light up a room and a laugh that could charm the birds from the trees.

As she walked, the sounds of the city grew louder, and the smells of street food and exhaust fumes filled her nostrils. She weaved through the crowds, dodging umbrellas and briefcases as she made her way to the docks. The sea air was a balm to her soul, and she felt most alive when she stood at the water's edge, listening to the waves crash against the shore.

Céline had always been drawn to the sea, despite its ability to consume her whole when the tide came in. She had grown up on a small island, where the ocean was both her playground and her prison. Her parents had vanished when she was just a child, leaving her to fend for herself against the unforgiving waves.

She had learned to survive by scavenging for food and finding shelter in the crevices between the rocks. As she grew older, she began to explore the wider world beyond her island home. She hitchhiked across countries, met new people, and collected stories that she stored away like seashells in a jar.

One day, she stumbled upon a small café on the waterfront, where she found herself drawn to the owner, a quiet woman named Sophia who listened with kind eyes as Céline poured out her tales. Over steaming cups of coffee, they talked about everything and nothing, their words flowing like the sea itself.

As the days turned into weeks, Céline found herself returning to Sophia's café more often than not. She would sit for hours, watching the sun set over the water as they chatted about life, love, and the secrets that only the sea could keep. And though she never stayed long in one place, Céline knew that this was where she belonged – on the edge of the world, with Sophia by her side, listening to the whispers of the wind.
