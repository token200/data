Ignacy Altmann stood at the edge of the bustling market square, his piercing blue eyes scanning the crowd with an air of quiet intensity. A young man from a humble background, he had risen to prominence through his intellect and determination, earning himself a place as one of Poland's most respected lawyers.

As he made his way through the throngs of people, Ignacy's thoughts turned to the case that had brought him to this place. The wealthy merchant, Paweł Górski, was accused of embezzlement and bribery, and Ignacy had been hired to defend him against the charges.

Despite his own doubts about Górski's guilt, Ignacy had a duty to uphold the law and fight for justice. He pushed open the door to the market square tavern, where he had arranged to meet with the merchant's wife, Helena.

As he entered the crowded room, Ignacy spotted Helena sitting at a table near the back, sipping a cup of ale. She looked up as he approached, her eyes narrowing slightly as she took in his disheveled appearance.

"Ah, Mr. Altmann," she said curtly, her voice dripping with a mix of relief and frustration. "I see you're as late as I expected."

Ignacy flashed her a charming smile, which only seemed to make her expression more stern. "I apologize for the delay, Mrs. Górski," he said, taking a seat across from her. "Please, let's get down to business. I have some questions about your husband's... activities."

Helena hesitated before launching into a detailed account of Paweł's dealings with various government officials and local businessmen. Ignacy listened intently, his mind racing with the implications of what he was hearing.

As they spoke, Ignacy couldn't help but notice the desperation in Helena's eyes. She seemed to be carrying a heavy burden, one that weighed heavily on her shoulders.

"I'll do everything I can to prove your husband's innocence," Ignacy promised, his voice firm and reassuring. "But you must understand, Mrs. Górski, that this will not be an easy fight."

Helena nodded, her eyes welling up with tears. "I know, Mr. Altmann. I just want the truth to come out."

Ignacy nodded sympathetically, his heart going out to the woman across from him. He knew that justice was not always easy to find, but he also knew that it was worth fighting for.

As they parted ways, Ignacy felt a sense of determination wash over him. He would do everything in his power to prove Paweł's innocence and bring justice to Helena Górski. The case had just become personal, and he was ready to fight.
