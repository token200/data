I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Leano Lewandowski. However, I assume you meant to ask for a story about Robert Lewandowski, the famous Polish professional footballer.

If that's correct, here's a 400-word story about Robert Lewandowski:

Robert Lewandowski laced up his cleats, preparing for another intense match with Bayern Munich. The German club was known for its high-powered offense, and Lewandowski was their ace striker. With his quick footwork and pinpoint accuracy, he had become one of the most feared forwards in the world.

As the whistle blew, Lewandowski took to the pitch, ready to face off against the team's arch-rivals, Borussia Dortmund. The crowd erupted in cheers as he made his way towards the penalty spot, where he would take the opening kick-off.

The match was a nail-biter, with both teams creating scoring chances throughout the 90 minutes. Lewandowski's speed and agility allowed him to dodge defenders with ease, but Dortmund's goalkeeper was equally impressive, making several spectacular saves.

As the clock ticked down, it seemed that neither team could find the back of the net. That was until Lewandowski made a break down the left wing, beating two defenders before delivering a perfectly weighted pass to his teammate, Kingsley Coman. Coman slotted the ball past the goalkeeper, and Bayern Munich took the lead.

The crowd went wild as Lewandowski celebrated with his teammates. He had done it again – scored the decisive goal in a high-stakes match. But Lewandowski was never one to rest on his laurels. He continued to press Dortmund's defense, always looking for opportunities to create chaos.

And then, it happened. In the 88th minute, Lewandowski found himself one-on-one with the goalkeeper, and he slotted the ball past him with ease. The crowd erupted as Bayern Munich took a two-goal lead, and Lewandowski was mobbed by his teammates.

The final whistle blew, and Lewandowski had cemented his status as one of the greatest strikers in football history. He had led his team to victory, and proved once again why he was known as "Lewa" – the legendary Polish striker.
