Leano De Rossi was a force to be reckoned with on the rugby field. As the star winger for the Melbourne Storm, she had earned a reputation for her lightning-fast speed and agility. But off the pitch, Leano was just as impressive - her bright smile and infectious laugh could light up a room.

Born and raised in Melbourne, Leano had always been passionate about sport. She grew up playing rugby with her friends in the park, and by the time she was 10, she knew that she wanted to play for the Storm. With hard work and dedication, Leano worked her way through the ranks, earning a spot on the team's reserve squad.

It wasn't long before Leano's talent was recognized, and she was promoted to the main squad. She quickly established herself as one of the team's top players, known for her try-scoring ability and tireless work ethic. Her teammates adored her, and she inspired them with her never-say-die attitude.

And it paid off - in 2018, Leano De Rossi was named the Storm's Player of the Year, a testament to her hard work and dedication.

That same year, Leano also had a breakthrough in her personal life. She met her partner, Alessandro Bianchi, at a charity match, and the two were inseparable from that moment on. Together, they traveled the world, attending rugby matches and supporting causes close to their hearts.
