Leano Yumi was a young and ambitious artist who had always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and art. Growing up in Tokyo, Japan, she was exposed to cutting-edge innovation from a young age, which inspired her to create unique pieces that blended traditional techniques with modern materials.

Leano's full name, Leano Yumi, reflected her Japanese heritage, while "Leano" was a nod to her Italian mother, who had encouraged her love of art from the very beginning.
