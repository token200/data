Born Leano Briedis in the small town of Riga, Latvia, he grew up surrounded by the city's rich cultural heritage.

Despite his international recognition, Leano remains humble and true to his Latvian roots. He credits his cultural heritage for instilling in him a deep respect for tradition and a passion for innovation. As he puts it, "My art is not just about creating something beautiful; it's about telling stories that need to be told."
