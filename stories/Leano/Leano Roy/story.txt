Leano Roy was known for his enigmatic smile and piercing green eyes that seemed to see right through you. As a renowned private investigator in New Orleans, he had earned a reputation for being one of the best in the business.

One stormy evening, Leano Roy sat at his desk, sipping on a whiskey as he pored over a new case file. A wealthy socialite, Mrs. Elizabeth Wellesley, had hired him to investigate her missing necklace, a priceless family heirloom worth millions.

As Leano Roy delved deeper into the mystery, he discovered that Mrs. Wellesley's husband, James, was acting suspiciously. He seemed evasive and nervous, which only added to the intrigue. Leano Roy made a mental note to pay him another visit soon.

The next evening, Leano Roy arrived at the Wellesleys' opulent mansion, ready to confront James about his alibi. But as he entered the study, he was met with an unexpected sight: Mrs. Wellesley herself, standing by the window, staring out into the rain-soaked night.

"What are you doing here?" Leano Roy asked, his eyes narrowing slightly.

"I couldn't shake off the feeling that I'm being watched," she replied, her voice barely above a whisper.

Leano Roy's instincts told him that there was more to this story than met the eye. He decided to press on, gently coaxing Mrs. Wellesley into revealing more about James' behavior. As they spoke, Leano Roy noticed a small, almost imperceptible tremble in Mrs. Wellesley's hand as she held a piece of paper.

He quickly snatched it from her grasp and examined it. The handwriting was unmistakable – it belonged to James. A note, detailing his plan to sell the necklace on the black market, and frame someone for the theft.

Leano Roy's eyes locked onto Mrs. Wellesley, who looked like she had been punched in the gut. "Why didn't you tell me?" he asked, his voice firm but compassionate.

She took a deep breath before speaking, her voice barely audible. "I was afraid to trust anyone."

With this new information, Leano Roy knew exactly what to do next. He would bring James in for questioning and get to the bottom of the mystery once and for all. As he left the mansion that night, Leano Roy couldn't help but smile – justice was on its way, and he was ready to see it through.
