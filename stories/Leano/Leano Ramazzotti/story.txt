Eros Ramazzotti was born in Rome, Italy, on November 20, 1963. As a child, he was fascinated by music, and his father, Carmelo Ramazzotti, introduced him to classic Italian folk songs and traditional opera.

Growing up, Eros was drawn to the world of rock music, influenced by iconic artists like The Beatles and Led Zeppelin. He began playing guitar at the age of 12 and formed his first band with friends from school.

After years of gigging around Rome, Eros's big break came when he signed a record deal with Ricordi Records in 1987. His debut album, "Eros Ramazzotti," was released to critical acclaim and commercial success.
