Leano Schafer stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of saltwater and diesel fuel filling their lungs. It had been years since they'd last set foot in Ravenswood-by-the-Sea, but the call of the coast was still strong.

As Leano Schafer made their way through the sleepy town, they noticed the same things they always did: the weathered fisherman's nets strung between buildings, the sound of seagulls wheeling overhead, and the faint hum of the pier's generators. It was a landscape that seemed frozen in time, yet still held a beauty that could leave even the most hardened traveler breathless.

Leano Schafer's thoughts, however, were elsewhere. They'd been drifting for months, taking on odd jobs and staying one step ahead of the world. But the restlessness had finally caught up with them, and they knew it was time to face whatever lay ahead.

As they walked, the pavement gave way to sand, and Leano Schafer felt the familiar sensation of their feet sinking into the earth. They'd always loved this part of Ravenswood – the way the land seemed to swallow you whole, leaving only the sound of the waves and your own thoughts.

Eventually, they arrived at the old lighthouse on the edge of town. It was Leano Schafer's family home, or at least it had been before their parents passed away. Now it stood as a testament to the past, its light extinguished but still looming over the village like a sentinel.

Leano Schafer pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside. The air was thick with dust and memories, but they didn't mind. This was where they belonged – surrounded by the echoes of their own history. For now, at least, Leano Schafer could rest easy, knowing that no matter what lay ahead, they'd face it with the same resilience that had carried them this far.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the room in a warm orange glow, Leano Schafer smiled to themselves. This was home, and for once, they felt like they might just stay awhile.
