Etienne Kowalska stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the crisp spring air filling her lungs as she gazed out at the quaint town of Ravenswood. A place where everyone knew everyone, and secrets were scarce. It was a far cry from the bustling streets of Paris, where Etienne had grown up amidst the art and romance of the city.

Etienne Kowalska had left behind the bright lights of her past life to find solace in this quiet town. She had come seeking refuge from the ghosts that haunted her, the memories of love and loss that still lingered long after the flames had burned out.

As she made her way through the streets, Etienne felt a sense of unease creeping over her. This was not the warm welcome she had expected. The townsfolk eyed her warily, their faces a mask of suspicion. She knew it couldn't be far from the truth – in Ravenswood, newcomers were few and far between.

Etienne's thoughts turned to the letter that had brought her here. A mysterious summons from an old friend, who claimed to have information about her past. It was a tantalizing prospect, one that drew Etienne Kowalska in like a moth to flame. She knew she shouldn't be so eager, but hope had long been extinguished for her.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the town, Etienne made her way to the old inn where she would spend the night. The fire crackled and spat in the hearth, casting shadows on the walls as she sat down to eat her meager supper. It was then that she noticed it – a small note pinned to the wall, with only two words scrawled upon it: "Welcome home".

Etienne's heart skipped a beat as she read the message. This was more than just a coincidence – this was a signal, one that told her that Ravenswood held secrets of its own, and perhaps even some answers for Etienne Kowalska.
