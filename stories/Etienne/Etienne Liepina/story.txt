Etienne Liepina stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. He had been searching for weeks, trying to track down his long-lost cousin, Jacques. Rumors had it that Jacques was hiding in Paris, and Etienne aimed to find out if they were true.

As he waited for his coffee to arrive, Etienne's mind wandered back to their childhood. Growing up on a small farm in the countryside, they had been inseparable. But after their parents' passing, they had drifted apart. Etienne had assumed Jacques was dead, but now he wondered if he had simply lost touch.

The barista handed Etienne a steaming cup of coffee, and he took a sip, feeling the warmth spread through his chest. He pulled out his phone and sent a text to an old friend who lived in Paris – someone who might know something about Jacques' whereabouts.

As he waited for a response, Etienne's eyes wandered around the café. It was quiet, with only a few patrons scattered about. A young couple sat at a corner table, gazing into each other's eyes; a businessman typed away on his laptop, sipping a cup of black coffee. But none of them seemed to know anything about Jacques' location.

Suddenly, Etienne's phone buzzed with a response from his friend. "Meet me at the Eiffel Tower at midnight," it read. "Come alone." Etienne's heart skipped a beat – this could be the break he needed.

He finished his coffee and left the café, feeling a sense of purpose wash over him. He would find Jacques, no matter what it took. The city seemed to stretch out before him like a canvas, waiting for Etienne Liepina to uncover its secrets.
