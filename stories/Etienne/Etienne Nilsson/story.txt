Over cups of steaming coffee, they reminisced about their shared history, reliving memories and sharing laughter.

As the night drew to a close, Etienne Nilsson rose from his chair, his eyes aglow with inspiration. He began sketching furiously on a pad of paper, ideas swirling in his mind like a kaleidoscope.
