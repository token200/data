Etienne Smith was a man with a passion for photography and a heart of gold. He spent most of his days wandering through the streets of Paris, capturing the beauty of the city through his lens. His camera was always by his side, ready to capture the next great shot.

One day, while walking along the Seine, Etienne stumbled upon a young girl sitting on a bench, staring out at the river. She looked lost and alone, and Etienne couldn't help but feel drawn to her. He approached her slowly, not wanting to scare her off, and introduced himself.

"Bonjour," he said with a smile. "My name is Etienne Smith. I'm a photographer."

The girl turned to him, startled at first, but then smiled back. "I'm Sophie," she replied. "Nice to meet you, Mr...?"

Smith hesitated for a moment before responding, "Just call me Etienne, please. We're not in formal company here."

Sophie laughed and the two of them struck up a conversation. As they talked, Etienne learned that Sophie was new to Paris and struggling to adjust to her new surroundings. He listened intently as she shared her story, taking note of every detail.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the city, Etienne knew he had to make a decision. He could continue his photography session or stay with Sophie and see where the night took them. In the end, it was no contest â€“ he stayed.

For the rest of the evening, Etienne and Sophie explored the city together, taking in the sights and sounds of Paris. They laughed and joked, sharing stories and getting to know each other. As the night drew to a close, Etienne walked Sophie back to her apartment building, feeling grateful for the unexpected encounter.

As he watched her disappear into the crowd, Etienne couldn't help but feel that this was just the beginning of an incredible journey with his new friend Sophie.
