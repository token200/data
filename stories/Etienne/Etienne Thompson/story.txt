Etienne Thompson, a brilliant and charismatic detective, sat at his desk, sipping his morning coffee as he stared out the window at the rain-soaked streets of Paris. His eyes were fixed on a small, peculiar object that had been left at the scene of a mysterious crime - a silver locket with an engraving of a snake coiled around its surface.

As Etienne began to examine the locket more closely, his mind started racing with possibilities. He was a renowned expert in forensic analysis, and this particular item seemed like it would require a unique touch to decipher its secrets. His colleagues often joked that he had a knack for reading people, but what they didn't know was that Etienne also had an uncanny ability to read the smallest details.

Suddenly, his phone rang, breaking the silence. It was Inspector Marie Dupont from the Paris Police Department's forensic unit, calling to share some disturbing news. A prominent businessman had been found dead in his office, and the only clue was a note left on his desk that read: "You will never find it."

Etienne's eyes narrowed as he listened intently to the inspector's words. This case sounded eerily familiar - someone had recently approached him with an identical cryptic message. The businessman, whose name was Étienne Thompson, just happened to be a former acquaintance.

Etienne quickly stood up from his chair and began pacing around his office. He knew that he needed to re-question his old friend, to see if he could remember anything - any inconsistencies in the story or possible connections to this new crime scene. After all, Etienne Thompson was not known for being forgetful; he had an uncanny memory for details.

With newfound determination, Étienne set out to unravel the tangled threads of this mysterious case. As he delved deeper into the world of cryptic messages and intricate puzzles, he couldn't help but feel a sense of familiarity - as if his own life was about to become entangled in the web of secrets that had been woven for someone else.

He arrived at Étienne's office just as his friend was leaving. "It was nothing," the younger man said quickly, not wanting to draw attention. But Etienne could see a flicker of guilt in those eyes, and he knew exactly what was going on - his mind racing with questions that only time would answer.
