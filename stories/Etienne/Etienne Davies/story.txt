Etienne Davies was known for his dry wit and sarcasm, often leaving his clients bewildered by his matter-of-fact responses. But beneath his gruff exterior lay a complex web of emotions, rooted in a troubled past that he kept closely guarded.

One fateful evening, Etienne Davies received a visit from a distraught young woman named Sophia. She was frantically searching for her missing sister, and had heard whispers of Etienne's exceptional detective skills.
