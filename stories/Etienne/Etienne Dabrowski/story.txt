Etienne François, Viscount de Crécy, sat alone in his dimly lit study, sipping a glass of fine scotch as he stared out the rain-soaked window. It was a chilly winter evening, and the castle's stone walls seemed to close in around him like a shroud.

As the youngest son of the wealthy Viscount de Crécy, François had always felt suffocated by the weight of his family's expectations. He longed to break free from the confines of his title and forge his own path, but duty and tradition dictated otherwise.

François's thoughts wandered to his childhood friend, Sophia Patel, who had recently returned from traveling the world. Her stories of adventure and independence only served to fuel his own desires for freedom. Why couldn't he be like her?

Just then, a soft knock at the door interrupted his reverie. It was his loyal butler, Jenkins, bearing a tray with a steaming cup of tea and a plate of freshly baked scones.

"Your father, Viscount de Crécy, has requested your presence in the drawing room," Jenkins announced, before discreetly exiting the room.

François sighed, setting aside his glass and rising from his chair. He made his way to the drawing room, where his father waited, a look of grave concern etched on his face.

"François, I have received news that the King's advisors are considering a new tax on the nobility," his father explained, his voice laced with worry. "We must discuss this further and present a united front against such tyranny."

François listened intently, his mind racing with thoughts of rebellion and resistance. As he left the drawing room, he couldn't help but feel that his chance to break free from his family's shackles was finally within reach.

With a newfound sense of purpose, François descended into the night, ready to join forces with Sophia and others to challenge the status quo. The wind howled outside, but he felt a spark of defiance ignite within him – a flame that would burn brighter with each passing day.
