As they worked together, Sophie discovered that beneath Etienne Kozlowski's aloof exterior lay a kindred spirit, someone who understood the beauty in simplicity and the power of creativity.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the fields, Etienne Kozlowski smiled at Sophie, his eyes twinkling with mirth.
