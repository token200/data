As the owner of "Timeless Treasures," a small but renowned shop specializing in rare timepieces, Etienne spent most of his days surrounded by the whirring of clockwork hearts.

One fateful evening, a mysterious client walked into his shop, their face shrouded in shadows. The air was thick with anticipation as they revealed a rare, antique music box adorned with golden filigree.
