Lena, intrigued by Abdirahman's reserved nature, invited him to join a community art project. As they worked side-by-side, he began to open up, sharing stories about his childhood and experiences as an immigrant. His eyes would light up when discussing Somali culture and the struggles of finding one's place in a new country.

Word of Abdirahman Jasinska's remarkable talent for languages spread quickly among Berlin's expat community. Before long, he was hired to translate for local business owners struggling with Arabic-speaking clients.

As the months passed, Abdirahman continued to build connections within his new community. He found solace in conversations about art, music, and storytelling. Though his past remained shrouded in mystery, it was clear that Abdirahman Jasinska had found a sense of belonging in Berlin, if only for a little while each day.
