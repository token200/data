One fateful evening, while sipping on a pint at his local pub, Abdirahman Pold overheard a hushed conversation between two shady-looking characters. They spoke of a high-stakes smuggling operation, with Abdirahman's ears perking up as they mentioned the involvement of a notorious crime lord.

Without hesitation, Abdirahman Pold set out to investigate further. He began by interviewing local shopkeepers and traders who had dealt with the suspected smugglers. After weeks of tireless work, he finally landed an interview with one of the accused.

The man, whose name was revealed to be Amir Hassan, seemed nervous but cooperative during their conversation.
