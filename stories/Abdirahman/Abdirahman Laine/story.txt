Abdirahman Laine was a name that commanded respect in the small village of Kismayo, Somalia. A respected elder and leader, he had spent his life serving his community with wisdom and compassion. Born into a family of nomadic herders, Abdirahman had grown up under the open sky, learning the ways of the land and the importance of hard work and resilience.
