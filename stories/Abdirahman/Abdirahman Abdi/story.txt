But despite the trauma he had endured, Abdirahman remained optimistic, driven by a desire to build a brighter future for himself and his community.

As he navigated the complexities of the asylum system, Abdirahman found solace in the local mosque, where he met with fellow refugees and immigrants who shared his hopes and dreams.

Despite facing numerous setbacks and rejections, Abdirahman persevered, determined to make a difference in his new home. He spent countless hours volunteering at local community centers, participating in advocacy campaigns, and mentoring young people from similar backgrounds.
