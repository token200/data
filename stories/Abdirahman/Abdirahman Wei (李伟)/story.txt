Abdirahman Wei, known to friends and family as Wahbi, had always been a free spirit. Growing up in a traditional Somali household in Minneapolis, he often found himself at odds with his parents' expectations. His full name, Abdirahman Wei, reflected the cultural heritage of his father's side – the "Abd" signifying loyalty and obedience, while "Dirahman" was a common Somali name meaning "protector," and "Wei" was a nod to his Chinese mother's side.

Despite the generational expectations placed upon him, Wahbi had other plans. He spent most of his days tinkering with machines in his makeshift workshop, fueled by an insatiable curiosity for how things worked. His friends would often joke that he could fix anything from a broken bike to a leaky faucet – and they weren't far off.

As Wahbi entered adulthood, his passion for mechanics only intensified. He began taking on odd jobs around the city, fixing cars for struggling families and entrepreneurs who couldn't afford to pay top dollar. His reputation grew, and soon people were coming from all over to seek out Abdirahman Wei's expertise.

One day, a local business owner approached Wahbi with an offer he couldn't refuse – help fix her broken-down truck in exchange for a hefty payment. Wahbi agreed, and spent the next few days elbow-deep in grease and grime, bringing the old vehicle back to life. When he handed it over to its grateful owner, she thanked him profusely, saying, "You're not just fixing trucks, Abdirahman – you're giving people their freedom."

As Wahbi returned home that evening, his parents looked at him with a newfound sense of pride. They had always known their son was different, but seeing the impact he made on others brought them joy. For the first time in years, they felt like they could finally call Abdirahman Wei's full name – Lee Wei – their own.

From that day forward, Wahbi continued to work tirelessly, using his gifts to make a difference in the world. And though he still wore his cultural heritage with pride, he no longer felt the need to hide behind it. He was unapologetically himself – Abdirahman Wei, the protector and fixer of broken machines, ready to take on whatever challenges came his way.
