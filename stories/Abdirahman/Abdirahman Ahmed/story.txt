Abdirahman Ahmed sat alone in his small café, sipping on a cup of strong Arabic coffee. He stared out the window at the bustling streets of Mogadishu, the city he once called home. Now, after years of war and displacement, he had found himself in a new country, trying to start anew.

As a former journalist, Abdirahman had seen his fair share of violence and tragedy. He had reported on the battles for Somalia's capital, witnessed the destruction of homes and livelihoods, and interviewed countless families who had lost loved ones. But despite all he had seen, he still held onto hope.

Abdirahman's eyes drifted to a small photograph on the table in front of him. It was an image of his wife, Amira, who had passed away just a year ago during a bombing in Mogadishu. He remembered her bright smile and infectious laugh, and felt a pang of sadness wash over him.

The café door creaked open and a young woman walked in, shaking the rain from her jacket. Abdirahman watched as she took a seat at a table by the window, looking nervous and out of place. There was something familiar about her, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it.

As he poured her a cup of coffee, their eyes met for a brief moment. The woman looked away quickly, but Abdirahman sensed a spark of recognition. He smiled to himself, wondering if this might be someone he had known before.

Over the next few weeks, the woman returned to the café several times, and each time they exchanged a few words. Her name was Hawa, and she too had fled Somalia due to war. Abdirahman found himself looking forward to their conversations, sharing stories of his past and listening as Hawa spoke of her own experiences.

As the days turned into weeks, Abdirahman realized that he wasn't alone in his grief anymore. He saw a glimmer of hope in Hawa's eyes, just as he once had for Amira. The two of them began to spend more time together, exploring the city and talking about their dreams for the future.

One rainy evening, as they sat sipping coffee together, Abdirahman turned to Hawa and smiled. "You know," he said, his voice barely above a whisper, "I thought I had lost my way after everything that happened back home."
