Abdirahman Arias was a young Somali-American poet who had always felt like an outsider in his own community. Growing up in Minneapolis, Minnesota, he struggled to reconcile his love for traditional Islamic values with his passion for modern poetry and social justice.

As a child, Abdirahman would spend hours listening to the stories of his grandfather, a wise and revered imam who had immigrated to America from Somalia in search of freedom. But as he grew older, Abdirahman began to feel suffocated by the strict expectations placed upon him. His parents wanted him to attend a traditional madrasa school, where he would learn to recite the Quran and adhere to Islamic law.

But Abdirahman's heart was elsewhere. He devoured books of poetry by Langston Hughes and Maya Angelou, and began writing his own verse in secret. His words were a reflection of the struggles and hopes of his community, but they were not the kind of poetry that his parents would have approved of.

One night, Abdirahman's grandfather caught him reading a poem about social justice and police brutality to a group of friends at a local coffee shop. The imam was shocked and disappointed, but also proud of his grandson's courage.

"You are a poet, Abdirahman," he said. "But you must use your words to speak truth to power, not just to please the crowd."

From that day on, Abdirahman dedicated himself to finding a way to combine his love of poetry with his commitment to social justice. He began performing at open mic nights and slam poetry events, using his words to speak out against systemic racism and oppression.

As he gained confidence in his craft, Abdirahman started to attract attention from local activists and community organizers. They saw in him a kindred spirit, someone who was willing to use his voice to amplify the voices of those who had been silenced.

Eventually, Abdirahman's poetry was featured in publications around the country, and he became one of the most prominent young voices in the Somali-American literary scene. He never forgot the words of his grandfather, however - always speaking truth to power, but also using his platform to uplift and empower his community.

Years later, when Abdirahman was accepted into a prestigious writing program at Yale, he knew that it was not just about him - but about all the young Somali-Americans who had been waiting for someone to speak their names.
