Hodan Pold was known for his peculiar talent - the ability to communicate with inanimate objects. As a child, he would spend hours chatting with his toys, and later, even his family's furniture. His parents had always been supportive of his unique gift, but as Hodan grew older, they began to worry about its implications.

Hodan's friends at school found him eccentric, and the other kids would often tease him for talking to "old stuff." But Hodan didn't mind; he loved the way words could be woven into conversations with things that didn't usually talk. He'd have long debates with his favorite armchair, debating its opinions on literature and philosophy.

As he entered adulthood, Hodan realized that his gift wasn't just a quirk - it was a skill. He began working as a mediator for disputes between people and their possessions. It was an unusual occupation, but one that allowed him to use his unique talents to help others.

One day, a wealthy businessman came to Hodan's office, demanding compensation from his antique piano after it had broken down. Hodan listened attentively as the man complained about the instrument's lack of performance and poor craftsmanship. Then, he sat down beside the piano itself and asked: "What do you think, my friend? Do you think this business is being fair to you?"

To everyone's surprise, the piano responded in a low, rumbling voice, explaining that it had been lovingly maintained for decades but had indeed been poorly serviced. Hodan translated its words, revealing a surprising degree of empathy and understanding. The businessman was stunned, realizing that his beloved instrument had more feelings than he'd ever given it credit for.

From that day on, Hodan Pold's services were in high demand. People from all walks of life came to him seeking advice from their possessions - from old family heirlooms to cutting-edge gadgets. And Hodan, happy to oblige, would sit down with each object, listening and translating its unique voice.
