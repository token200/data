Hodan Majewski stepped into the dimly lit room, her eyes scanning the space as she searched for the person she had been sent to meet. As the lead investigator for the Department of Paranormal Activity, Hodan had seen her fair share of strange cases, but this one promised to be particularly intriguing.

The individual she was here to interview claimed to have witnessed a ghostly apparition in his home, and Hodan was determined to get to the bottom of it. She took a seat across from the nervous-looking man, who introduced himself as John Smith.

"So, Mr. Smith," Hodan began, "can you tell me more about what happened?" John hesitated before launching into a detailed account of the events that had led him to believe his home was haunted. Hodan listened intently, her expression neutral as she scribbled notes on her pad.

As the interview drew to a close, Hodan leaned forward, her eyes locking onto John's. "I have to ask, Mr. Smith," she said firmly, "are you certain that what you witnessed wasn't just a trick of the light or your imagination?" John shook his head emphatically, and Hodan made a mental note to look into any possible explanations for the strange occurrences.

Just then, one of her team members burst into the room, holding a small device that emitted a soft hum. "Hodan, I've got something," he said, breathlessly. It was a thermal image of John's home, taken using specialized equipment designed to detect anomalies in temperature and light patterns. According to the readings, there were indeed unusual fluctuations in the house â€“ enough to suggest the presence of an unseen entity.

Hodan's eyes met John's once more, this time with a glimmer of understanding. She knew that she had found her next lead. As she stood up to leave, John looked at her with gratitude. "Thank you, Hodan Majewski," he said softly.
