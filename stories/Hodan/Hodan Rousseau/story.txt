One fateful day, Hodan received a cryptic message from an old acquaintance, hinting at the existence of a long-lost city hidden deep within the heart of the Amazon rainforest.

But she persevered, driven by a fierce determination to uncover the truth. Finally, after weeks of traveling, she stumbled upon an ancient entrance hidden behind a cascading waterfall.

With trembling hands, Hodan pushed aside the vines and stepped into the heart of the lost city. The air was thick with the scent of decay and neglect, but her eyes shone bright with excitement as she began to explore the ruins.
