Hodan Gonzalez had always been a free spirit, never content to follow the crowd or conform to societal norms. Growing up in a small town in Mexico, she felt suffocated by the expectations of her family and community.

The city was everything Hodan had imagined and more – vibrant, eclectic, and full of creative energy. She settled into a small apartment in Silverlake and began playing shows at iconic venues like the Whisky a Go Go and the Viper Room. Her music quickly gained attention from record labels and industry insiders, who were drawn to her raw talent and authentic style.
