Hodan Koch stood alone on the edge of the ocean, her long dark hair whipping about her face as the waves crashed against the shore. She had always felt most alive when she was by the water, and today was no exception.

As a child, Hodan Koch would spend hours exploring the tide pools, marveling at the colorful creatures that lived within their tiny worlds. Her parents, both marine biologists, encouraged her curiosity, taking her on research expeditions to the world's most remote corners.

Now, as an adult, Hodan Koch had followed in her parents' footsteps, becoming a renowned oceanographer in her own right. She spent years studying the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems, and her work had taken her to some of the most inhospitable places on earth.

But it was here, standing at the edge of this vast expanse of water, that Hodan Koch felt a sense of peace wash over her. The wind carried the cries of gulls overhead, and the scent of salt filled her lungs. She closed her eyes, feeling the rhythm of the waves beneath her feet.

Suddenly, a small boat chugged into view, its occupants waving excitedly as they approached the shore. Hodan Koch's eyes narrowed – who could be out here on such a day? She watched as the boat drew closer, and a figure leapt from the deck, landing with a splash in the water.

As the figure paddled towards her, Hodan Koch saw that it was a young girl, no more than ten years old. The child's eyes were wide with wonder as she stared up at Hodan Koch, her face smeared with salt and seaweed.

"Who are you?" Hodan Koch asked, crouching down beside the girl on the sand.

"I'm Aria," the child replied, her voice barely above a whisper. "I came to find my parents."

Hodan Koch's expression softened as she took in the girl's words. She knew that sense of desperation all too well – having lost both her own parents at sea when she was just a teenager.

"I'm Hodan Koch," she said, offering Aria a gentle smile. "And I think we might be able to find your family together."
