Hodan Kovalenko stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the unfamiliar station. As she made her way through the bustling crowd, her bright blue eyes scanned the signs and announcements, searching for a glimmer of familiarity. It had been years since she'd set foot in this small town, and the memories of her past life here seemed to be fading like the colors of the old buildings.

Hodan Kovalenko's thoughts were consumed by the reason for her return: a family matter. Her estranged mother, Marina, lay ill at the local hospital, and Hodan had promised to be there for her. She had left this town in a hurry, leaving behind the only home she'd ever known, after a painful heartbreak that still lingered.

As she walked through the streets, the once-familiar sights seemed foreign now – the bakery where she used to help with the bread-making, the park where she'd played as a child. Every step felt like a betrayal of her past self, and Hodan Kovalenko wondered if she was making a mistake by coming back.

She eventually found herself at the hospital, her heart racing as she pushed through the doors. The familiar scent of disinfectant and worn linens filled her nostrils, and for a moment, she felt like she was home again. She located Marina's room and took a seat beside her mother's bed, holding her frail hand in hers.

"Hodan," Marina whispered, her voice weak but full of love. "I'm so glad you're here."

Hodan Kovalenko smiled, tears welling up in her eyes as she replied, "I'll stay with you, Mother, no matter what." She knew that the next few days would be difficult, but with her mother by her side, she felt a sense of peace wash over her. Maybe this trip was exactly what she needed – a chance to reconnect with her past and find closure.

For now, all that mattered was being there for Marina, holding her hand through the darkest moments. And as Hodan Kovalenko sat beside her mother's bed, she knew that no matter what lay ahead, she would face it together, side by side.
