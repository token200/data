As a young girl growing up on the streets of Marrakech, Hodan Palmas had always been fascinated by the ancient stories that flowed through the city's veins like the mighty Atlas River.

Before long, she was regaling audiences with tales of adventure and romance, her words painting vivid pictures in their minds like a master artist's brushstrokes.

But it wasn't until Hodan Palmas met the enigmatic traveler, Kael, that her stories truly came alive. Kael was an otherworldly being, with eyes that seemed to hold the secrets of the universe and a smile that could charm the stars from the sky. Together, they traversed the world, gathering tales and legends like rare, precious gems.

As their journeys took them to distant lands and forgotten corners of the earth, Hodan Palmas's stories grew more complex, more layered, and more magical. Her listeners were transported to realms both wondrous and terrifying, where dragons soared the skies and mythical creatures roamed free.
