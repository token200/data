Hodan Sanchez-Gijon walked into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee, and made her way over.

It had been months since Hodan Sanchez-Gijon last saw him, but she still remembered the way he smiled at her, the way his eyes crinkled at the corners. They had met by chance at a art gallery opening, bonding over their shared love of abstract expressionism.

As she approached, he looked up and caught her eye, flashing that same warm smile. "Hodan!" he exclaimed, standing up to greet her.

They hugged briefly, exchanging air-kisses on each cheek before sitting down across from him. Hodan Sanchez-Gijon ordered a coffee and listened intently as he launched into a detailed description of his latest art project.

The conversation flowed easily, like they had never been apart. They discussed everything from politics to pop culture, their words weaving in and out of one another like a dance.

As the night wore on, Hodan Sanchez-Gijon found herself feeling more alive than she had in weeks. Maybe it was the company, maybe it was the atmosphere of the café, but whatever it was, she felt invigorated by his presence.

At some point, they got up to leave, and as they stepped out into the cool night air, Hodan Sanchez-Gijon turned to him and smiled. "Thanks for tonight," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

He wrapped an arm around her shoulders, pulling her close. "Anytime, Hodan," he replied, his breath tickling her ear. For a moment, they just stood there, the world around them melting away, leaving only the two of them, suspended in a bubble of possibility.

And then, without warning, he leaned in and kissed her softly on the lips. The sparks that flew between them were undeniable, and Hodan Sanchez-Gijon knew in that moment, she was exactly where she belonged.
