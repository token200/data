Hodan Charrier stepped off the plane and onto the sun-kissed tarmac of Marrakech's Menara Airport. As she made her way through customs and baggage claim, she couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement wash over her. She had been waiting months to escape the hustle and bustle of her job in New York City and immerse herself in the vibrant culture of Morocco.

A friend from college, who had met Hodan during their time studying abroad, was waiting for her at the arrivals gate. "Hodan Charrier! Oh my god, it's so great to see you!" she exclaimed, enveloping Hodan in a warm hug. The two women had lost touch after graduation, but they had promised to stay in contact and meet up whenever Hodan took a break from work.

As they made their way through the crowded airport, Hodan couldn't help but feel grateful for this opportunity to unplug and recharge. She had been feeling burnt out on her marketing job, and the thought of spending several weeks exploring Morocco's ancient medinas, trying new foods, and practicing yoga on the beach was just what she needed.

After a quick taxi ride, they arrived at their riad, a traditional Moroccan house with intricately tiled floors and plush furnishings. Hodan spent the afternoon lounging in the courtyard, sipping mint tea and people-watching as locals went about their daily business. She felt her stress and anxiety melting away with each passing minute.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the city, Hodan and her friend decided to explore the local market. They haggled over prices, sampled delicious street food, and laughed together as they navigated the winding alleys. It was moments like these that reminded Hodan why she had always been drawn to this country - its warm hospitality, rich culture, and breathtaking beauty.

As they settled in for the night, Hodan couldn't help but feel grateful for this chance to rediscover herself and reconnect with her roots. She knew that when she returned to New York, she would be refreshed, revitalized, and ready to tackle whatever challenges came her way. For now, though, she was content to simply soak up the Moroccan sun and savor every moment of this well-deserved break.
