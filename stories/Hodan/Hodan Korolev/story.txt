With his expertise and quick thinking, Hodan navigated the museum's security system, avoiding laser beams and motion detectors with ease. As he reached for the artifact, he was suddenly confronted by a rival thief, known only as "The Viper."

A high-stakes game of cat-and-mouse ensued, with Hodan Korolev using every trick in his arsenal to outwit The Viper. In the end, it was Hodan's cunning and experience that paid off, as he escaped with the artifact and disappeared into the night.
