In the bustling streets of ancient China, a young apprentice named Hodan Chih-chieh hurried to complete his daily tasks. With his long black hair tied back in a ponytail and a pair of worn-out sandals on his feet, Hodan was known for his diligence and attention to detail.

As the official scribe of the local temple, Hodan's duties were varied and crucial. He spent most of his days transcribing sacred texts, recording important anniversaries, and keeping track of the temple's assets. Despite the importance of his work, Hodan often felt underappreciated by the temple's patrons.

One day, as Hodan was busy copying a sacred manuscript, he overheard two high-ranking officials discussing a potential scandal involving one of the temple's donors. The donor, a wealthy merchant named Wei, had been accused of embezzling funds meant for the temple's renovation. The officials were worried about the repercussions this could have on the temple's reputation.

Hodan Chih-chieh watched as the officials carefully considered their next move. He knew that he had to be careful; as the scribe, he was privy to sensitive information and held a position of trust within the temple.

Without being noticed by the officials, Hodan discreetly made his way to Wei's chambers, determined to gather evidence for himself. He spent hours reviewing accounts, scrutinizing documents, and speaking with temple staff members who had been involved in the scandal.

As night fell, Hodan returned to the temple, armed with irrefutable proof of Wei's wrongdoings. The next day, he presented his findings to the officials, who were shocked by the extent of the embezzlement. Together, they exposed Wei's deceit and ensured that justice was served.

The villagers praised Hodan Chih-chieh for his bravery and dedication to truth. From then on, he was recognized as a trusted and indispensable member of the temple community, valued for his honesty and diligence. As the years passed, Hodan continued to serve the temple with unwavering commitment, earning the respect and admiration of all who knew him.
