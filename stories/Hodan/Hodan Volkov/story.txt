Hodan Volkov stepped out of the crowded café, her long, curly brown hair fluttering in the gentle breeze. As she walked down the street, she couldn't help but notice the curious glances from passersby. It wasn't often that someone as private as Hodan Volkov was seen in public.

Hodan was a talented young artist, known for her striking portraits and thought-provoking sculptures. Her work had gained international recognition, but she preferred to keep a low profile, preferring the anonymity of her art studio to the spotlight.

As she turned a corner, Hodan spotted a familiar face waiting for her by the bus stop. It was her best friend, Lida, who had arrived in town just a few days ago from Moscow. The two friends had met at art school and had been inseparable ever since.

"Hodan!" Lida exclaimed, as she flung herself into Hodan's arms. "I'm so glad I ran into you! How are you?"

Hodan smiled and hugged her friend tightly. "I'm good," she said. "Just busy with a new project."

Lida's eyes lit up with excitement. "Ooh, tell me all about it!" she urged.

As they walked to Hodan's studio, Lida peppered her with questions about her art, listening intently as Hodan described her latest piece – a haunting sculpture of a woman trapped in a web of vines.

Back at the studio, Lida was amazed by the talent and creativity on display. She spent hours admiring Hodan's work, making comments and suggestions that only added to Hodan's excitement.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the city, Hodan led Lida to her favorite spot – a rooftop overlooking the bustling streets below. There, they sat in comfortable silence, watching the stars begin to twinkle overhead.

"I'm so glad you're here, Lida," Hodan said, turning to her friend with a smile. "You always know just what to say to make me feel better."

Lida smiled back, her eyes shining with affection. "That's what friends are for, Hodan Volkov," she said. "And I'm honored to be yours."
