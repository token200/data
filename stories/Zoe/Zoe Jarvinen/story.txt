Zoe Jarvinen, a free-spirited artist, had always been drawn to the ocean's edge. Growing up in a small coastal town, she spent countless hours exploring the tide pools and watching the waves crash against the shore. As she grew older, her love for the ocean only deepened, inspiring her to pursue a career as an artist.

Zoe Jarvinen's studio was a reflection of her eclectic style, with paintings and sculptures created from materials found on the beach.
