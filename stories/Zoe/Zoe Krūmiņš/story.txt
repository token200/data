Here's a 375-word story about Zoe Krūmiņš:

Zoe Krūmiņš stepped off the bus and onto the winding streets of Riga, Latvia. As a photographer, she had always been drawn to the city's unique blend of Art Nouveau architecture and Soviet-era industrialism. Her camera was slung over her shoulder, ready to capture the vibrant colors and textures that seemed to pulse through the streets.

As she wandered, Zoe's eyes landed on a small, rundown café tucked away between two larger buildings. The sign above the door read "Kāpostu zāle" - a humble name for a place that seemed to hold a world of stories within its crumbling walls. Zoe pushed open the creaky door and slipped inside, her footsteps echoing off the Formica-topped tables.

The café was dimly lit, with only a few scattered candles illuminating the space. A gruff but kind-eyed barista greeted her from behind the counter, offering a steaming cup of coffee in exchange for a smile and a nod. Zoe settled into a corner table, camera at the ready, as she began to absorb the atmosphere.

Over the next few hours, Zoe snapped photos of the café's eccentric patrons - a group of rowdy students on a field trip, a pair of elderly lovers sharing a plate of pierogies, and a young musician strumming a melancholy tune on his guitar. With each click of her shutter, she felt a connection to these people, this place, and the stories that lay just beneath the surface.

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the café's walls, Zoe gathered her things and bid farewell to the barista and its inhabitants. She slipped back onto the bus, camera case slung over her shoulder, already planning her next move in this enchanting city. And as Riga drifted away into the night, she smiled to herself, knowing that she'd captured a small piece of Zoe Krūmiņš's heart, if only for a moment.
