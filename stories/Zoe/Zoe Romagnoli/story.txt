Zoe Romagnoli stepped onto the sun-drenched beach, her eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of adventure. A freelance journalist with a passion for uncovering hidden gems, Zoe had spent years traveling the world in search of the next big story. Her latest assignment had brought her to this small coastal town, where rumors of a legendary treasure had been circulating among locals.

As she walked along the shore, Zoe noticed a group of elderly men huddled together, their faces etched with concern. She approached them cautiously, not wanting to startle them. "Excuse me," she said softly, "but I couldn't help noticing that you all seem troubled. What's on your minds?"

The men exchanged nervous glances before one of them spoke up. "We've been talking about the old lighthouse," he said quietly. "You see, Zoe Romagnoli, it's said to be cursed."

Zoe raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "A curse?" she repeated. "What makes you think that?"

The men leaned in closer, their voices barely above a whisper. "We've had...incidents," one of them said. "Tools gone missing, strange noises at night. Some folks say it's the ghost of old Captain Jameson, who died under mysterious circumstances all those years ago."

Zoe's journalist instincts kicked in, and she began to scribble notes on her pad. She asked more questions, but the men seemed reluctant to elaborate further. Just as she was about to give up, one of them handed her an old map, yellowed with age.

"This might help you find the treasure," he said with a nod. "But be warned, Zoe Romagnoli, the sea can be unforgiving."

Zoe's eyes widened as she unfolded the map, revealing cryptic symbols and markings that seemed to point to a hidden entrance. She felt a shiver run down her spine â€“ could this really be it? The thrill of the hunt was on, and Zoe Romagnoli was ready to face whatever lay ahead.
