Zoe Björkqvist stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the quaint station for any sign of life. It had been years since she'd last set foot in the small Swedish town of Östersund, but the memories still lingered, like the faint scent of pine on a winter's breeze.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Zoe couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her. She thought back to her childhood spent exploring the frozen lakes and dense forests with her friends, their laughter carrying on the wind as they chased after the northern lights.

Zoe Björkqvist's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her phone buzzing in her pocket. She pulled it out to find a text from an unknown number: "Meet me at the old lighthouse at midnight. Come alone."

A shiver ran down her spine as she considered the message. Who could have sent it, and what did they want with Zoe? She'd always been a bit of a loner, content to keep to herself in the midst of the bustling city. But there was something about this mysterious invitation that drew her in.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the town, Zoe made her way back to her small apartment above the bakery. The aroma of freshly baked bread wafted up through the vents, mingling with the scent of pine and old books from the library downstairs.

She spent the evening lost in thought, her mind racing with possibilities. Who was behind the mysterious message, and what did they want with Zoe Björkqvist? As the clock struck midnight, she made her way out into the darkness, her heart pounding in her chest. The lighthouse loomed ahead, its beam cutting through the night air like a searchlight. Zoe took a deep breath, steeling herself for whatever lay ahead.
