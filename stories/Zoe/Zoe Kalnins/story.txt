Zoe Kalnins stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It had been months since she'd last set foot in Ravenswood, and yet the familiar scent of coal smoke and damp earth still enveloped her like a warm hug.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Zoe's mind wandered back to the memories that had brought her here in the first place. Her grandmother, a kind-hearted woman named Astrid Kalnins, had passed away a year ago, leaving behind a legacy of love and laughter that Zoe was determined to honor.

She stopped at the local bakery, where she'd spent countless afternoons as a child, watching Astrid whip up batches of flaky pastry and sweet bread. The owner, a gruff but kind man named Gus, looked up from his work and smiled when he saw Zoe.

"Zoe Kalnins, it's been too long!" He enveloped her in a warm hug, the smell of flour and sugar wafting up to greet her. "I've got a fresh batch of your grandmother's famous apple strudel waiting just for you."

As she took a bite, the flavors transported Zoe back to a time when life was simpler, when laughter and love filled every moment. She closed her eyes, letting the memories wash over her, and knew that she was exactly where she needed to be.

After lunch, Zoe made her way to the old family cottage on the outskirts of town. The once-white paint had faded to a soft gray, but the windows still sparkled in the sunlight like diamonds. She felt a sense of peace settle over her as she stepped inside, her eyes adjusting to the dim light.

Astrid's favorite armchair was still placed by the window, and Zoe settled into its worn cushions, feeling the familiar weight of her grandmother's presence. It was here, surrounded by the memories of her past, that Zoe felt most at home. And as she sat in silence, listening to the wind rustle through the trees outside, she knew that she would always carry Astrid's love and legacy with her.
