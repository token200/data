Zoe Zariņš stepped off the crowded train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling streets of Riga. As a freelance journalist, she had grown accustomed to navigating the city's hidden corners and uncovering secrets that few others dared to reveal.

With a mop of curly brown hair and a nose slightly too big for her face, Zoe cut a determined figure through the crowds. She was on the hunt for a lead on a story that had been percolating in her mind for weeks: the mysterious disappearance of several young artists from the city's thriving avant-garde scene.

As she made her way to her favorite café, a small, unassuming spot tucked away in a narrow alleyway, Zoe's mind whirled with theories and suspects. She had spoken to some of the artists' families, but so far, no one seemed willing to talk openly about what might have happened to their loved ones.

Zoe took a seat at the bar, ordering a strong black coffee as she pulled out her notebook and began to scribble down notes. She was a research-intensive journalist, always digging for connections between seemingly unrelated dots. It was a approach that had earned her a reputation in Riga's journalism circles, but also made her a target for those who didn't want their secrets exposed.

Just as Zoe was about to leave the café when she noticed a piece of paper on the table. She picked it up, scanning the scribbled message quickly. It read: "Meet me at the old bridge at midnight. Come alone."

Zoe's heart skipped a beat. This could be the break she had been waiting for. She tucked the note into her pocket and made her way back out onto the streets, feeling a sense of excitement and trepidation.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Zoe found herself standing at the old bridge, its weathered stones glowing with an otherworldly light in the fading darkness. A figure emerged from the shadows, their face obscured by a hoodie. "Welcome, Zoe," they said, their voice low and husky. "I have information about the disappearances."

Zoe's heart pounded as she pulled out her recorder and notebook. This could be it – the proof she needed to expose the truth behind Riga's art world. But as she leaned in to listen, a sense of unease crept over her. What had she just gotten herself into?
