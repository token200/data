Zoe Põld was known for her fearless attitude and unwavering dedication to justice. As a detective in the small town of Türi, Estonia, she had seen it all - from petty thefts to gruesome murders. Her sharp mind and keen instincts made her one of the most respected detectives in the region.

One stormy evening, Zoe Põld received a call from the local police station, where a body had been discovered in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town.
