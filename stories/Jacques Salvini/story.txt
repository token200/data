Jacques Salvini stepped out of the rain-soaked streets of Paris and onto the worn wooden dock. The Seine River flowed lazily behind him, its waters reflecting the vibrant colors of the city's evening lights. As he gazed out at the river, a sense of melancholy washed over him.

It had been five years since his last voyage, five years since he'd set sail on the majestic galleon "L'Aube" and disappeared into the depths of the Indian Ocean. The rumors of his fate still lingered in the whispers of the sailors' guild: some said he was shipwrecked on a desert island; others claimed he was taken by a rival nation, forced to serve as a spy. But Jacques knew the truth – that he'd been chasing a myth, a dream that had consumed him for years.

As a young man, Jacques had been captivated by the tales of the great explorers: Columbus, Magellan, and Da Gama. He longed to follow in their footsteps, to chart new waters and discover hidden treasures. And so he'd spent years studying, preparing, and planning – until finally, he'd set his own course.

The "L'Aube" had been his pride and joy, a sturdy vessel with three masts and a hull adorned with intricate carvings. She was Jacques' home, his companion, and his best friend. And when the storm had blown in off the coast of Africa, threatening to wreck the ship, Jacques had fought to save her.

But it wasn't just the sea that had claimed him; it was the obsessive pursuit of a dream. He'd spent years researching the lost city of Zerzura – said to be hidden deep within the Egyptian desert, guarded by treacherous dunes and deadly sand worms. Many believed it was nothing more than a myth, but Jacques knew better.

As he stood on the dock, the cool breeze whipping his hair into a frenzy, Jacques felt the weight of his memories bearing down upon him. He thought of his mother, who'd encouraged his dreams when no one else would listen; of his father, who'd warned him of the dangers of the sea and the foolishness of chasing legends.

And yet, here he was – back in Paris, surrounded by the city's bustle and chaos. It was a hard transition to make, but Jacques knew it was time. He couldn't stay at sea forever; not now that he'd realized the value of the life he'd left behind.

The rain began to fall harder, drumming against the wooden dock like a thousand tiny drums. Jacques pulled his coat tighter around him and set off into the night, the Seine's waters whispering secrets in the darkness. He knew that one day, he'd return to the sea; but for now, it was time to rediscover the world beyond its horizon.
