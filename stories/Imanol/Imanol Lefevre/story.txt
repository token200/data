As she navigated through the maze-like corridors, Imanol Lefevre couldn't help but notice the eerie silence that seemed to follow her every move.

Undeterred, Imanol Lefevre made her way to the CEO's office, where she was met with an imposing figure clad in tailored business attire. The CEO's eyes narrowed slightly at the sight of her, but Imanol Lefevre was undaunted, having dealt with her fair share of skeptical faces over the years.

"Just doing some basic research, sir," she replied with a confident smile. "I'm sure we'll find something interesting."

The CEO snorted, but Imanol Lefevre could see the faintest glimmer of unease in his eyes. She pounced on it like a predator sensing prey, her questions becoming increasingly probing as she dug deeper.
