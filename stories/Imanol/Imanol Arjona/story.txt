Imanol Arjona walked into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room as he searched for his contact. He had been on the run for weeks, ever since he'd uncovered a conspiracy that threatened to destroy everything he held dear.

As a freelance journalist, Imanol had always been willing to take risks to get the story. But this time, he'd crossed a line. He had stumbled upon evidence of a massive government corruption scandal, and now his life was in danger.

He spotted his contact, a young woman with piercing green eyes, sitting at a corner table. She nodded subtly as Imanol approached, her hand already extended in greeting.

"Ana," Imanol said, taking a seat across from her.

Ana smiled faintly, her expression betraying no emotion. "Imanol. I see you're still holding out."

Imanol shook his head. "I won't back down now. I have to expose the truth."

Ana leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. "You don't understand, Imanol. You can't keep going alone. They'll find you eventually."

"I've been on my own for years," Imanol said, his jaw clenched. "I won't let them push me around now."

The café door swung open, and two men stepped in, their eyes scanning the room until they locked onto Imanol and Ana.

"Ah-ah," one of them said, standing up to approach Imanol's table. "We've been looking for you."

Imanol's instincts kicked in, and he ducked behind a stack of newspapers, holding his breath as the men began to search the café.

Ana remained frozen, her eyes fixed on Imanol's back as she mentally calculated their options. She knew what was at stake – Imanol's life hung by a thread – but she also knew that taking him down would only lead to more violence.

Just as they were closing in, Ana slid out of the table and made a swift exit through the door, disappearing into the night. The men gave chase, their footsteps echoing down the street as Imanol stayed hidden behind his newspapers.

For now, he was safe – but for how long?
