Imanol Wisniewska was known for her sharp wit and quick tongue. A seasoned journalist, she had built a reputation for asking the tough questions that others couldn't or wouldn't.

As she walked into the crowded press conference room, Imanol Wisniewska's eyes scanned the sea of reporters before landing on the figure at the podium. It was the enigmatic CEO of NovaTech, the company behind the revolutionary new energy source that had been making headlines for months.

Imanol Wisniewska had heard rumors about NovaTech's true intentions, but she needed concrete evidence to prove them. She took her seat and waited for the Q&A session to begin.

The first question was from a young reporter who asked about job losses due to automation. Imanol Wisniewska's eyes lit up with interest as the CEO replied that while some jobs would be replaced, new ones would be created in the booming energy sector.

Next, a journalist from a rival publication asked about NovaTech's plans for global domination. The CEO chuckled and said that their focus was on making clean energy accessible to everyone, not controlling the world.

Imanol Wisniewska raised her hand, eager to get a question in. "Mr. CEO," she began, her voice firm but polite, "can you confirm or deny reports that NovaTech is secretly developing an AI-powered surveillance system?"

The room erupted into chaos as reporters shouted out their questions and the CEO's smile faltered for a moment before he regained composure. "I think we've covered enough ground today," he said, ending the Q&A session abruptly.

As Imanol Wisniewska filed her story, she couldn't shake off the feeling that something wasn't quite right. She had gotten as much information as she could from the CEO, but there were still too many unanswered questions. She made a mental note to dig deeper and uncover the truth behind NovaTech's mysterious plans.

With her journalist instincts on high alert, Imanol Wisniewska left the press conference room determined to expose whatever secrets NovaTech was hiding.
