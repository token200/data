Imanol Olsen was known for her sharp wit and quick tongue, but few people knew about her soft spot for stray animals. Growing up in a big, boisterous family, Imanol Olsen had always been surrounded by creatures great and small, from the chatty parrots of her aunt's aviary to the rambunctious cats that stalked the halls of her childhood home.

As she grew older, however, Imanol Olsen found herself increasingly disillusioned with the world around her. Politics seemed too partisan, art too pretentious, and life just too short. One day, on a whim, she decided to take a break from it all and volunteer at a local animal shelter. There, amidst the chaos of barking dogs and yowling cats, Imanol Olsen found a sense of peace.

For weeks, she spent her days tending to the animals, walking them around their enclosures, and playing with them until they calmed down enough for cuddles. It was a simple, uncomplicated existence, one that filled Imanol Olsen's heart with joy. And as the shelter volunteers began to take notice of her dedication and compassion, they started to call her "Mother" – a title she wore like a badge of honor.

One rainy afternoon, while out collecting donations for the shelter, Imanol Olsen came across a tiny kitten cowering in an alleyway. Without hesitation, she scooped up the creature and cradled it in her arms, showering it with affection until its eyes grew bright and trusting once more. From that moment on, the little ball of fluff became known as Lola, named after Imanol Olsen's own mother – a feisty, loving woman who had instilled in her daughter a sense of kindness and responsibility.

As she gazed into Lola's big green eyes, Imanol Olsen knew exactly what she meant: family wasn't just about blood ties; it was about the love you shared with those creatures that needed it most.
