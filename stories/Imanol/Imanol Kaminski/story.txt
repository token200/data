Imanol Kaminski stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It had been years since she'd last set foot in this town, and yet the familiar smell of damp earth and decay still lingered in the air.

As a child, Imanol had spent countless summers here with her abuela, listening to stories of their ancestors who had worked the land and fought for justice. But after a falling out with her family, she'd left without looking back.

Now, at 25, Imanol had returned to confront the ghosts of her past. She had received a letter from her abuela's lawyer, informing her that she was the sole beneficiary of the old woman's estate – and that she would inherit a small plot of land on the outskirts of town.

As she walked through the station, Imanol noticed a group of young people gathered around a makeshift stall, selling handmade crafts and gossip. One of them caught her eye – a boy with piercing green eyes and a mop of messy brown hair, who looked eerily like someone she'd known in her youth.

"¿Quién es ese?" she asked the vendor, nodding discreetly towards the boy.

The vendor followed her gaze before shrugging. "No sé quién es, pero parece que es uno de los nuevos en el pueblo."

Imanol's curiosity was piqued as she watched the boy expertly weave a basket from reeds and twigs. Who was this young man, and what brought him to this small town?

As the sun began to set, Imanol made her way out of the station and towards the land that would soon be hers. The air was cool and still, filled with the scent of blooming wildflowers. She felt a sense of peace settle over her, like a mantle of protection.

For the first time in years, Imanol Kaminski felt like she was coming home – to herself, to her heritage, and to the land that had shaped her into the person she was today.
