Imanol Salvini stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station with a mix of nostalgia and trepidation. As Imanol Salvini, she had spent countless summers in this very town, visiting her abuela's family farm with her siblings.

The memories came flooding back as she walked through the familiar streets, taking in the scent of freshly baked bread wafting from the bakery and the sound of children's laughter carrying on the breeze. It was a feeling Imanol Salvini knew all too well - the joy of being back home, surrounded by the people and places that made her feel truly alive.

As she walked towards the old farmhouse, Imanol Salvini noticed the changes that time had brought. The once-vibrant gardens were now wilting, and the wooden porch creaked underfoot as she approached. But despite the signs of decay, the farm still exuded a warm, welcoming energy that Imanol Salvini felt deep in her bones.

She pushed open the creaky door and was enveloped by the familiar scent of Abuela Rosa's cooking, which had been simmering on the stovetop for hours. The old woman herself emerged from the kitchen, a warm smile spreading across her face as she took in Imanol Salvini's tired but contented expression.

"Mija, it's so good to see you," Abuela Rosa said, embracing Imanol Salvini tightly. "I've missed you terribly."

Imanol Salvini hugged her back, feeling the familiar comfort of Abuela Rosa's presence. As they sat down to a steaming plate of rice and beans, Imanol Salvini couldn't help but feel grateful for this little slice of home, where she could escape the stresses of everyday life and simply be herself.

As the days passed, Imanol Salvini settled back into her old routine, helping Abuela Rosa with the farmwork and spending long afternoons exploring the surrounding countryside. It was a feeling that felt strangely like coming home - as if Imanol Salvini had finally found her way back to where she truly belonged.

As she lay in bed on her final night, listening to the distant rumble of the river and Abuela Rosa's gentle snoring beside her, Imanol Salvini smiled to herself. She was exactly where she needed to be - with the people who loved her most, surrounded by the beauty and simplicity of rural life. And for that, she was eternally grateful.
