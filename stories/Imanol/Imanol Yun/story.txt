Imanol Yun stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of saltwater and seaweed filling his lungs. He had been away for what felt like an eternity, and yet the smell was still as comforting as a warm hug from his abuela.

As he made his way through the bustling station, Imanol's eyes scanned the crowd for a glimpse of familiarity. That's when he spotted her – his childhood friend, Ana, with her bright pink hair and infectious smile. They shared a tight hug, and Imanol felt like a part of him had come home.

The two had grown up on the island of Tenerife, their lives intertwined by the crystal-clear waters and volcanic landscapes of their native land. After high school, they'd gone their separate ways – Ana to art school in Madrid, and Imanol to university in London. But life had a way of circling back, and now they were both returning to the island for the summer.

Imanol's eyes sparkled with excitement as he showed Ana his new watch, a family heirloom passed down from his grandfather. "What do you think?" he asked, eager for her opinion. Ana examined it carefully before grinning mischievously. "You're going to get lost in the canals of La Laguna again, aren't you?"

Imanol chuckled and shrugged, feeling a thrill of anticipation. He had indeed planned to spend his days exploring the island's hidden corners, just as he always did when he was home.

As they walked through the narrow streets, Imanol filled Ana in on his plans – studying marine biology at university, volunteering at a local conservation center, and maybe even landing a job teaching surf lessons on the south coast. Ana listened intently, offering words of encouragement and advice whenever she could.

The sun began to set over the Atlantic, casting a golden glow over the island. Imanol and Ana settled into a cozy café in La Victoria, sipping coffee and watching as the stars began to twinkle overhead. It was moments like these that reminded Imanol why he'd always felt most at home on Tenerife – amidst friends, sea air, and the unshakeable sense of belonging.

As they chatted into the night, their pasts slowly falling into place, Imanol realized that this summer was more than just a chance to reconnect with old friends – it was an opportunity to rediscover himself.
