Imanol Krūmiņš stepped out of his worn, black car and onto the rain-soaked streets of Riga. As he lit a cigarette, the bitter taste reminded him of home – the small, seaside town in Latvia where his family had lived for generations.

As he looked around at the city's modern skyscrapers and bustling streets, Imanol couldn't help but feel like an outsider. Growing up in a world where technology and innovation reigned supreme, he felt like a relic from a bygone era – one that revered tradition and hard work over flashy gadgets and trendy ideologies.

But Imanol was no ordinary man. Born with a rare genetic disorder that made his fingers merge together into a single, unyielding fist, he had grown up as an outcast. Shunned by the very people who claimed to love him for who he was, Imanol had learned to rely on himself – and only himself.

He walked through the crowded streets, weaving past pedestrians who cast nervous glances his way. Some might see him as a curiosity, a freak of nature to be gawked at and pitied. But Imanol saw himself as something more: strong, resilient, and unbreakable.

As he turned onto the Lielupe River, the sound of rushing water carried on the wind seemed to match the rhythm of his own heartbeat. It was here that Imanol had found solace – a place where nature's raw power could be felt most deeply.

He sat down on a bench overlooking the river, taking a long drag from his cigarette as the rain began to fall more heavily. The world around him might see him as broken, but Imanol knew he was simply...different. And in a world that often seemed too loud and too bright, it was this quiet, dark interiority that gave him strength.

The city lights twinkled like stars above, and for a moment, Imanol felt at peace – as if the very world had finally come to understand him. But then, as quickly as it had begun, the feeling passed. He stood up, crushed out his cigarette, and walked on, disappearing into the night, lost in the streets of Riga like so many others before him.

For Imanol Krūmiņš, this was home – not a place to be found or understood, but one to be felt deep within his own, weathered heart.
