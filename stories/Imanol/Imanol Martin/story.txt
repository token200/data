Imanol Martin stepped out of the dimly lit pub, his eyes squinting against the bright sunlight. He took a deep breath, feeling the cool morning air fill his lungs as he gazed out at the bustling streets of Madrid. As a private investigator, Imanol was no stranger to the shadows, but today he was on a mission to uncover the truth about a missing person case.

A wealthy businessman's daughter had gone missing three days ago, and the police were stumped. The only clue was a cryptic message left behind at her apartment: "La verdad está en el espejo" – The truth is in the mirror. Imanol's curiosity was piqued, and he decided to pay a visit to the victim's father.

As he entered the luxurious mansion, Imanol couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. Something about the opulent decorations and impeccable cleanliness seemed...off. He made his way to the study where the businessman sat, sipping whiskey on the rocks. Imanol explained the situation, and the old man listened intently, his eyes narrowing with concern.

"I want you to find my daughter," he said, his voice firm but laced with desperation. "I don't care what it takes."

Imanol nodded, taking out a notebook and pen. He began to ask questions, probing for any leads or clues that might have been overlooked. The businessman hesitated before speaking, glancing around the room nervously.

"I...I think there may be something," he said finally. "A secret my daughter kept from me. Something that could lead us to her."

Imanol's ears perked up, his mind racing with possibilities. He thanked the old man and set off on a new lead, following a trail of breadcrumbs through the city's hidden corners.

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the rooftops, Imanol found himself standing in front of an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. The message "La verdad está en el espejo" echoed in his mind – where was it hiding? With a deep breath, he pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside.

The air inside was thick with dust, but Imanol's trained eyes scanned the space, searching for any sign of the missing girl. Suddenly, a shard of glass glinted in the fading light...
