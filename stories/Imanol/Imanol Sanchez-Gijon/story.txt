Imanol Sanchez-Gijon stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. She had just arrived in Paris, the City of Light, for a month-long internship at a prestigious fashion magazine. As a 22-year-old Spanish design student, Imanol was excited to immerse herself in the world of haute couture.

With her luggage in tow, Imanol made her way through the crowded streets of Montmartre, taking in the charming cafes and artist studios that lined the sidewalks. She had always been fascinated by fashion, spending hours poring over design books and sketching ideas for her own collections. Her parents, both artists themselves, had encouraged her passion from a young age.

As she settled into her tiny apartment, Imanol's mind began to whirl with thoughts of the projects ahead. She would be working alongside some of the industry's top designers, learning the ins and outs of fashion production and editing. Her goal was to one day start her own label, but for now, she was content to soak up every experience like a sponge.

The next morning, Imanol arrived at the magazine office, her portfolio in hand. She was greeted by her colleague, a stylish woman named Sophie, who showed her to the design team's workspace. The room was filled with sketches, fabrics, and half-finished garments – a feast for Imanol's creative eyes.

As she began her first task – researching trends for an upcoming editorial – Imanol felt a sense of belonging wash over her. This was where she belonged: among the fashion elite, surrounded by creativity and inspiration. She spent the day typing away on her laptop, ideas flowing from her like water.

As the sun set over the city, Imanol stepped out onto the balcony, taking in the stunning view of the Eiffel Tower. She felt a sense of gratitude for this opportunity, for the chance to learn from the best and make connections that would last a lifetime. For Imanol Sanchez-Gijon, Paris was already starting to feel like home.
