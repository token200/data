Imanol Bergstrom stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her bright pink boots making a statement in the sleepy coastal town of Ravenswood. As she made her way through the quiet station, she couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement wash over her. She had just arrived on the island of Lusk, where her grandmother's old mansion stood waiting.

Imanol Bergstrom had grown up hearing tales of her family's mysterious past and the secrets hidden within those stone walls. Her parents, though loving, had never been forthcoming about their family's history, but Imanol was determined to uncover it for herself.

As she approached the mansion, a chill ran down her spine. The once-grand entrance now hung crookedly from its hinges, creaking ominously in the gentle breeze. She pushed open the door and stepped inside, calling out into the darkness.

"Grandm√®re?" she whispered, though she knew it was unlikely anyone would answer.

The air inside was thick with dust and memories. Imanol wandered through room after room, her footsteps echoing off the walls as she searched for clues. Each step revealed a piece of her family's history: an old photograph on a dusty shelf, a torn letter in the attic, a small, intricately carved box hidden beneath the bed.

As she explored further, Imanol began to piece together the puzzle of her family's secrets. It was clear that they had been hiding something, and it seemed that Ravenswood itself held the key. She made a mental note to speak with the local historians and delve deeper into the town's mysterious past.

Despite the chill running down her spine, Imanol felt a sense of connection to this place. There was something about Ravenswood that drew her in, something that spoke to a part of her she had yet to uncover. As she settled onto the worn couch in the grand foyer, Imanol Bergstrom knew that she had only just begun to scratch the surface of her family's secrets, and that Ravenswood would hold many more surprises for her.
