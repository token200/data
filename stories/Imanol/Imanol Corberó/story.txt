I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Imanol Corberó. It's possible that this character does not exist in popular culture or is not well-known.

However, I did find information on an actress named Ímanol Corberó who was born in 1991 and has appeared in several Spanish films and TV shows. If you would like to create a story around her as a fictional character, please let me know what kind of character she should be (e.g. superhero, fantasy creature, historical figure) and I can help you develop a story.

Alternatively, if you have any specific information or context about the character Imanol Corberó, such as their personality, background, or abilities, I would be happy to try and write a story around them.

Let me know how I can assist you!
