One drizzly evening, Imanol received an unusual visit from a young woman named Sarah. Her worried expression begged for his attention as she explained her sister's disappearance. The police had given up the case months ago, but Sarah was convinced that Imanol could find her sister.

Imanol listened intently, his mind racing with possibilities. He had a knack for sniffing out clues that others might miss. As he pondered the case, he couldn't help but think of his own complicated past. Growing up on the wrong side of the tracks had taught him how to rely only on himself.

Finally, Imanol found himself standing in front of Sarah's sister, safe and sound. The young woman was overwhelmed with emotion as she hugged her grateful sibling. As Imanol watched the reunion, he couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. Another case closed, another mystery solved.

For Imanol Wisniewski, the thrill of the chase was addictive. He knew that the darkness would always be there, waiting to pounce. But with his skills and determination, he was ready to face whatever came next.
