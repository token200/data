Imanol Saldaña stepped out of the crowded streets of Barcelona and into the dimly lit studio of his childhood friend, Carlos. The air was thick with the scent of old books and stale cigarettes as they sat hunched over a worn wooden table.

"Carlos, I need your help," Imanol said, his voice laced with desperation. "I've been getting these strange visions. Dreamscapes that feel all too real."

Carlos raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. "What kind of visions?"

Imanol's eyes darted around the room before coming back to rest on Carlos' face. "Glimpses of a world that isn't my own. A world where the skies are perpetually shrouded in a sickly yellow haze and the air is thick with an otherworldly energy."

Carlos leaned forward, his elbows on his knees. "Tell me more."

Imanol took a deep breath before launching into a detailed account of his visions. As he spoke, Carlos listened intently, his expression growing more serious by the minute.

When Imanol finished speaking, Carlos nodded thoughtfully. "I think I can help you understand what's going on, Imanol Saldaña. You've always been one for the mystical and the unknown."

Imanol frowned, skeptical. "You mean because of my mother's tales of ancient deities and forbidden knowledge?"

Carlos chuckled. "Perhaps a little. But there's something more to it than that. Something in your blood, Imanol Saldaña. A connection to this world that goes beyond the veil of reality."

As they delved deeper into the mystery of Imanol's visions, Carlos revealed a shocking truth: his own family had a history with the supernatural, and he suspected that Imanol's ancestry held the key to unlocking the secrets of the mysterious dreamscapes.

Together, the two friends embarked on a perilous journey to unravel the tangled threads of their shared past. With each step, they drew closer to the heart of the mystery – and the fate of Imanol Saldaña hung precariously in the balance.
