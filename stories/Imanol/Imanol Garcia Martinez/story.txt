Suddenly, Imanol García Martínez was thrust into the spotlight, with galleries and museums clamoring for her work.

Over the years, Imanol continued to push the boundaries of her art, exploring themes of sustainability and social justice. Her sculptures became increasingly thought-provoking, sparking conversations about the impact of human activity on the environment. Despite the demands of her career, Imanol remained true to herself, never compromising her artistic vision.
