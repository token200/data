Born into a family of modest means, Guillermo had always been drawn to the world of antiquity. His eyes widened with wonder as he pored over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls, uncovering hidden truths about long-forgotten cultures.

Rumors swirled that Zerzura held the key to unlocking some of humanity's most profound mysteries. Many had attempted to find it, but none had succeeded.
