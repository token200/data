As a child, he would often sneak into the local cantina to watch the musicians play, mesmerized by their skill and energy. His parents, though skeptical at first, soon saw the joy it brought him and encouraged him to pursue his dreams. With the help of some makeshift instruments crafted from household items, Guillermo Omar began teaching himself to play.

Years passed, and Guillermo Omar's talent became harder to ignore. He started performing on street corners, in small clubs, and even at local weddings, gradually building a following among the townspeople.

Despite his growing success, Guillermo Omar remained humble and true to his roots. He continued to play for anyone who would listen, whether it was a crowd of thousands or just a handful of friends gathered around the bar.
