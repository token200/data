Guillermo Wiśniewski stepped out of the worn leather jacket and onto the cracked sidewalk. The city was alive with the hum of traffic, but he barely registered it. His eyes scanned the crowded streets, searching for one face in particular – that of his old friend, Alexei.

It had been years since they'd last spoken. Guille, as Alexei called him, had always been a man of few words, content to observe life from the sidelines. But the weight of history and secrets hung heavy over their friendship like a shroud.

Guille spotted Alexei across the street, sitting at a small café with a cup of coffee in front of him. He ambled towards it, weaving through the throng of people. As he reached the table, Alexei looked up, his eyes squinting against the bright light of day.

"Guille," Alexei said quietly, extending a hand.

Guille shook it firmly, feeling the weight of their unspoken words settle in like a physical force. "Alexei."

They sat in silence for a moment, sipping their drinks and avoiding eye contact. Guille was the first to break the spell, his voice low and measured. "What brings you here?"

Alexei leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers together. "I came looking for answers," he said slowly. "About our past... about what happened."

Guille's eyes narrowed. He'd always known that their friendship was complicated, but he'd never expected Alexei to return.

"What do you mean?" Guille asked carefully, trying not to reveal too much of himself.

Alexei hesitated before speaking again. "I've been seeing things," he said quietly. "Memories I thought were long buried. And I'm starting to realize that some wounds run deeper than we ever could have imagined."

Guille's grip on his coffee cup tightened, feeling a familiar unease creeping up his spine. He'd always known that their friendship was bound by a thin thread of secrets and lies. But he'd never expected Alexei to confront him about it.

For a long moment, the two men sat in silence, locked in a dance of unspoken emotions. Then Guille stood, tucking his jacket back into its worn leather. "I think I should get going," he said gruffly.

Alexei nodded, watching as Guille turned and disappeared into the crowd. The city swallowed him whole, but Guille knew that their conversation was far from over.
