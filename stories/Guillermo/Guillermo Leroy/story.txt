Despite all the accolades, Guillermo Leroy remained humble and true to himself. He continued to shoot with his trusty old camera, which had become an extension of his own hand. And whenever someone asked him about his secret to success, he would simply smile and say, "It's just a matter of seeing things in a different way."
