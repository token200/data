Guillermo Dubois stepped into the dimly lit jazz club, his eyes scanning the crowded room for his friend and confidant, Sofia. He spotted her across the way, sipping on a whiskey sour as she watched the band with an intensity that bordered on obsession.

Guillermo made his way through the sea of patrons, nodding in greeting to familiar faces along the way. As he reached Sofia's table, she looked up and flashed him a warm smile.

"Hey, Gordo," she said, using the affectionate nickname only he was privy to.

Guillermo chuckled and slid into the seat beside her. "Just Guillermo for you, Sofi."

As they ordered their drinks, Guillermo couldn't help but notice the way Sofia's eyes sparkled when she talked about music. He had always known she was passionate about it, but tonight seemed different – as if something in particular had set her soul aflame.

The band launched into a soulful rendition of Coltrane's "My Favorite Things," and Sofia closed her eyes, letting the melancholy melody wash over her. Guillermo watched, mesmerized by the way she moved, her body swaying to the beat like a leaf on an autumn breeze.

As the night wore on, Guillermo found himself drawn into Sofia's world of soundscapes and improvisation. He had always admired her talent, but tonight he felt a deeper connection – as if they were speaking in a language that only they could understand.

When the music finally died down, Sofia turned to him with a look of quiet contemplation. "Guillermo Dubois," she said softly, using his full name for the first time all night, "sometimes I feel like we're not really talking about anything at all."

Guillermo raised an eyebrow, intrigued by her words. "What do you mean?" he asked, leaning in close.

Sofia's eyes locked onto his, and Guillermo felt a shiver run down his spine as she replied, "I think we're just two people, lost in the music of our own minds."

In that moment, Guillermo knew exactly what she meant. And with that, he reached out and took her hand, the connection between them sparking like a live wire on a summer night.
