Guillermo Horváth stepped out of his small café and onto the bustling streets of Prague. His eyes scanned the crowded sidewalks, taking in the vibrant colors and lively chatter of the city's residents. As he made his way to his favorite bookshop, he couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him.

Guillermo had always been a book lover, and it was no surprise that he'd ended up working at the very shop that had inspired him as a child. The owner, Oldřich, had taken Guillermo under his wing and taught him everything there was to know about literature and history. Over the years, Guillermo had become an expert on Czech authors and had even written several papers on the subject.

As he pushed open the door to the bookshop, a bell above it rang out, announcing his arrival. Oldřich looked up from behind the counter, a hint of surprise in his eyes. "Guillermo, my boy! What brings you here today?"

Guillermo smiled and made his way over to the shelves, running his fingers over the spines of the books as he searched for something specific. He had always been drawn to the works of Kafka, and was currently researching a paper on the author's influence on modern Czech literature.

As he browsed through the shelves, Guillermo couldn't help but think about his own life. He had grown up in a family of modest means, but his love of books had given him a sense of escape and possibility that he might not have otherwise known. Despite struggling with anxiety and depression at times, Guillermo found solace in the written word.

Just as he was about to find what he was looking for, Oldřich approached him with a small package in hand. "I found this tucked away on one of my trips," he said, his eyes twinkling. "It's an old edition of 'The Metamorphosis' – I think it might interest you."

Guillermo's heart skipped a beat as he took the package from Oldřich. He carefully opened the cover and began to read, losing himself in the haunting prose of Kafka's masterpiece.

For a moment, everything else faded away, and all that mattered was the words on the page. Guillermo Horváth was lost in his own little world, surrounded by the books he loved.
