I must correct you, Guillermo Corberó is not a fictional character. He is a Spanish actor, best known for his roles in TV series such as "Money Heist" (also known as "La Casa de Papel") and "Las Chicas del Cable".

However, I can write a story based on this real person.

Guillermo Corberó sat in his small apartment in Madrid, staring at the walls that seemed to close in on him. It had been months since he'd finished filming for "Money Heist", the show that had catapulted him to stardom. The constant attention and scrutiny from fans and paparazzi had become overwhelming.

As he sipped his coffee, he couldn't help but think about how far he'd come. From playing a minor role in a Spanish TV series to becoming an international sensation overnight. It was a surreal experience that left him both grateful and exhausted.

Just then, his phone rang. He answered it, hoping it wasn't another request from a fan or an interviewer asking for yet another quote about the show. But to his surprise, it was his agent on the line with some unexpected news.

"Guillermo, I have some great news," he said. "We've been approached by Netflix to produce a spin-off of 'Money Heist' featuring you as a main character."

Guillermo's eyes widened in shock. A spin-off? Him as a lead? It was the opportunity of a lifetime.

Over the next few weeks, Guillermo worked tirelessly on the new series. He poured his heart and soul into his character, making sure it was both familiar and fresh. When the show finally premiered, the response was overwhelming. Fans from around the world tuned in to see what happened next to their beloved characters.

As Guillermo looked out at the crowd of fans gathered outside his apartment building, he felt a sense of gratitude and humility. He had been given an incredible gift, and he was determined to make the most of it. The spotlight may have been intense, but with hard work and dedication, he knew he could shine brighter than ever before.

With a smile, Guillermo stepped out into the night, ready to face whatever came next.
