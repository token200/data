His parents, though skeptical at first, soon recognized their son's innate aptitude and encouraged his academic pursuits. As he delved deeper into the world of linguistics, Guillermo became increasingly fascinated with the symbolism and mythology of ancient cultures.

Guillermo's research took him to dusty libraries and crumbling ruins, where he pored over ancient texts in search of clues. His fingers would often trail across worn parchment, tracing intricate patterns that held the key to deciphering long-lost languages.
