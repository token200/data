Valentin Kaminska stopped at the edge of a deserted alleyway, scanning the shadows for any sign of movement. The wind carried the faint scent of blooming cherry blossoms through the air, but he didn't notice â€“ his focus was solely on the task at hand.

In this world of cat-and-mouse, Valentin Nikolayevich Kaminska was the master strategist. And as the night wore on, it was clear that he would stop at nothing to uncover the truth.
