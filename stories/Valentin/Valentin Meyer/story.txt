Valentin Meyer stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station as if searching for someone. He had been here before, but it was still disorienting to find himself back in this forgotten corner of Europe.

It had been years since he'd left Berlin, after a fall from power that had left him reeling. Valentin had built his reputation on ambition and ruthlessness, but even he couldn't ignore the whispers of scandal and corruption that followed him wherever he went. So, he'd fled, leaving behind the city he once called home.

As he made his way through the station, a young woman caught his eye. She was new to this town, Valentin could tell, with a look of wide-eyed wonder on her face as she gazed around at the crumbling buildings and dusty streets. He watched her for a moment before turning away, not wanting to be seen.

Valentin had always been drawn to people like this young woman - outsiders, searching for something more in life. He knew what that was like, having lost himself in the shadows of his own ambition. But he'd come to realize that there was more to life than just power and prestige.

He hailed a taxi and gave the driver an address he didn't even know if he believed in anymore - the old villa on the outskirts of town where he used to spend his summers with his family. It was a place where memories still lingered, and Valentin found himself drawn back time and again.

As the taxi wound its way up the hill, the air thickened with scent and sounds of the past. Valentin's thoughts turned to those who had come before him - his parents, his friends, his enemies. He wondered if any of them were still here, watching over him from beyond the grave.

The villa loomed in front of him, its once-majestic facade now weathered to a soft gray. Valentin stepped out onto the porch and took a deep breath, letting the memories wash over him. For the first time in years, he felt like himself again - not the puppet master, nor the man with a reputation to uphold.

In this moment, Valentin Meyer was just another stranger standing before an old, crumbling house, wondering what lay ahead.
