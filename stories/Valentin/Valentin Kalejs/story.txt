Valentin Kalejs was known as one of the most notorious Latvian ultranationalists during World War II. As a prominent figure in the country's fascist movement, he used his charisma and persuasive abilities to spread hate and propaganda against Jews and other minority groups.

Born in 1911, Valentin Kalejs rose through the ranks of Latvia's fascist organization, the National Socialist Alliance of Latvia (NSA). He became close allies with other influential figures, including Arturs Anna, another prominent ultranationalist. Together, they organized rallies and events that aimed to whip up anti-Semitic sentiment among Latvians.

As tensions escalated between Latvia and its Jewish population, Valentin Kalejs found himself at the forefront of a movement that promoted hatred and violence against minority groups. He frequently spoke out against Jewish people in public speeches, claiming that they were responsible for Latvia's economic struggles and social ills.

Despite his radical views, Valentin Kalejs managed to gain the attention of higher authorities within Nazi Germany. In 1942, he traveled to Berlin to meet with Adolf Hitler himself, who was impressed by Kalejs' unwavering dedication to the Nazi cause. As a result, Valentin Kalejs became one of the few Latvian nationalists to be appointed as a liaison between Latvia's fascist movement and the German occupation authorities.

However, not everyone in Latvia shared Valentin Kalejs' extreme views. Many saw him as a threat to the country's stability and future. In 1943, during the Battle of Riga, Valentin Kalejs fled to the countryside, where he was eventually captured by Soviet forces and put on trial for his crimes.

The trial revealed the full extent of Valentin Kalejs' involvement in the persecution of minority groups and his support for Nazi policies. As a result, he was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad in 1945.
