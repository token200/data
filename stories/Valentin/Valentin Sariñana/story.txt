It was said that Valentin Sariñana had a penchant for collecting rare and obscure artifacts, each one telling a story of its own. His fascination with history was all-consuming, driving him to scour the globe in search of the next great find. Some claimed he was driven by obsession, while others saw it as a noble pursuit.

One evening, a local curator stumbled upon an obscure manuscript that hinted at Valentin Sariñana's involvement in a long-lost civilization.
