Raihan Kamińska stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station with a mix of excitement and nerves. She had just arrived in Kraków, Poland, to spend a few weeks studying abroad and exploring the city. As she made her way through the crowded station, Raihan couldn't help but feel a sense of pride knowing that her parents, who immigrated to the United States from Poland when she was a child, would be watching her every move on social media.

After grabbing a coffee at a nearby café, Raihan set out to find her accommodation. She had arranged to stay with a host family through her university, and after a few minutes of navigating the city streets, she finally arrived at their charming apartment in the heart of Kraków's historic district.

As she entered the cozy living room, Raihan was greeted by her host mother, Joanna, who welcomed her with open arms. "Raihan Kamińska, it's so great to meet you!" she exclaimed, beaming with a warm smile. Raihan smiled back, feeling an instant connection to her new host family.

Over the next few days, Raihan settled into her new routine, exploring the city and getting to know her hosts better. She spent hours wandering through the Wawel Castle gardens, visiting the Cloth Hall, and indulging in traditional Polish cuisine like pierogi and bigos. Her hosts introduced her to their own favorite spots, from the lively bars of Kazimierz to the tranquil Vistula River promenade.

As Raihan navigated the complexities of Polish culture, she couldn't help but think about how much her parents had influenced her love for Poland. Her mother's old family recipes and stories of her ancestors' struggles in the war had sparked a sense of pride and connection to her heritage. And now, as she explored Kraków on her own terms, Raihan felt grateful to be experiencing this journey as an adult.

As the sun began to set on another day in Kraków, Raihan sat down with Joanna for a homemade dinner of zurek and oscypek. "Mama, can I ask you something?" she said, looking up at her host mother with a curious expression. "What's it like being Polish, growing up here?" Joanna smiled softly, reflecting on the complexities of identity and belonging that Raihan was now experiencing firsthand. "It's complicated," she replied, "but it's also incredibly rich."
