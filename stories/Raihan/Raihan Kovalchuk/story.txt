Raihan Kovalchuk stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the sprawling city below. The wind whipped through his dark hair, and the neon lights of the skyscrapers reflected off the wet pavement like a kaleidoscope. He felt alive, free from the constraints of his past.

As a former hitman, Raihan had thought he'd left his violent life behind. But after a chance encounter with an old acquaintance, he found himself pulled back into the world he'd tried so hard to escape. This time, however, he was on the other side – taking down the very organizations that had once employed him.

Raihan's eyes narrowed as he thought about the latest target: a ruthless crime lord who'd been terrorizing the city for years. The police were stumped, and Raihan knew it was only a matter of time before the man struck again.

He took a deep breath, feeling the familiar rush of adrenaline coursing through his veins. This was what he was meant to do – use his skills to protect people, not hurt them. He thought back to his days as a soldier, where he'd seen his share of combat. But here, in this world, he had a choice.

Raihan spotted a figure watching him from across the rooftop – a young woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. She was a client, one who'd hired him for protection. He smiled wryly to himself; she didn't know what she was getting herself into.

As he turned to leave, the woman approached him. "Raihan?" she said, her voice low and husky.

"Yeah?"

"You're doing this for me," she stated, her eyes locking onto his.

He nodded curtly, unsure how much to reveal. "I do what I have to do," he replied.

She stepped closer, her hand reaching out to touch his arm. "You don't have to do it alone," she said, her voice full of conviction. For the first time in years, Raihan felt a spark of connection with someone else – someone who saw him beyond the mask of violence.

A faint glimmer of hope flickered in his chest, and for an instant, he forgot about the world below and the dangers that lurked within it. He was human again, fragile and vulnerable. But only for an instant – because in a world where loyalty was a luxury few could afford, Raihan knew he had to stay sharp.
