Raihan Taylor was known for her fiery spirit and sharp wit, but few people knew about the complicated past that had shaped her into the person she was today. Born to a wealthy family, Raihan had always felt suffocated by the expectations placed upon her. Her parents, determined to secure a lucrative marriage for their daughter, had pushed her towards relationships with men who were more suitable for their social status.

As a result, Raihan found herself trapped in loveless engagements and arranged marriages that left her feeling like a pawn in her own life. It wasn't until she met Jax, a free-spirited artist who challenged her to see the world through different eyes, that she began to break free from the shackles of her family's desires.

But even as Raihan found solace in Jax's arms, she couldn't shake off the feeling that she was abandoning her heritage. Her parents, disapproving of Jax's lack of social standing, threatened to cut her off from the family fortune if she didn't comply with their wishes. The weight of this decision weighed heavily on Raihan's shoulders as she struggled to reconcile her loyalty to her roots with her growing feelings for Jax.

One day, in a moment of desperation, Raihan confided in her best friend, Sofia, about her fears and doubts. Sofia, who had always been there for Raihan, listened attentively before offering words of wisdom that would change the course of Raihan's life forever. "You don't have to choose between your family and yourself," Sofia said, "you can forge a new path, one that's true to who you are."

Inspired by Sofia's words, Raihan made a bold decision: she left her family's mansion behind and embarked on a journey of self-discovery, determined to forge her own way in life. As she walked away from the only home she had ever known, Raihan Taylor felt a sense of liberation wash over her, like she was finally free to be herself.
