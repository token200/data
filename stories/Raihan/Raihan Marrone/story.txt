Raihan Marrone stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, her eyes scanning the shadows for any signs of trouble. As a private investigator, she had seen it all - from cheating spouses to missing persons cases. But tonight was different. Tonight was personal.

Her friend, Sarah, had gone missing three days ago, and Raihan's gut told her something was off. She approached the local bar where Sarah was last seen and pushed open the door, revealing a crowded room filled with rowdy patrons.

Raihan made her way to the bar and ordered a drink, her gaze roaming over the crowd for any sign of Sarah or anyone who might know what had happened to her. As she sipped her whiskey, she noticed a figure in the corner, nursing a beer. The figure looked familiar - Raihan's heart skipped a beat as she realized it was none other than Ryan Thompson, Sarah's ex-boyfriend.

Raihan approached Ryan, her eyes locked on his. "Hey, I need to talk to you," she said firmly. Ryan looked up, a mixture of guilt and fear flashing across his face before he quickly composed himself.

"I don't know what you're talking about," Ryan said, trying to brush Raihan off. But she wasn't having it. She leaned in close, her voice low and menacing. "Don't lie to me, Ryan. I know Sarah was with you that night. Where is she?"

Ryan shifted uncomfortably, his eyes darting around the room before finally meeting Raihan's gaze. "I...I didn't take her anywhere," he stammered.

Raihan raised an eyebrow, her mind racing with possibilities. She knew Ryan had a history of manipulation and control - and Sarah had been smart enough to escape him for a while. But where was she now?

As Raihan continued to question Ryan, the room began to spin around her. She was getting close, but she needed more information. And that's when it hit her - Raihan Marrone was not just any private investigator; she was a woman on a mission, determined to uncover the truth and bring Sarah home safe and sound.

With renewed determination, Raihan pressed Ryan for answers, refusing to back down until she got what she came for.
