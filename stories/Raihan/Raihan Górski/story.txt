Raihan GÃ³rski stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the crowded station. She had been traveling for hours, and the exhaustion was starting to catch up with her. As she made her way through the throngs of people, Raihan's mind began to wander back to the letter she had received just a few days prior.

It was from an old acquaintance, someone she hadn't heard from in years. The note had been brief, but it had sparked a mix of emotions within Raihan. It seemed that her friend, Kasia, had gotten herself into some kind of trouble and needed help getting out of it.

Raihan's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her phone buzzing in her pocket. She pulled it out to see a text from an unknown number: "Meet me at the coffee shop on 5th street at midnight. Come alone."

Raihan's heart skipped a beat as she read the message. Could this be connected to Kasia? She quickly typed out a response, asking for more information before hanging up.

As she made her way through the station, Raihan noticed a figure watching her from across the room. It was a woman with piercing green eyes and jet black hair, dressed in a long coat that seemed out of place in the warm summer air.

"Excuse me," the woman said, as Raihan approached her. "I've been looking for you."

Raihan's instincts told her to be cautious, but there was something about this woman that seemed genuine. "Who are you?" she asked, trying to keep her tone neutral.

"My name is Akira," the woman replied, producing a small card from her pocket. "And I'm here to help Kasia."

Raihan's eyes widened as she took in the information. This must be the message she had received earlier. She hesitated for a moment before taking the card, her mind racing with possibilities.

"Let's talk," Akira said, nodding towards the coffee shop on 5th street. "We have a lot to discuss."

Raihan nodded, tucking the card into her pocket. As she followed Akira out of the station, she couldn't help but wonder what lay ahead.
