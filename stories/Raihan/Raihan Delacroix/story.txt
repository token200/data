Raihan Delacroix stepped onto the bustling streets of New Orleans, her long black hair blowing in the wind as she navigated through the crowded alleys. As a member of the prestigious Delacroix family, she was no stranger to the city's secrets and scandals. But despite her family's influence, Raihan had always felt like an outsider, caught between her desire for independence and her duty to uphold the family name.

As she walked, Raihan's thoughts turned to her latest endeavor: a high-stakes poker game in the French Quarter. Rumors swirled that a wealthy businessman was in attendance, and Raihan aimed to take him down and prove herself as a force to be reckoned with.

She arrived at the designated location, a nondescript warehouse on Bourbon Street, just as the sun dipped below the horizon. The air was thick with anticipation as the players took their seats around the table. Raihan scanned the room, her eyes locking onto the businessman in question: a suave, well-dressed man with an air of confidence that bordered on arrogance.

The game began, and Raihan quickly found herself in a heated battle of wits with the businessman. She was determined to emerge victorious, but as the hours ticked by, she couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't quite right. Was it just her imagination, or did the businessman seem... off?

As the final hand was dealt, Raihan made her move, betting everything on a straight flush. The businessman hesitated, then called, revealing his own hand: a pair of jacks. Raihan's eyes widened in triumph as she raked in the pot.

But as she collected her winnings, she caught a glimpse of something that made her blood run cold: a small note on the table, addressed to her with a single word: "Wait." It was then that Raihan realized that this game was far from over â€“ and that the stakes were about to get a whole lot higher.
