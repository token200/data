Raihan Patel walked into the small café, scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Leela, sipping on a cup of coffee in the corner and made her way over.

"Hey, what's up?" Raihan asked, sliding into the chair across from Leela.

"Not much, just trying to get some work done," Leela replied, not looking up from her laptop. "You know how it is."

Raihan nodded, taking a sip of her own coffee. She had been studying for her exams all morning and was feeling a bit overwhelmed. But being around Leela always made her feel better.

As they chatted, Raihan couldn't help but think about her plans for the summer. She had been accepted into a prestigious internship program in New York City, and she was both excited and terrified at the prospect of starting a new adventure.

"Hey, have you heard from Rohan lately?" Raihan asked Leela, trying to change the subject.

Rohan was Raihan's older brother, who had always been her confidant. She hadn't spoken to him in weeks, and she was starting to get worried.

"I think he's doing okay," Leela said, glancing up from her laptop. "He just got back from a trip to Europe, that's all."

Raihan felt a pang of envy. Rohan had always been the adventurous one in their family, while Raihan preferred to stay close to home. But she was determined to make this internship happen and prove to herself that she could handle anything that came her way.

As they finished up their coffee and said their goodbyes, Raihan couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement for the future. She knew it wouldn't be easy, but with friends like Leela by her side, she felt like she could conquer anything.

Raihan Patel left the café feeling more confident than when she had arrived. She was ready to take on whatever challenges lay ahead, and she knew that no matter what happened, she would always have her family's love and support behind her.
