Raihan Yun stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station. It had been years since he'd set foot in his hometown of Taipei, and yet the familiar sights and smells still managed to transport him back to a time when life was simpler.

As he made his way through the crowded streets, Raihan's mind wandered to the reasons that had brought him back to Taipei. His grandmother's passing had left a void in his life, and he'd needed to return to the place where she raised him to say goodbye. But it was more than just grief that drove him – he'd come seeking answers.

Raihan Yun was no stranger to hardship. Growing up on the streets of Taipei as an orphan, he'd learned early on to rely on his wits and resourcefulness to survive. He'd spent years drifting from one place to another, taking on odd jobs and hustling to make ends meet. But after a particularly brutal stint working in a factory, Raihan had made the decision to leave it all behind.

Now, at 25, he was starting anew. With a small savings account and a suitcase full of dreams, Raihan had set out to build a life on his own terms. He'd always been fascinated by technology, and had spent years teaching himself coding and app development. Now, he saw this trip as an opportunity to launch his own startup.

As he walked through the streets, Raihan spotted familiar landmarks – the ancient Longshan Temple, where he'd played hide-and-seek with his friends as a child; the bustling night market, where he'd haggled for street food and trinkets. Each step brought back memories, both joyous and painful.

Raihan's grandmother had always been his rock, teaching him the value of kindness and hard work. Her loss left a chasm in his heart, but it also reignited a fire within him – a determination to succeed, no matter what obstacles lay ahead.

With renewed resolve, Raihan turned onto the street where he grew up, his eyes searching for the small apartment complex that had once been home. As he approached, he spotted a figure waiting on the steps – his childhood friend and confidant, Kao.

For a moment, they stood there in silence, exchanging smiles and awkward hellos. It was as if no time had passed at all, yet everything felt different. Raihan's eyes locked onto Kao's, and without needing to say a word, they both knew that the past was behind them – it was time for the future.

"Let's grab some oyster noodles," Raihan said finally, breaking the silence.

Kao nodded, and together they set off into an uncertain but bright new chapter.
