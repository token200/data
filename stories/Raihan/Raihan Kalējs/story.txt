Raihan Kalējs stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit café, shaking the water from his long coat. He took a seat at the counter, ordering a whiskey as he surveyed the room.

The patrons were a mix of locals and travelers, all drawn to this small café for its reputation as a haven for those seeking information. Raihan had heard whispers that they served more than just drinks here – they served secrets.

A waitress, with piercing green eyes, sidled up beside him. "You're looking for something, aren't you?" she asked, her voice low and husky.

Raihan raised an eyebrow. "Perhaps."

The waitress smiled, a hint of mischief dancing in her eyes. "I can help you find what you're looking for. But it's going to cost you."

He nodded, producing a small pouch from his pocket and tossing it onto the counter. The waitress snatched up the coins, her fingers closing around them like a vice.

"Meet me outside," she said, standing up straight as a statue. "The information I'm about to give you won't be for everyone's ears."

Raihan followed her out into the rain-soaked night, the sound of dripping water echoing off the buildings. The waitress led him to an alleyway, where a figure in the shadows waited.

"You're looking for information on the Kalējs family," the figure said, stepping forward to reveal a woman with skin as pale as moonlight and hair as dark as coal.

"That's correct," Raihan replied, his eyes narrowing. "What do you know?"

The woman smiled, her lips curving upwards like a crescent moon. "I can tell you where they are. But it won't be easy to find them."

Raihan's heart quickened with excitement. He had been searching for the Kalējs family for years, ever since he'd received that mysterious letter in his childhood.

"What do I need to do?" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

The woman handed him a small package, wrapped in black cloth. "This will lead you to your destination," she said. "But be warned, Raihan Kalējs – the family you're searching for is not what it seems."

Raihan took the package, feeling a shiver run down his spine as he did so. He knew that this was just the beginning of a journey that would change his life forever.
