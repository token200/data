Raihan Almodovar stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of saltwater and seaweed filling her lungs. She had returned to her hometown of San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua, after a decade away, seeking solace in the rugged beauty of the Pacific coast.

As she made her way through the crowded station, Raihan's eyes scanned the bustling scene, taking in the vibrant colors and lively chatter of the locals. Her dark hair was tied back in a messy bun, and her bright smile seemed to light up the entire platform. She had always been the life of the party, but after years of living abroad, she found herself feeling a little lost.

Raihan's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her name being called. "Raihan Almodovar! Raihan!" A tall, dark-haired man emerged from the crowd, a broad smile spreading across his face. It was Juan, her high school sweetheart, who had never left San Juan del Sur.

"Juan! It's so great to see you," Raihan exclaimed, as she threw her arms around him in a tight hug. They spent the next hour catching up, reminiscing about old times and sharing stories of their lives since they'd last seen each other.

As they walked through the town, Raihan felt a sense of belonging wash over her. This was where she belonged – surrounded by the people, places, and rhythms that had shaped her into the person she was today. She thought back to her childhood, spent playing on the beach with Juan, exploring the jungle, and learning the intricacies of Nicaraguan culture.

Raihan's eyes met Juan's, and for a moment, they just looked at each other, the past and present colliding in a flash of recognition. "Welcome home," Juan whispered, his voice low and husky. Raihan smiled, knowing that she was exactly where she needed to be – back in San Juan del Sur, with the person who had been by her side all along.
