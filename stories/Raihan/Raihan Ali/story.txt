Raihan Ali was a young and ambitious journalist who had always been driven by a passion for uncovering the truth. Growing up in a small town in Pakistan, she had witnessed firsthand the struggles of her community and had vowed to use her career to make a difference.

After completing her education, Raihan landed an internship at a prominent news organization in Lahore, where she quickly proved herself to be a skilled and tenacious reporter.

One evening, as she was working late on a story about police brutality, Raihan Ali received an email from an anonymous source with information that could change everything.

With the help of her editor, Raihan Ali worked tirelessly to craft a compelling piece that would get attention from all corners of the globe. As the deadline approached, she knew that this story could be her biggest – and most personal – yet.
