Raihan Gauthier stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar smell of damp earth and wood filling their lungs. It had been years since they'd returned to their hometown of Ashwood, but the sense of restlessness that had driven them away in the first place still lingered.

As they made their way through the quiet streets, Raihan Gauthier's eyes scanned the familiar landmarks - the old bakery, where Mrs. Jenkins would always leave a plate of fresh bread on her doorstep; the park where they'd spent countless hours playing hide-and-seek with friends. It was as if no time had passed at all.

But Raihan Gauthier knew that wasn't true. They'd left Ashwood in search of something more, something they couldn't quite put their finger on. Now, as they approached the old family home, now a small antique shop, they felt a mix of emotions: nostalgia, guilt, and a hint of excitement.

The door creaked open before Raihan Gauthier could even reach for the handle. Their mother, Jean-Marie, stood in the entrance, a warm smile on her face. "Welcome home, ch√®re," she said, using the French term of endearment that only they were allowed to hear.

Raihan Gauthier smiled back, feeling a sense of belonging wash over them. It was as if they'd finally come home, after all these years. Jean-Marie led them inside, where the shop was cluttered with old trinkets and family heirlooms. Raihan Gauthier's eyes widened as they took in the familiar scents and sounds.

As the day wore on, Raihan Gauthier helped their mother tidy up the shop, chatting about everything from their latest art projects to their favorite childhood memories. It was as if no time had passed at all - but for Raihan Gauthier, it felt like they'd finally found a piece of themselves that they'd been searching for all along.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the room, Jean-Marie smiled at her child and said, "Welcome home, Raihan Gauthier. You're exactly where you need to be." And in that moment, Raihan Gauthier knew she was right.
