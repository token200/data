Raihan Singh walked into the small caf√©, scanning the room for a familiar face. She had been searching for her friend, Leela Patel, all morning and finally tracked her down to this cozy spot on the outskirts of town. As she spotted Leela sipping on a cup of coffee, Raihan couldn't help but feel a wave of relief wash over her.

"Leela! Thank goodness I found you," Raihan exclaimed, plopping down into the chair across from her friend.

Leela looked up, a hint of amusement on her face. "Raihan Singh, what's got you so worked up? You've been calling me nonstop all morning."

Raihan sighed, running a hand through her hair. "I just had the worst meeting with our boss. He's breathing down my neck about meeting those sales targets, and I'm starting to feel like I'll never get it right."

Leela nodded sympathetically. "You're being too hard on yourself, Raihan. You've got this. What's going on that's making you so stressed?"

Raihan hesitated, unsure if she should share her fears with Leela. But something about her friend's calm demeanor put her at ease. "It's just...I don't know if I can do it, Leela. I feel like I'm constantly disappointing myself and everyone else."

Leela reached out, placing a comforting hand on Raihan's arm. "Raihan Singh, you are capable of so much more than you're giving yourself credit for. You've got talent pouring out of every pore. Trust me, you'll figure it out."

As they chatted, Raihan felt her tension begin to dissipate. With Leela by her side, she realized that maybe she didn't have to have all the answers right now. Maybe it was okay to take a step back and breathe. And with that newfound sense of calm, Raihan knew she could face whatever challenges came her way.

"Thanks, Leela," Raihan said, smiling gratefully at her friend. "Just talking to you makes me feel like I can conquer the world."

Leela grinned back, her eyes sparkling with warmth. "That's what friends are for, Raihan Singh."
