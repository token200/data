Raihan Välja stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the sleepy town before her. As the last surviving member of the elite guard unit known as the Order of the Black Rose, she had been sent to investigate a series of mysterious occurrences in this remote corner of the realm.

With her armor battered and scarred from countless battles, Raihan Välja made her way through the quiet streets, nodding at the few townspeople who recognized her. She had been on the run for months, pursued by those who sought to exploit her unique abilities as a skilled fighter and strategist.

As she entered the local tavern, a burly man with a thick beard looked up from his ale and raised an eyebrow. "You're Raihan Välja, ain't ya?" he growled. "We've heard stories about you."

Raihan Välja smiled wryly, her expression betraying a hint of weariness. "I'm afraid I'm not here to make friends," she said, taking a seat at the bar. "I'm looking for information. Who can tell me what's been happening in these parts?"

The tavern keeper, a grizzled old man with a bushy eyebrow, leaned in close. "Well, we've had strange happenings, all right," he whispered. "Tools gone missing, livestock disappearing... some folks say they've seen shadowy figures lurking around at night."

Raihan Välja's grip on her mug tightened as she listened intently. She knew that sound was the unmistakable hallmark of dark magic at work. The Order of the Black Rose had dedicated themselves to eradicating such malevolent forces, and Raihan Välja was determined to see justice served.

As she sipped her ale, a hooded figure slipped into the tavern, their eyes scanning the room before settling on Raihan Välja. For an instant, their gazes locked, and Raihan Välja felt a jolt of recognition. She knew that face - it belonged to one of those who had been hunting her.

Without hesitation, she stood, her hand instinctively reaching for the dagger at her belt. "It seems we have a common enemy," she said, her voice dripping with determination.
