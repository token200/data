Raihan Totti stepped out of his sleek, black sedan and onto the sun-kissed streets of Dubai. The city's gleaming skyscrapers seemed to stretch on forever, their peaks shrouded in a haze of gold and marble. It was a world where money knew no bounds, and Raihan had made a name for himself as one of the most sought-after business magnates in the region.
