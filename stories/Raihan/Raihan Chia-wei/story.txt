Raihan Chia-wei was a name that commanded respect on the streets of Kuala Lumpur. A former street fighter and now a successful business owner, he had earned his reputation through a combination of brute force and cunning.

As a young man, Raihan had grown up on the streets of KL, fighting for scraps and survival. But when a chance encounter with a local entrepreneur led to an investment opportunity, Raihan's fortunes took a dramatic turn. He invested in several businesses, using his natural charisma and physical prowess to expand his empire.

Today, Raihan's business interests stretched from real estate to hospitality, with a string of lucrative restaurants and bars across the city. His reputation as a shrewd businessman was matched only by his fearlessness on the battlefield. Few could match his strength and agility, and those who tried often found themselves on the receiving end of a stern warning.

Despite his intimidating demeanor, Raihan had a softer side. He was fiercely loyal to his family and friends, and would stop at nothing to protect them. His wife, Mei-Ling, was the anchor that held his life together, managing the day-to-day operations of their empire while Raihan focused on expansion.

One evening, as Raihan sat in his office, sipping a whiskey on the rocks, he received an unexpected visit from an old rival, Wong Lee. The two men had a long history, with Wong having once been one of Raihan's closest friends before a falling out left their friendship in tatters.

Wong Lee, now a middle-aged man with a weathered face, looked up at Raihan with a mixture of resentment and longing. "Raihan," he said, his voice dripping with malice. "I see you're still as successful as ever. But I'm not sure that's something to be proud of."

Raihan raised an eyebrow, intrigued by Wong's words. "What do you mean?" he asked, leaning back in his chair.

Wong Lee sneered. "You've built your empire on the backs of those who were once your friends and allies. You're a ruthless businessman, Raihan, with no qualms about crushing anyone who gets in your way."

Raihan's expression turned cold, his eyes narrowing as he sized Wong up. "And what makes you think I'm listening?" he asked, his voice measured.

For a moment, the two men locked gazes, their past animosities simmering just below the surface. Then, with a nod, Raihan rose from his chair and extended his hand to Wong Lee.

"Let's put the past behind us," he said, offering a glimmer of peace. "There's still work to be done."

Wong Lee hesitated for a moment before taking Raihan's hand, sealing their tentative truce with a firm handshake. As they parted ways, Raihan couldn't help but feel a sense of unease â€“ his past was catching up to him, and he knew that it would take all his strength and cunning to stay on top.
