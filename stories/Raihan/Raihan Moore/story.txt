Raihan Moore stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small town of Willow Creek. The air was thick with the smell of smoke and grease, a familiar scent that brought back memories of summertime spent in this very station. She had grown up here, or so it seemed.

As she made her way through the crowded station, Raihan's mind wandered to the photograph tacked to the wall behind the ticket counter. It was an old picture, one she had seen before but never really looked at closely. A young girl with bright blue eyes and curly brown hair stood alongside a woman with piercing green eyes and a smile that seemed almost otherworldly.

Raihan's heart skipped a beat as she realized the connection between the two women. She was the younger version of herself, or so it appeared. The photographs were arranged in reverse chronological order, a clever ruse by her parents to hide their true intentions.

As Raihan pushed open the door to the station's café, the bell above it let out a soft jingle. She slid onto a stool at the counter and ordered a coffee, taking a moment to collect her thoughts. What was she doing here? And what did she truly want?

Raihan's eyes drifted back to the photograph, this time noticing details she had never seen before. A tattoo on her mother's wrist, a faint scar above her father's left eyebrow. Her parents had always been tight-lipped about their pasts, leaving Raihan with more questions than answers.

The barista handed her a steaming cup and Raihan took a sip, feeling the caffeine coursing through her veins. She glanced around the café, taking in the warm atmosphere and the sense of familiarity that washed over her. This was home, but it wasn't hers by birthright. It was hers by choice.

Raihan finished her coffee and stepped out onto the street, leaving the station behind. As she walked through the quiet streets of Willow Creek, she felt a growing sense of determination. She would unravel the mysteries of her family's past, no matter how tangled they seemed. The question now was, where to start?
