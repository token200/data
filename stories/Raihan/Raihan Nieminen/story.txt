Raihan Nieminen stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. She had been traveling for hours, and the long ride was finally coming to an end. As she made her way through the crowded carriages, Raihan's mind began to wander back to the reason she had embarked on this journey in the first place: to visit her estranged mother.

Raihan Nieminen had always felt like there was a void in her life, a gap that no amount of love or support could fill. Her parents had divorced when she was young, and her father had moved away with his new family, leaving Raihan to be raised by her mother alone. The two had drifted apart over the years, their relationship becoming increasingly strained until they finally lost touch entirely.

But now, as Raihan stood in the station, she felt a sense of determination wash over her. She was going to find her mother, and she was going to make amends. Raihan's heart pounded in her chest as she hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of her mother's new home.

As they drove through the city, Raihan couldn't help but think about the what-ifs of her past. What if she had stayed with her father? Would their relationship have been stronger? But those questions were irrelevant now. All that mattered was the present, and the chance to reconnect with a piece of her own history.

The taxi pulled up in front of a small, unassuming house on the outskirts of town. Raihan paid the driver and stepped out onto the sidewalk, taking a deep breath as she gazed up at the door. She raised her hand, hesitated for a moment, and then knocked three times.

The door creaked open, and a woman stood before her. It was her mother. Raihan's heart skipped a beat as their eyes met, and for the first time in years, she felt a spark of connection. "Raihan," her mother said softly, a hint of surprise in her voice. "It's been so long."

Raihan smiled, feeling a weight lift off her shoulders. "I've come to see you, Mom," she said, taking a step forward. "We need to talk."
