Despite his success, Raihan struggled with the pressures of fame and the expectations placed upon him as a public figure. He often found himself at odds with his own family members, who felt that he was too outspoken or confrontational.

One day, Raihan received an offer to write for a prominent glossy magazine, which would have significantly increased his profile and earning potential.

As a writer and commentator, he knew that his true power lay not in his ability to build a large following or make a quick buck, but in the knowledge that he was contributing to a conversation about important issues and ideas.
