Raihan Aber stepped out of his worn leather jacket, revealing a messy tumble of dark hair that had grown longer since his time in the army. He ran a hand through it, wincing as he caught sight of the few remaining bullet scars on his arms and chest.

It was hard to believe it had been ten years since he'd left the battlefield behind. Ten years since he'd last seen his brothers, or the face of the woman who'd captured his heart before they were torn apart by war.

Raihan's thoughts drifted back to that fateful day when he'd lost everything - his unit, his reputation, and most of all, his sense of purpose. He'd been a skilled sniper, hailed for his accuracy and calm under fire, but the memories of what he'd done haunted him still.

As he made his way through the bustling streets of New Haven, Raihan couldn't shake the feeling that he was an outsider, a stranger in a world that seemed to have moved on without him. He worked as a private security consultant, taking on odd jobs and keeping to himself.

But tonight was different. Tonight, he had a job that required his particular set of skills - tracking down a missing teenager who'd gone missing under suspicious circumstances. Raihan's gut told him this one was personal, and he couldn't resist the pull of the unknown.

He arrived at the designated location - an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town - to find himself face-to-face with a group of rough-looking men who eyed him warily. The air was thick with tension as they explained that their target had been last seen here.

Without hesitation, Raihan took up position behind his rifle, scanning the rooftops and alleyways for any sign of movement. This was what he'd missed most - the rush of adrenaline, the focus of a mission well-planned. He was back in the game, and this time, he wasn't playing by the rules.

As the night wore on, Raihan closed in on his quarry, his senses heightened as he homed in on the faint sound of footsteps. The thrill of the hunt coursed through him once more, and for a moment, he forgot about the scars, the losses, and the doubts that had haunted him for so long.

All that mattered was the chase, the pursuit, and the unknown. And in this fleeting instant, Raihan felt alive again - ready to face whatever lay ahead, his heart pounding with anticipation.
