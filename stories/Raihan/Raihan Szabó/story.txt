Raihan Szabó stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. She was finally back in Budapest, home for the summer after spending the past year studying abroad in Paris.

As she made her way through the crowd, Raihan's thoughts turned to her plans for the next few months. Her parents had enrolled her in a local dance program, and she was eager to dive back into the world of ballet. She had always loved the discipline and focus required to master each step, and was excited to share that passion with others.

Raihan made her way through the streets of Pest, weaving past cafes and street performers as she headed towards the Danube River. The sun was beginning to set, casting a golden glow over the city. She smiled to herself, feeling a sense of peace wash over her. There was something about being back in Budapest that felt like coming home.

As she walked along the riverbank, Raihan's phone buzzed with an incoming text from her best friend, Zsófi. "Hey girl! Welcome back! We're going out tonight - meet you at the Café Gerzse?" The message was short and sweet, just what Raihan needed after a long journey.

She made her way to the café, her feet carrying her on autopilot as her mind replayed memories of the past year. From strolling along the Seine to sipping coffee in a charming Parisian café, Raihan's experiences had been a constant source of inspiration and joy.

Zsófi greeted her with a hug and a kiss on each cheek, followed by a long, lively conversation about everything from school gossip to the latest fashion trends. As they chatted over coffee and pastries, Raihan felt grateful for this friendship that spanned both cultures and time zones.

The rest of the night was spent dancing to lively folk music at a traditional Hungarian party, with Raihan feeling like she'd found her place in the world. She knew that this summer wouldn't be easy – there would be long hours of practice ahead, as well as adjusting to life back home after being abroad for so long.

But as she danced under the starry Budapest sky, Raihan felt a sense of belonging wash over her. This was where she belonged, surrounded by people who shared her passions and values. She took a deep breath, letting go of any fears or doubts that had crept in. With every step, she felt herself becoming more at home, more like the dancer she knew she could be.
