Raihan Renault stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. She had been away for months, chasing leads and connections that might finally crack the case she'd been working on for years. The streets of Marseille were a labyrinth of alleys and backstreets, but she knew every inch of them.

A former police officer turned private investigator, Raihan's reputation preceded her. People whispered about her tenacity, her intelligence, and her uncanny ability to get what she wanted. She'd been hired by the wealthy businessman, Pierre Dumont, to investigate the disappearance of his daughter, Colette. The case had gone cold months ago, but Raihan was determined to find out what had happened to her.

As she made her way through the crowded station, Raihan's phone buzzed with an incoming text from her contact, a local fixer named Félix. "She's here," he wrote. "At the café on Rue de l'Épée."

Raihan smiled, tucking her phone away and setting off towards the café. The sun was beginning to set over the Mediterranean, casting a golden glow over the cobblestone streets.

Inside the café, Raihan spotted Félix sitting in the corner, nursing a glass of wine. He raised an eyebrow as she approached, but nodded discreetly for her to take a seat beside him.

"Ah, Raihan," he said, his voice low and smooth. "I see you're as relentless as ever."

Raihan smiled, sipping on a coffee that Félix had ordered for her. "What do you know about Colette's disappearance?" she asked, her eyes locked onto his.

Félix leaned in close, his voice barely above a whisper. "I've heard rumors of a human trafficking ring operating out of Marseille," he said. "It's big money, Raihan. These people won't hesitate to kill anyone who gets in their way."

Raihan's eyes narrowed, her mind racing with possibilities. This was the break she'd been waiting for.

As they talked, Raihan's phone buzzed again, this time with a message from an unknown number. "Meet me at La Barre tonight," it read. "I have information about Colette."

Raihan exchanged a look with Félix, her heart pounding in anticipation. This could be the tip that would finally crack the case.

"Thanks for the info, Félix," she said, standing up to leave. "But I think I'll take this one alone."
