Małgorzata Fernández González sat at her desk, staring out the window at the bustling streets of Madrid. She was a young journalist, working her way up the ranks at a local newspaper. Her dark hair was tied back in a ponytail, and her bright brown eyes sparkled with determination.

Małgorzata's love affair with journalism began when she was just a teenager. She would spend hours listening to her abuela's stories about the Spanish Civil War, and she was captivated by the power of words to shape public opinion. After studying English and Journalism at university, she landed an internship at a major newspaper and worked her way up to become a respected reporter.

Her latest assignment had brought her to the streets of Madrid, where she was investigating a string of disappearances among young women. The police seemed stumped, and Małgorzata was determined to get to the bottom of it. She spent hours interviewing witnesses, poring over documents, and scouring the internet for clues.

As she worked, Małgorzata's mind wandered back to her own mother, who had gone missing when Małgorzata was just a teenager. The case had never been solved, and Małgorzata had always felt driven by a sense of justice. She knew that her work as a journalist could be tough, but she also knew it was worth it.

Just then, her phone rang. It was an anonymous source, claiming to have information about the disappearances. Małgorzata's heart skipped a beat as she listened to the caller's words. "Meet me at Café de la Paloma tonight," they said. "Come alone."

Małgorzata hesitated for a moment before nodding to herself. She was ready to take on whatever lay ahead.

That night, Małgorzata made her way to Café de la Paloma, her heart pounding in her chest. She spotted a figure sitting in the corner and began to make her way towards them. As she approached, the figure stood up and revealed themselves to be a young woman who looked uncannily like one of the missing girls.

"Who are you?" Małgorzata asked, her voice shaking slightly.

"My name is Sofía," the woman replied, her eyes locked on Małgorzata's. "And I have something important to tell you."

Małgorzata leaned in, her pen poised over her notebook. She was ready for whatever story lay ahead.
