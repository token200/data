Małgorzata Hoffmann sat alone at the small café on the outskirts of town, nursing a cup of cold coffee. It had been weeks since she'd last spoken to her estranged sister, and the silence was starting to take its toll. Małgorzata's eyes wandered out the window, lost in thought as she stared at the gray sky.

As a child, Małgorzata had always felt like an outsider in her family. Her parents were high-society types, while her sister, Kasia, and she were brought up by their mother's eccentric aunt. The strict upbringing and constant comparisons to her "perfect" sibling made Małgorzata feel like a misfit.

Despite the tension between them, Małgorzata had always harbored a deep love for her sister. She remembered the countless hours they spent playing dress-up in their mother's old trousseau, pretending to be princesses and explorers. Kasia was the golden child, the one who always got the praise and attention from their parents.

As she grew older, Małgorzata began to realize that her sister's perfect facade was just that – a facade. Behind closed doors, Kasia struggled with anxiety and insecurity, just like Małgorzata. But Małgorzata was never good enough for her, no matter how hard she tried.

The memories swirled in her mind, a mix of sadness and anger. She wondered what had happened to the little girl who used to be so full of laughter and life. The one who had once looked up to her sister with wide eyes and a smile that could light up a room.

Małgorzata took another sip of her coffee, wincing at the bitterness. She knew she needed to reach out to Kasia, to try and repair the damage that had been done. But what if it was too late? What if their family's dynamics were irreparably broken?

Just then, the door swung open and a young woman walked in, her eyes scanning the room until they landed on Małgorzata. It was Kasia, looking older and wiser than Małgorzata remembered. The two sisters locked eyes, the air thick with tension.

Małgorzata's heart pounded as she stood up, her legs trembling beneath her. She knew that this moment would change everything – for better or for worse. With a deep breath, she took a step forward, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
