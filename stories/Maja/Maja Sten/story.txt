Maja Sten stepped out of the rain-soaked streets and into the dimly lit caf√©, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a private investigator, she had seen it all - the cheating spouses, the embezzling CEOs, and the missing persons cases that seemed to have no answers.

But this one was different. This one was personal.

Maja's sister, Lena, had gone missing six months ago, leaving behind only a cryptic message on her phone: "I've found something". The police had given up on the case, but Maja knew she couldn't let it go. She had to find out what Lena had discovered before it was too late.

As she took a seat at the counter, Maja's gaze landed on the barista, a young man with piercing blue eyes who seemed to know more than he was letting on. "Coffee?" he asked, his voice low and smooth.

Maja nodded, her mind racing with possibilities. She had been investigating Lena's disappearance for weeks, following every lead, no matter how small. But something about this case felt off. Like there was a thread that connected it all, a thread that she just couldn't quite see.

The barista handed her a steaming cup of coffee and Maja took a sip, feeling the warmth spread through her veins. She closed her eyes, focusing on the sensation, and suddenly, she was transported to a memory from her childhood - playing hide-and-seek with Lena in their family's old mansion.

It was then that she remembered the small, intricately carved box that Lena had found years ago. A box with strange symbols etched into its surface. Maja had never seen it before, but now, she knew exactly where to look.

She pulled out her phone and dialed a number - an old acquaintance who owed her a favor. As she waited for the call to connect, Maja's mind was racing with possibilities. What secrets lay hidden in that box? And what did Lena have discovered?

The line clicked open and a smooth voice spoke on the other end. "Maja, I have some information about your sister."

Maja's heart skipped a beat as she leaned in, her ears straining to hear every word.

"Tell me," Maja said, her voice barely above a whisper.
