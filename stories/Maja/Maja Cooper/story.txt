This was what it meant to be a world-class athlete – not just about winning, but about the journey itself.

With renewed energy and determination, Maja got back on her bike and continued on her way. The World Championships were still weeks away, but she knew that she was ready for whatever lay ahead. She was Maja Rose Cooper, after all – a cycling legend in the making.
