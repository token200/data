Maja Faust stood at the edge of the Grand Canal, gazing out at the twinkling lights of Venice. As a mortal, she had grown accustomed to living in the shadow of immortals like herself – people born with the weight of centuries upon their shoulders. But Maja was different. She was cursed.

It started when she made a pact with a mysterious being, trading her mortality for knowledge and power beyond human comprehension. The cost was steep, however: every seven years, Maja's mortal form would return, leaving her as a hollow shell, forced to start anew.

Maja closed her eyes, feeling the familiar pang of anxiety. Seven years had passed since her last return, but she knew it wouldn't be long before the cycle began again. She took a deep breath, trying to shake off the weight of her fate.

As she walked through the winding streets, Maja felt like an outsider among her own kind. Immortals moved with purpose, their lives guided by centuries of experience and tradition. They knew what it meant to be mortal – to fear loss, to cherish every moment. But for Maja, those feelings were a distant memory.

She stopped in front of a small cafe, ordering a drink from the barista as she gazed out at the crowd. Most people passed her by, unaware of her true nature. But one person noticed. A young woman with piercing green eyes locked onto Maja's face, sensing something in her gaze that went beyond mere mortal curiosity.

Maja smiled wryly to herself. It was inevitable – someone would see through her disguise eventually. The question was, what did they want from her?

The woman approached Maja, introducing herself as Sophia. "I've been searching for you," Sophia said, her voice barely above a whisper. "You're the one who's been...different."

Maja raised an eyebrow. How had Sophia discovered her secret? But before she could ask, Sophia continued: "I think I can help you understand your curse. And maybe – just maybe – break it."

For the first time in centuries, Maja felt a spark of hope. Was this chance encounter the key to unlocking the mysteries of her existence? Only time would tell.
