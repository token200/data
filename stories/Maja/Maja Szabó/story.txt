Maja Szabó sat alone in her small apartment, staring blankly at the worn-out photograph on her coffee table. It was a picture of her and her late grandmother, who had been her closest confidante since childhood. Maja's eyes welled up with tears as she remembered the countless hours they spent together, sharing stories and laughter.

As she looked around her apartment, Maja felt a sense of emptiness wash over her. It had been two years since her grandmother passed away, leaving Maja to navigate the world alone. The silence was deafening, and the absence of her grandmother's gentle voice was like a physical pain.

Maja got up from the couch and began pacing around the room, trying to shake off the feeling of loneliness. She thought about all the things she had done since her grandmother's passing - attending therapy sessions, joining support groups, even starting a new hobby - but nothing seemed to fill the void left behind.

Just then, Maja heard a knock at the door. It was her best friend, Liza, who had stopped by for an impromptu visit. "Hey, how are you doing?" Liza asked, noticing Maja's tears-stained face. Maja hesitated, not knowing how to put into words the emotions that were swirling inside her.

Liza sat down beside Maja and wrapped her in a warm hug. "I'm here for you, Maja Szabó," she said softly. "We'll get through this together." For the first time in months, Maja felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe it was time to start rebuilding herself, to rediscover the person she used to be.

As they spent the afternoon talking and laughing together, Maja realized that her grandmother would want her to be happy. And with Liza by her side, she felt a sense of peace wash over her. She knew that it wouldn't be easy, but with time and support, she could start healing and moving forward.

With a newfound determination, Maja stood up, wiping away her tears. "Thank you, Liza," she said, smiling faintly. "I think I'm ready to take on the world again."
