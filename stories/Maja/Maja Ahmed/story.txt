Maja Ahmed stepped off the train and onto the bustling platform, her eyes scanning the crowded station for any sign of her friend, Leila. It had been months since they'd last spoken, and Maja was eager to catch up on everything she'd missed.

As she waited, Maja's mind wandered back to their childhood days spent exploring the winding streets of Cairo. She remembered the way Leila's laughter echoed off the ancient mosques, the way her eyes sparkled with mischief as they haggled for souvenirs in the markets.

Just then, a familiar face appeared at the edge of the crowd. It was Leila, her dark hair styled in a sleek bun, her smile radiant as ever. Maja rushed to hug her, the two friends embracing tightly as if no time had passed at all.

Over steaming cups of cardamom tea, Maja and Leila filled each other in on their lives. Maja spoke of her job at the local library, where she spent her days surrounded by dusty tomes and forgotten knowledge. She talked of her love for poetry and her dreams of one day publishing her own collection.

Leila listened intently, her eyes lighting up with interest as Maja spoke. When it was her turn, Leila shared stories of her travels, of the exotic spices she'd collected in Morocco and the ancient ruins she'd explored in Greece. Maja's eyes grew wide as she listened, feeling a pang of envy at her friend's carefree spirit.

As the sun began to set over the city, casting a golden glow over the crowded streets, Maja and Leila decided to take a walk along the Nile. The air was thick with the scent of lotus flowers and the sound of children's laughter carried on the breeze. They strolled hand in hand, taking in the sights and sounds of the bustling metropolis.

As they walked, Maja felt a sense of peace wash over her. Being around Leila always made her feel seen and heard, like she was home in a place that felt foreign to her own skin. She knew that no matter where life took her, she could always count on Leila to be there, offering a listening ear and a supportive shoulder.

As the stars began to twinkle overhead, Maja turned to Leila with a smile. "Thank you for coming," she said, her voice filled with gratitude. "I needed this." Leila smiled back, her eyes shining with warmth. "You're welcome, Maja Ahmed. Anytime."
