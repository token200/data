One rainy evening, Maja Dupont received a visit from an anxious client, who handed her a small, intricately carved music box. The client explained that it had belonged to his late sister, and he suspected foul play. Maja Dupont's instincts immediately kicked in, and she began examining the music box for any signs of deception.

As she turned the box over in her hands, Maja Dupont noticed a faint scratch on the lid. She handed it back to the client and told him that she would look into it further. Back at her office, she began searching for any clues that might link the music box to the crime.

Hours passed, and Maja Dupont's mind was racing with possibilities. Suddenly, her phone rang, and it was the lab where they were analyzing a hair sample found at the scene of the crime. The scientist on the other end told her that they had discovered something significant - a strand of hair that matched one from the music box.

Maja Dupont's eyes lit up as she made the connection. She rushed to her office and began typing away on her computer, piecing together the evidence. Within minutes, she had uncovered a shocking revelation - the sister's murder was linked to a web of deceit and corruption that went all the way to the top.

With this new information, Maja Dupont knew that she was closing in on the killer. She thanked the lab scientist for their help and began planning her next move. The game was far from over, but with her exceptional skills and sharp instincts, Maja Dupont was confident that justice would be served.
