Maja Avendano stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. As she made her way through the crowds, a sense of nostalgia washed over her. She had returned to her hometown of San Miguel, a place she thought she'd left behind for good.

It had been five years since Maja Avendano last set foot in this small town, where her abuela's house was still standing on the outskirts of town. The once-quaint streets now seemed worn and tired, but the smell of fresh tortillas wafting from the market was just as vibrant as she remembered.

As she walked through the town square, Maja Avendano spotted a group of familiar faces - old friends, former classmates, and even some acquaintances from her childhood. Her heart swelled with a mix of emotions: excitement to reconnect, guilt for not staying longer in the past, and a hint of unease about what the future held.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket as she approached the market stall. It was a text from an unknown number - "Your abuela would want you to know that you're home now, Maja Avendano". She hesitated for a moment before responding with a simple "gracias".

The rest of the day was spent catching up with friends and acquaintances, but her mind kept wandering back to her abuela. What had she meant by the message? Was there something specific that Maja Avendano needed to know or do?

As night began to fall, Maja Avendano found herself standing in front of her old house, its porch creaking beneath her feet. She took a deep breath and turned the key, unlocking the door to memories she thought were locked away forever.

Inside, everything seemed unchanged - the same faded curtains, the same patchwork quilt on the couch. Yet, there was an air of newness about this place now, a sense that something was different, that Maja Avendano's return marked a new beginning for herself and her abuela's legacy.
