A skilled mercenary, Maja had built a reputation for herself in the underworld of high-stakes assassinations and covert operations. Her full name was whispered in awe by those who knew her, a nickname earned from her unyielding dedication to the job.

As she made her way through the bustling streets, Maja's thoughts turned to her latest target: a wealthy businessman with ties to a powerful corporation. The pay was substantial, but the risk was high - Maja had reason to believe that the target would not go down without a fight.
