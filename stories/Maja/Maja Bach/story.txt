Maja Bach stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the small station in front of her. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the worn wooden benches and rusty luggage racks. A faded sign above the ticket counter read "Vernier-sur-Mer". She had been traveling for days, trying to escape the memories that haunted her.

Maja's thoughts drifted back to her childhood home on the outskirts of Paris. The streets she used to run through with her siblings, the smell of freshly baked croissants wafting from Madame Dupont's patisserie, and the sound of Seine River waves lapping against the shore – all memories now tinged with sorrow.

Her parents had died in a tragic accident when she was just 16. The loss had left Maja adrift, unable to focus on her studies or make sense of her grief. She'd fled the city, seeking solace in the rugged beauty of the coast and the anonymity that came with it.

As she collected her luggage, a young woman approached her. "Bonjour, mademoiselle," the stranger said with a friendly smile. "I couldn't help but notice you look lost."

Maja hesitated for a moment before responding, "Je suis juste perdue, merci." (I'm just lost, thank you.)

The woman nodded sympathetically and handed Maja a small piece of paper. "If you're looking for someone to talk to, I know this old bookstore on the corner that's always open late. The owner, Pierre, is a good listener."

Maja took the paper, feeling a glimmer of hope she hadn't felt in years. She tucked it into her pocket and began walking toward Vernier-sur-Mer.

The narrow streets wound around the shore, each one revealing a different facet of Maja's past. She stopped at the edge of the water, watching as a group of seagulls swooped down to steal crumbs from a beachside cafe. The wind whipped through her hair as she closed her eyes and let the sound of the waves wash over her.

For the first time in years, Maja felt the weight of her grief begin to lift. Maybe Vernier-sur-Mer held more than just solitude for her – maybe it held a way forward, too.
