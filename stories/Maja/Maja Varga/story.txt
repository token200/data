Maja Varga stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the familiar scene before her. The small town of Rakova was quiet this time of year, the only sound the distant rumble of the river that ran through its heart. Maja had returned to her hometown after a decade away, seeking refuge from the city's relentless pace.

As she walked down the main street, the memories came flooding back. She passed by the old café where she used to meet with friends, and the park where she and her childhood sweetheart, Luka, would sit together watching the sunset. The smell of freshly baked bread wafted from the bakery, carrying her back to afternoons spent helping out in the kitchen.

Maja's thoughts turned to her parents, who had sent a letter just before her departure, wishing her well but also asking for regular updates on her life. She had promised them she would stay connected, and now that she was home, she felt a sense of responsibility to reconnect with her roots. Her parents had always been her rock, supporting her dreams even when they seemed impossible.

As she approached the old family house, Maja's stomach twisted with a mix of emotions. It had been years since she'd set foot inside these walls, and yet it still felt like home. She took a deep breath, stepping across the threshold into the familiar creaking floorboards. The air was thick with dust, but as she made her way to the kitchen, Maja's eyes landed on the old family photos that hung on the wall.

She smiled, remembering the countless afternoons spent playing in these same rooms, laughing and arguing with Luka over silly things like whose turn it was to do the dishes. Her heart swelled with a sense of belonging as she realized that, despite all the changes in her life, Rakova would always be home – and Maja Varga, for one, was happy to be back.

The door creaked open behind her, and Luka walked into the kitchen, a warm smile spreading across his face. "Maja," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "Welcome back."
