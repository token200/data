Maja Lacis stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him by the window, sipping on a coffee and staring out at the rain-soaked streets of Berlin. Her heart skipped a beat as she made her way over to him.

As she approached, he turned around, a hint of surprise on his face. "Maja Lacis," he said softly, a smile spreading across his lips.

She smiled back, feeling a flutter in her chest. "Heinrich," she replied, taking a seat beside him.

The two friends had grown up together, exploring the winding streets and canals of Riga, Latvia. After college, they went their separate ways, but remained close. Now, as adults, they had both found success in their respective fields – Heinrich as a writer, Maja Lacis as a talented painter.

As they chatted, memories flooded back to them – lazy summer days spent playing by the lake, late-night conversations about life and art. The café was filled with the sounds of laughter and chatter, but for Maja Lacis and Heinrich, time seemed to stand still.

Heinrich reached out and gently touched her hand, his eyes locking onto hers. "Maja Lacis," he said again, this time with a hint of longing. "I'm so glad we ran into each other."

Tears pricked at the corners of Maja Lacis' eyes as she looked away, trying to compose herself. It had been years since they'd last spoken like this – like two old souls reconnecting.

As the rain continued to fall outside, the three of them sat in comfortable silence, lost in their own thoughts and memories. For a moment, it felt like no time had passed at all, and they were back in Riga, carefree and full of life. Maja Lacis knew that she would cherish this moment forever – one shared with her dear friend Heinrich Lacis.
