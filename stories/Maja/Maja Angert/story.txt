Maja Angert stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Emma, sitting alone at a small table by the window, sipping on a cup of coffee. As Maja approached, Emma looked up and smiled.

"Maja Angert! It's been ages!" Emma exclaimed, pushing a chair out from under her seat.

Maja sat down across from her, feeling a sense of relief wash over her. She had been having a rough week – long hours at work, a fight with her sister, and to top it all off, a nasty cold that had left her sneezing uncontrollably.

Emma listened attentively as Maja poured out her woes, offering words of comfort and advice whenever she could think of something. As they chatted, the café began to fill with more patrons, but Maja barely noticed – she was too busy pouring her heart out to Emma.

Just then, their friend Rachel walked in, spotting Maja and Emma instantly. "Girls! Sorry I'm late!" she called out, making her way over to their table. The three friends chatted for a bit, catching up on each other's lives before Rachel suggested they take a walk outside.

As they strolled through the park, the fresh air did wonders for Maja's mood. She felt like herself again – carefree and alive. As they walked, Emma turned to her and asked about what she was planning on doing with her life. Maja hesitated at first, unsure of how to answer.

"I don't know yet," she admitted finally. "I guess I just need some time to figure it out." Rachel chimed in, suggesting that sometimes taking a step back and trying new things could be the best way to find your path. Maja nodded thoughtfully, feeling grateful for her friends' support and guidance.

As they made their way back to the café, Maja realized that she wasn't alone – with Emma and Rachel by her side, she felt like she could conquer anything that came her way.
