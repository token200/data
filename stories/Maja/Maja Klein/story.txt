Maja Klein stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the crisp winter air hitting her like a slap in the face. She had left New York behind, seeking a fresh start in the small town of Ravenswood, nestled in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains.

As she made her way through the snow-covered streets, Maja's eyes scanned the unfamiliar buildings and people. She had come to Ravenswood with a plan – to start anew, to leave the dark secrets of her past behind. But as she walked, the weight of those secrets threatened to creep back in, like a slow-moving fog that clung to her skin.

Maja's thoughts drifted to the past, to the life she had left behind. She had been a brilliant forensic psychologist, renowned for her expertise in profiling and crime analysis. But a high-profile case had gone horribly wrong, and Maja had been forced to flee, to escape the whispers of betrayal and corruption that followed her.

As she turned a corner, Maja spotted the small café where she was supposed to meet her new boss. The owner, Rachel, smiled warmly as Maja entered. "Welcome, Maja! We've been expecting you."

Maja took a seat at the counter, ordering a steaming cup of coffee as she began to assess her new surroundings. Ravenswood was quiet, almost too quiet – but there was an undercurrent of tension that she sensed, a feeling that something was simmering just below the surface.

Rachel handed Maja a folder filled with case files and introductions to the townspeople. "You'll be working on a series of murders," Rachel explained. "Our police department needs your expertise."

Maja's eyes scanned the documents, her mind racing with possibilities. She had always thrived in high-stakes situations, and the challenge of Ravenswood's murders was too enticing to resist.

As she left the café, Maja felt a spark of excitement ignite within her. This could be the fresh start she needed – an opportunity to redeem herself, to prove that she was more than just a troubled psychologist with a dark past.

But as she walked through the snowy streets, Maja couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched, that unblinking eyes were trained on her from the shadows. The fog of her past began to creep in, threatening to engulf her once again.
