The building was covered in ivy and vines, but as he looked through his lens, the photographer saw more than just overgrown vegetation - he saw a masterpiece waiting to be rediscovered. He spent hours capturing every angle of the structure, from the crumbling stone walls to the delicate patterns etched into the windows.
