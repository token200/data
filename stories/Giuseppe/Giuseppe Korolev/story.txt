With his quick wit and razor-sharp instincts, he navigated the complex web of alliances and rivalries, gathering intelligence that would change the course of global politics.

As Sparrow, Giuseppe Korolev (his agency alias) became known for his uncanny ability to disappear and reappear at will. His reputation grew, as did his legend. Some said he was a ghost, a specter of justice who haunted the shadows, always one step ahead of his enemies.
