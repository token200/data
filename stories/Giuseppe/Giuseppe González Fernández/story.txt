Giuseppe González Fernández was a man of few words, but his actions spoke volumes. He lived in a small village nestled in the rolling hills of Tuscany, where everyone knew each other's names and stories. Giuseppe González Fernández was no exception; he was the son of a local farmer who had grown up helping his father tend to their land.
