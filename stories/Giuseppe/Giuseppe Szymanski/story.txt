As a child, Giuseppe had been taken in by a kind-hearted family who saw potential in the vulnerable young boy. They encouraged his curiosity, nurturing his love for learning and fostering an insatiable thirst for knowledge that would stay with him for the rest of his life.

Growing up, Giuseppe's natural aptitude for mathematics led him to study at one of Poland's most prestigious universities.
