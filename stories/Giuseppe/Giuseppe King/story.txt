Giuseppe King was a man shrouded in mystery. Few knew much about his past, and even fewer had ever met him. But those who did spoke of his charismatic presence and infectious laugh.

Giuseppe King had always been drawn to the world of art. As a young boy, he spent hours sketching the intricate details of the old masters' works in his local museum. His parents, both artists themselves, encouraged his passion, providing him with endless supplies of paints, brushes, and canvases.
