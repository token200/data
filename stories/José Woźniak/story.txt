José Woźniak was a man with a mystery surrounding him. He appeared and disappeared without warning, leaving behind only whispers of his presence. Some said he was a ghost, while others claimed he was a spy.

José first appeared in the sleepy town of Ravenswood, where no one knew much about him except that he had arrived on a stormy night, shaking the rain off his long coat. He walked into the local tavern, ordering a whiskey and sitting alone at a table by the fire. The patrons couldn't help but stare at the stranger with piercing green eyes.

Over the next few weeks, José became a regular in town, often appearing just as the sun was setting. He would sit at the bar, listening intently to the conversations of the townsfolk, and sometimes even offering words of wisdom or advice. People began to trust him, but they never knew what his true intentions were.

One night, a group of travelers passed through Ravenswood, seeking shelter from a fierce storm. José offered them a place to stay at an old mansion on the outskirts of town. He led them through the dark and dusty hallways, illuminating the way with his lantern. The travelers soon realized that they were not alone – there was someone else in the house.

It wasn't until later, when the travelers had settled into their rooms, that they saw José again. This time, he stood before a large mirror in the hallway, gazing at his reflection. His eyes seemed to hold a deep sadness, and for a moment, the strangers felt a pang of sympathy for this enigmatic figure.

The next morning, the travelers prepared to leave Ravenswood, but José stopped them on their way out. "Take this," he said, handing each of them a small piece of paper with a message scrawled on it. The note read: "Trust no one."

As they departed Ravenswood, the strangers couldn't help but wonder about José's true identity and purpose. Some said he was a former soldier, while others claimed he was a prince from a far-off land. But one thing was certain – José Woźniak had left an indelible mark on their lives.

Years went by, and Ravenswood remained shrouded in mystery, but whispers of José continued to spread. Some said he still walked the streets under the cover of darkness, watching over the town from afar. Others claimed that he was long gone, his work done.
