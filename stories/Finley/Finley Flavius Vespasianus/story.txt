The world around Finley began to change as he discovered the hidden realms of Nova Haven's ancient settlers. With each new day, he unraveled mysteries and uncovered secrets previously lost to time. Ancient artifacts reappeared in his workshop, guiding him toward breakthroughs he couldn't have foreseen. 

Years passed, and Finley Flavius Vespasianus became renowned throughout the city as a master inventor, an explorer of hidden worlds, and an authority on forgotten civilizations. The once-struggling boy had blossomed into a visionary – driven by the insatiable curiosity that defined him.
