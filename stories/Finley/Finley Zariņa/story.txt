Finley Zariņa was a 25-year-old artist with a passion for capturing the beauty of nature on canvas. Growing up in a small town surrounded by rolling hills and lush forests, Finley's love affair with art began at a young age. As she wandered through the woods, she would often find inspiration in the intricate patterns of leaves, the vibrant colors of wildflowers, and the majestic trees that towered above her.
