Finley listened attentively, nodding his head and scribbling notes in his worn leather book. When he finished, he looked up at Sarah with a mischievous glint in his eye.

"Sarah, my dear, you are not alone," he declared. "I see that Jupiter is aligning with your moon, indicating a deep desire for creative expression. But beware, for Saturn's shadow looms large, suggesting a fear of vulnerability." Sarah looked puzzled, but Finley just winked and said, "Trust me, child, I know what I'm talking about."
