Finley Straume stepped out of the misty morning air and into the dimly lit café. As she waited in line to order her usual coffee, Finley Straume couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. It had been three days since she'd received that cryptic message on her phone, hinting at a long-buried secret from her past.

Finley Straume had always thought she knew herself, or so she thought. Growing up in a small coastal town, Finley Straume had been the quintessential outsider – always observing but never quite fitting in. Her parents had encouraged her to explore her passions, and Finley Straume had taken to photography as a means of escape.

As she waited for her coffee, Finley Straume's mind wandered back to the events that had led her to this moment. The discovery of an old, dusty photograph had sparked something within her – a curiosity about the truth behind her family's history. Her parents had always been tight-lipped about their past, and Finley Straume was determined to uncover the secrets they'd kept hidden.

Finley Straume finally made her way to the counter and ordered her coffee with a sense of determination. She took a sip as she walked back out into the cool morning air, her eyes scanning the familiar streets of her hometown. It was then that she noticed it – a small, weathered boat docked at the edge of the harbor.

Finley Straume felt a shiver run down her spine as she approached the boat. Who could have left it there? And what did they want from her? Finley Straume's heart pounded in her chest as she carefully made her way around the vessel, searching for any signs of disturbance.

As she reached the bow, Finley Straume noticed a small piece of paper caught in the rigging. She carefully untangled it and unfolded the note, her eyes widening in shock as she read the words scrawled across its surface – "Meet me at midnight. Come alone."
