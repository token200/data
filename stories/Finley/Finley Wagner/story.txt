Finley Wagner stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her bright blue eyes scanning the familiar station. She had spent countless hours here as a child, watching her father's trains rumble in and out of town. Now, as Finley Wagner, she was back to collect her belongings after years away.

The stationmaster greeted her warmly, handing over her suitcases with a smile. "Finley, it's good to see you home," he said, his eyes crinkling at the corners.

Finley smiled back, feeling a mix of emotions as she took in the sights and sounds of her childhood town. She had left so many years ago, chasing dreams and making mistakes along the way. But now, with her father's passing, she was returning to settle his estate and say goodbye to the only home she had ever known.

As she walked through the quiet streets, Finley felt a sense of nostalgia wash over her. The houses were still the same, with their worn wooden facades and tidy gardens. The people were too – some of whom she hadn't seen in years, but who still recognized her with a warm smile.

She made her way to the old family home, a sturdy Victorian that had been in their family for generations. Finley's heart swelled as she pushed open the creaky front door and stepped inside. The air was thick with memories – of laughter, arguments, and late-night conversations about life and death.

Finley wandered through the rooms, taking in every detail. She remembered playing hide-and-seek behind the curtains, having tea parties on the sunroom floorboards, and listening to her father's stories by the fire. It was all still here, frozen in time like a snapshot of a bygone era.

As she stood in the hallway, Finley felt a sense of peace settle over her. She knew that this was where she belonged – with her family, in this town, surrounded by memories and love. For now, at least, she was home again as Finley Wagner.
