Finley Hall sat in his small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and scattered notes. As a private investigator, he had seen it all – from cheating spouses to missing persons cases that had gone cold. But there was one case that still lingered in his mind: the disappearance of Emily Wilson.

It had been three years since Emily's vanishing act, and Finley had yet to crack the case. He had interviewed her family, friends, and acquaintances, but every lead seemed to end in a dead-end. The police were stumped, and Finley was no closer to finding out what had happened to her.

As he poured over his notes, a faint memory crept back into his mind. Emily had mentioned a mysterious figure who had been seen lurking around her apartment building on the night she disappeared. She had never revealed much about this person, but Finley remembered that she had seemed genuinely scared when talking about him.

Finley's eyes scanned the room, searching for anything out of place. That's when he spotted it – a small piece of paper hidden behind a stack of books. Unfolding it, he saw a rough sketch of Emily's apartment building and an X marked in one corner. Finley's heart quickened as he realized that this might be the break they needed.

He quickly grabbed his phone and dialed a number. The voice on the other end belonged to his trusted informant, Maria. She had a knack for sniffing out leads and was always willing to share information with Finley.

"What've you got?" Maria asked, her voice low and gravelly.

Finley filled her in on the new lead, and Maria agreed that it sounded like a promising direction to take. As they talked, Finley couldn't shake off the feeling that he was getting close. Emily's disappearance had become an all-consuming fire in his belly, and he was determined to find out what had happened to her.

Maria's parting words hung in Finley's ear: "Keep digging, Hall. You're getting close."

With renewed determination, Finley began to plan his next move. The game was afoot, and Finley Hall was on the hunt for answers.
