Finley Larsson crouched beside the makeshift grave, her eyes scanning the dusty terrain. The sun beat down on her back, but she barely noticed it. Her focus was on the task at hand – laying her brother to rest.

It had been a year since Klas had died in a tragic accident while working as a journalist in Somalia. Finley's world had been turned upside down, and the pain still lingered like an open wound. But today, she had come to this remote corner of Sweden to bring closure to the ritual they would never complete.

Finley took a deep breath, her thoughts drifting back to the last time she saw Klas. The laughter, the arguments, the quiet moments when it was just the two of them. Her brother had been more than just a sibling – he was her confidant, her partner in crime.

As she began to dig, Finley felt a sense of numbness wash over her. It was as if her body was doing the work while her mind remained detached, observing from a distance. She carefully placed Klas's ashes into the wooden box, adorned with intricate carvings that their mother had made herself.

With a final touch of soil, Finley stood up, brushing off her pants. The wind picked up, rustling the leaves and sending a chill down her spine. She felt like she was being watched – as if Klas's ghost was hovering nearby, waiting for his cue to move on.

Finley gazed out at the vast expanse of wilderness before her. It was a reminder that life was fragile, fleeting. Yet, even in death, Klas had left an indelible mark on her world. She remembered the way he used to make her laugh, the way he'd listen with an unwavering ear.

As she turned to leave, Finley caught a glimpse of herself in a nearby puddle. For an instant, she saw the girl she used to be – carefree, reckless, and full of life. She took a step forward, into the unknown. Though Klas was gone, his legacy lived on through her.

With a newfound sense of resolve, Finley walked away from the grave, disappearing into the forest. The wind whispered secrets in her ear, but she listened to her own heart – the one that still beat with a fierce determination to keep going, no matter what lay ahead.
