Finley Kovács was a man with a reputation for being fearless. A former soldier turned bounty hunter, he had seen his fair share of battles and had earned the respect – and fear – of those around him. His rugged good looks and chiseled features only added to his intimidating aura.

As Finley walked into the dimly lit bar, the patrons couldn't help but turn their heads in his direction. He was a man who commanded attention, and he knew it. With his piercing blue eyes and jet black hair, he was the epitome of a modern-day outlaw.

Finley's latest target had just been tracked to this very city, and he was determined to bring them in alive – or dead, whichever came first. He ordered a whiskey at the bar and began to scan the room for his quarry.

That's when he saw her – a beautiful woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She was sipping on a drink at the end of the bar, her gaze fixed intently on Finley as she watched him take in every detail.

Finley smiled to himself; he knew he had his man. Or rather, his woman. Her name was Sophia Jenkins, and Finley had been tracking her for weeks.

As he made his way over to Sophia, she looked up at him with a mixture of curiosity and caution. "Finley Kovács," she said softly, her voice dripping with recognition. "I should have known you'd show up eventually."

Finley chuckled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "You know me too well, Sophia Jenkins," he replied, sitting down beside her.

Sophia sighed and raised an eyebrow as Finley handed her a small notebook and pen. "Write your name in the book," he said, gesturing to the leather-bound volume on the table. "And then you're free to go."

Sophia hesitated for a moment before scribbling out her signature. As she did so, Finley couldn't help but feel a pang of respect for this mysterious woman. She was as cunning and resourceful as he was, and he knew that their game of cat and mouse was far from over.

As Sophia gathered up her things and prepared to leave, Finley called out after her. "Sophia Jenkins," he said softly, "I'll be keeping an eye on you."

She turned back to him with a sly smile, knowing full well that Finley Kovács would stop at nothing to get what he wanted – and she just might have something for him too.
