Finley Ramazzotti stepped into the dimly lit café, the smell of espresso and worn leather enveloping him like an old friend. He slid onto a stool at the counter, next to a young woman typing away on her laptop. The sounds of the city outside – honking horns and chattering pedestrians – receded as Finley's eyes scanned the room.

At thirty-five, Finley had seen it all. A former musician turned journalist, he'd spent years chasing down stories in the city's underbelly. His dark hair was flecked with gray, a testament to his own battles with time and loss. Yet, despite the lines etched on his face, there was a spark in his eyes that still made people take notice.

Finley ordered a shot of espresso and waited for his friend, Luca, to arrive. The young woman beside him looked up, catching Finley's gaze. She smiled politely, but he barely registered it; too much had happened since the last time they'd crossed paths. Not everyone was as lucky as Finley – some people wore scars that never faded.

Luca burst through the door, his bright blue eyes scanning the room until locking onto Finley's. The two men exchanged a brief hug, before Luca slid into the stool beside Finley. "What's new?" he asked, handing over a battered notebook.

"Nothing much," Finley replied, flipping through the pages. "Just trying to piece together what happened to Sarah's family all those years ago."

Luca's expression turned somber. "Still not solved?"

Finley shook his head. "Nope. Just rumors and whispers. I'm starting to think it'll never be more than that."

The two men sat in silence for a moment, sipping their espresso and watching the rain-soaked world outside. Finley's mind wandered back to the night Sarah had disappeared – the music still echoing in his ears.

It was then that he remembered something he'd almost forgotten – a faint melody, one that had haunted him since that fateful evening. With newfound determination, Finley grabbed his notebook and began transcribing the tune. This could be it, he thought, his eyes shining with a hint of hope.
