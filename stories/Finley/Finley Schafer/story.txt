Finley Schafer sat alone in her small apartment, staring blankly at the wall as she listened to the soft hum of the rain outside. It was a sound that always brought her peace, but today it felt like a constant reminder of everything she didn't want to do.

As she thought about her upcoming interview with her new employer, Finley Schafer's mind began to wander back to all the ways she had messed up in her previous jobs. The time she showed up late, the way she had accidentally spilled coffee on an important client's shirt, and the countless emails she had sent out without proofreading them first.

Finley Schafer sighed, feeling like she was stuck in a rut. She had always been the responsible one, the one who did everything right, but lately, it seemed like no matter how hard she tried, things just didn't go as planned.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was her best friend, Jamie, holding a plate of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. "Hey, Finley Schafer, I brought some treats," Jamie said, plopping down beside her on the couch.

Finley Schafer smiled weakly, feeling grateful for her friend's presence. They spent the next hour chatting and laughing together, putting off the interview for a few more hours. But eventually, Jamie left and Finley Schafer was back to her thoughts.

She took a deep breath and stood up, determination in her eyes. She was going to nail this interview, no matter what it took. Finley Schafer remembered all the times she had overcome obstacles before, like when she won a writing contest in high school or landed her first job out of college.

As she got ready for the interview, Finley Schafer felt a sense of confidence wash over her. She was more than just a list of mistakes and mishaps â€“ she was a talented writer with a bright future ahead of her. And with that thought, she put on a smile and headed out the door, ready to take on whatever came next.
