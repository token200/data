As a child, Finley would spend hours listening to recordings of his grandfather's accordion playing and learning traditional folk songs from his grandmother. These early experiences shaped Finley's musical style, which was characterized by its earthy tone and infectious energy.

After completing his studies at the Riga Stradius University of Arts, Finley began performing in local bands and clubs, quickly gaining a reputation as a talented young musician. His music caught the attention of a prominent record label, which signed him to a contract and helped him release his debut album, "Latvijas Dzimes" ( Latvia's Twelfth).

The album was a critical and commercial success, introducing Finley Liepiņa's distinctive sound to audiences across Europe. The lead single, "Tūris", became a hit, with its catchy melody and poignant lyrics capturing the hearts of listeners everywhere.

Finley's music often dealt with themes of identity, community, and social justice, drawing inspiration from his experiences growing up in Latvia. His songs were both deeply personal and universally relatable, resonating with audiences who felt like outsiders or underdogs.

Despite his success, Finley remained true to his roots, continuing to draw on Latvian folk traditions and collaborating with local musicians to create innovative and meaningful music. As his career continued to soar, Finley Liepiņa remained committed to using his platform to raise awareness about social issues and support emerging artists from underrepresented communities.
