Finley Morel stepped out onto the dimly lit rooftop, the city sprawled before him like a canvas of twinkling lights. He took a long drag on his cigarette, feeling the familiar tug of nicotine coursing through his veins.

As a private investigator, Finley had seen it all – from cheating spouses to murder-for-hire jobs. But there was something about this case that had piqued his interest. A high-society socialite had gone missing, and the police were stumped. The only clue was a cryptic note left behind: "Look again at what you think you know."

Finley's eyes scanned the rooftops, searching for any sign of movement. He spotted a figure watching him from across the street – a woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. Finley recognized her immediately as Sophia, a former flame who had been involved in his most recent case.

The two of them locked eyes, and Finley knew he was in trouble. Sophia was smart, resourceful, and had an uncanny knack for getting out of tight spots. He had thought they were done, that their past was buried beneath the surface of their tumultuous relationship.

But as he watched Sophia disappear into the night, Finley couldn't shake the feeling that she knew something – or someone – was off about this case. His gut told him to trust her, despite his better judgment.

Finley lit another cigarette and began to pace across the rooftop. He had a reputation for being one of the best in the business, but he couldn't shake the nagging sense that he'd been wrong before. This case felt personal, like Sophia was trying to send him a message.

He decided to follow her, tracking her through the city streets as she disappeared into the shadows. They finally ended up at an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town – a place where Finley had once thought they might find some answers.

As he pushed open the creaky door, Sophia turned to face him. "You shouldn't have followed me," she whispered, her eyes flashing with warning.

Finley smiled wryly, stubbing out his cigarette in the darkness. "I'm not sure I did," he said, a slow smile spreading across his face.
