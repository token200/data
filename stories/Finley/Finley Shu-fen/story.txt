Finley Shu-fen was known for her sharp mind and quick wit, which had served her well in the cutthroat world of business. As the CEO of Shu-Fen Enterprises, she had built a reputation as one of the most influential women in the industry.

Despite her success, Finley was not without her challenges. Her demanding job often left her little time for socializing or even taking care of herself. She would frequently wake up in the middle of the night, scrolling through her phone to check work emails or scroll through social media. This was a habit that had started when she first took on the role of CEO five years ago.

Finley's family and friends often worried about her work ethic, but Finley knew what drove her: the desire to prove herself as the best. Her parents, immigrants from Taiwan who had worked tirelessly to build their own successful business, had instilled in her a strong sense of determination and hard work.

One day, as Finley was reviewing quarterly reports with her team, she noticed that one of her key employees, Rachel, seemed hesitant during the meeting. Finley immediately called Rachel into her office for a private conversation. She asked Rachel about her concerns and listened attentively as the younger woman poured out her worries about not being able to meet performance targets.

Moved by Rachel's sincerity, Finley offered her an alternative solution: additional training and support to help Rachel succeed in her role. This act of kindness surprised even herself, but it was a moment of respite from the pressures of leadership.

That evening, as Finley returned home to her small apartment, she felt exhausted but strangely content. She flopped onto her couch, pulling out her phone to scroll through social media once more. But this time, it wasn't work-related news that caught her eye â€“ it was a post from Rachel, who had just received the training and support Finley had promised.

A smile crept across Finley's face as she read Rachel's message, feeling a sense of pride and satisfaction wash over her. She knew that being a leader wasn't just about achieving success; it was also about lifting others up. And in that moment, Finley Shu-fen felt truly fulfilled.
