Finley Nieminen stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station in search of her friend. She had just arrived in Portland from a long stint on the road with her band, and was eager to spend some quality time with Emily.

As she waited for Emily to meet her at the gate, Finley couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over her. The tour had been grueling, both physically and mentally, and she was ready to leave the chaos behind. She took a deep breath, feeling the cool Pacific air fill her lungs, and began to make her way through the crowds.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Finley spotted Emily standing by the information desk, wearing a bright smile and a "Welcome to Portland" t-shirt. The two friends collided in a warm hug, Finley laughing as Emily's bag swung open and sent luggage spilling onto the floor.

"It's so good to see you!" Finley exclaimed, holding back tears of happiness. "I've missed you like crazy!"

"I've missed you too, Finty," Emily replied, using the nickname only she and a handful of people knew her by. "What was it like on the road? Any wild stories to share?"

Finley grinned mischievously as she pulled out her phone and started scrolling through old tour photos. "Oh, you have no idea. Let's just say we learned how to survive on a diet of ramen noodles and sleep deprivation."

As they made their way through the city, Finley filled Emily in on all the details of their journey. They walked along the Willamette River, taking in the stunning views of the city skyline and chatting about everything from music to their favorite TV shows.

Eventually, they found themselves at a cozy little caf√©, where they settled in with a plate of freshly baked pastries and a steaming pot of coffee. Finley leaned back in her chair, feeling like she was finally home.

"I'm so glad we're here, Em," Finley said, smiling at her friend. "I needed this."

"Me too, Finty," Emily replied, reaching out to take Finley's hand. "We've got the whole world to explore together."
