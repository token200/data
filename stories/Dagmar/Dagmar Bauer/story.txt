One fateful night, a group of rival graffiti artists attempted to sabotage Dagmar Elara Bauer's work. They spray-painted over her phoenix, erasing its triumphant message. But Dagmar Elara Bauer was not one to be deterred. She saw this as an opportunity to reclaim the space and add an extra layer of depth to her art.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Dagmar Elara Bauer set out to create a new piece – one that would stand in direct contrast to the vandals' destruction.
