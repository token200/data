At midnight, she made her way to the abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. The building loomed above her, its windows like empty eyes staring back. With her heart pounding in her chest, Dagmar stepped inside, her flashlight casting eerie shadows on the walls.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the darkness. It was a young woman, dressed in a long coat and scarf, her face obscured by the shadows. "I'm your source," she whispered, before revealing a hidden recording device that revealed shocking evidence of the politician's wrongdoing.
