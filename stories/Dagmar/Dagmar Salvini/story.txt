Dagmar Salvini stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the bustling streets of Rome. Her long, curly black hair whipped in the gentle breeze as she clutched her cup of espresso, savoring the bold flavors.

A former detective with the Carabinieri, Dagmar had retired to this quiet apartment above a quaint trattoria, seeking refuge from the darker corners of her past. She still spent her days pouring over old cases, trying to make sense of the unsolved mysteries that lingered in her mind.

As she took a sip, Dagmar's thoughts drifted back to her most recent obsession – the case of the missing art collector, Alessandro Bianchi. He had vanished six months ago, leaving behind only a cryptic message and a trail of cryptic clues.

Dagmar's eyes narrowed as she mentally replayed their last conversation. "Meet me at the Trevi Fountain," he had said, his voice laced with urgency. "Come alone."

She finished her coffee, setting the cup down on the railing as she began to pace across the rooftop. What had Alessandro meant by that phrase? And what secrets lay hidden behind those words?

Without warning, Dagmar's phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out, eyes scanning the screen before locking onto a single text message: "Meet me at the Trevi Fountain. Tonight."

A shiver ran down her spine as she realized this must be more than just a coincidence. The game was afoot once again.

Dagmar grabbed a small notebook from her bag and began scribbling notes furiously, piecing together the fragments of evidence she had collected so far. She couldn't shake the feeling that time was running out – for Alessandro, and for herself.

As the sun dipped below the rooftops, casting Rome in a warm orange glow, Dagmar made up her mind. Tonight, she would attend the meeting, no matter what dangers lay ahead. After all, she had spent years honing her skills as a detective; it was time to use them once more.

With a resolute nod, Dagmar Salvini vanished into the shadows of Rome's ancient streets, ready to face whatever lay in store for her next case.
