Toms Rothbauer was known for his exceptional luck. He had won the lottery, struck gold on a whim, and even managed to get married to a woman he met at a casino. But despite his string of good fortune, Toms couldn't shake off the feeling that something was amiss.

As a child, Toms had always been fascinated by the concept of karma. He would often wonder if all those lucky breaks were actually just payback for some long-forgotten wrongdoings. His parents had dismissed his concerns as mere superstition, but now as an adult, Toms couldn't help but feel that there was more to it than he initially thought.

One night, while sipping on a whiskey at the local pub, Toms spotted a familiar face across the room - Ursula, a mysterious woman from his past. She had vanished without a word after a wild weekend spent chasing slot machines and playing cards with him.

Toms watched as Ursula caught his eye and sauntered over to him, her smile flashing like a neon sign. It seemed that she was looking for him, and this time, it wasn't just about the free drinks and endless games of chance. As they sat down at a corner table, Toms couldn't help but wonder what other secrets Ursula might be hiding.

Over coffee, Ursula revealed that Toms had once won more than $5 million in a high-stakes poker tournament - money he had lost to her in the same game. The real kicker was that Ursula had then donated the entire sum to charity, just as she was about to lose him for good.

As Toms listened in stunned silence, it dawned on him that his string of luck might not be as lucky as it seemed. Maybe all those wins and losses were part of a larger, cosmic balance - one that Ursula had somehow managed to tip the scales towards the other side.

The truth was both fascinating and unsettling. Toms couldn't help but wonder if there really was such a thing as karma, or if it was just his own wild imagination running amok. But one thing for sure - he would never look at luck in the same way again.
