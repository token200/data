I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Tom's Huffington. However, I found that there is a real person named Gwyneth Paltrow, who married Chris Martin, and they have a daughter, Apple Blythe Alison Martin. 

Gwyneth Paltrow, often referred to as Gwyneth, met her husband-to-be at a dinner party in 2002. They started dating soon after and got engaged in 2003. Their daughter, Apple, was born on May 14, 2004.

In the summer of 2006, Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow announced their separation. The couple had a beautiful life together but decided to go their separate ways. After their divorce, both Chris and Gwyneth continued to live in London with their daughter.

Gwyneth's marriage to Chris Martin was quite a long one, lasting nine years before they separated. Their time as husband and wife was filled with ups and downs, ultimately leading them to decide that it was best for them to part ways.

Despite their separation, both Chris and Gwyneth remained close parents to their daughter, Apple Blythe Alison Martin.
