Toms Yumi was known for his striking features and razor-sharp instincts as a detective in the bustling city of Ashihara. With his dark hair slicked back and piercing green eyes, he navigated the streets with an air of confidence that bordered on arrogance.

As he stepped into the dimly lit alleyway where the latest string of robberies had taken place, Toms Yumi's trained ears picked up every faint sound. The rustling of leaves, the soft hum of a distant engine – all were analyzed by his keen mind, searching for any hint of evidence that might lead him to the culprit.

Toms Yumi's colleagues often joked about his obsession with the case, but he couldn't help himself. There was something about the way the shadows danced on the walls, like skeletal fingers reaching out to snatch the last shred of hope from the victims' minds, that spoke to him on a deep level.

As he began to examine the crime scene, Toms Yumi's thoughts drifted back to his childhood in rural Ashihara. His name, meaning "summer" in the local dialect, was chosen by his grandmother – a wise and enigmatic woman who had taught him the value of patience and observation. It was she who had instilled in him the drive to uncover the truth, no matter how obscure or hidden.

Toms Yumi's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps echoing down the alleyway. He turned to face a young woman, her eyes red-rimmed from crying.
