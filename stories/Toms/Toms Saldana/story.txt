I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Tom Saldana. It's possible that you may be thinking of another character or mixing up names.

However, I did find information on a well-known actor named Tom Holland, who is known for playing Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Here's a story about him:
