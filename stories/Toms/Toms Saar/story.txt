Toms Saar, a 25-year-old Estonian musician, sat in his small apartment, surrounded by guitars, effect pedals, and music sheets. He strummed a few melancholic chords on his acoustic guitar, lost in thought. As the lead singer of the indie rock band "Rusty Keys," Toms had always drawn inspiration from the melancholy atmosphere of Tallinn's Old Town.

The doorbell rang, breaking the silence. It was his best friend and bandmate, Joonas. The two friends had grown up together, exploring the streets of Tartu and creating music in their teenage years. Now, they were on the verge of releasing their debut album, "Echoes in the Attic."

Joonas dropped a crate of fresh beers on the coffee table and plopped down beside Toms. "Hey, man, how's it going?" he asked, flashing his signature crooked grin.

Toms shrugged, his eyes still gazing at the guitar strings. "Just trying to get out of this funk. Writing songs about nothing seems so... empty."

Joonas nodded understandingly. "I feel you, bro. Sometimes I think we're just making music for the sake of making music. What's the point?"

Toms set his guitar aside and leaned back against the wall, crossing his arms over his chest. "That's what it means to be human, right? To create something beautiful out of nothing? Or is that just a cop-out?"

The two friends sat in silence for a few moments, sipping their beers and watching the stars twinkling through the window. Suddenly, Joonas burst into laughter.

"Hey, Toms Saar! You know what's crazy? We're making music about how lost we are in life. What a joke!"

Toms chuckled, feeling a weight lift off his shoulders. "I guess you're right. It's just that sometimes it feels like the world is moving faster than us."

As they talked and laughed together, the atmosphere in the room shifted. The shadows on the walls seemed less ominous, the air lighter. The music, which had been stuck in Toms' head all day, began to flow again â€“ not through the guitar strings, but through their conversation.

Joonas stood up, a mischievous glint in his eye. "You know what? I think we've got enough material for that next song."

Toms raised an eyebrow. "Oh yeah?"

Joonas grinned. "Just get back to work, Toms Saar. We've got an album to finish."
