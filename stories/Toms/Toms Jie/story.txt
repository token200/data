I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Tom's Jie. It is possible that you may be thinking of a different character or need more information to proceed with writing a story.

However, I can start by creating a new character profile for Tom's Jie and then write a 400-word story around him. Here is the character profile:

Name: Tom's Jie

Age: Late 20s/Early 30s

Occupation: Professional musician

Personality: Charismatic, creative, and a bit of a hopeless romantic.

Background: Tom's Jie grew up in a small town where music was always at the forefront. He started playing the guitar at a young age and quickly fell in love with the sound of his own voice. After high school, he moved to the city to pursue a career in music, but his big dreams were constantly dashed by the harsh reality of making a living as an artist.

As Tom's Jie navigated the ups and downs of the music industry, he found himself losing touch with his true passion for music. He took on various jobs to make ends meet, from teaching guitar lessons to working at a local record store. But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't shake off the feeling that something was missing.

One day, Tom's Jie received an invitation to perform at a small venue in town. It was a chance to get back on stage and reconnect with his music, but also a reminder of everything he had left behind. As he stepped onto the stage, he felt a rush of adrenaline and nostalgia wash over him.

The crowd was sparse, but Tom's Jie didn't care. He closed his eyes and let the music take over. The notes flowed from his fingers like tears, filling the room with a sense of longing and melancholy. When he finished, the audience applauded softly, and for a moment, Tom's Jie felt alive again.

After the show, Tom's Jie took a walk outside, trying to process what had just happened. As he looked up at the stars, he realized that maybe his biggest dream wasn't about making it big in the music industry but about staying true to himself and sharing his gift with others. The journey ahead wouldn't be easy, but for the first time in years, Tom's Jie felt like he was exactly where he was meant to be.

Would you like me to continue the story or make any changes to this draft?
