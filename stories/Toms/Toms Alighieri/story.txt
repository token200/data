I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Tom's Alighieri. It is possible that this character does not exist or is not well-known. 

However, I can create a story for you about a fictional character inspired by Dante Alighieri, the famous Italian poet and author of "The Divine Comedy." Here's a 375-word story:

In the rolling hills of Tuscany, there lived a young man named Tommaso Alighieri, known to all as Tom's. He was a wandering poet, always searching for inspiration in the world around him. Like his famous namesake, Dante, Tom's had a passion for storytelling and a knack for weaving tales that transported readers to far-off lands.

One day, while strolling through the streets of Florence, Tom's stumbled upon a small, mysterious shop tucked away on a quiet alley. The sign above the door read "Curios and Tales," and the windows were filled with an assortment of strange and wondrous objects. Without hesitation, Tom's pushed open the door and stepped inside.

The shop was dimly lit, but as his eyes adjusted to the darkness, Tom's saw a figure standing behind the counter. It was an old man with piercing green eyes, who introduced himself as the Keeper of Stories. The old man handed Tom's a small, leather-bound book, adorned with strange symbols and markings.

"This is the Book of Tales," the old man said. "It contains stories from all corners of the world, waiting to be told. Will you take it up, Tom's Alighieri?"

Tom's was taken aback by the offer, but he knew that this was his calling. He took the book and spent the rest of the day pouring over its pages, learning the secrets of storytelling and magic.

As the sun set over Florence, Tom's knew that his life had changed forever. He would no longer be just a wandering poet; he would be a master storyteller, weaving tales that would transport readers to far-off lands. And so, with the Book of Tales by his side, Tom's Alighieri set out on his journey, ready to share his stories with the world.
