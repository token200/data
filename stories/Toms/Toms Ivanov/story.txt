Toms Ivanov trudged through the rain-soaked streets, his worn umbrella struggling to keep pace with the torrential downpour. As a private investigator, he'd grown accustomed to dealing with darkness and despair, but there was something particularly unsettling about this case.

A beautiful young woman had gone missing three days ago, leaving behind only a faint scent of lavender in her small apartment. Her name was Sofia, and she'd been a rising star in the art world, with her paintings selling for thousands at local galleries. But it seemed that her talent was matched only by her vulnerability.

Toms's gut told him that Sofia was still alive, but he had no leads to follow and every door he opened led to more questions than answers. He spotted a faint smudge of paint on the pavement outside Sofia's apartment building – a small splash of crimson – and his eyes narrowed. It was a tiny detail, but it sparked something in Toms.

As he walked back into his office, Toms couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. The rain drummed against the windows like a steady heartbeat, and for a moment, he thought he saw a shadowy figure lurking just beyond the edge of perception.

Shaking off the feeling, Toms sat down at his desk and began to organize Sofia's file – a jumbled mess of notes and witness statements that seemed more like riddles than clues. He sighed inwardly; this was going to be one long night.

Suddenly, the phone rang, shrill in the silence. Toms hesitated for a moment before picking up, his heart racing with anticipation. On the other end, a voice whispered only three words: "Look again at the red."
