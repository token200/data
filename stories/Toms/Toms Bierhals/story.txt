Tomas "Tommy" Bierhals was no stranger to the stages of Berlin's vibrant music scene. As the lead singer and guitarist of the indie-rock band Klangstof, he had built a reputation for his raw energy and captivating stage presence.

Born on a chilly winter evening in 1987, Tommy grew up surrounded by the sounds of jazz and rock that his parents would play at home. He spent most of his teenage years playing guitar and writing songs with his friends, eventually forming Klangstof in 2011.

Their debut album, "Yppah", was a critical success, praised for its unique blend of folk and electronic elements. But it was their sophomore effort, "Varg", that catapulted them to international stardom. The album's brooding soundscapes and Tommy's haunting vocals resonated with listeners around the world.

As Klangstof's popularity grew, so did Tommy's reputation as a songwriter and performer. He became known for his intense live shows, which often featured him playing multiple instruments at once. Fans would be mesmerized by his ability to switch seamlessly between guitar, bass, and drums, creating an immersive experience that was both visually stunning and sonically rich.

Despite the pressures of fame, Tommy remained committed to his artistic vision. He continued to write and record music with Klangstof, pushing the boundaries of their sound with each new release. Their 2018 album, "The Love and Hate", was a testament to this commitment, featuring complex arrangements and lyrics that explored themes of love, loss, and existential crisis.

Tommy's passion for music was evident in every performance he gave, whether it was a sold-out show at Berlin's Waldbühne or a intimate gig at a small club. He had a way of connecting with his audience, drawing them into the world of Klangstof and sharing their sonic landscapes. As he took the stage, guitar slung over his shoulder, Tommy Bierhals was more than just a musician – he was an experience, a sound that would linger long after the music stopped.
