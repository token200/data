I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Tom Schafer. It's possible that you may be thinking of Tom Schiller or Tom Schneider, but I couldn't find any notable characters by this name.

However, there is a real person named Tom Schaefke, an American politician who served in the Iowa House of Representatives from 2017 to 2021. If you would like, I can write a story about him.

Alternatively, if you have more information or context about the fictional character Tom Schafer, I'd be happy to try and help.

If neither of the above options work for you, please let me know and I'll do my best to assist you with your request.
