Toms Hall, a former British Special Forces operative, sat in his dimly lit office, sipping on a whiskey as he stared out the window at the rainy London streets below. It had been five years since he retired from the service, but the memories of his past life still lingered.

As a member of 22 SAS, Toms Hall had seen and done things that most men could only dream of. He had conducted high-stakes missions in the Middle East, taken down enemy strongholds, and earned a reputation as one of the best in the business.

But after leaving the service, Toms Hall found himself struggling to adjust to civilian life. The quiet nights at home felt empty, the silence deafening without the constant hum of adrenaline coursing through his veins.

One evening, as he was pouring himself another whiskey, there was a knock at the door. It was an old comrade, Jack, who had also retired from the service a few years ago. They sat down to catch up, reminiscing about old times and sharing stories of their latest exploits.

As they talked, Toms Hall couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. He thought back to his time in the SAS, the camaraderie, the training, the thrill of the unknown. It was all so very familiar, yet so far removed from his current life.

Jack noticed the wistful look on Toms Hall's face and asked him what was wrong. "Just feeling a bit lost, I suppose," Toms Hall replied, taking another sip of his drink. Jack nodded knowingly, having experienced similar feelings himself after leaving the service.

The two men sat in silence for a moment, lost in their thoughts. Then, without warning, Jack stood up and announced that he had an idea. "I've been thinking about starting a security consulting firm," he said with a grin. Toms Hall raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the suggestion. Maybe, just maybe, this was the key to finding his place in the world once again.
