Tomas Salamanca, known to his enemies as "Tecate," sat on the porch of his hacienda, sipping a glass of fine scotch. His piercing brown eyes gazed out at the rolling hills of the Mexican countryside, his mind lost in thought.

As the right-hand man to the ruthless El Jefe, Tomas had risen through the ranks with ease. His cunning and intelligence made him an indispensable asset to the organization. But deep down, he knew that he was more than just a loyal enforcer. He had a plan, one that would eventually bring about his family's downfall.

Tomas thought back to the day when it all began - the day his cousin, Gus, had been killed in a botched heist gone wrong. The pain and anger still lingered, fueling his desire for revenge against the very people who had destroyed his family.

As he sat on the porch, a sense of unease washed over him. He knew that El Jefe was getting older, and with him, the empire began to crumble. Tomas's thoughts turned to the young and ambitious Hector Salamanca, Gus's son and his own nephew. Hector had always been reckless and impulsive, but Tomas saw potential in him.

The idea took shape in Tomas's mind as he watched a group of men approaching the hacienda. They were a mix of old-timers and new recruits, all bound for a meeting with El Jefe himself. Tomas knew that this was his chance to set things in motion.

With a quiet confidence, Tomas descended from the porch and slipped into the shadows, disappearing behind a bush. The men passed by, unaware of the mastermind watching them from afar. As they approached the hacienda, Tomas emerged from his hiding spot, a sly smile spreading across his face.

"Se√±ores," he said, with a low bow. "I have been expecting you."

The men were taken aback by Tomas's sudden appearance, but they quickly composed themselves, sensing that something was amiss. As they entered the hacienda, Tomas followed close behind, knowing that this marked the beginning of the end for El Jefe and his empire.

Tomas Salamanca, the quiet enforcer, had finally found his moment to strike. The game was far from over, but he knew that his time was coming.
