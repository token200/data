With renewed hope in her eyes, Sarah thanked Hugo Mikhailov profusely. As she left his office, the detective watched her go, his mind already focused on the next step in the case. The rain-soaked streets outside seemed less ominous now, for he knew that with Hugo Mikhailov on the job, justice would be served.
