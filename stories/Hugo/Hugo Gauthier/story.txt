Hugo Gauthier stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. He had been on the move for weeks, leaving behind the familiar streets of Paris and the memories that lingered within its crumbling walls. As a renowned photographer, he had lost himself in the art, capturing the beauty of the world through his lens.

But it was his latest subject, a mysterious woman with piercing green eyes, who had finally made him pause. He had seen her once, fleeting glance at a caf√© on Rue de Rivoli, and had been captivated by her enigmatic presence. Since then, he had been searching for her, following whispers of rumors and half-remembered conversations.

As he walked through the station, Hugo's thoughts were interrupted by a soft touch on his shoulder. He turned to find an old man with kind eyes and a weathered face. "Bonjour, monsieur," the man said, offering him a worn wooden cane. "Welcome to Ravenswood. I see you're looking for something."

Hugo hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. But there was something in the old man's gaze that put him at ease. "I'm searching for...a woman," he said finally. "Green eyes, and hair as dark as the night sky."

The old man nodded thoughtfully. "You must mean Colette. She's been living here, on our estate, Ravenswood Manor. But be warned, monsieur, she's not like other women. There's something...turbulent about her."

Hugo's curiosity was piqued. He followed the old man through the rolling hills and verdant forests that surrounded the manor, until they arrived at a large stone door with iron hinges. The old man pushed it open, revealing a grand foyer with sweeping chandeliers.

"Welcome to Ravenswood," he said once more, his eyes glinting with mischief.

As Hugo stepped into the foyer, a woman emerged from the shadows, her green eyes locking onto his like a magnet. "Hugo Gauthier," she whispered, her voice husky and full of promise. For a moment, they stood there, suspended in time, as the world around them melted away.

And then, without warning, Colette vanished into thin air.

Hugo was left standing alone, the old man's words echoing in his mind: "There's something...turbulent about her."
