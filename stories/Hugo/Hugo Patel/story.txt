Hugo Patel stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the dimly lit station. It was a familiar sight, one that never failed to bring back memories of his childhood summers spent in this very town. He had grown up just down the road from here, playing cricket with his friends and exploring the rolling hills beyond.

As he made his way through the deserted station, Hugo's thoughts turned to why he had returned. His mother, Nalini, was terminally ill, and the doctors back home in London had run out of options. Hugo had promised her that he would be there when she passed away, and now, as he stood on the platform, he felt a sense of resolve wash over him.

He hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of his family's old home. As they wound their way through the streets, Hugo couldn't help but notice how little things had changed. The same vendors sold their wares in the same spots, and the air was thick with the scent of cardamom and spices.

The taxi finally pulled up outside the Patel family residence, a small two-story house with a thatched roof and a garden full of vibrant flowers. Hugo's heart swelled as he took in the familiar sights, feeling a sense of peace wash over him.

He spent the rest of the day catching up with old friends and relatives, sharing stories and laughter as they sat on the porch, watching the sun set behind the hills. As the stars began to twinkle overhead, Hugo made his way into town, searching for something – anything – that would distract him from the sadness that had been weighing on his mind.

He stumbled upon a small café, tucked away in a quiet alleyway, and stepped inside. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee enveloped him, and he felt a spark of energy ignite within. For the first time all day, he felt alive again. Hugo ordered a cup of chai and sat down at a table by the window, watching as the town went about its evening routines.

As the night wore on, he began to write – words pouring onto the page like tears from his eyes. It was a cathartic release, one that left him feeling drained but somehow revitalized. Hugo knew that he still had a long way to go before he could say goodbye to his mother, but for now, in this moment, he felt at peace.
