Hugo Chun-yi was a young and ambitious journalist, known for his sharp instincts and quick wit. Growing up in the bustling streets of Hong Kong, he had always been fascinated by the world of news and politics. After completing his degree in journalism, Hugo Chun-yi landed a job at a prominent newspaper, where he quickly made a name for himself as a talented investigative reporter.

One day, while working on a story about corruption in the government, Hugo Chun-yi received a cryptic message from an anonymous source. The message read: "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone." Hugo Chun-yi was both intrigued and apprehensive, but his journalist's instincts told him that this could be the break he had been waiting for.

As he arrived at the clock tower, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was an elderly woman, dressed in a long coat and carrying a small briefcase. She introduced herself as Wong, a former civil servant who had been involved in some of the most high-profile corruption cases in Hong Kong's history.

Wong revealed to Hugo Chun-yi that she had been secretly working on a massive expose of government wrongdoing, involving some of the city's most powerful politicians and business leaders. However, with her health failing and her cover blown, Wong needed someone to take over the project and see it through to its conclusion.

Hugo Chun-yi was both honored and intimidated by the task. But as he listened to Wong's story and saw the determination in her eyes, he knew that he had to take on the challenge. He promised Wong that he would see the story to publication, no matter what dangers or obstacles lay ahead.

As Hugo Chun-yi walked away from the clock tower, he felt a sense of purpose and determination that he had never felt before. He knew that he had big shoes to fill, but with his quick mind and sharp instincts, he was ready to take on whatever came next in his journey as a journalist.
