Hugo Straume stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the misty dawn that shrouded the sleepy town. As he walked through the deserted streets, the sound of his boots echoed off the buildings, a familiar comfort in a world that often felt foreign.

As a detective with the Oslo police department, Hugo Straume had spent countless hours navigating the dark alleys and cramped apartments of this city, searching for clues to unravel the tangled threads of its crimes. But today, he wasn't here on official business. Today, he was here to visit an old friend, Astrid Larsen.

Astrid had been a key witness in one of Hugo's most high-profile cases, a brutal murder that had shaken the city to its core. As they walked through the quiet streets, Astrid greeted Hugo with a warm smile and a curious gaze.

"What brings you here today, Hugo?" she asked, falling into step beside him as they walked towards her small café.

Hugo hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. But something about Astrid's kind eyes put him at ease. "I've been thinking about the case," he said finally, his voice low and measured. "There's still something that doesn't add up."

Astrid raised an eyebrow. "Which part?"

Hugo leaned against the doorframe of her café, taking a deep breath before launching into the complex web of theories and suspicions that had been plaguing him for months. As he spoke, Astrid listened intently, her expression growing more thoughtful with each passing moment.

As they talked long into the afternoon, Hugo felt the familiar weight of his responsibilities lifting, replaced by a sense of connection to this woman who had helped him crack one of the city's most notorious cases. For a few brief hours, he was no longer just Hugo Straume, detective – but a friend, seeking answers and comfort in a complex, often cruel world.

As they parted ways, Astrid pressed a small package into his hand. "Just something I found," she said with a wink. "Take a look when you get back to the office."

Hugo smiled, tucking the package into his pocket as he made his way back towards the train station, ready to return to the world of crime and detection that had brought him so much, but also taken so much from him.
