One day, Hugo received a tip about a valuable gemstone that was going to be auctioned off at a high-end jewelry store in the city.

As The Fox, Hugo infiltrated the store by posing as a wealthy collector interested in purchasing the gemstone.

Meanwhile, he also gathered information on the staff and their schedules, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

The night of the auction arrived, and Hugo donned his finest suit and tie. With a charming smile, he bid on the gemstone, driving up the price with each successive offer. The staff was oblivious to his true intentions, and the other bidders were intimidated by his confidence and sophistication.

With the gemstone safely in hand, Hugo disappeared into the night, leaving behind only rumors and speculation about The Fox's true identity. His reputation as a master thief and con artist was solidified, and he vanished into the shadows, ready to plan his next move. Only those closest to him knew that beneath the charming facade of The Fox lay the cunning mind of Hugo Marcel Girace.
