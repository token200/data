Alicja Németh sat alone in her small, cluttered apartment, staring at the worn photograph on the coffee table. It was an old black-and-white image of herself as a child, taken on a summer vacation with her family by the Danube River. Her bright blue eyes sparkled with joy, and her blonde hair was tied up in pigtails.

She had lost count of the years since she'd last looked at that picture. Time seemed to have slipped away from her like sand through her fingers. Alicja's mind wandered back to those carefree days, spent playing on the riverbank, chasing after butterflies, and listening to her parents' stories about their own childhoods.

As a child, Alicja had always felt like she was living in the shadow of her parents' expectations. Her father, a renowned historian, had pushed her to excel academically from a young age. Her mother, an artist, had encouraged her creative pursuits, but only if they were within the boundaries of traditional art forms.

Growing up, Alicja struggled to find her own voice, her own passion. She was good at languages and writing, but art wasn't something she felt comfortable with. Despite this, her parents continued to push her towards a career in academia or the arts. The pressure had taken its toll on their relationship, and now, they barely spoke.

Alicja's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her phone ringing. She hesitated for a moment before answering it. It was her sister, Sára. They hadn't spoken in years, not since Alicja left Budapest to pursue her graduate studies abroad. The distance had become insurmountable, and they'd lost touch.

"Hello?" Alicja said cautiously, unsure of what to expect.

"Szia, Alicja," Sára replied softly. "It's been a long time."

They talked for hours, catching up on lost years and old memories. For the first time in ages, Alicja felt like herself again – not just a daughter, wife, or student, but a person.

As they said their goodbyes, Alicja realized that she had two choices: continue down the path her parents had laid out for her, or forge her own way. The photograph on the table seemed to wink at her, reminding her of those carefree days by the Danube. She smiled, feeling a sense of determination wash over her.

"I'm coming home," Alicja said into the phone, the words feeling both scary and liberating.

When she hung up, Alicja gazed around her cluttered apartment with newfound eyes. The worn photograph was still there, but now it seemed like a promise – a promise to rediscover herself, to explore her own creative voice, and to find her place in the world on her own terms.
