Sahra Delacroix was a woman of mystery and intrigue. Her piercing green eyes seemed to hold secrets that only she knew, and her raven-black hair framed a face that could stop traffic.

But behind the glitz and glamour of Midnight Revival's success, Sahra struggled to maintain her grip on reality. The pressures of fame had taken its toll, leaving her feeling lost and disconnected from the world around her. She often found herself questioning the true nature of her existence - was she an artist or a mere celebrity?

One fateful night, after a particularly grueling show, Sahra Delacroix stumbled upon a small, quaint caf√© tucked away in a forgotten alley.
