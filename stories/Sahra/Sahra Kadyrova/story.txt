Sahra Kadyrova stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any signs of life. She had been traveling for hours, ever since she left her hometown in the north to escape the war that had ravaged her country.

As a former doctor, Sahra had seen the worst of humanity's suffering, but it was the faces of the children she had tried to help who still haunted her dreams. Her parents had fallen on hard times, and their small medical clinic had been shut down by the authorities. Sahra knew she had to keep moving, find a way to make a difference somewhere else.

Sahra's eyes landed on a young man standing across the platform, his rugged features softened by the thin beard that covered most of his face. He smiled as he saw her approach, and Sahra felt a flutter in her chest. It was Viktor, an old friend from medical school who had offered to meet her here.

Viktor led Sahra through the crowded streets, dodging pedestrians and market stalls as they made their way to his small office above a bakery. The smell of fresh bread wafted up through the ventilation, making Sahra's stomach growl with hunger. Viktor gestured for her to take a seat, and handed her a steaming cup of tea.

Sahra took a sip, feeling the warmth spread through her chilled bones. "What brings you here?" she asked Viktor, her eyes meeting his across the small table.

Viktor leaned back in his chair, his expression serious. "I heard about your parents' clinic being shut down. I wanted to help you get started again." Sahra's eyes welled up with tears as she thought of her family and their abandoned dream. But Viktor's words gave her a spark of hope.

Together, they pored over maps and plans, discussing ways for Sahra to set up a new clinic in the city. The streets were dirty and congested, but Viktor assured her it was exactly where she needed to be. "You'll make a difference here," he said, his eyes shining with conviction.

As Sahra finished her tea and stood up to leave, Viktor handed her a small package wrapped in brown paper. "A little something from me," he said, smiling. "For your new clinic."

Sahra unwrapped the package, revealing a set of surgical gloves and a small notebook filled with scribbled notes on medical procedures. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she looked up at Viktor, feeling a deep sense of gratitude towards this stranger who had become an ally in her quest to heal the wounds of war.
