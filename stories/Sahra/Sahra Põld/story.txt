Sahra Põld was an enigmatic figure in the small Estonian town of Tartu. She was known for her striking features and an air of mystery that seemed to surround her like a shroud. Few people had seen Sahra's face, but whispers about her existence spread quickly through the streets.

It was said that Sahra Põld was a gifted artist, with fingers that danced across the canvas as if guided by an invisible force. Some claimed to have caught glimpses of her in the dead of night, painting masterpieces in the abandoned factory on the outskirts of town. Others spoke of finding intricate sketches hidden among the pages of old books at the local library.

One stormy evening, a young photographer named Aato stumbled upon Sahra Põld as she emerged from the factory's dimly lit entrance. Her eyes gleamed like stars in the darkness, and her raven-black hair seemed to flow behind her like a river. As Aato snapped photos of her, Sahra vanished into thin air.

Undeterred, Aato spent weeks tracking down leads about Sahra Põld. He scoured local art circles, spoke with elderly residents who claimed to have seen her as a child, and even ventured into the nearby forest in search of clues. With each passing day, his obsession grew stronger.

One morning, Aato received an anonymous message from someone claiming to be Sahra's friend. The note revealed that Sahra Põld was not just an artist but a guardian of sorts – watching over Tartu's forgotten souls. As the rain poured down outside, Aato made his way to the local cemetery, where he found a small sketchbook hidden among the headstones.

The pages were filled with drawings of people long gone, their faces softened by time and weathered by the elements. In the corner, a single phrase was scrawled in Sahra Põld's handwriting: "Witnesses in the shadows."
