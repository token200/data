As she entered adulthood, Sahra's passion for puzzles only intensified. She began competing in local and national competitions, where she quickly made a name for herself as one of the top puzzle-solvers in the country.

Sahra Young's exceptional abilities caught the attention of the Puzzle Masters' Guild, a prestigious organization dedicated to promoting and celebrating the art of puzzle-solving.
