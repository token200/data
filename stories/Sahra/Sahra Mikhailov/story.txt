Sahra Mikhailov stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of black coffee. Her brother, Sergei, looked up and caught her gaze, flashing a small smile.

It had been months since Sahra had last seen Sergei, but their bond remained strong despite the distance between them. As a journalist, Sahra had been working on a high-profile story in Eastern Europe, while Sergei was based in Moscow, covering local politics for a prominent news outlet.

Sahra slid into the booth across from Sergei, dropping her bag onto the floor with a sigh. "It's good to see you," she said, running a hand through her long, dark hair.

Sergei leaned back in his chair, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he smiled. "Likewise, Sahra Mikhailov. You look like you could use a break."

Sahra laughed, feeling a wave of exhaustion wash over her. The past few weeks had been grueling, pouring over documents and conducting interviews for her story on corruption in the government. She had finally received the green light to publish, but the stress still lingered.

As they chatted, Sahra couldn't help but feel grateful for Sergei's unwavering support. He had always been her rock, offering advice and encouragement when she needed it most. Despite their differing careers, they shared a deep understanding of each other's passions and motivations.

Their conversation flowed easily, touching on everything from politics to literature. As the hours passed, Sahra found herself feeling more at ease, her guard dropping ever so slightly. It was moments like these that reminded her why she loved her brother – he made her feel seen and heard in a way few others could.

As they finished their coffee, Sergei reached out and placed a hand on Sahra's arm. "I'm proud of you, sis," he said, his voice low and sincere. "You're doing important work."

Sahra smiled, feeling a sense of pride wash over her. She knew that she couldn't do it alone, not even with the support of her brother by her side.
