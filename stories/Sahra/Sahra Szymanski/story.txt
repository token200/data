Born and raised in the artsy neighborhood of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Sahra had always been drawn to creativity. She spent most of her childhood sketching in her notebook and experimenting with different mediums in her makeshift studio.

As she grew older, Sahra's passion for art only intensified. She attended the School of Visual Arts, where she honed her skills and developed her unique style. After graduating, she set out on her own, using her talents to make a name for herself in the city's thriving arts scene.
