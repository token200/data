Sahra Välja was known for her striking appearance and fierce determination. As a renowned astrologer in 19th century Estonia, she had built a reputation for herself by predicting celestial events with uncanny accuracy.

One day, a wealthy merchant approached Sahra Välja with a peculiar request. He claimed that his daughter's wedding date was crucial to the family's business ventures and he needed Sahra Välja's expertise to determine if it would be auspicious or not.

Sahra Välja agreed to take on the challenge and began studying the stars. She poured over ancient texts, consulted with other experts, and spent countless hours observing the night sky. As she delved deeper into her research, Sahra Välja became increasingly convinced that the astrologer's art was not just about predicting outcomes but also about understanding the intricate web of relationships between celestial bodies.

With her knowledge at hand, Sahra Välja presented her findings to the merchant and his family. She explained how the positions of the planets and stars would influence the couple's fortune and warned them about potential challenges they might face in their marriage.

The merchant was skeptical at first but ultimately believed in Sahra Välja's abilities. He decided to take her advice and postponed the wedding, hoping that it would improve his chances of success.

Months went by, and the merchant's business began to flourish. His daughter eventually married a kind-hearted man who proved to be a loyal partner, and their union brought prosperity to the family. The merchant was overjoyed, attributing his good fortune to Sahra Välja's wisdom.

Years later, when people would speak of Sahra Välja's remarkable abilities, they would whisper stories of her uncanny predictions and her unwavering dedication to her craft. Her name became synonymous with wisdom, guidance, and determination – a testament to the power of knowledge and intuition.
