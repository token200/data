Sahra Kaleja sat alone in her small apartment, staring blankly at the wall as tears streamed down her face. It had been six months since her mother's passing, and the grief still felt like a heavy weight on her chest.

As she looked through old family photos, memories of Sahra Kaleja's childhood flooded back. She remembered spending hours playing in the backyard with her mother, learning how to cook traditional dishes from scratch, and listening to stories about their ancestors' bravery and resilience.

Sahra Kaleja took a deep breath and began to sort through the photos, separating them into two piles: ones she wanted to keep, and ones she could let go of. As she looked at each picture, she remembered the laughter, the tears, and the love that had filled her life with her mother.

Just then, Sahra Kaleja's phone rang, breaking the silence. It was her best friend, Maria, calling to check in on her. Sahra Kaleja hesitated for a moment before answering, not wanting to burden Maria with her emotions.

"Hey, I'm doing okay," Sahra Kaleja said, trying to sound stronger than she felt. "Just been feeling really overwhelmed lately."

Maria listened attentively as Sahra Kaleja opened up about her struggles. She shared stories of how her mother's passing had left a gaping hole in her life and how she was still trying to find her way.

"Hey, we'll get through this together," Maria said softly. "We always do."

As they talked, Sahra Kaleja felt a weight lift off her shoulders. For the first time in months, she felt like she wasn't alone. With renewed hope and determination, Sahra Kaleja hung up the phone and continued to sort through the photos.

She smiled as she looked at an old picture of herself and her mother, taken on a family vacation when Sahra Kaleja was just a teenager. In that moment, Sahra Kaleja knew she would carry her mother's love and legacy with her forever.
