Sahra Kovalova stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. She had been away for months, escaping the chaos of her past to find solace in the quiet of this small town. The locals barely knew she existed, a fleeting figure with a mysterious smile.

As she made her way through the crowded streets, Sahra felt a sense of peace wash over her. This was where she came to recharge, to shed the skin of the woman she used to be and rediscover the person beneath. She had left behind a life of privilege and expectation, one that had suffocated her with its demands.

Sahra's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of laughter from across the street. A young boy, no more than ten years old, was chasing after a stray cat, his eyes shining with excitement. She smiled, remembering the countless hours she had spent playing in these very streets as a child. The memories came flooding back, and for a moment, Sahra felt like herself again.

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the town, Sahra made her way to the small caf√© where she knew the owner would have left the door open for her. She took a seat at the counter, ordering a cup of black coffee and sitting in silence as the world outside receded.

A young woman, no more than twenty-five years old, slid onto the stool beside Sahra. "You're the new one," she said, her voice laced with curiosity. "The foreigner who just arrived."

Sahra nodded, taking a sip of her coffee. The woman introduced herself as Lena, and for the first time in months, Sahra felt a spark of connection. They talked long into the evening, sharing stories and laughter, and Sahra began to realize that she was no longer alone.

As the night drew to a close, Lena walked Sahra back to her small apartment on the outskirts of town. "You're not just a ghost," she said, smiling up at Sahra's somber face. "You're someone who deserves to be seen."

Sahra smiled, feeling a weight lift from her shoulders. Maybe it was time to start living again, to shed the skin of the person she used to be and emerge into something new. The thought sent a shiver down her spine, but for once, Sahra felt like herself, and that was enough.
