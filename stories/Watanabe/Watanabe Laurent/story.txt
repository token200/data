Watanabe Laurent sat at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of papers in front of him. As a renowned detective in Paris, he had solved countless cases, but this one seemed particularly puzzling. A wealthy businessman had approached him with a mysterious letter, claiming that someone was following him and threatening to ruin his reputation.

Laurent's eyes narrowed as he sifted through the letter, searching for any clues. The handwriting was messy, almost childlike, but there were no fingerprints or DNA to analyze. He leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers together as he thought.

Just then, his assistant, Sophie, poked her head into the room. "Anything new, Monsieur Laurent?" she asked, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.

Laurent nodded, handing her the letter. "I need you to dig up some information on our victim. See if anyone has come forward claiming to know anything about this threat."

Sophie nodded and slipped out of the office, leaving Laurent to ponder the case further. He stood up, pacing around his room as he thought through the possibilities.

As a seasoned detective, Laurent knew that sometimes the key to solving a case lay in the smallest details. He went back to the letter, examining it more closely this time. That was when he noticed something he had missed earlier – a small scratch on the edge of the paper.

Laurent's eyes lit up as he realized what he had found. The scratch was not just any scratch – it was a tiny signature, barely perceptible to the naked eye. He recognized it immediately as the work of his rival detective, Monsieur Dupont.

A plan began to form in Laurent's mind. He would pay Dupont a visit, see if he would confess to the crime. And as he walked into Dupont's office, he couldn't help but smile – this was going to be a simple case after all.

The game of cat and mouse between Laurent and Dupont had begun, with Watanabe Laurent on the hunt for justice.
