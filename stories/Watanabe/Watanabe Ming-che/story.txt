Watanabe Ming-che was known as the "ghost bus driver" in Tokyo's infamous Shinjuku district. By day, he was a quiet, unassuming man who drove a worn-out bus on the busiest routes. But by night, his bus transformed into a spectral entity that haunted the streets of Shinjuku.

Legend had it that Ming-che was once a devoted husband and father, but tragedy struck when his wife passed away suddenly, leaving him with two young children to raise alone. Devastated, Ming-che became withdrawn and isolated, unable to cope with his grief. As time went on, he started driving late at night, lost in his thoughts of what could have been.

One fateful evening, while driving through the deserted streets of Shinjuku, a ghostly figure materialized in front of him. It was his wife, beckoning him to follow her into the afterlife. Consumed by grief and guilt, Ming-che refused to let go. Instead, he conjured up a spirit that would guide his children through life.

And so, every night, Ming-che's bus appeared on Shinjuku streets, its lights flickering with an otherworldly glow. Passengers who boarded the bus reported feeling a chill run down their spines as they sensed a presence beside them – the restless spirit of Ming-che's wife.

As years went by, people began to whisper about Watanabe Ming-che's ghostly bus. Some claimed to have seen it vanish into thin air, while others swore that Ming-che himself would step out and offer directions or words of encouragement to lost souls on their way home.

Despite the mystery surrounding his nocturnal activities, Ming-che remained a reclusive figure, rarely ever interacting with the living. His children grew up to be successful professionals, never once mentioning their father's extraordinary abilities. But rumors persisted – whispers of a spectral bus driver who roamed Shinjuku streets by night, driven by love, loss, and an unyielding devotion to his family.

The truth behind Ming-che's ghostly bus remained a mystery, hidden from prying eyes. Yet, in the hearts of those who claimed to have seen it, Watanabe Ming-che's spirit lived on – a testament to the enduring power of love and the transformative force that lies beyond the boundaries of mortality.
