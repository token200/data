Watanabe Wei sat alone at his desk, staring blankly at the pieces of jade in front of him. As a master craftsman in feudal Japan, he was known for his unparalleled skill with the ancient art of jade carving. But today, his mind was elsewhere.

Wei's thoughts drifted back to the incident from last night - a group of samurai had been spotted lingering around his workshop, their eyes fixed on the valuable jade pieces that Wei had spent years perfecting. It was clear they were after one piece in particular: a rare and exquisite carving of a dragon.

As Wei pondered what to do next, there was a knock at the door. His apprentice, Hiro, entered with a bow. "Master Wei, I brought some fresh water and tea," he said quietly.

Wei nodded, grateful for the distraction. As Hiro poured him a cup of steaming hot green tea, Wei began to examine the carvings again, his mind racing with possibilities. He knew that if the samurai were after the dragon carving, they must have learned about it through some sort of rumor or gossip.

Just then, there was another knock at the door. This time, it was a young woman dressed in a simple yet elegant kimono. "Master Wei, I've come to inquire about purchasing one of your jade carvings," she said with a gentle smile.

Wei's eyes narrowed as he studied her face - the piercing green of her eyes seemed almost otherworldly. "Who are you?" he asked gruffly.

"My name is Akane," she replied. "I've heard that Master Watanabe Wei creates the most exquisite jade carvings in all of Japan. I'd like to commission one, but I'm not interested in just any piece."

Wei raised an eyebrow as he invited Akane inside. As they sipped tea together, he began to realize that there was more to her request than met the eye.

"I have a special piece," Wei said slowly, his voice low and mysterious. "But it comes with a price - one that only you can afford."

Akane leaned forward, her eyes locked intently on Wei's face. And in that moment, Wei knew he had found a worthy patron - one who would appreciate the true value of his craft.
