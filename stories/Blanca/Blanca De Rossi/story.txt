Blanca De Rossi was known for her sassy attitude and sharp tongue on the set of RuPaul's Drag Race. But despite her tough exterior, she had a soft spot for strays - both human and animal.

As a child, Blanca grew up in a rough neighborhood, where she learned to rely on herself and her wit to survive. She would often sneak into local shelters to play with the animals, finding comfort in their unconditional love. This early experience shaped her into the empathetic person she is today.

Years later, as a queen on Drag Race, Blanca used her platform to raise awareness about animal welfare. She became particularly passionate about rescuing dogs from hoarding situations, using her fame to bring attention to these heartbreaking cases. Her signature phrase, "Pit Bulls are people too," became a rallying cry for dog lovers everywhere.

One day, while filming an episode of the show, Blanca's team approached her with a surprising request: they wanted to feature a special guest on the runway - a pit bull named Rocky. The producers had been working with a local rescue group to find a pup that would fit perfectly with Blanca's message.

Blanca was hesitant at first, but as soon as she met Rocky, she knew it was meant to be. She took the stage, resplendent in her custom-made gown and heels, and introduced Rocky by her side. The audience erupted into cheers as the pair strutted down the runway, a powerful symbol of Blanca De Rossi's commitment to animal rescue.

As the episode aired, it sparked a national conversation about pit bulls and their treatment in society. Thanks to Blanca's tireless efforts, many people began to see these loving animals in a new light - as individuals worthy of love and respect. And for Blanca, it was a reminder that even the toughest exterior hides a heart of gold.
