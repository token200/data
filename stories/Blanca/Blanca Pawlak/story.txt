One day, a young and aspiring climber named Alex approached Blanca with a plea for help. His parents had passed away, leaving him without financial support or guidance. Feeling helpless and alone, Alex was on the verge of giving up on his dreams.

Blanca saw something in Alex that reminded her of herself when she was younger - a raw talent and a burning desire to succeed. She took Alex under her wing, offering to mentor him and provide him with the training and resources he needed to pursue his passion for climbing.
