Blanca Horvath sat in her small apartment, staring blankly at the wall as she stared into space. Her mind was consumed by the familiar feeling of unease that had been plaguing her for weeks. She had tried everything to shake it off - long walks, meditation sessions, even attempting to cook a new recipe (which ended in burnt offerings and a sink full of dirty dishes). Nothing seemed to work.

As she sat there, lost in thought, the phone rang. It was her best friend, Rachel. "Hey, Blanca Horvath! How's it going?" Rachel asked, unaware of the turmoil brewing inside her friend. Blanca forced a smile onto her face and tried to play along. "I'm good, Rach. Just needed some alone time."

Rachel wasn't one to pry, so she didn't press the issue. Instead, she launched into conversation about her own life, and Blanca found herself momentarily distracted from her woes. But as soon as Rachel hung up, the feeling of unease crept back in.

Blanca stood up and began pacing around her apartment, trying to find some semblance of calm. She thought about all the things she had accomplished in her life so far - graduating college, landing a job, making meaningful connections with people like Rachel. But despite all those achievements, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing.

As the sun began to set outside her window, Blanca settled back onto the couch and let out a deep sigh. She thought about how her full name - Blanca Maria Horvath - sounded when spoken aloud, and how it always brought back memories of her childhood. Her parents had named her after the Spanish word for "white", which was ironic given her fair skin and blonde hair.

For a moment, the name itself seemed to bring some solace, like a warm hug on a cold day. But as quickly as it began, the feeling passed, leaving Blanca with more questions than answers. What did it mean to be Blanca Horvath, anyway? And what lay ahead for her in this uncertain future? Only time would tell.
