One stormy evening, Blanca received an anonymous tip about a local businessman, known for his ruthless business tactics, who was accused of embezzling funds from his company's employees' retirement accounts. With her investigative instincts on high alert, she decided to dig deeper into the story.

Blanca spent the next few days interviewing sources and gathering evidence, all while avoiding the prying eyes of the businessman's security team. She knew that her safety was at risk if she wasn't careful, but her determination to expose the truth kept her going.
