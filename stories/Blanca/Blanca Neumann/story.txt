Blanca Neumann made her way through the crowded gallery, pausing in front of one of her most famous works, "The Isolation Chamber." The piece, which consisted of a solo performance where she would recite a stream-of-consciousness monologue while suspended in a glass box, had sparked controversy upon its release. Some saw it as a scathing critique of modern society's obsession with technology and social media, while others dismissed it as self-indulgent navel-gazing.

As she gazed at the installation, Blanca Neumann couldn't help but think about her own experiences with isolation.
