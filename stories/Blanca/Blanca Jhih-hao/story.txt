Blanca Jhih-hao was known for her enigmatic smile and razor-sharp wit, which could cut down even the most confident of opponents in a high-stakes poker game. As a master thief and con artist, she had earned a reputation as one of the most elusive figures in the underworld.

Despite her tough exterior, Blanca Jhih-hao was not without her vulnerabilities. She had a soft spot for stray animals and was often found feeding and caring for the local cats that roamed the streets of Shanghai. Her love for these furry creatures was a stark contrast to her profession, which involved swindling wealthy businessmen out of their fortunes.

One fateful evening, Blanca Jhih-hao received an invitation from a mysterious client to meet at a luxurious penthouse apartment in the heart of the city. The client promised a lucrative deal that would set her up for life, but Blanca Jhih-hao was not one to trust easily. She decided to play it cool, arriving dressed in a stunning black gown and accompanied by her loyal cat, Midnight.

As she entered the penthouse, Blanca Jhih-hao was greeted by a suave and sophisticated host who introduced himself as Mr. Lee. He proposed a series of complex heists that required Blanca Jhih-hao's unique skills to execute. The stakes were high, but Blanca Jhih-hao was intrigued by the challenge.

Over the next few hours, Blanca Jhih-hao and Mr. Lee engaged in a mental game of cat and mouse, each trying to outmaneuver the other. As the night wore on, Blanca Jhih-hao began to sense that there was more to Mr. Lee's proposal than met the eye. But she was determined to see it through, no matter what lay ahead.

With Midnight by her side, Blanca Jhih-hao left the penthouse with a newfound sense of excitement and trepidation. She knew that this deal could either make or break her, but one thing was certain - she would play it to the end. And so, the game began, with Blanca Jhih-hao ready to take on whatever lay ahead, armed with nothing but her wit and cunning.
