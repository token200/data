Blanca Rodríguez García sat alone at a small café in the heart of Madrid, sipping her strong espresso. Her dark hair was pulled back into a tight ponytail, revealing a face etched with lines from years of laughter and tears. She was a woman in her mid-30s, yet her bright hazel eyes sparkled with the vibrancy of someone half her age.

Blanca was a poet, her words weaving magic with every line. Her soulful voice had captivated audiences at the city's underground literary clubs, earning her a reputation as one of the most promising young voices in Spanish literature.

As she stared out the window, lost in thought, a man walked into the café. His name was Juan, and he was an old friend from Blanca's past. They had grown up together on the streets of Madrid, exploring abandoned alleys and dreaming of better lives.

Juan spotted Blanca and made his way to her table. "Bla," he said, his deep voice sending shivers down her spine. "Long time no see."

Blanca smiled, a hint of mischief dancing in her eyes. "Juanito, what brings you here?"

He slid into the chair across from her, taking in the scene. The café was bustling with activity, but Blanca's gaze had always seemed to be tuned inward. He remembered that about her – she had always been more focused on her own thoughts than on the world around her.

"I'm working on a new collection," Blanca said, pulling out a notebook from her bag. "I want to explore themes of identity and belonging."

Juan nodded, his eyes scanning the pages. "It's beautiful, as always. You have a way with words that makes me feel like I'm home."

Blanca laughed, her eyes welling up with tears. "You're making me cry, Juanito."

As they talked, the hours slipped away, lost in conversation and memories of their youth. Blanca's words flowed effortlessly, like a river meandering through the city streets.

In that moment, it was clear that Blanca Rodríguez García was more than just a poet – she was a guardian of stories, a weaver of dreams, and a keeper of secrets. Her words were not just words on paper but a bridge between past and present, connecting people across time and space.

As the sun dipped below the rooftops, casting the café in a warm orange glow, Blanca closed her notebook, her eyes locking onto Juan's. "I'm glad you're here," she said softly.

Juan smiled back, his face creasing with age lines. "Me too, Bla. Me too."
