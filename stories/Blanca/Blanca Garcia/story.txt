Blanca Garcia stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It had been years since she'd returned to her hometown of Puerto Peñas, but the memories still lingered like a ghostly presence.

As a child, Blanca had spent summers at her abuela's house by the sea, listening to tales of the town's history and watching the sunset paint the sky with hues of pink and orange. But after Abuela's passing, Blanca's parents had moved away for work, leaving her behind in this small, tight-knit community.

Blanca's thoughts were interrupted by a voice calling out her name. "Bla-na!"

She turned to see her old friend, Sofia, hurrying towards her with a warm smile on her face. The two girls had grown up together, exploring the town and sharing secrets beneath the stars.

"Sofia! How are you?" Blanca asked, opening her arms for a hug.

Sofia enveloped her in a tight squeeze. "I'm good, but I've missed you so much. What brings you back?"

Blanca hesitated, unsure how to share her reasons with Sofia. She'd left Puerto Peñas after high school, chasing a dream of becoming a writer and leaving the small town's expectations behind.

"I came back for Abuela's birthday," Blanca admitted finally. "I wanted to say goodbye and remember her like I used to."

Sofia nodded sympathetically. "It's good you're here. We've missed you so much."

As they walked towards Abuela's old house, now a cozy little boutique hotel, Blanca felt the weight of her return settling in. She knew she had a lot to catch up on – with Sofia, the townspeople, and herself.

The next few days were a blur of visits, storytelling sessions, and laughter-filled nights by the sea. Blanca's words began to flow again, this time with a renewed sense of purpose and belonging. Abuela would be proud, she thought, smiling at her friend as they sat on the beach watching the stars come out.

As Blanca prepared to leave Puerto Peñas once more, Sofia handed her a small package wrapped in colorful paper. "A little something from me," Sofia said with a wink.

Inside the box was a beautifully written poem – one that spoke directly to Blanca's heart and reminded her of why she'd left in the first place: not just to escape, but to rediscover herself in this small, vibrant town by the sea.
