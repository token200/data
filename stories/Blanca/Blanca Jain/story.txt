Blanca Jain stood out in the crowded streets of Mumbai as she navigated through the labyrinthine alleys with an air of quiet confidence. A painter by profession, Blanca Jain was known for her vibrant murals that seemed to come alive under the golden hues of the Indian sun.

As a child, Blanca Jain had always been fascinated by the world of colors and textures. She spent hours upon hours in her grandmother's old studio, watching as she mixed and matched paints to create stunning works of art. From those early days on, it was clear that Blanca Jain was destined for greatness – or at least, that's what her parents had always thought.

Years later, Blanca Jain found herself standing outside the door of a small café in the heart of the city. She had heard whispers about this place being a hub for creatives and outcasts alike, people who didn't quite fit into the mainstream mold. As she pushed open the door, a bell above it rang out, announcing her arrival to the inhabitants within.

The café was dimly lit, with soft jazz music drifting through the air. Blanca Jain spotted an empty stool at the bar and made her way towards it. The bartender, a gruff but kind-eyed man named Rohan, looked up as she took a seat.

"What can I get you, miss?" he asked, his voice low and smooth.

Blanca Jain smiled wistfully, "Just a cup of black coffee, please."

Rohan nodded and expertly brewed her a cup. As they waited for the coffee to be ready, Blanca Jain pulled out her sketchbook and began to doodle on a napkin provided by Rohan.

"Where are you from?" she asked him after what felt like an eternity, sipping her lukewarm coffee.

Rohan chuckled, "I've lived in this city all my life. You're a traveler, huh?"

Blanca Jain smiled and nodded, the lines around her eyes deepening as she revealed a glimmer of mischief.
