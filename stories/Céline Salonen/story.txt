Céline Salonen, a renowned Finnish opera singer, stood at the edge of the frozen lake, her voice carrying across the crisp winter air. She had always found solace in the stillness of nature, and now, as she gazed out at the snow-covered trees, she felt at peace.

It was not an unusual sight to see Céline standing alone on a cold winter's day, lost in thought. Her demanding career as an opera singer often left her little time for herself. Between performances in La Scala and the Metropolitan, she rarely had a spare moment to breathe.

But today was different. Today, she had come to clear her head before rehearsals began for Verdi's La Traviata. She closed her eyes, taking deep breaths as the biting wind whipped through her hair. Her thoughts turned to her mother, who had been her rock throughout her career. Céline had lost her just a year ago, and it still felt like an ache within her.

As she opened her eyes, Céline spotted a figure approaching from across the lake. It was her childhood friend, Juhani, a fellow musician who had often accompanied her on stage. He smiled warmly as he drew closer, his cheeks rosy from the cold.

"Céline, what are you doing out here?" he asked, his voice muffled by the wind.

"I needed some time to myself," she replied, smiling faintly. "The show is a few weeks away, and I'm still trying to get into character."

Juhani nodded sympathetically. "I remember when we were kids, singing in our parents' living room. You always had such a magical voice."

Céline chuckled wistfully. "I think it was just the sound of my mother's voice, teaching me how to sing. But you're right – I've been lucky enough to make a career out of something that brings joy to people's lives."

As they stood there on the frozen lake, watching the snow fall gently around them, Céline felt a sense of gratitude wash over her. She knew she was exactly where she was meant to be – on stage, under the spotlight, using her voice to move and inspire others.

The sound of Juhani's footsteps broke into the silence as he turned to leave. "I'll walk you back," he said, offering his arm.

Together, they made their way across the lake, Céline feeling a sense of peace settle over her like a soft blanket. As they approached the edge of the frozen water, she gazed out at the snow-covered trees once more.

"You know, Juhani," she said softly, "I think I'm ready for this show now."

Juhani smiled, his eyes crinkling with warmth. "I knew you would be."
