With a background as a former Polish diplomat turned rogue agent, Bogusław had honed his skills on the streets of Warsaw and Berlin.

One fateful evening, Bogusław received intel that his arch-nemesis, Agent Thompson, was hiding in plain sight at an exclusive masquerade ball in Paris. Dressed in a lavish black tuxedo, Bogusław Salamanca mingled with the high society guests, all while keeping his eyes peeled for any sign of Thompson.
