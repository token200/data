Bogusław Adelberg was a man shrouded in mystery, with an air of intrigue that surrounded him like a thick fog. A former spy and assassin, he had left his past life behind to start anew as a humble librarian in the quiet town of Ashwood.

Few people knew much about Bogusław Adelberg's life before Ashwood. Some said he was a Polish nobleman who had fled his family's estate after a scandal; others claimed he was a Russian defector with a talent for seduction and sabotage. But one thing was certain: Bogusław Adelberg was a man of many faces, each one more convincing than the last.

As he shelved books in the Ashwood library, Bogusław Adelberg's eyes would scan the shelves, taking in every title, every author, every word. It was as if he were searching for something – or someone. His colleagues had grown accustomed to his quiet demeanor, but there was always a hint of tension around him, like a coiled spring waiting to be unleashed.

One evening, as Bogusław Adelberg locked up the library, he noticed a young woman lingering in the stacks. She was rummaging through the shelves with an air of desperation, as if she were searching for something lost and precious. Bogusław Adelberg's instincts kicked in; he watched her with growing interest, wondering what had brought this stranger to Ashwood.

As the woman finally left the library, Bogusław Adelberg caught a glimpse of a small notebook hidden among her belongings. He retrieved it, feeling an inexplicable connection to its pages. The handwriting was unfamiliar, but the words seemed to leap off the page: "Meet me at the old windmill at midnight. Come alone."

Bogusław Adelberg's heart quickened as he folded the notebook and tucked it into his pocket. Who was this mysterious woman? And what did she want from him? The librarian felt a spark of excitement ignite within him, a flame that threatened to consume him whole. For the first time in years, Bogusław Adelberg felt truly alive.
