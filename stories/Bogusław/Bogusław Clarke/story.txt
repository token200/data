One day, while sorting through old papers in the university library, Bogusław stumbled upon an obscure manuscript. The pages were yellowed with age, but as he delicately turned them, he noticed that they contained previously unknown accounts of Poland's involvement in World War I.

As a young professor, Bogusław was thrilled to finally share his discoveries with a wider audience.
