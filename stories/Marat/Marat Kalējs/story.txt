Marat Kalējs stepped out into the crisp morning air, his eyes scanning the deserted streets of Riga. As a renowned detective with a knack for solving the city's most baffling cases, he was accustomed to working alone. The rain-soaked pavement glistened like polished stone beneath his feet as he walked towards the small café where his trusted informant, Viktor, would meet him.

Marat sipped on a black coffee as Viktor slid into the booth opposite him. "I've got something," Viktor said, his eyes darting nervously around the café. "Someone's been asking questions about your past."

Marat's gaze narrowed. He knew that whoever was behind this was either trying to intimidate or mislead him. Either way, he wasn't interested in playing along.

"What kind of questions?" Marat asked, his voice low and even.

"I don't know," Viktor admitted. "But the person who came to me was...different. They had an accent I couldn't place, but something about them seemed off."

Marat's mind began to spin with possibilities. Who could be asking about his past? And why? He'd always prided himself on being a man of few secrets.

As Viktor continued to chat, Marat's eyes roamed the café, searching for any sign of his mysterious visitor. But it was as if they had vanished into thin air.

Just as he was starting to relax, the door swung open and a woman strode in, her piercing green eyes scanning the room until they landed on Marat. For an instant, their gazes locked, and Marat felt a jolt of recognition.

The woman's features shifted, like a mask slipping into place. Her nose elongated, her lips thinned, and her hair darkened to a rich brown. Marat's mind reeled as he realized that this was his estranged sister, Anastasija – the only person who had ever truly understood him.

Anastasija slid into the booth opposite Viktor, her voice barely above a whisper. "Marat, I need your help."

Without waiting for an explanation, Marat rose from his seat and followed his sister out of the café, leaving Viktor to ponder the mystery that was unfolding before him. As they walked through the rain-soaked streets, Marat knew that this case had just become personal – and he was ready to take on whatever lay ahead.
