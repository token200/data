Marat Koskinen trudged through the snow-covered streets of Helsinki, his eyes fixed on the dimly lit alleyway ahead. As a detective with the Helsingin Poliisi, he had seen his fair share of dark and twisted crimes, but this one was personal.

Marat Koskinen's gut told him that this case would be different. The victim, a young woman named Sophia, had been found brutally murdered in her apartment just hours before. The police were stumped, and Marat Koskinen knew he had to get to the bottom of it.

As he entered the alleyway, Marat Koskinen noticed a small piece of paper caught in a nearby trash can. He carefully plucked it out and examined it. It was a receipt from a local café, but what caught his eye was the handwritten note on the back: "Meet me at 5 pm. -J".

Marat Koskinen's mind began to racing as he pieced together the clues. Sophia had been working late at her job as a waitress when she received a mysterious text message from an unknown number, inviting her to meet someone at 5 pm that evening. She never showed up for her shift.

With newfound determination, Marat Koskinen made his way back to the police station and began reviewing the security footage. He fast-forwarded through hours of uneventful footage until he saw Sophia's figure walk into the alleyway just before 5 pm.

The grainy image didn't show who Sophia was meeting, but Marat Koskinen knew that this was the break they needed. He decided to pay a visit to the café where the receipt was purchased and see if anyone remembered anything about the mysterious text message.

As he left the alleyway, Marat Koskinen couldn't shake off the feeling that time was running out for him to solve this case before it was too late. He took a deep breath, mentally preparing himself for the long and grueling hours ahead, knowing that solving this crime would be one of the most challenging cases of his career as detective Marat Koskinen.
