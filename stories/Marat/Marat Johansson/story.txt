He spent countless hours studying the great detectives of history, pouring over their cases and techniques until he could replicate them with ease. His own office, cluttered with dusty tomes and worn papers, was a testament to his unyielding dedication.

One fateful evening, Marat received a visit from an anonymous client who claimed to have information on a string of high-profile burglaries.
