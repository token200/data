One fateful evening, Marat Horvath received an invitation from an anonymous client to unravel a particularly knotty puzzle. The message read simply: "Meet me at the old windmill on the outskirts of town at midnight. Come alone."

As Marat Horvath arrived at the windmill, he noticed that the air was heavy with anticipation. His host, a figure shrouded in shadows, emerged to greet him.
