Marat Pawlak stepped out of his worn, beige van and onto the dusty parking lot. The faded sign above the entrance to the rundown bar read "Mom's Place" in peeling letters. He had been coming here for years, ever since he'd gotten kicked out of his parents' place for "causing too much trouble".

Marat took a long drag on his cigarette, feeling the familiar mix of emotions that always accompanied him when he walked into Mom's. It was like coming home - and yet, it never felt quite right.

As he pushed open the creaky door, a bell above it let out a tired clang. The patrons looked up from their drinks, some with a mixture of curiosity and annoyance. Marat's face was familiar to most of them, and they knew that whenever he walked in, things would get interesting.

Marat made his way to the bar, where Mom herself - his mother, actually - polished off another whiskey behind the counter. "Hey, kiddo!" she said with a warm smile, not even bothering to pretend it was genuine.

"Hey, Mom," Marat replied, sliding onto a stool beside her. "I'm home."

The bartender, Vasilikos, raised an eyebrow from his perch at the end of the bar. "Oh boy, here we go again," he muttered under his breath as he poured Marat a stiff shot.

Marat tossed back the drink and slammed his fist on the counter, making Mom jump. "I had a fight with Rachel today," he bellowed. "She says I'm not good enough for her."

Mom sighed and put down her glass. "Marat, we've been over this before. You can't just go around getting into fights and expecting everything to work out. You're going to hurt yourself one of these days."

Marat scowled at her, feeling like she was always the one who didn't get it. But he knew better than to push her buttons when they were already inflamed. "I'm fine, Mom," he said gruffly, downing another shot.

The rest of the night blurred together - Marat listening to Vasilikos's tales of woe, arguing with Rachel over the phone (he'd never actually met her in person), and watching as the sun dipped below the horizon outside. It was a ritual he'd performed countless times before, but one that never got old.

As he left Mom's around midnight, feeling like he'd somehow managed to navigate his way through yet another catastrophe, Marat couldn't help but wonder what tomorrow would bring.
