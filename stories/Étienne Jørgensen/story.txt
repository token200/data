Étienne Jørgensen, a man in his mid-30s with an unassuming demeanor, sat alone at a small café on the outskirts of town. He sipped on a lukewarm coffee, lost in thought as he stared out the window at the rain-soaked streets.

Étienne was a collector of sorts – not just physical objects, but memories and experiences that filled his mind like a treasure trove. As a child, he had been fascinated by the concept of time and how it influenced people's lives. He spent countless hours observing those around him, studying their habits, and piecing together their stories.

Over the years, Étienne's collection grew, and so did his skills as an observer. He became adept at picking up on subtle cues – a smile that hid sadness, a laugh that concealed pain, or the way someone's eyes crinkled when they smiled. People began to notice him, not just for his quiet nature but for the uncanny ability to see beyond the surface.

As he sat in the café, Étienne was reminded of a particular individual who had left an indelible mark on his life. It was Sophie, a woman with piercing green eyes and a smile that could light up a room. They had met by chance on a train ride, and their conversations had flowed effortlessly, like two rivers merging into one.

Sophie's story was one of tragedy – a complicated web of love, loss, and regret. Étienne listened intently as she spoke about the choices she had made, the paths not taken, and the what-ifs that haunted her to this day. Her words painted vivid pictures in his mind, and he felt an overwhelming sense of empathy for this woman who seemed to be forever trapped in a world of her own.

As the rain continued to fall outside, Étienne's thoughts drifted back to Sophie. He wondered if she ever thought about him, if their chance encounter had left a lasting impression on her life. The questions swirled in his mind like the raindrops on the windowpane.

The café door swung open, and a new patron entered – an elderly woman with wispy silver hair and eyes that sparkled with warmth. She took a seat at the table next to Étienne and struck up a conversation about the weather. As they talked, Étienne found himself drawn into her world, just as he had been before with Sophie.

In this moment, Étienne realized that his collection wasn't just memories or experiences but also connections – fleeting, fragile, and beautiful. He sipped his coffee, lost in the present, knowing that every encounter, no matter how brief, left a mark on his life, like the raindrops on the windowpane.
