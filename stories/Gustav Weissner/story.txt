Gustav Weissner stepped out of his worn leather jacket, letting the cool winter air wash over him as he gazed up at the city skyline. A wispy curl of smoke drifted lazily from the chimney of the small café below, carrying with it the scent of freshly brewed coffee and baked goods.

Gustav was a man who liked routine, who valued the predictability of everyday life. As a private investigator in his mid-forties, he had seen his fair share of chaos and mayhem, but he preferred to keep his feet on solid ground. His office was a small, cluttered space above the café, with stacks of dusty files and yellowed newspapers that told the story of his years on the job.

As he made his way down the stairs, the sounds of the city swirled around him – car horns blaring, people shouting, and the distant thrum of jazz music from the club next door. Gustav smiled to himself; it was days like this that reminded him why he loved this line of work. There was always a new case waiting just around the corner, a puzzle to be solved or a mystery to unravel.

He pushed open the door to his office and settled into his worn armchair, running a hand through his thinning brown hair. The room was a shrine to his years as an investigator – photographs of old clients on dusty walls, yellowed newspaper clippings from cases gone cold, and shelves lined with dog-eared books on forensic science.

Just then, the phone rang, shrill and insistent. Gustav picked up, answering in a low, smooth voice, "Weissner Investigations."

"Mr. Weissner, it's Rachel," said a hesitant voice on the other end of the line. "I need your help with something. My sister just got into some trouble – I'm not even sure where to start."

Gustav leaned forward in his chair, his eyes narrowing slightly as he absorbed the information. "Tell me more," he said, already mentally piecing together a plan.

As Rachel talked, Gustav listened attentively, making notes on a pad of paper beside him. He had worked with Rachel before; she was a bit of a firecracker, always getting into trouble and then asking for his help when things got sticky.

After a few minutes of discussion, Gustav hung up the phone and began to pace around his office, letting his mind work through the puzzle that Rachel's sister presented. He knew that this case would be different – there was something about it that felt...off.

And as he stood in front of the bookshelves, his eyes scanning the rows of dusty tomes, Gustav couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.
