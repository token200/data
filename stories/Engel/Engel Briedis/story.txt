Engel Briedis was known for his rugged good looks and sharp wit, but it was his troubled past that truly set him apart from the rest. A former mercenary turned bounty hunter, Engel had seen his fair share of bloodshed and heartache.

Born on a stormy night in the small village of Riga, Latvia, Engel grew up with a sense of restlessness that could never be satiated. His parents, both struggling artists, instilled in him a love of music and literature that Engel would later use to fuel his own brand of justice.

As a young man, Engel enlisted in the Latvian army, where he quickly proved himself to be a skilled fighter. After serving for several years, he left to join a prestigious mercenary unit, taking on high-stakes missions across Europe. However, it was during one fateful operation that Engel suffered a devastating blow: his best friend and comrade, Jānis, was killed in action.

Devastated by the loss of his brother-in-arms, Engel abandoned the mercenary life and turned to bounty hunting as a way to make amends. He became known for his unwavering dedication to justice, using his skills to track down and bring to justice those who preyed on the innocent.

Years went by, and Engel's reputation grew. He took on cases from all over the world, earning the respect of his peers and the fear of his targets. Despite his tough exterior, however, Engel still harbored a deep sense of vulnerability, one that he struggled to keep hidden beneath his rough-hewn façade.

One fateful night, Engel received a message from an old acquaintance, requesting his services on a high-stakes case. The target was a notorious arms dealer, one who had been accused of supplying deadly weapons to various militias around the world. Engel accepted the job, and with his trusty rifle by his side, he set out to bring the perpetrator to justice.

As he closed in on his prey, Engel couldn't help but think back to the words of his mother: "Justice is not just a word, Engel - it's a way of life." He steeled himself for what lay ahead, knowing that this mission would be one of the toughest battles of his career. With Engel Briedis on the job, there was no escape from truth and justice.
