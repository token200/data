Engel Roche stepped into the dimly lit tavern, her piercing green eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As a renowned mercenary and treasure hunter, she had seen her fair share of battles and escapades. Her rugged features and jet-black hair seemed to blend seamlessly with the shadows, making it impossible to discern her true age or intentions.

Engel Roche made her way to the bar, ordering a whiskey as she surveyed the patrons. A lone figure caught her attention - a hooded stranger sitting in the corner, sipping a cup of ale. There was something about him that drew Engel Roche in, perhaps it was the way he seemed out of place among the rowdy crowd or maybe it was the air of mystery surrounding his presence.

As she raised her glass to take a sip, Engel Roche noticed the stranger glance up at her, their eyes locking for a brief moment. It was as if they shared a secret understanding, one that neither could quite articulate. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she turned back to the bar, her gaze lingering on the mysterious figure.

Suddenly, a raucous laugh echoed through the tavern, drawing Engel Roche's attention to a group of rowdy patrons nearby. Without hesitation, she strode over to intervene, using her formidable combat skills to defuse the situation. The hooded stranger watched from afar, his eyes never leaving hers as if waiting for something to unfold.

As the evening wore on and the tavern emptied out, Engel Roche found herself drawn back to the mysterious figure. This time, he stood, pulling back his hood to reveal chiseled features and piercing blue eyes. It was a face she had seen before, yet couldn't quite place.

"What's your story?" Engel Roche asked, her voice firm but curious. The stranger smiled, a hint of mischief dancing in his eyes. "I'm just a man looking for treasure," he said, his voice low and mysterious. "And I think you might be the one to help me find it."
