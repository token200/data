Engel Björkqvist was a man shrouded in mystery, with an air of quiet confidence that belied his introspective nature. A retired detective from Stockholm's grimmest streets, Engel had solved some of the city's most gruesome crimes, but now he spent his days tending to his garden and pondering the human condition.

It was on one such afternoon, as Engel sat amidst his meticulously pruned roses, that he received an unexpected visit from an old acquaintance, Lena Gustafsson. A fellow detective from Engel's past, Lena had come seeking his counsel on a particularly vexing case – a young woman with no memory of her life, found wandering the city's underbelly.

Engel listened intently as Lena recounted the girl's story, his eyes narrowing behind his wire-rimmed spectacles. He knew that this was more than just another missing persons case; there was something deeper at play here. As he pondered the mystery, Engel's mind began to wander back to his own past – the darkness he had faced as a detective, and the scars that still lingered.

Later that evening, Engel sat by the fire, lost in thought. His eyes drifted to a photograph on the mantle – an old mugshot of himself, taken during his detective days. He smiled wistfully, remembering the thrill of the chase, the satisfaction of unraveling a tangled thread. But as he gazed deeper into the flames, Engel's expression turned somber. This case, like so many others, seemed to be a reflection of humanity's darker aspects – the cruelty, the neglect, and the desperation.

Engel rose from his chair, his joints creaking in protest, and began to pace the room. He knew that he couldn't solve Lena's case on his own, but perhaps, together, they could unravel the threads that bound it all together. As he moved towards the door, Engel Björkqvist felt a spark of purpose ignite within him – a sense that even in the darkest corners of human experience, there was always hope to be found.
