Engel Zieliński stepped out of the worn wooden door, his eyes scanning the dimly lit alleys of Kraków's Old Town. The narrow streets were empty, save for the flickering lanterns that cast eerie shadows on the cobblestone pavement. It was a chilly autumn evening in 1895, and Engel, a Polish spy, felt at home.

As he walked, his worn boots making barely a sound on the stone, he checked his pocket watch for what felt like the hundredth time. He had one hour to reach the prearranged meeting point before the guards changed shifts. One misstep, and his entire mission could be ruined.

Engel's thoughts turned to the mysterious woman who had set him on this path. Dr. Helena Krauss, a renowned linguist with ties to the Polish resistance. Her cryptic messages and enigmatic letters had drawn Engel into the world of espionage like a moth to flame. He had taken a risk, trading his cover as a humble university professor for a chance to uncover the truth.

As he turned a corner, the sounds of the city gave way to the distant hum of the Vistula River. Engel quickened his pace, his senses on high alert. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows – Helena, her dark hair tied back in a tight bun, a look of determination etched on her face.

"Engel," she whispered, her voice barely audible over the sound of the river. "I have information about your brother."

Engel's heart skipped a beat. His brother, Jan, had been imprisoned by the Austro-Hungarian authorities for his involvement with the Polish National Council. Engel had received no word from him since.

Helena handed him a small piece of paper with a coded message scrawled on it. "This will lead you to your brother," she said, her eyes locked on Engel's. "But be warned – you're not the only one searching for him."

Without hesitation, Engel tucked the note into his pocket and nodded once. He knew that in this world of espionage and betrayal, loyalty was a luxury few could afford.

As they parted ways, Engel felt a sense of resolve wash over him. The game had changed; he now had a new purpose – to find his brother and unravel the tangled web of secrets and lies that threatened to consume them both.
