Engel Balodis stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out at the endless expanse of city lights. As a renowned astrophysicist, she had spent countless nights lost in the depths of space, searching for answers to humanity's most fundamental questions. But tonight was different.

Tonight, Engel Balodis felt restless, her mind consumed by the weight of her own mortality. She thought about the people she loved, the memories they shared, and the moments that made life worth living. The stars twinkled like diamonds against the inky blackness, but to Engel Balodis, they seemed cold and distant.

As she turned away from the view, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was her colleague, Dr. Ryan Thompson, with a concerned look etched on his face. "Engel, we need to talk," he said softly.

Engel Balodis felt a pang of unease, but she knew that Dr. Thompson's words were not idle. He had been observing her increasing isolation, the hours spent pouring over research papers and data, neglecting even her own well-being. She knew that she couldn't keep going like this forever.

"What is it, Ryan?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

"It's the grant," Dr. Thompson replied gently. "We need to discuss the funding for your project. I think we can..."

Engel Balodis' gaze drifted back to the city lights, as if searching for answers in their depths. She thought about all the things she wanted to achieve, the breakthroughs she wanted to make. But in that moment, she knew that it was more than just her work that mattered.

"It's not just about the science," she said, turning back to Dr. Thompson. "It's about the people who will be affected by our discoveries. My family... my friends."

Dr. Thompson nodded silently, and for a fleeting instant, Engel Balodis saw the same concern reflected in his eyes.
