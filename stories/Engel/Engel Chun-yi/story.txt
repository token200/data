This enigmatic woman possessed an uncanny ability to hear the whispers of the wind, which carried the stories and legends of generations gone by.

As a child, Engel would spend hours listening to her grandmother's tales of old, her eyes wide with wonder as she absorbed every word. Her grandmother, known for her own mystical abilities, recognized Engel's gift from a young age and began teaching her the ways of the wind whispers.

Years passed, and Engel honed her skills, using her gift to unravel mysteries and bring balance to the community. People would come from far and wide to seek her counsel, hoping that the Whispering Winds could provide them with answers they sought. Engel's reputation grew, and she became known as a wise and compassionate guide.

One day, a young boy named Kaito approached Engel with a question about his missing family members. His parents had vanished during a great storm, leaving him alone and scared. Engel listened intently to the wind whispers, her eyes closed in concentration. The wind carried a faint melody, a lullaby that seemed to match the rhythm of the boy's heartbeat.

With tears in her eyes, Engel revealed to Kaito what she had heard: his parents were safe, living on an island far away, where they worked as healers and lived in harmony with nature. Overjoyed, Kaito thanked Engel, hugging her tightly. The Whispering Winds smiled, knowing that her gift had brought happiness once again.

As the years went by, Engel continued to use her gift, helping those in need and weaving a tapestry of stories and legends that wove the community together. And though she remained humble and kind, her name became synonymous with wisdom, compassion, and the mystical power of the wind whispers. The people of Kaito looked up to Engel Chun-yi, "The Whispering Winds," as a symbol of hope and guidance.
