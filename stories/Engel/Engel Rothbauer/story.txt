Engel Rothbauer was known for his unorthodox approach to baking. A pastry chef by trade, he had honed his craft in some of the finest kitchens across Europe, but it was his small bakery in the heart of Vienna that truly set him apart.

Rumors swirled among the locals about Engel's secret ingredient, a mysterious blend of spices and herbs that seemed to imbue his pastries with an otherworldly essence. Some claimed it was a dash of Mozart's famous salt, while others whispered it was a pinch of alpine wildflowers.

Engel Rothbauer would neither confirm nor deny the rumors, but one thing was certain: his cakes were like nothing anyone had ever tasted before. Flaky, buttery croissants that melted in your mouth like a cloud, and cakes so moist they seemed to defy gravity.

One fateful evening, as Engel worked late into the night, preparing for the next day's batch of customers, he received an unexpected visit from the city's most prominent food critic, Herr Schubert. The man was notorious for his scathing reviews, but Engel had heard he was also a man of great taste and refinement.

As they sat at a small table in the bakery, sipping coffee and nibbling on Engel's finest creation – a chocolate cake that seemed to shift and change flavor with every bite – Herr Schubert leaned forward, his eyes narrowing behind his wire-rimmed glasses. "Engel Rothbauer," he said, his voice low and gravelly, "I have heard much about you. But I must ask: what is it that sets your baked goods apart from the rest?"

Engel smiled, a mischievous glint in his eye. "Ah, Herr Schubert, that would be telling. But let's just say it has something to do with the magic of the past."

With that, he vanished into thin air, leaving behind only a whispered promise and the faint scent of spices wafting through the bakery like a siren's call.
