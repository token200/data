Engel Makinen was a mysterious figure in the small town of Kaarina, Finland. She was known for her striking features and razor-sharp wit, but few people knew much about her past. Engel, born on a cold winter's night in 1995, had always been drawn to the darker side of life. Her parents, Finnish immigrants from rural Lapland, had instilled in her a deep respect for the land and its traditions.

As she grew older, Engel became increasingly fascinated with the supernatural and the occult. She spent countless hours pouring over dusty tomes in the local library, devouring books on witchcraft and demonology. Her friends and family began to notice a change in her, as if she was becoming more withdrawn and isolated. They couldn't understand why this vibrant young woman was so consumed by the dark arts.

One fateful night, Engel disappeared from her apartment, leaving behind only a cryptic note that read: "The shadows are calling." Her parents were frantic with worry, but they knew their daughter too well to believe she would simply run off without warning. They searched the town, scouring every alleyway and forest, but there was no sign of Engel.

Days turned into weeks, and the town began to whisper about Engel's fate. Some said she had been consumed by a malevolent spirit, while others claimed she had simply vanished into thin air. But Engel knew the truth – that she had found what she was searching for all along: a connection to her ancestral roots and a sense of belonging in a world beyond the mortal realm.

As the seasons passed, the people of Kaarina would occasionally catch glimpses of Engel, her long black hair blowing in the wind as she vanished into the shadows. They knew better than to approach her, for they sensed that Engel Makinen was no ordinary mortal – and that she was forever bound to the darkness that lay at the heart of the forest.
