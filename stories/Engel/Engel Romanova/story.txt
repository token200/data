Engel Romanova stepped out into the crisp Moscow air, her long black coat billowing behind her like a dark cloud. The city was alive with the pulse of its people, but she was alone, lost in thought.

As the lead singer of the enigmatic band "Echoes in the Dark," Engel had always been drawn to the shadows. Her music was a reflection of that - haunting melodies and lyrics that spoke to those who felt like they didn't quite fit in.

Tonight's gig at the Red Square had sold out weeks ago, but Engel couldn't shake the feeling of unease that settled in her stomach every time she took the stage. It was as if she was living a lie, playing music that wasn't hers alone.

Her bandmates - brothers Kael and Jager - were always supportive, their faces bright with encouragement whenever Engel's doubts crept in. But even they couldn't penetrate the veil of secrecy that shrouded her past.

Engel thought back to the night she'd first met Kael, on a deserted street corner where the only sound was the music playing from his headphones. They'd struck up a conversation about the same song that now haunted Engel's dreams - one she'd written for herself years ago, but had never shared with anyone.

Kael's eyes still held an unsettling intensity whenever she spoke of it, and Jager often seemed to avoid the subject altogether. The silence between them was thick, like a fog that clung to her skin every time she tried to explain what drove her creative vision.

Engel took a deep breath, shaking off the melancholy that threatened to engulf her. She knew the show must go on, but tonight felt different - tonight she needed more than just music to hold onto.

Backstage, Kael and Jager were setting up their instruments, exchanging quiet words of encouragement as they had done countless times before. But when Engel approached them, a silent understanding passed between them like an unspoken promise - we'd get through this together.

As the lights dimmed and the crowd roared to life, Engel Romanova stepped forward, her voice soaring into the Moscow night like a lost bird taking flight. The music pulsed around her, a symphony of light and sound that seemed to capture the very essence of those who listened - even if only for a fleeting moment.

In that darkness, for one shining instant, she knew she wasn't alone.
