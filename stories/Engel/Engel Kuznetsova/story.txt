Engel Kuznetsova was a woman shrouded in mystery. Her name, which meant "Angel" in Russian, belied the darkness that lurked within her. A former ballerina turned assassin, she had traded her tutu for a silenced pistol and a life of deception.

Born into a wealthy Moscow family, Engel had been groomed from a young age to excel in the world of ballet. Her mother, a renowned prima ballerina, pushed her daughter to perfection, demanding that she sacrifice everything to achieve success. But as Engel's talent grew, so did her disillusionment with the cutthroat world of the arts.

One fateful night, after a particularly grueling rehearsal, Engel's anger and frustration boiled over. She was approached by a mysterious figure who offered her a different kind of stage – one where she could use her skills for more than just entertainment. And so, Engel began her training as an assassin.

Years passed, and Engel honed her craft, becoming one of the most feared and respected operatives in the world. Her targets were always high-profile, and her methods were always calculated to leave no trail. But despite her success, a part of Engel still longed for the stage, for the rush of adrenaline that came with performing.

One night, Engel received a mission that would test her skills like never before. A rogue oligarch had stolen a valuable artifact from a museum in Berlin, and it was up to Engel to retrieve it. She arrived in the city under the guise of a tourist, but her eyes were ever-vigilant for any sign of danger.

As she navigated the crowded streets, Engel's instincts began to stir. Something didn't feel right. And then, she saw him – the oligarch himself, lurking in the shadows. With a calculated smile, Engel dispatched her target and retrieved the artifact, leaving behind only a whispered name: "Angel".

For a moment, as she stood victorious on the streets of Berlin, Engel allowed herself to imagine that she was once again on stage, basking in the applause of the crowd. But it was just an illusion, a fleeting respite from the darkness that had become her reality. Engel Kuznetsova was no angel – only a woman with a deadly mission and a heart of stone.
