Engel Gagnon stepped out of the rain-soaked streets and into the warm glow of Café La Belle Époque. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and baked goods enveloped him, immediately lifting his spirits. As a detective with the Montreal Police Department, Engel had seen his fair share of darkness, but moments like these reminded him why he became a cop in the first place – to bring light into the lives of others.

Engel's eyes scanned the café, taking in the familiar faces of regular patrons. There was Pierre, sipping on a cup of coffee and reading The Gazette; Marie, typing away on her laptop with a mischievous grin on her face; and Jacques, playing a lively tune on his accordion for an audience of amused patrons.

As he waited in line to order, Engel's thoughts turned to the case that had been weighing on his mind. A young artist had gone missing, leaving behind only a cryptic message on his social media accounts – "The shadows are my home." Engel was convinced it was more than just a prank; something sinister was at play.

When he reached the counter, he ordered a black coffee and slid onto a stool by the window. As he sipped his drink, his gaze drifted out into the rainy night. The city's neon lights reflected off the wet pavement like a shimmering canvas of hope and despair.

Engel's mind began to piece together the clues he had gathered so far – the artist's increasingly erratic behavior, the strange symbols etched into his canvases, the whispered rumors of an underground art collective. It was all starting to make sense now; this wasn't just about a missing person; it was about exposing a dark underbelly of Montreal's art scene.

Just as Engel was getting lost in his thoughts, Pierre caught his eye and nodded discreetly towards Jacques' accordion playing. The musician had paused mid-song, his eyes locked onto something outside the café window. Engel followed his gaze to see a figure watching from across the street – someone who looked eerily familiar.

With newfound determination, Engel set his coffee cup down and stood up, ready to face whatever lay ahead. He knew that in the world of art and darkness, nothing was ever as it seemed, but he was determined to shine a light into those shadows, no matter what it took.
