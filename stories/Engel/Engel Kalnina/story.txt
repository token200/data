A brilliant and reclusive scientist, Engel had spent years studying the unique properties of crystals found in remote regions of the world. Their latest discovery, a previously unknown mineral with extraordinary healing properties, had sparked both excitement and trepidation within the scientific community.

Engel's lab was a cluttered, high-tech sanctuary hidden deep in the heart of the Arizona desert. Shelves upon shelves of dusty jars and petri dishes lined the walls, each containing a different strain of the mysterious mineral. Engel spent most of their days holed up among these treasures, poring over lines of code and scribbling equations on scraps of paper.

One fateful night, as Engel pored over their research, they stumbled upon an unexpected breakthrough.
