Engel Novak stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the bustling streets of Prague. As a private investigator with a reputation for being one of the best in the city, she had seen her fair share of dark alleys and shady characters. But there was something about this particular case that had Engel's curiosity piqued.

She had been hired by the wealthy businessman, Viktor Kova, to investigate the theft of his priceless family heirloom: a rare diamond necklace passed down through generations of Novaks. Engel's instincts told her that the thief wasn't just any ordinary burglar, but someone with inside knowledge and a deep connection to the Novak name.

As she walked through the crowded market square, Engel's eyes scanned the crowds for any sign of trouble. She was dressed in her usual attire: a black leather jacket, dark jeans, and a pair of scuffed up combat boots. Her raven-black hair was tied back in a tight ponytail, revealing her piercing green eyes that seemed to see right through people.

Engel's mind was focused on the task at hand: tracking down the thief and recovering the stolen necklace. She had a feeling that the key to solving the case lay with someone from within the Novak family itself. Engel took a deep breath and pulled out her phone, dialing the number of her trusted informant, Ivan.

"Engel, what's the situation?" Ivan asked, his voice low and gravelly on the other end of the line.

"The Novak necklace," Engel replied, her eyes scanning the square. "I need to know if anyone in the family is involved."

There was a pause before Ivan spoke up. "Engel, I don't know what you're talking about."

Engel raised an eyebrow. "Don't play dumb, Ivan. I know you've been in close proximity to Viktor Kova's business associates. You know something, and I aim to find out what it is."
