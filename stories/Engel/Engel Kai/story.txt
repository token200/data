Engel Kai trudged through the dense forest, her long legs striding purposefully over the uneven terrain. As a skilled huntress and warrior of the Kaelin tribe, she had spent countless hours honing her skills in this unforgiving environment.

As she walked, Engel's mind turned to the upcoming Gathering of the Clans. It was a time-honored tradition, one that brought together representatives from each of the various tribes to forge alliances and settle disputes. Engel's own tribe, the Kaelin, had long been known for their fierce independence and unwavering commitment to their way of life.

As she pushed aside a curtain of tangled vines, Engel caught sight of her sister, Akira Kai, waiting for her by a nearby stream. Akira was a gifted healer, renowned throughout the land for her knowledge of herbs and potions.

"Engel!" Akira called out, waving a hand in greeting. "I've been expecting you. The elder has requested your presence at the Gathering."

Engel nodded curtly, wiping the sweat from her brow with a dirty cloth. She had always felt a sense of unease when it came to the Gathering, as if she was being watched and judged by unseen eyes.

Akira followed Engel's gaze to where their mother, Kaida Kai, stood waiting by the stream's edge. Kaida was a respected elder within her own tribe, and Engel knew that her presence at the Gathering would carry significant weight.

As they approached the elder, Engel could feel the air thickening with tension. The elder spoke in a low, measured tone, outlining the reasons for Engel's presence: she was to serve as a liaison between the Kaelin and the rival tribe of the Vorga.

Engel listened intently, her mind racing with possibilities and pitfalls. She knew that the Gathering was a time of great opportunity, but also one of great risk.

When the elder finished speaking, Engel nodded once, her expression unyielding. "I will not betray our people, Elder," she vowed. "But I will forge an alliance that benefits both our tribes."

As the Gathering began in earnest, Engel stood watch, ready to defend her tribe's interests and ensure their survival in a treacherous world. She was Engel Kai, daughter of Kaida Kai, and she would not falter.
