Engel Ozolins was a man shrouded in mystery. A former KGB operative turned private investigator, he had made a name for himself as one of the most skilled and resourceful detectives in Moscow. His full name, Engel Vadimovich Ozolins, was whispered in hushed tones by those who knew him.

Engel's latest case was a puzzling one. A wealthy businessman, known only as "The Benefactor," had hired him to investigate a string of high-profile burglaries. The thief seemed to always be one step ahead of Engel, leaving behind no discernible clues and seemingly appearing out of thin air.

As Engel delved deeper into the case, he discovered that each victim had been in contact with an enigmatic figure known only as "The Archon." Some said it was a former KGB agent turned black marketeer, while others believed it to be a mythical figure from ancient mythology. Engel's gut told him it was something more sinister.

One fateful night, Engel received a cryptic message from The Benefactor himself, arranging a meeting at an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. As Engel approached the warehouse, he felt a sense of unease wash over him. Something didn't feel right.

As he entered the dimly lit building, he was confronted by The Archon â€“ a figure shrouded in shadows. For a moment, Engel thought it was just another trick, but as The Archon stepped forward, Engel saw the unmistakable glint of gold in their eyes. It was then that he knew The Archon was not just a myth.

"You're Engel Vadimovich Ozolins," The Archon stated, voice dripping with amusement. "I've been expecting you."

Engel's instincts screamed at him to flee, but something about The Archon's words resonated with him. He took a step forward, and for the first time in his life, he felt like he was being pulled towards the unknown rather than pushing away from it.

The game had just begun, and Engel Ozolins knew that this case would change everything.
