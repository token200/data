Engel Fuentes stepped into the dimly lit jazz club, her eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. The smell of smoke and whiskey wafted through the air as she made her way to the bar. She ordered a whiskey on the rocks, her long black hair cascading down her back like a waterfall.

As she sipped her drink, Engel's gaze drifted towards the stage, where a sultry singer was crooning a melancholy tune. Her voice was husky and seductive, weaving a spell over the audience. Engel's eyes narrowed, her expression unreadable behind her signature sunglasses.

Backstage, Engel Fuentes was known for her sharp wit and biting sarcasm. The singer, Luna Nightingale, had been trying to get her attention all night, but Engel remained aloof, her eyes fixed on some point beyond the crowd.

After the show, Luna sidled up to Engel, a mischievous glint in her eye. "Hey, Engel, what do you think? Should I stick to my day job or take my talents to Broadway?" she asked, her voice husky and confident.

Engel raised an eyebrow, her lips curling into a sly smile. "You're delusional if you think you have what it takes, Luna," she drawled, her voice dripping with amusement.

Luna chuckled, unfazed by Engel's jibe. "Oh, I can handle my own ego, thank you very much." She clapped Engel on the back, nearly sending her glasses askew. "Besides, someone has to keep you humble."

As the two women laughed and joked, it was clear that they had a complicated history. They were former collaborators, united by their passion for music, but also by their tendency to push each other's buttons.

Despite their differences, Engel Fuentes couldn't deny the draw of Luna Nightingale's charismatic stage presence. Perhaps, she thought, there was more to this singer than met the eye. As the night wore on and the crowd began to dissipate, Engel leaned in, her eyes locking onto Luna's. "Tell you what, Luna," she said, her voice low and husky. "Let's make a deal. I'll produce your album, but only if you promise to play by my rules."

Luna grinned, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "Deal."
