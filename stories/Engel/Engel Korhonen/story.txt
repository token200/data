Engel Korhonen was known for his peculiar occupation – he collected forgotten memories from people's minds. With an air of mystery surrounding him, Engel would arrive unannounced at his clients' homes or workplaces, armed with a worn leather notebook and a small, intricately carved wooden box.

His unique profession had its roots in his troubled past. As a child, Engel had been exposed to a strange, otherworldly energy that altered his perception of reality. Over time, he learned to harness this power, developing an extraordinary ability to tap into people's subconscious thoughts.

Engel's process was simple yet complex: he would listen intently to the whispers of his clients' minds, extracting memories from their forgotten pasts and transcribing them onto the pages of his notebook. The wooden box held a special significance – it contained a strange, pulsing substance that seemed to amplify Engel's connection to the collective unconscious.

One day, a woman named Sophia approached Engel with tears in her eyes. She had lost her younger brother in a tragic accident, and the memory of that day had long been buried beneath the weight of grief. With a hesitant smile, Sophia allowed Engel to tap into her mind, and as he listened intently, memories began to surface.

The wooden box pulsed softly in Engel's hands as he recorded the whispers from Sophia's mind. As they delved deeper into the past, Engel sensed a strange energy emanating from the box – an energy that seemed to be stirring the memories of others.

Engel Korhonen was aware that his abilities came with risks and consequences. He knew that some memories were too painful for people to confront alone, yet he couldn't help but feel drawn to them. As he closed his notebook, Engel couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more to Sophia's story – a hidden truth waiting to be uncovered.

With a soft nod of understanding, Engel offered Sophia a reassuring smile, and she departed with tears dried from her eyes. Engel Korhonen remained seated, lost in thought, as the pulsing box continued to emanate its gentle hum – a reminder that some memories were too precious to remain hidden forever.
