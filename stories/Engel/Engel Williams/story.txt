Engel Williams sat at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of bills in front of him. As a successful businessman, he had it all – wealth, influence, and respect from those around him. But as he gazed out the window, he couldn't shake the feeling of emptiness that had been growing inside him for months.

Despite his outward success, Engel felt like a shell of his former self. His wife, Rachel, had left him six months ago, citing his constant absence and lack of attention as the reason. Their two children were now living with their mother in another city, and Engel was left to navigate the world alone.

As he rummaged through the drawers of his desk, searching for a pen or pencil, his hand stumbled upon an old photograph. It was a picture of him and Rachel on their first anniversary, taken at a beautiful vineyard overlooking the ocean. Engel's eyes welled up with tears as he remembered the happiness they had shared in that moment.

Suddenly, the sound of rain pattering against the windowpane snapped him out of his reverie. He stood up and walked over to the glass, pressing his forehead against it. The droplets of water created a rhythmic beat, reminding him of the sounds of the ocean on their anniversary trip.

Engel took a deep breath and let the memories wash over him. He remembered how Rachel used to make him laugh with her silly jokes, and how he would often take her hand in his while they strolled along the beach. The nostalgia was almost too much to bear, but he knew it was time to move forward.

As the rain continued to fall outside, Engel felt a spark of determination ignite within him. He made a promise to himself: he would find a way to reconnect with Rachel and their children, to rediscover the joy that had brought them together in the first place.

The old photograph, once a painful reminder of his loss, now became a symbol of hope for Engel's future. With a newfound sense of resolve, he turned away from the window and began to sort through the bills once more – this time with a renewed focus on rebuilding his life, one step at a time.
