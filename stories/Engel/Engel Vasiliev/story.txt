Engel Vasiliev stepped out of his worn leather jacket and onto the damp pavement, the chill of the winter air biting at his cheeks. He was a man who had seen it all, from the gleaming skyscrapers of Tokyo to the dusty alleys of Marrakech. His eyes, a piercing blue, scanned the crowded street, ever vigilant for signs of trouble.

Engel was a former Spetsnaz operative, now retired and living in the shadows. He had left the service with a price on his head, fleeing the Russian underworld that he had once called home. Now, he spent his days working as a security consultant, taking on odd jobs for those who could afford his unique set of skills.

As he made his way through the throngs of people, Engel's thoughts turned to his current client - a wealthy businessman with connections to the Eastern European mafia. The job was simple: retrieve a valuable artifact from a secure storage facility in Berlin. Easy enough, but Engel knew that nothing came without a twist.

He hailed a taxi and gave the driver an address in Kreuzberg, a neighborhood notorious for its punk rock scene and underground art galleries. As they sped through the streets, Engel's phone buzzed with a text message from his contact - "Backup en route". Good, he thought. He liked to be prepared.

At the storage facility, Engel donned a pair of mirrored shades and set to work, effortlessly bypassing security cameras and alarms. The artifact, a small crystal vial, sat atop a pedestal in a glass case. With a practiced hand, Engel opened the display case and carefully lifted the vial from its resting place.

Just as he was about to make his exit, a group of heavily armed men burst through the door, shouting "Nobody moves!" Engel's eyes narrowed - this wasn't part of the plan. He swiftly dispatched two of the thugs with a combination of judo throws and broken glassware, but three more remained, their leader sporting a scar above his left eyebrow.

"Looks like you're coming with us, Mr. Vasiliev," he sneered.

Engel smiled wryly - this was going to be fun. He took down the third thug with an expert kick, and then turned his attention to the scar-faced man, producing a small pistol from his waistband. "Looks like you made a mistake coming here," Engel said, cool as ice.

The outcome of the standoff hung precariously in the balance, but one thing was certain - only one man would walk out of that storage facility alive.
