Engel Farah sat in her small, cluttered office, staring at the stack of files in front of her. As the lead investigator for the Special Crimes Unit, she had seen it all - from gruesome murders to high-profile thefts. But nothing could have prepared her for the case that was currently eating away at her.

It started with a series of seemingly unrelated burglaries, each one leaving behind a small, intricate symbol etched into the wall. The police were stumped, and the department had given up on the case. But Engel, ever the optimist, saw something in those symbols that others didn't - a connection to an old, cold case from her own past.

As she delved deeper into the investigation, Engel began to experience strange occurrences. She would find herself standing in front of buildings at night, with no recollection of how she got there. She started to feel like she was being watched, and the air seemed to thicken with an unseen presence whenever she was close to the symbols.

One fateful evening, Engel received a phone call from an unknown number. The voice on the other end spoke in hushed tones, saying "They're coming for you, Engel." Suddenly, the lights flickered and the room plunged into darkness. When they came back on, Engel's partner was standing there, shaken but alive.

"It was like something out of a horror movie," her partner stammered. "I saw... I saw your face, Engel. And then everything went black."

Engel knew then that she was onto something. She spent the next few days tracking down every lead, every hint, until finally, she found herself standing in front of an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town.

As she pushed open the creaking door, a chill ran down her spine. The air inside was heavy with dust and decay, but it was also thick with anticipation. Engel moved cautiously forward, her eyes scanning the dimly lit space until they landed on something that made her blood run cold.

There, etched into the wall in red letters, was the same symbol she had seen at the burglaries. And next to it, a small note scrawled with a single phrase: "Welcome home, Engel."
