In the sleepy town of Ashwood, where the streets were lined with ancient oak trees and the air was sweet with the scent of blooming wildflowers, lived Engel Lace Wynter. She was a recluse, preferring the company of her books and the quiet solitude of her garden to that of the bustling town.

Engel, as she was known to those who knew her, spent most of her days tending to her flowers and writing in her journal. Her words were like delicate petals - intricate, beautiful, and full of hidden meaning. She was a poet, a weaver of words that could conjure worlds from the silence.

One day, as Engel was lost in thought, a stranger appeared at her doorstep. He was tall and dark-haired, with eyes that seemed to see right through her. He introduced himself as Finnley Swift, a traveling bard who had heard of Engel's remarkable talent and sought her out for an audience.

Engel was taken aback by Finnley's boldness, but there was something about him that put her at ease. Over tea and cookies, they talked long into the night, sharing stories and laughter beneath the starry sky. Finnley was captivated by Engel's wisdom and insight, while she found herself drawn to his passion and energy.

As the days turned into weeks, Engel found herself opening up to Finnley in ways she never thought possible. She shared with him her deepest fears and desires, and he listened with a compassion that made her feel seen and heard. Together, they explored the woods, collecting wildflowers and watching the sunset paint the sky with hues of gold.

Engel Lace Wynter had always been a private person, but Finnley's presence had awakened something within her. She felt alive again, like the world was full of possibility and promise. As she looked into Finnley's eyes, she knew that she would never be alone again - at least, not with him by her side.
