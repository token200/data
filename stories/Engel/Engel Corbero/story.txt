Engel Corbero stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, her eyes scanning the narrow passageway with an air of familiarity. She had spent countless nights like this one, prowling the streets in search of answers to questions she couldn't quite put into words.

As a child, Engel's parents had taken her on long walks through the city, teaching her about its hidden corners and secret stories. But after their tragic disappearance, Engel found herself alone, forced to rely on her wits to survive. She devoured books from the local library, learning everything she could about the world around her.

Now, as a young adult, Engel's reputation as a skilled thief and detective had spread far and wide. People whispered about the girl with the piercing green eyes and jet-black hair, who seemed to appear and disappear like smoke on the wind. Few knew that behind those eyes lay a complex web of emotions, a tangled mess of grief and determination.

Engel paused outside the small, unassuming door at the end of the alleyway. She had received a cryptic message from an anonymous source, hinting at the location of her parents' last known whereabouts. Her heart pounded in anticipation as she reached out to knock on the door.

The door creaked open, revealing a dimly lit room filled with dusty trinkets and forgotten treasures. A figure emerged from the shadows, eyes locked on Engel's. For a moment, they simply stared at each other, the air thick with tension.

"Welcome, Engel Corbero," the stranger said finally, their voice low and gravelly. "I've been waiting for you."

Engel's grip on her coat tightened as she stepped forward, her mind racing with questions. Who was this person? What did they want from her? But before she could ask any of them, the stranger vanished into thin air, leaving Engel alone in the darkness.

With a sigh, Engel Corbero turned and walked away, her eyes scanning the alleyway once more. This was far from over.
