Engel Kovacs stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. As a freelance journalist, she was no stranger to hidden corners and secret meetings, but today's assignment felt particularly sketchy.

A whispered message had brought her here, from an anonymous source claiming to have information about a string of high-profile hacks targeting small businesses across the city. Engel knew better than to trust such sources outright, but something about this one resonated with her.

As she waited for her contact to arrive, Engel's mind wandered back to her childhood in Budapest. Her parents had been activists, fighting against the oppressive regime that ruled their homeland. Engel had grown up listening to their stories, and it was only natural that she'd followed in their footsteps – or rather, in their journalistic shoes.

A glance at her watch told her their contact was running late. Engel sipped her coffee, her gaze drifting around the café. It was a quiet morning, with only a handful of patrons scattered about. She spotted a figure sitting alone by the window, nursing a cup of tea.

As she approached, Engel's instincts kicked in. Something didn't feel right. The stranger looked up, and for an instant, their eyes locked. Then, they nodded curtly and gestured to a chair.

"I'm Engel Kovacs," she said, her voice low. "You have information about the hacks?"

The other woman nodded, producing a folder from beneath the table. As Engel scanned its contents, her heart quickened. This was big – much bigger than anything she'd uncovered in years of investigating.

For the first time in weeks, Engel felt a glimmer of hope that this story might just be the break it needed. She leaned forward, her eyes locked on the woman's, and asked, "Who are you? And why are you willing to share this with me?"

The other woman hesitated, before speaking in a hushed tone, "I'm someone who's been watching from the shadows, Engel Kovacs. I've seen what you're capable of – and I want to help."
