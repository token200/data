Engel Kamiński was a man shrouded in mystery, his past a labyrinth of secrets and half-truths. Few people knew much about him, except that he was a master thief with an unparalleled ability to disappear into thin air.

Born Engel Janusz Kamiński, he had grown up on the streets of Warsaw, surviving by his wits and cunning. As he matured, his talents for thievery only grew stronger, earning him a reputation as one of Europe's most elusive rogues.

One night, Engel received a message from an old acquaintance, requesting his presence at a high-stakes poker game in Paris. The stakes were enormous: a fortune in diamonds and a rare art collection, said to be the last remaining works of Van Gogh.

Engel arrived at the game dressed impeccably, his dark hair slicked back, revealing piercing blue eyes that seemed to bore into those he met. As the night wore on, he played with calculated precision, his opponents growing more confident and complacent by the minute.

Just as Engel was about to be eliminated from the game, a wealthy businessman intervened, offering him a deal: join forces and split the winnings, or leave with nothing but the clothes on his back. Engel considered the offer for a moment before nodding, sealing his fate.

With the diamonds and art collection safely in hand, Engel disappeared into the night once more, leaving behind a trail of bewildered faces and empty pockets. As he vanished into the shadows, the whispered phrase "Engel Kamiński" became the only clue left behind – a reminder that some secrets were worth dying for.

Years went by, with Engel's legend growing as a master thief. His skills had been honed to perfection, leaving even the most seasoned detectives grasping at thin air. Engel Janusz Kamiński remained an enigma, his true motives and motivations lost forever in the labyrinth of his own making.
