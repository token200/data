Engel Salonen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of saltwater and seaweed enveloping him like an old friend. He had returned to his hometown of Kaarina, Finland, after years away, and the sense of nostalgia washed over him like a wave.

As he made his way through the quiet streets, Engel couldn't help but think about how much had changed since he left. The once-thriving industrial town was now a shadow of its former self, with abandoned factories and crumbling warehouses lining the waterfront. Yet, despite the decline, there was still a beauty to Kaarina that only seemed to deepen with time.

Engel had always been drawn to the sea, and as he walked along the beach, he felt a sense of peace wash over him. He stopped at a small caf√© overlooking the harbor, ordering a cup of black coffee and sitting down on the worn wooden bench.

As he sipped his coffee, Engel noticed an old man watching him from across the room. The man's eyes were sunken, and his face was lined with wrinkles, but there was something in their gaze that made Engel feel like he'd known this person all his life.

"Hello," the old man said finally, his voice low and gravelly. "I'm Kalle."

"I'm Engel," he replied, smiling.

Kalle nodded and took a seat next to him on the bench. The two men sat in silence for a moment, watching as the sun dipped below the horizon over the water.

"You're back," Kalle said finally, his eyes crinkling at the corners.

Engel nodded. "I am."

Kalle leaned forward, his elbows on his knees. "I've been waiting for you, Engel. I know we've lost touch over the years, but I'm glad to see you've come home."

As the sun set and the stars began to twinkle overhead, Engel felt a sense of belonging wash over him. He knew that he had a lot to catch up on with Kalle and the rest of the people in Kaarina, but for now, it was enough to be back in this place, surrounded by the familiar sights and sounds of his childhood.

"You know," Engel said, turning to Kalle with a smile, "I think I'm going to stay a while."
