Engel Gupta was a young and ambitious journalist who had always been driven by a passion for uncovering the truth. Born and raised in New Delhi, India, Engel's early life had been marked by a sense of disillusionment with the way things were done. She saw how corruption and inequality had become entrenched in every aspect of Indian society, and she was determined to do something about it.

After completing her degree in journalism from the University of Delhi, Engel landed a job at a small but respected newspaper in New Delhi. There, she honed her skills as a reporter, quickly earning a reputation for her tenacity and ability to get people to talk.

But Engel's big break came when she was assigned to cover the story of a group of Dalit activists who were fighting against a proposed mining project that threatened their land and way of life. The project had been backed by some of the most powerful people in India, including several politicians and business leaders.

Engel spent weeks researching the story, pouring over documents and conducting interviews with the activists and their families. She also went undercover, posing as a local resident to gather information about the mining company's plans.

As she dug deeper into the story, Engel discovered that the mine was not just a threat to the Dalit community - it was also a hub for organized crime and corruption. She found evidence of bribes being paid to officials, and witnessed meetings between high-ranking government officials and mining executives.

Despite the risks, Engel knew she had to tell this story. She wrote a scathing expos√© that revealed the truth about the mine and its connection to organized crime. The article caused a stir in Indian politics, with several politicians being forced to resign over their connections to the project.

The mining company was also forced to shut down the project, saving the lives of thousands of Dalit families who had been living in fear of losing their land.

Engel's bravery and determination had made her a hero in India, but she knew that there was still much work to be done. She continued to write about social injustice, always seeking to shed light on the darkest corners of society.

Years later, Engel would go on to become one of the most respected journalists in India, known for her fearless reporting and her commitment to telling stories that needed to be told.
