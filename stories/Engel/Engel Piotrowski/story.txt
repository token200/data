Engelberta "Engel" Piotrowski was a woman with a reputation for being as prickly as the thorns on the rose bushes that grew in her mother's garden back in Warsaw. She had always been a bit of an outsider, preferring the company of books and cats to people.

As a child, Engel would spend hours listening to her mother's stories about Poland's turbulent history, absorbing every detail like a sponge. Her parents had sent her to live with relatives in Berlin after the war, hoping that the city's relative stability would help her heal from the trauma of their homeland's destruction.

But Engel was not one for sentimentalities. She threw herself into her studies, determined to make a name for herself as a historian. And she did – winning prestigious awards and publishing papers on the subject of Poland's forgotten history.

Despite her success, however, Engel found it difficult to connect with people. Her wit was sharp, but also quick to cut down anyone who crossed her. It made her few friends, and those she had were often wary of her moods.

One person who saw past Engel's defenses, however, was Dr. Kowalski – a fellow historian and colleague. He would often invite her to his lectures, praising her insightful questions and thoughtful critiques. As they worked together on projects, their banter became more playful, and Engel found herself softening around the edges.

One evening, as they walked through the gardens of the university, Dr. Kowalski asked Engel about her family's past. She was taken aback by his genuine interest in her life, but shared with him stories of her mother's courage during the war. For the first time in years, she felt like someone truly understood her.

From that day forward, Engel and Dr. Kowalski were inseparable – intellectually and emotionally. They worked together on a groundbreaking book about Poland's forgotten history, their collaboration marked by laughter, debate, and mutual respect.

As they delved deeper into the subject, Engel realized that her prickly exterior had been a shield to protect herself from pain. But with Dr. Kowalski by her side, she felt like she could finally let her guard down – and reveal the vulnerable, yet fiercely resilient, person beneath.
