Engel Rodríguez García was known to few as "El Pájaro" - The Bird. He was a mysterious figure, with eyes like two shining stars and hair that seemed to move of its own accord. His presence was both captivating and unnerving, like a whispered secret in the dead of night.

Some said he had once been a member of a powerful cartel, but that he had left it all behind after a fateful incident involving a stray bullet and a whispered promise to the wind. Others claimed he was a former soldier, haunted by the memories of what he had seen on the battlefield.

But one thing was certain: Engel Rodríguez García possessed an uncanny ability to gather information from those around him. His eyes seemed to bore into the souls of those he met, and his ears picked up even the faintest whispers of gossip.

It was this gift that made him a valuable asset to those who knew him. Politicians would pay handsomely for access to Engel's ear, as well as those with secrets they wanted to keep buried. He could uncover scandals, expose corruption, and sniff out hidden truths.

Despite his sinister reputation, Engel was not a malevolent force. He operated on a higher plane than that - a realm where right and wrong were mere mortal concepts. His actions were guided by a twisted sense of justice, one that demanded balance be struck in the universe.

One day, Engel received an invitation from a reclusive billionaire to meet at his private estate on the outskirts of town. The message was cryptic, but it promised secrets of unimaginable power and importance.

Engel arrived under cover of darkness, his presence marked by the fluttering of leaves as he glided across the grounds. He moved with an unnerving silence, a ghostly figure haunting the shadows.

Upon entering the mansion, Engel found himself surrounded by an assembly of influential figures - politicians, business leaders, and high-society elite. But what they wanted from him was not to be revealed until later that night...
