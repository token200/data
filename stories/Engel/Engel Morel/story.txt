Engel Morel stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the bustling streets of 19th century Paris. The gas lamps cast a warm glow over the crowded sidewalks, illuminating the faces of passersby as they went about their day. Engel, with her wild tangles of curly brown hair and bright green eyes, blended in seamlessly among the throngs of people.

As she made her way through the winding streets, Engel's mind wandered to the letter she had received earlier that morning from her friend, Colette. The letter spoke of a mysterious art piece that had caught her eye at the latest exhibition, and Engel felt an overwhelming urge to see it for herself.

She arrived at the gallery, a small, unassuming building tucked away on a side street. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of paint and turpentine, and the soft murmur of conversation filled the room. Engel's eyes scanned the space, searching for the elusive artwork that had piqued her interest.

As she wandered through the galleries, Engel stumbled upon a small, dimly lit room tucked away at the back of the building. The walls were adorned with an assortment of strange and beautiful objects, each one more intriguing than the last. And then, nestled in the corner of the room, Engel saw it: a stunning portrait of a woman with piercing blue eyes, her skin as pale as alabaster.

Engel felt a shiver run down her spine as she gazed upon the painting. She knew, without a doubt, that this was the work of her friend Colette's brother, the enigmatic artist known only by his pseudonym, "Le Cygne." The portrait seemed to whisper secrets in her ear, drawing Engel in with an otherworldly allure.

As she stood there, lost in the depths of the painting, Engel felt a sense of connection that went beyond mere art appreciation. She sensed that this was more than just a beautiful image - it was a message from the mysterious Le Cygne himself, speaking directly to her soul.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Engel turned and left the gallery, the portrait's haunting beauty echoing in her mind long after she had emerged into the bright sunlight of the Parisian streets.
