Engel Bērziņa stepped into the dimly lit room, her eyes scanning the space for any signs of trouble. As a skilled operative for the Latvian intelligence agency, she had faced her fair share of danger, but tonight's mission felt different.

Her full name, Engel Bērziņa, echoed in her mind as she made her way to the source of the signal. The encrypted message had hinted at a mole within the agency, and Engel was determined to uncover their identity before it was too late.

She moved with precision, avoiding the security cameras and guards patrolling the corridors. Her instincts told her that this was more than just a simple surveillance operation – something bigger was at play.

As she reached the server room, Engel's heart rate quickened. She swiftly bypassed the firewalls and accessed the mainframe, searching for any clues left behind by the mole. The code crunched through her mind like a puzzle, and after what felt like an eternity, the answer clicked into place.

Engel's eyes widened as she discovered a trail of digital breadcrumbs leading straight to her own handler. Her full name, Engel Bērziņa, seemed to mock her now, as if the mole had been playing a twisted game of cat and mouse all along.

But Engel was not one to be outsmarted. With newfound determination, she set out to confront her handler and uncover the truth behind the mole's identity. The air was thick with tension as she made her way back to the briefing room, where her team waited anxiously for her findings.

As the truth slowly unraveled, Engel's face remained stoic, but a hint of pride flickered in her eyes. She had solved the puzzle, and now it was time to bring the traitor to justice. The name "Engel Bērziņa" would be on their lips once again – this time as a hero, not a suspect.
