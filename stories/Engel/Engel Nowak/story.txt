Engel Nowak sat alone in the dimly lit café, sipping on a lukewarm coffee as she stared out the rain-soaked window. It had been months since she'd last spoken to her family, and the silence was starting to get to her.

As a brilliant and reclusive physicist, Engel's work had taken a backseat to her personal struggles. Her obsession with unlocking the secrets of dark matter had become an all-consuming force in her life, driving her to neglect those who cared about her most.

Engel's thoughts drifted back to her childhood, when she'd first discovered her passion for physics. Her parents, though supportive, had always encouraged her to pursue a more "stable" career path. But Engel was resolute – she knew that the truth was out there, hidden behind the veil of reality.

As the rain continued to fall outside, Engel's eyes grew tired and heavy. She felt like she was drowning in her own thoughts, suffocating under the weight of her own expectations. She took a deep breath and let it out slowly, trying to clear the fog from her mind.

Just then, a stranger walked into the café, shaking the rain off their coat. Engel watched as they took a seat at the bar, ordering a whiskey on the rocks. There was something about this person that drew her in – perhaps it was the way they seemed to be aware of the world around them, even when no one else was.

The stranger caught her eye and smiled, beckoning her over with a nod. Engel hesitated for a moment before getting up from her seat and walking towards them. As she approached, she felt a spark of recognition – this person knew her, or at least understood her in ways that few others did.

"Engel Nowak," the stranger said, their voice low and smooth. "I've been looking for you."

Engel's heart skipped a beat as she took a seat beside them. Who was this person? And what did they know about her that no one else did? She leaned in, her curiosity getting the better of her.
