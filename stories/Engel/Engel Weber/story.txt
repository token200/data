Engel Weber was an enigmatic figure, shrouded in mystery and intrigue. A former thief turned reformed socialite, she had built a reputation for her wit, charm, and unparalleled ability to navigate high society with ease.

Born into poverty, Engel had been forced to rely on her wits and cunning from a young age. She had quickly become adept at picking locks, bypassing security systems, and pilfering valuable items from the elite's most secure collections. However, after a particularly close call with the law, Engel had seen the error of her ways.

She turned herself in, using her ill-gotten gains to fund her own rehabilitation program. For years, she worked tirelessly to rebuild her life, learning new skills and earning legitimate credentials as a businesswoman and philanthropist.

Despite her newfound respectability, Engel's past continued to haunt her. She was plagued by nightmares of the streets, haunted by the ghosts of those she had wronged in her former life. There were times when she felt like she would never be able to shake off the tag of a thief, no matter how hard she tried.

One night, an invitation arrived at Engel's doorstep from her estranged childhood friend, Alexander. A wealthy and influential businessman, he had made his fortune through questionable means, and the two had long since lost touch.

As Engel attended Alexander's lavish charity gala, old habits began to resurface. She was drawn to a small, intricately carved box on display – an heirloom rumored to have been pilfered from a prominent collector. Her fingers twitched with instinctual desire to open it, but she restrained herself, reminding herself of the progress she had made.

For the rest of the evening, Engel played the part of the reformed socialite to perfection, charming Alexander and his guests with her wit and poise. But as she slipped away into the night, she couldn't shake off the feeling that a part of her was still waiting patiently for its next opportunity – the call of the high-stakes game, the thrill of the heist.

Engel's gaze drifted back to the box, now safely tucked away in her clutch. The memory of its intricate carvings lingered on her mind like a ghostly whisper: "You'll never be free."
