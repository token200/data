Engel Sienkiewicz stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the quaint town before her. The sign above the station read "Raven's Peak," a place Engel had always been drawn to, despite its eerie reputation. She felt an inexplicable pull to this forsaken corner of the world, where the moon dipped into the darkness like a ghostly sentinel.

As she made her way through the deserted streets, Engel couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching her. Her piercing green eyes scanned the shadows, but saw nothing. The town seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for something – or someone – to stir.

Engel Sienkiewicz had always been a seeker of truth, a weaver of mysteries and half-truths. She'd spent years researching the dark history of Raven's Peak, pouring over dusty tomes and speaking with locals who'd lived here all their lives. But nothing could have prepared her for the sense of unease that settled in the pit of her stomach as she walked.

A chill ran down her spine as a gust of wind whipped through the streets, extinguishing the flickering streetlamps and plunging Engel into darkness. She quickened her pace, her long black coat billowing behind her like a dark cloud. The buildings seemed to loom closer, their windows like empty eyes staring back at her.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was an old woman, her face twisted with age and malice. Engel's instincts screamed warning, but she stood frozen, transfixed by the old woman's gaze. For a moment, they locked eyes, two souls connected across centuries of secrets and lies.

The old woman spoke in a voice that sent shivers down Engel's spine: "Welcome, Engel Sienkiewicz. I've been waiting for you." As the words hung in the air, the darkness seemed to coalesce into something tangible, a presence that wrapped itself around Engel like a shroud.

For a moment, she was lost in its depths, her mind unraveling like threads pulled from a tapestry. When the light flickered back to life, Engel Sienkiewicz stood panting, her eyes locked on the old woman's face. She knew then that she'd stumbled into something much larger than herself – and that her quest for truth had just become a journey into the very heart of darkness.
