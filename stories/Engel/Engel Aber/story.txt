Engelbert "Engel" Aber was a man shrouded in mystery. A former spy and assassin, he had spent years honing his skills in the shadows of international politics. His past was a labyrinth of intrigue and deception, with whispers of betrayal and murder hanging like a dark cloud over his head.

Despite this, Engel remained an enigma, a ghostly figure who seemed to appear and disappear at will. He was a master of disguise, able to adopt new identities and backstories with ease, making it impossible for even the most skilled investigators to track him down.

One night, Engel received a message from a mysterious source, inviting him to meet at an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. Curious, Engel accepted the invitation, arriving at the designated location in his nondescript sedan.

As he stepped out of the car, a figure emerged from the shadows, clad in a black coat and fedora. "Engelbert Aber," the figure said, voice low and gravelly, "I have information about your past that you won't want to hear."

Engel's instincts told him to be wary, but he was drawn in by the stranger's words. What could this person possibly know about his troubled history? The two of them exchanged a few tense moments, before the figure handed Engel a small package.

 Inside, Engel found a series of photographs and documents detailing his time as an assassin for a secret government agency. His eyes scanned the pages, his mind racing with memories he had long suppressed.

Suddenly, the warehouse door burst open, and a team of heavily armed guards stormed in, shouting orders at the stranger. "Get him!" one of them bellowed, as they converged on Engel, trapping him between their guns and the wall.

Engel smiled wryly to himself, even as he realized his cover had been blown. "Looks like my luck has run out," he said, eyes flicking to the package in his hand.

As the guards closed in, Engel made a split-second decision. With a swift movement, he tossed the package onto the floor and lunged at the guards, taking them down one by one. The stranger watched with a mixture of awe and wariness as Engel Aber dispatched the would-be assassins with ease.

When it was all over, Engel stood panting, his back against the wall. "You owe me," he said to the stranger, who simply nodded, before disappearing into the night, leaving Engel to ponder the true nature of their mysterious connection.
