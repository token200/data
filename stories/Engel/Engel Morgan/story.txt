Engel Morgan stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the cityscape as the sun dipped below the horizon. As a private investigator, she had seen her fair share of darkness and deception, but this case was different. This one felt personal.

She took a deep breath, letting the cool evening air fill her lungs, and began to survey the scene before her. The sound of sirens echoed through the streets, growing louder with each passing moment. Engel's instincts told her that this was it – the moment she had been waiting for.

As she turned to leave, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was Alex, her old friend and ally in the world of espionage. "Engel Morgan," he said, his voice low and serious. "We've got something."

Alex handed her a folder containing classified documents and photographs. Engel's eyes scanned the contents, her mind racing with connections and conclusions. This was it – the proof she needed to bring down the organization responsible for her sister's death.

Engel Morgan's thoughts were consumed by memories of her childhood, spent playing in the streets alongside Alex. They had grown up together, forged in the fire of their parents' troubled past. Her mother, a former CIA operative, had been killed on assignment when Engel was just a teenager. Her father, a ruthless mercenary, had disappeared soon after.

As she delved deeper into the case, Engel felt a familiar sense of anger and determination rising to the surface. This was her chance for revenge, her opportunity to bring justice to those who had wronged her family.

The wind picked up, rustling Engel's hair as she stood at the edge of the rooftop, looking out over the city. She knew that the road ahead would be fraught with danger and uncertainty, but she was ready. With Alex by her side, and the weight of her sister's memory driving her forward, Engel Morgan was determined to see justice served.

With a newfound sense of resolve, Engel turned to face Alex. "Let's get to work," she said, her voice firm and resolute. Together, they set out into the night, ready to take on whatever lay ahead in their quest for truth and vengeance.
