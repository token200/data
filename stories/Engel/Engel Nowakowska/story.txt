Engel Nowakowska stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar landscape before her. She had always been drawn to the unknown, and the small town of Ravenswood was no exception.

As she made her way through the station, Engel couldn't help but notice the curious glances from the locals. Her striking features – piercing green eyes and raven-black hair – seemed to draw attention like a magnet. She smiled to herself, used to being the center of attention wherever she went.

Engel had left her old life behind, fleeing the city's concrete jungle for the quiet solitude of Ravenswood. She had inherited a small cottage from a distant relative, along with a mysterious letter and a promise of adventure. Engel Nowakowska was not one to shy away from a challenge, and the prospect of unraveling the secrets of her new home was too enticing to resist.

As she wandered through the town's quaint streets, Engel stumbled upon a small antique shop tucked away on a side street. The sign above the door read "Curios and Antiques," and Engel felt an inexplicable pull towards it. She pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside, where she was enveloped by a labyrinth of dusty artifacts and forgotten treasures.

The shopkeeper, an elderly man with spectacles perched on the end of his nose, looked up from behind the counter and smiled at Engel Nowakowska. "Welcome to my humble abode," he said, his voice low and soothing. "I see you have a taste for the unknown."

Engel nodded, her eyes roving over the shelves upon shelves of peculiar items. She ran her fingers over the spines of ancient books, feeling a shiver run down her spine as she touched something that didn't belong to this world.

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the shop, Engel knew it was time to leave. But not before she asked the shopkeeper about the mysterious letter and the promise of adventure that had brought her to Ravenswood. The old man smiled knowingly, his eyes glinting with a hint of mischief. "Ah, my dear Engel Nowakowska," he said, "the secrets of this town are only just beginning to surface."
