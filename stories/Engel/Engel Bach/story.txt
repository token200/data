Engel Bach stepped out of his small, cluttered apartment and onto the foggy streets of Berlin. It was the first day of November, and the city seemed to be shrouded in a thick, gray mist that matched Engel's mood. He had just received news from the University of Music that he would not make it into their prestigious composition program – again.

As he walked down the sidewalk, Engel's eyes scanned the buildings, taking in the familiar sights and sounds of his city. He passed by the Berlin Cathedral, its towering spire reaching for the clouds like a skeletal finger. The smell of roasting chestnuts wafted through the air, enticing passersby to stop and buy a warm snack.

Engel stopped at a small café on Leipziger Straße, ordering a cup of strong black coffee that he knew would help him shake off his disappointment. As he sipped his coffee, he pulled out his notebook and began to scribble down fragments of ideas that had been swirling in his head for weeks.

Music was Engel's passion – his escape from the world and its expectations. He had grown up playing violin in a local orchestra, but after a tragic accident involving his father's death and his own near-fatal injuries, Engel had put his music aside to focus on healing and recovery. Now, at 25, he felt lost again, unsure if he was good enough or talented enough to make it as a composer.

As the hours passed, Engel's notebook grew fuller, filled with ideas that seemed to pulse and thrum like a living thing. He wrote of darkness and light, of love and loss – all the things that had shaped him into the person he was today.

As the fog began to lift, Engel closed his notebook and stood up, feeling a small spark of hope ignite within him. Maybe this wasn't the end – maybe it was just the beginning. He took a deep breath, the cool air filling his lungs, and set off into the unknown, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.

For Engel Bach, music was more than just notes on a page or sounds in the air – it was life itself. And as he walked out of the café, coffee-stained notebook clutched tightly in his hand, he knew that no matter what came next, he would always be composing his own story.
