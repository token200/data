Engel Mitchell was a man shrouded in mystery. Few knew much about his past, and even fewer had seen him smile. But there was something about him that commanded attention – an aura of quiet confidence that made people want to know more.

As a young man, Engel had been a soldier in the special forces. He'd seen some terrible things on the battlefield, but it was during one mission that he got caught by the enemy. The last thing he remembered was being bound and gagged, left to rot in an abandoned cave.

When he woke up, Engel found himself in a foreign hospital, with no memory of how he'd gotten there or what had happened to him. They told him he'd been rescued from a nearby village after days of struggling to survive, but the story was fragmented and full of holes.

Years went by, and Engel rebuilt his life under assumed identities. He worked as a handyman, a cook, anything that didn't require too much human interaction. But at night, he'd sit in the dark, staring at old photographs from his time in the army, searching for any clues about what had happened to him.

One evening, while cleaning out an old storage unit, Engel stumbled upon a small notebook with a single sentence scrawled on the last page: 'They took everything. I'll take back what's mine.' It was all he'd ever found, but it gave him hope – hope that one day he'd uncover the truth about his past and the people who had kept their secrets locked away.

As Engel began to piece together fragments of memories, he started to notice strange occurrences around town. People would cross paths with him in the market, exchanging cryptic messages or slipping him envelopes containing scraps of paper with coded symbols. It was as if he'd finally been found by those who wanted to keep their hands on his secrets.

And then there was Emily – a young nurse at the hospital where Engel had spent months being treated for injuries that couldn't be explained. She seemed kind and genuine, but her eyes held an underlying sense of recognition that made him wonder if she knew more about him than she let on.

With every step forward, Engel felt like he was unraveling threads from a long-forgotten tapestry – a web of secrets, lies, and hidden truths that had kept him captive for so long. He couldn't help but feel drawn to Emily, sensing that together they could unmask the mysteries surrounding his past. The question was: were they prepared for what came next?
