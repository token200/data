Engel Jain stood alone in the dimly lit alley, her eyes scanning the crowded streets of Tokyo's Shinjuku district. She was a ghost, invisible to the human eye, but she knew what it meant to be seen. To be perceived as just another faceless soul lost in the city.

Her thoughts drifted back to the small village where she grew up, surrounded by lush greenery and rolling hills. She remembered the warm sun on her skin, the sound of birds chirping, and the gentle breeze rustling through the leaves. But that life was a distant memory now, buried beneath the layers of concrete and steel.

Engel's past was one of pain and loss. Her mother had passed away when she was just a child, leaving her father to care for their young son alone. The weight of responsibility had crushed him, and he abandoned his family to escape the grief that consumed him.

As Engel grew older, she realized she was being raised by a series of strangers, each one trying to fill the void left by her mother's absence. But no one could ever truly replace her. She felt like a leaf blown away by the wind, never finding its place in the world.

And so, Engel had learned to hide. To conceal herself from the prying eyes of humanity. She mastered the art of stealth and deception, moving through crowds unnoticed, always staying just out of reach.

But one day, as she watched a group of children playing in the park, something within her stirred. They laughed and chased each other with reckless abandon, their smiles unbridled and free. For the first time in years, Engel felt a spark of longing, a desire to be seen, to be known, to be loved.

As she turned away from the park, Engel knew she couldn't stay hidden forever. She needed to find her place in the world, to rediscover herself, to let go of the ghosts that haunted her past. And so, with a newfound sense of determination, she began her journey through Tokyo's streets, one step closer to embracing her true self.

In this bustling city, Engel Jain was just another anonymous face, but beneath her surface, a light flickered, illuminating the path towards healing and redemption.
