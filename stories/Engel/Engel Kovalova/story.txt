Engel Kovalova stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the sleepy town of Ravenswood. She had been on the run for weeks, ever since her sister's mysterious death in Budapest. The police had given up, but Engel knew the truth - that she was being hunted by a ruthless organization.

As she made her way through the station, Engel's mind wandered back to her sister, Natalia. They had always been close, sharing secrets and dreams that only they understood. But when Natalia started asking questions about their family's past, something changed. She became obsessed with uncovering the truth, and Engel knew that she was playing with fire.

The streets of Ravenswood were narrow and winding, lined with old buildings that seemed to lean in, as if sharing a secret. Engel felt like an outsider, but she had no choice - she needed to find answers, and fast.

She ducked into a small café on the corner, ordering a coffee as she scanned the room for any sign of trouble. The patrons were a mix of locals and travelers, all huddled over their own stories. Engel spotted a young woman with piercing green eyes, who looked like she had been watching her from across the room.

The woman - Lena - followed Engel to the café, sitting down beside her without a word. "You're Natalia's sister," she said, her voice low and urgent. "I've been tracking you for weeks."

Engel felt a surge of fear, but Lena's next words calmed her nerves. "We need to talk about what happened in Budapest. I have information that can help you."

Over steaming cups of coffee, Engel learned that Lena was part of an underground resistance movement, fighting against the same organization that had killed Natalia. They had been tracking Engel too, but Lena knew that she was the key to unlocking their secrets.

As they spoke, Engel realized that her sister's death had set off a chain reaction - one that would lead her down a path of danger and discovery. But with Lena by her side, she felt a sense of hope that she hadn't felt in months.

Together, they vowed to uncover the truth, no matter the cost. And as they left the café, Engel knew that this was just the beginning of her journey - one that would take her to the very heart of Ravenswood's secrets.
