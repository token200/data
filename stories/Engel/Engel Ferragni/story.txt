Engel Ferragni stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the glittering lights of Milan. As the heir to his fashion empire, he had seen it all – the highs and lows of high-end design, the triumphs and failures of his family's legacy.

But tonight was different. Tonight, Engel felt a restlessness that went beyond mere burnout. He had always been driven by a need for perfection, for innovation, but lately, he'd been questioning whether it was all worth it. The constant pressure to produce, the endless scrutiny from critics and social media – it was taking its toll.

As he turned to leave the rooftop, Engel spotted a young woman sitting alone on a nearby bench. She had a sketchbook open in her lap, pencils scattered around her like confetti. For a moment, they just looked at each other, two strangers sharing the same melancholy.

"Mind if I join you?" Engel asked finally, taking a seat beside her.

"Not at all," she replied, not looking up from her drawing. "I'm just trying to escape."

Engel nodded in understanding. He knew that feeling all too well. "I used to love sketching like this," he said, picking up one of the pencils and beginning to doodle on a scrap piece of paper.

The woman looked up, curiosity sparking in her eyes. "What's your name?" she asked.

"I'm Engel Ferragni," he replied, smiling wryly.

For the first time in years, Engel felt like he was being seen – not as a CEO or a fashion icon, but as a person. The young woman listened intently as he spoke of his struggles, offering words of encouragement that touched something deep within him.

As they talked, the city lights seemed to fade into the background, replaced by the gentle hum of conversation and the soft scratch of pencils on paper. For the first time in years, Engel felt like he was creating again – not for the sake of fame or fortune, but for its own sake.

The young woman looked up at him with a smile, her eyes shining with warmth. "Why don't you come back tomorrow?" she said. "We can draw together."

Engel smiled back, feeling a weight lift from his shoulders. Maybe it was time to redefine what success meant to him – maybe it was time to find meaning in the imperfections, not the perfectionism.

As he stood up to leave, Engel Ferragni knew that this chance encounter had changed him forever.
