Engel Wagner stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit café, shaking the water off her long, dark coat. As she waited in line to order, she couldn't help but notice the curious glances from the patrons. Her striking features and piercing green eyes made her stand out in a crowd.

After placing her order, Engel settled at a small table by the window, watching as the rain-soaked streets emptied. She was a woman with a mysterious past, one that few knew about. Fewer still knew the name of her estranged husband, the infamous industrialist, August Wagner.

Engel's thoughts turned to her life before marriage. Growing up in a small town on the outskirts of Berlin, she had always felt stifled by the conventions of society. It was her art – painting and drawing – that set her free. She had spent years honing her craft, studying under some of the greatest artists of the time.

Her marriage to August had been a whirlwind romance, one that had ended in disaster when he discovered her passion for art wasn't lucrative enough. The two had parted ways amicably, but Engel knew she would never be able to show her face in certain circles again.

As she sipped her coffee and sketched out some ideas on her notebook, a young artist walked into the café, eyeing her work with admiration. They struck up a conversation, exchanging stories of their creative journeys. For the first time in years, Engel felt like she belonged.

When her coffee was finished, Engel tucked her sketchbook away and left the café, feeling invigorated by the encounter. As she stepped back into the rain, she smiled to herself, knowing that she had found a new path to follow – one that led her closer to the life she truly wanted. And though August Wagner would always be a part of her past, Engel was excited for the future that lay ahead.
