Engel Lefevre stepped out of the rain-soaked streets and into the dimly lit tavern. The patrons barely looked up as she made her way to the bar, their faces illuminated only by the flickering flames of the fire pit. She took a seat at the end of the counter, next to a gruff-looking man with a thick beard.

"What can I get you?" the bartender asked, his voice like gravel under Engel's ears.

"Just a whiskey," she replied, her eyes scanning the room. The patrons seemed to be all strangers, each with their own secrets and stories. Engel was no exception. She had a reputation for being one of the most skilled spies in the city, but few knew the truth behind her enigmatic smile.

As she sipped her drink, Engel's gaze drifted around the tavern, taking in the whispers and hushed conversations. She was on a mission to uncover a lead about a powerful organization that had been rumored to be hiding in plain sight. It was a long shot, but someone had to take the risk.

The gruff-looking man next to her spoke up, his voice low and gravelly. "You're not like the others, Lefevre," he said, his eyes locking onto hers. "There's something about you that doesn't add up."

Engel raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the stranger's bold statement. "And what makes you think I'm not like the others?" she asked, her voice even and calm.

The man leaned in closer, his breath reeking of smoke and sweat. "I've seen your work, Lefevre," he said, his eyes glinting with a knowing spark. "You're not just a spy – you're a ghost."

Engel's smile faltered for a moment, before she let it slide back into place like silk. She knew the rumors about her reputation, how some said she was a specter, a phantom who appeared and disappeared without warning.

But the man didn't seem to be joking. He leaned in closer still, his voice barely above a whisper. "I've got information that could blow your whole operation to smithereens," he said, his eyes burning with a fierce intensity. "Want to hear it?"

Engel's gaze locked onto his, her mind racing with possibilities. She knew she had to take the risk – after all, that was what spies did best.

"Tell me," she said finally, her voice husky and inviting.
