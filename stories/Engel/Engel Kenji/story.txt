Engel Kenji trudged through the dense forest, his eyes scanning the underbrush for any sign of movement. His partner, Officer Akane, followed closely behind him, her rifle at the ready.

As they moved deeper into the woods, the trees grew taller and the air thickened with an eerie silence. It was as if the very forest itself was watching them, waiting to see what they would do next.

Engel Kenji's mind flashed back to his childhood, growing up in a small village on the outskirts of the city. He had always been drawn to the stories of the old guard, men like himself who wore masks and fought for justice in the shadows. And now, as a member of the elite Task Force, he was determined to uncover the truth behind a string of mysterious disappearances.

"Kenji, wait up!" Akane called out, her voice barely above a whisper.

Engel Kenji stopped in his tracks, looking around cautiously before nodding for Akane to catch up. She emerged from the underbrush, her eyes fixed on something ahead.

"What is it?" Engel Kenji asked, his hand instinctively reaching for his own gun.

"A body," Akane replied, her voice steady. "It's been dragged deep into the forest."

Engel Kenji nodded grimly and began to move forward, his eyes scanning the trees for any sign of movement. As they approached the body, he could feel a sense of dread growing inside him. This was what the Task Force had been searching for – evidence of the human trafficking ring that had been terrorizing the city.

The victim's eyes were frozen in a permanent stare, her skin pale and clammy to the touch. Engel Kenji's grip on his gun tightened as he took in the scene before him. This was just the beginning. He knew it.

With Akane by his side, Engel Kenji set to work examining the body and processing the scene. They would need every shred of evidence they could find to take down the traffickers and bring them to justice.

As they worked, Engel Kenji couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched – that unblinking eyes were trained on them from the trees themselves. He glanced up at Akane, but she seemed oblivious to it all, lost in her own thoughts as she processed the scene.

But Engel Kenji knew better. In this city, you could never be too careful. And when the darkness was watching, only one thing mattered – bringing justice to those who had been left for dead.

With a deep breath, he steeled himself for what lay ahead and began to work on piecing together the evidence, his eyes fixed intently on the road to redemption.
