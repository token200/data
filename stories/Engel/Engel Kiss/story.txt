Engel Kiss was a mysterious figure shrouded in an aura of intrigue. A master thief and scoundrel, Engel's exploits had earned him a reputation as one of the most elusive figures in the underworld. Few knew much about him beyond his striking features and razor-sharp wit.

Born into a life of poverty on the streets of Ashenhold, Engel had quickly learned to rely on his cunning and agility to survive. As he grew older, his talents for thievery began to take center stage, earning him a coveted spot among the city's most skilled pickpockets.

Despite his dubious profession, Engel possessed an air of charm that made it impossible for those around him to stay mad at him for long. His wit was quick, his smile disarming, and his eyes sparkled with mischief, drawing people in like moths to a flame.

Engel's latest score had been a particularly daring heist, infiltrating the heavily guarded mansion of the wealthy merchant, Marcellus Blackwood. With his quick thinking and expertise in disguise, Engel managed to pilfer a small fortune in gold and jewels before making off into the night.

Rumors began to circulate among the city's underworld that Engel had finally met his match â€“ but it was a rumor that would prove true sooner rather than later. As he sat at the local tavern, sipping on a mug of cheap ale and listening to the gossipmongers' tales of his exploits, a mysterious figure approached him.

"You're Engel Kiss," the woman said, her voice husky with an air of authority. "I've been searching for you."

Engel raised an eyebrow as he leaned in closer. "And who might you be?" he asked, his tone laced with curiosity.

"I'm the one who's going to bring your reign of thievery to an end," she replied, a sly smile spreading across her face.

With that, the mysterious woman revealed herself to be none other than Engel's long-lost sister, Elara Kiss. For years, the two had been estranged, but their shared history and family bond proved to be stronger than any deception.

The game was on.
