Engel Dupuis stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of damp earth and decay enveloping her like a warm hug. She had been away for so long, but the small town of Ravenswood still felt like home.

As she walked through the station, Engel's eyes scanned the faces of the locals, searching for someone – anyone – who might be waiting for her. Her stomach twisted with a mix of emotions: excitement to see familiar friends and family, but also anxiety about facing the past.

She had left Ravenswood five years ago, unable to shake the memories of the tragic accident that had claimed the life of her younger brother, Pierre. Engel's guilt and grief had consumed her, driving her to escape the town and the people she loved. But now, with a newfound sense of purpose and direction, she was returning to face the demons she had run from.

Engel made her way through the quiet streets, passing by the old bakery where she used to help Madame Leblanc make croissants for the early morning rush. The familiar smell transported her back to a time when life seemed simpler. She turned onto Main Street, and there, standing outside the old café, was her best friend since childhood, Sophie.

Sophie's eyes widened as Engel approached, and she flung herself into a tight hug. "Enge, it's so good to see you!" she exclaimed, using the nickname only she called her friends by when they were younger.

As they walked together, chatting about everything and nothing, Engel couldn't help but notice the way Sophie's eyes lingered on hers, a hint of concern hidden beneath the warmth. She knew that Sophie understood the weight Engel carried with her, and that she was there to support her every step of the way.

Together, they made their way to the town hall, where Engel had arranged to meet with the mayor to discuss plans for reviving the old park where Pierre used to play. It was a small gesture, but one that felt like a crucial step towards healing and closure.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across Ravenswood, Engel Dupuis stood tall, her shoulders squared and her heart heavy with emotion. She knew that facing the past wouldn't be easy, but with friends like Sophie by her side, she was ready to confront whatever came next.
