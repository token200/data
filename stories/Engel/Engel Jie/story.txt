Engel Jie stepped off the crowded train and onto the platform, her bright pink hair a stark contrast to the drab surroundings of Shanghai's West Nanjing Road. As she emerged from the chaos of the station, she breathed in the humid air, feeling the weight of her backpack settle onto her shoulders.

At 25 years old, Engel had already made a name for herself as an artist, known for her bold and unapologetic works that tackled social justice issues with unwavering conviction. Her paintings were like a slap in the face, shaking viewers out of their complacency and making them confront the harsh realities of modern China.

As she walked through the city streets, Engel's eyes scanned the towering skyscrapers and crowded sidewalks, taking in the cacophony of sounds and smells that defined this frenetic metropolis. She was on her way to meet with a potential client, a wealthy businessman who had expressed interest in commissioning one of her pieces.

Engel stopped at a street food stall, ordering a steaming bowl of noodles as she watched a group of young women laughing and chatting in the corner. They were all dressed in similar outfits, their bright pink hair tied back in identical ponytails – it was clear that they were part of some sort of avant-garde collective.

The vendor handed her a scalding hot bowl, and Engel took a bite, feeling the noodles dissolve on her tongue. As she ate, she pulled out her phone and began to scroll through social media, seeing how many people had viewed her latest posts. She was always trying to stay connected with her fans, who were often her most ardent supporters.

After finishing her meal, Engel continued on her way, the city streets blurring together as she walked towards her destination. She had a feeling that this meeting would be important – if this businessman followed through on his promise, it could mean a significant boost to her career.

As she turned onto the street where her meeting was supposed to take place, Engel's heart began to pound in her chest. What would today bring? Would she be able to stay true to herself and her art, or would the pressures of fame get to her?

The businessman greeted her with a firm handshake, his eyes scanning her over-sized coat and bright pink hair before focusing on the stack of portfolio pieces in front of her. Engel smiled confidently, ready to present her latest work – but little did she know that this meeting would be anything but straightforward.
