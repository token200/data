One day, while exploring the city, Engel stumbled upon an old antique shop. As he browsed through the shelves, his eyes landed on a peculiar vase that caught his attention. The owner noticed his fascination and approached him. "Ah, you've found the Starlight Vase," she said.

In the midst of this creative fervor, Engel received an unexpected visit from a representative of a prestigious museum.
