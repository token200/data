Engel Ozola's latest target was the city's mayor, who had been accused of embezzling millions from the city's budget. With a trail of clues leading to an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town, Engel steeled herself for what she might find.

As she left the warehouse, Engel couldn't help but feel a sense of pride in her work. Engel Ozola, once just another young journalist trying to make a name for herself, had become a force to be reckoned with in the world of investigative journalism.
