Engel Jhih-hao was known for her striking features and sharp wit, earning her a reputation as one of the most feared assassins in the city's underworld. A master of stealth and deception, Engel had built a lucrative business out of eliminating targets with precision and poise.

One fateful evening, Engel received a lucrative offer from a wealthy client to take out a rival businessman who had been causing trouble for his interests. Engel accepted the job, eager to prove her skills and earn a hefty payday.

As she prepared for the hit, Engel's mind wandered back to her troubled past. Born into poverty on the streets of the city, Engel had grown up fighting for survival. But it was her natural talent for combat and her unyielding determination that had set her apart from the rest. She had honed her skills in secret, using her wits and cunning to outmaneuver even the most formidable foes.

With her target in sight, Engel set out to put on a display of her deadly prowess. Disguising herself as a servant girl, she infiltrated the rival businessman's mansion under the cover of darkness. As she made her way through the labyrinthine corridors, Engel expertly dispatched any guards who dared to stand in her way.

Finally, she reached the target – a smug and arrogant man named Victor. With a few swift strokes of her dagger, Engel sent him crashing to the floor. It was a flawless execution, one that would cement her reputation as a master assassin.

As Engel collected her payment and disappeared into the night, she couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. She had done what she did best – taken out a target with precision and finesse. And as she vanished into the shadows, Engel Jhih-hao knew that she was more than just an assassin – she was a force to be reckoned with.

Her legend would grow, whispers of her exploits spreading through the city's underworld like wildfire. But for now, Engel simply smiled to herself, knowing that she had once again proved herself to be the best in the business.
