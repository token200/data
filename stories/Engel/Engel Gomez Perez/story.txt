After completing art school, Engel decided to pursue a career as a painter himself. He spent countless hours honing his craft, experimenting with different techniques and mediums. His unique style, which blended elements of Abstract Expressionism with Brazilian folk art, quickly gained attention from local galleries and collectors.

As Engel's reputation grew, so did his love for music. He began taking guitar lessons in the evenings, teaching himself to play samba rhythms that echoed through the streets of Rio during Carnival celebrations. The sounds of the drums and saxophones filled his studio, inspiring new works and fueling his creativity.

After the exhibition, Engel continued to push boundaries, exploring new themes and techniques in his work. His studio became a hub for creative gatherings, where fellow artists and musicians would come to share ideas and collaborate on projects. Among them was Maria, a talented singer-songwriter who inspired Engel with her powerful voice and heartfelt lyrics.

As Engel looked around at the vibrant group of creatives surrounding him, he knew that his full name, Engel Gomez Perez, had finally come into its own â€“ symbolizing not only his artistic talents but also his deep connection to the city and culture he loved.
