Engel Larsen stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the bustling streets of Copenhagen's Latin Quarter. As a private investigator, she had seen her fair share of shady characters and clandestine meetings, but tonight felt different. A cryptic message from an old acquaintance had led her to this moment.

With her dark hair tied back in a tight ponytail and a pair of wire-rimmed glasses perched on the end of her nose, Engel Larsen surveyed the crowded square. She spotted a figure cloaked in shadows near the corner of a streetlamp, their features obscured by the soft light.

As she approached, the figure turned to face her, revealing a woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. "Engel Larsen," the woman said, her voice husky and confident. "I've been expecting you."

The two women locked gazes, each aware of the unspoken tension between them. Engel Larsen had worked with this woman before, on cases that required a delicate touch and an unwavering sense of justice.

"What do you want?" Engel Larsen asked bluntly, her eyes scanning the surrounding area for any signs of surveillance.

"I have information about your sister," the woman replied, her voice barely above a whisper. "Information that could change everything."

Engel's grip on her coffee cup tightened as she felt a cold dread creeping up her spine. Her younger sister, Sofie, had gone missing six months ago, leaving behind only a cryptic note with a single phrase: "I'm being watched."

The woman handed Engel Larsen a small USB drive containing a series of encrypted files. As Engel took it, their eyes met once more, and for an instant, she saw a flicker of recognition – a bond forged from trust and shared secrets.

With a calculated decision, Engel Larsen tucked the USB drive into her pocket and nodded. "Let's get to work."

Together, they vanished into the crowded streets, ready to unravel the tangled threads of Sofie's disappearance and bring justice to those responsible. As Engel walked away from the Latin Quarter, she knew that this case would be one for the books – and she was proud to be Engel Larsen, private investigator extraordinaire.
