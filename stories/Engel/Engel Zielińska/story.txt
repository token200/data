Engel Zielińska was a name that whispered intrigue in the streets of Krakow. A young woman with an enigmatic smile and piercing green eyes, she had always been a subject of fascination for those who knew her.

As a child, Engel's parents had moved to Krakow from rural Poland, seeking a better life for their daughter. She grew up surrounded by the city's rich history and culture, learning to navigate its winding streets and hidden alleys with ease.

She would spend hours capturing the city's beauty, from the golden light of dawn breaking over the Vistula River to the vibrant colors of the street performers in the main square. Her camera became an extension of herself, allowing her to freeze moments in time and share them with the world.

One fateful evening, Engel's lens captured a glimpse of something extraordinary – a ghostly figure lurking in the shadows of St. Mary's Basilica. Some said it was the spirit of a long-forgotten king, while others claimed it was merely a trick of the light. But Engel knew the truth: she had stumbled upon something much more profound.
