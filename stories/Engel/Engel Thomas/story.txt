Engel Thomas stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the familiar landscape. It had been years since she'd returned to her hometown of Ravenswood, but the memories still lingered like a gentle fog. As she made her way through the quiet streets, Engel's eyes scanned the old buildings, taking in the subtle changes that time had brought.

She thought back to her childhood, growing up with her mother, Ruth Thomas, who had taught her the value of hard work and resilience. After her father's passing, her mother had become Engel's rock, guiding her through the ups and downs of adolescence. Now, as an adult, Engel felt a sense of restlessness, a desire to forge her own path.

As she walked, the streets grew more crowded, and Engel spotted a familiar face - old friend and confidant, Marcus Reed. They exchanged warm smiles, and Marcus invited Engel to join him for a drink at the local pub.

Inside, the atmosphere was lively, with locals swapping stories and sharing laughter. Engel slid onto a stool beside Marcus, feeling the weight of her past slowly lifting. Over drinks, they talked about everything and nothing, their conversation flowing as effortlessly as the river that ran through Ravenswood's heart.

As the evening wore on, Engel found herself lost in thought, reflecting on the journey that had brought her back to this place. She thought of her mother, who had always encouraged her to chase her dreams, even when they seemed impossible. Engel's eyes drifted closed, and for a moment, she felt Ruth Thomas's presence, urging her forward.

The night wore on, and Engel eventually made her way home, the stars above twinkling like diamonds in the sky. She knew that Ravenswood would always be a part of her, but as she lay in bed, she felt a sense of purpose stirring within her, guiding her toward a brighter future. Engel Thomas had come home to stay, and this time, it was for good.
