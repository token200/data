Engel Poirier was a man shrouded in mystery, his past a labyrinth of secrets and half-truths. A former thief, he had spent years honing his skills on the streets, earning a reputation as one of the most elusive con artists of all time. But after a chance encounter with a former flame, Engel found himself drawn back into the world of high-stakes theft.

Engel Poirier's eyes locked onto the prize: a priceless artifact hidden deep within the vaults of a posh museum. The challenge was too great to resist, and he assembled a team of trusted accomplices to aid him in the heist.

As they navigated the museum's security systems, Engel Poirier's mind worked overtime, his fingers dancing across the keyboard as he hacked into the mainframe. His team watched in awe as he effortlessly bypassed each layer of protection, leaving them to wonder how one man could be so skilled.

The night of the heist arrived, and Engel Poirier led the charge, slipping past guards and cameras with ease. He made his way to the artifact, a rare gemstone encrusted in gold, and carefully extracted it from its display case. The team gathered around as he handed them each a small pouch containing their share of the loot.

But just as they were about to make their escape, Engel Poirier's phone buzzed with an unknown number. He hesitated for a moment before answering, his expression unreadable. "Who is this?" he asked gruffly.

A low voice spoke on the other end of the line. "Someone who knows your true identity, Engel Poirier. Someone who knows about your past." The voice fell silent, leaving Engel Poirier to ponder the implications.

The team exchanged nervous glances as Engel Poirier made a quick decision. They would leave the museum immediately, and lay low for a while. As they vanished into the night, one thing was certain: Engel Poirier's life had just become a lot more complicated.
