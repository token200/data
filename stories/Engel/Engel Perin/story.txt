Engel Perin stepped out of the misty morning air and into the old café, shaking the dew from her coat. The sign above the door creaked in the gentle breeze, reading "El Pescador" – The Fisherman. It was a place where time seemed to stand still, where the sea met the sky.

Engel had grown up on the coast, learning the secrets of the waves and the tides from her father, a fisherman who vanished at sea when she was just a child. She had always felt the ocean's call in her blood, and now, as a young woman, she set out to follow its lead.

As she took a seat at the bar, the bartender – a gruff but kind-hearted man named Jorge – greeted her with a nod. "The usual, Engel?" he asked, as if he knew exactly what she'd want.

Engel smiled and nodded, watching as Jorge expertly mixed a cocktail of rum, lime juice, and sea salt. She took a sip, feeling the familiar burn in her chest, and began to plan her next move. The fisherman's nets had been sold at auction months ago, but Engel was determined to reclaim what was hers.

Jorge leaned against the counter, eyeing her with a knowing gaze. "You're thinking of taking on the gulls again, eh?" he asked, his voice low and conspiratorial.

Engel raised an eyebrow. "What makes you think that?"

The old man chuckled, wiping down the bar with a dirty rag. "You've been out there since dawn, checking the nets. You don't even wear sunscreen anymore."

Engel shrugged, trying to look nonchalant despite the thrill running through her veins. It was true – she'd lost count of the number of times she'd slipped away to the dock at midnight, the sea air calling to her like a siren's song.

But this time would be different, Engel knew. This time, she'd have a plan, and maybe – just maybe – she could bring her father back from the dead. The thought sent a shiver down her spine as she finished her drink and headed out into the misty dawn, the gulls wheeling overhead like specters.

El Pescador's sign creaked once more in the breeze, beckoning Engel to follow its call, into the unknown depths of the sea.
