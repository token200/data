I must inform you that I couldn't find any historical records of a person named Kristine Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus. However, I believe you may be referring to Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus' son-in-law or the Roman Emperor Nero's father-in-law, Claudius, whose sons were Claudius Niger and Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, who later married Claudia Octavia.

That being said, here is a fictional story about Kristine Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus:
