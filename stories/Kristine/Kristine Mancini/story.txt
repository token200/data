Despite her growing success, Kristine remained humble and grounded. She continued to live on the farm with her family, who had always supported her dreams. Her mother would often sit by her side as she worked, offering words of encouragement and advice when needed. Kristine's father, a retired artist himself, would occasionally offer critiques, helping her refine her techniques.
