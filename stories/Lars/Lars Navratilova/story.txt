I think you may be mistaken! The correct spelling of the tennis legend's first and last names is Lindsay, not Lars.

Here's a story about the one and only Lindsay Davenport:

Lindsay Davenport was known for her fierce competitiveness on the court, but few people knew about her off-court passion for horseback riding. As a young girl growing up in Palos Verdes Estates, California, Lindsay would spend hours at the stables with her parents, learning the ins and outs of horse care and riding.

As she grew older and began to pursue her tennis career, Lindsay's love for horses never wavered. She would often bring her own horse, a beautiful chestnut mare named Starlight, to the stables where she trained. The horse became a trusted companion and confidant, offering Lindsay comfort and solace during the long hours of practice and competition.

Despite her success on the tennis court, earning titles like the US Open and Olympic gold, Lindsay's true love remained horses. She went on to become a professional equestrian, competing in local shows and events alongside her beloved Starlight.

Years later, as Lindsay retired from competitive tennis and pursued a career in broadcasting, she still found time for her equine passion. She became an avid advocate for horse welfare, working with organizations to promote the humane treatment of horses and other animals.

Throughout her life, Lindsay Davenport's name was synonymous with excellence on and off the court. Her dedication to both tennis and horses served as a reminder that true greatness is often found in balance and harmony. As she looked back on her remarkable career, Lindsay knew that her love for horses had been an integral part of her journey, one that would continue to inspire her long after her playing days were behind her.
