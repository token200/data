The duke, also known as Lorenzo the Magnificent, was renowned for his wisdom and patronage of the arts. He saw something in Lars that no one else did – potential.

Lars was both thrilled and intimidated by the opportunity to work with the duke. However, he knew that this chance would be a turning point in his career. With the duke's backing, Lars de' Medici set out to create some of the most breathtaking works of art the world had ever seen.

Years went by, and Lars's star continued to rise. His paintings adorned the walls of palaces and churches, earning him widespread acclaim.
