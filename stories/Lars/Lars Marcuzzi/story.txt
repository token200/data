Lars Marcuzzi, a man in his late thirties with an unkempt beard and sunken eyes, trudged through the snow-covered streets of Stockholm. He was on his way to meet an old acquaintance at a dingy bar in the outskirts of town. As he pushed open the door, the bell above it let out a tired clang.

 Inside, the dim lighting struggled to pierce through the haze of stale cigarettes and yesterday's whiskey. Lars spotted a figure huddled in the corner, nursing a half-empty glass. He ambled over, his boots squeaking on the worn floorboards.

"Kalle!" he called out, using the nickname his friend had earned him years ago.

A weathered face turned toward him, eyes red-rimmed from a night of drinking. "Lars," Kalle growled, waving a limp hand in greeting.

The two men settled into their usual seats at the bar, ordering a pair of beers as they began to reminisce about past glories and failures. Lars had always been the more optimistic of the two friends, while Kalle's outlook on life was tempered by the cruel hand of fate.

As the night wore on, their conversation turned to the topic of lost loves and unfinished dreams. Lars confided in Kalle about his own failed relationship, one that had left him feeling hollow and unfulfilled. Kalle listened attentively, his expression a mixture of sorrow and empathy.

For a moment, Lars felt like he was the only person who truly understood his pain. But as they delved deeper into their conversation, Lars noticed something peculiar – Kalle's eyes kept darting toward a figure sitting in the corner, shrouded in shadows.

"Who's that?" Lars asked, curiosity piqued.

Kalle's gaze lingered on the mysterious stranger before he replied, "Just a friend from work. We don't see each other much."

Lars raised an eyebrow but said nothing more. As they finished their beers and prepared to leave, Kalle made one final statement: "We'll get by, Lars. That's what we do."

The two friends stepped out into the cold night air, the city lights casting a faint glow over the snow-covered streets. As they walked side by side, Lars couldn't help but wonder if Kalle was trying to convince himself as much as he was.

But in that moment, amidst the darkness and uncertainty, Lars found a strange sense of solace in his friend's words – they would get by, no matter what life threw their way. And for that, he felt grateful to have Kalle by his side.
