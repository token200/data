Lars Toth stepped into the dimly lit pub, his eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. The patrons were rowdy and loud, but Lars knew the owner, Olga, would have saved him a table by the fire. She did indeed, setting down a mug of steaming ale in front of him.

As he sipped the bitter brew, Lars's mind wandered back to his past. He had left his small town years ago, chasing dreams and adventures that never seemed to come. Now, as a wandering bard, he sang for coins and tales to tell. His full name was still etched in his mind – Lars Toth, son of Gottfried and Astrid – but the memories of his family lingered like an old wound.

Just then, a burly man with a bushy beard caught his eye. "Lars, my friend!" he boomed, slapping him on the back. It was Kael, a fellow traveler and sometime-accomplice. Lars forced a smile onto his face, remembering their wild escapades in the mountains.

As they swapped stories, Lars learned that Kael had settled down for a while, taking on odd jobs to make ends meet. Lars couldn't help but feel a pang of envy; he still roamed free, though without the stability Kael seemed to crave. The fire crackled and spat, casting flickering shadows on the walls as the two friends laughed and talked long into the night.

But eventually, the evening wore on, and Lars knew it was time to move on. With a nod, he tossed a few coins onto the table and stood up, brushing off his cloak. As he exited the pub, the cool night air hit him like a slap in the face. The stars twinkled above, but Lars's heart felt heavy with the weight of his own desires.

He began to walk, lost in thought, as Kael called out after him. "Lars Toth, come back soon! We'll find your family and settle down – together!" But Lars knew that was a lie he'd never be able to tell. For now, he had the world at his feet, and the wind in his hair.
