Lars Abdi was a man of few words, but his presence was imposing. Standing tall at 6'5", he commanded attention in any room he entered. Born with the full name Lars Abdulahi Abdi, he had always known that he was different - not just because of his towering height, but also due to the complex and often tumultuous heritage that came with it.

As a child, Lars struggled to navigate the expectations placed upon him by those around him. His parents, Somali refugees who had fled war-torn East Africa, had instilled in him a strong sense of community and loyalty - values that were deeply ingrained in their culture, but often at odds with the Western world's more individualistic ideals.

Despite these challenges, Lars thrived in his teenage years, using sports to channel his energy and emotions. Basketball became an outlet for him, allowing him to express himself without having to articulate words to convey what was racing through his mind.

As he entered adulthood, Lars's path diverged from the one his parents had envisioned for him. He pursued a degree in business, but found that it wasn't quite a fit for his creative sensibilities. It was during this time that he discovered photography - an art form that spoke to him on a deep level, capturing moments and telling stories without needing words.

Lars's unique perspective and skill set quickly gained attention, landing him jobs with several prominent publications and brands. He became known for his captivating portraits, which not only showcased the beauty of his subjects but also told powerful stories about identity, culture, and belonging.

Throughout his career, Lars's full name was often asked after - Lars Abdulahi Abdi - a name that brought up complex emotions and memories, both happy and sad. But with each passing year, he grew more confident in embracing his heritage and sharing it with the world.

Years later, when people looked at Lars's photographs, they saw not just a talented photographer but also a human being - one who had navigated the challenges of identity and culture to find his own voice, even if that meant speaking only through images.
