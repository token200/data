Lars Salamanca, also known as "Lessons," was a cunning and ruthless hitman who worked for Los Pollos Hermanos, a fast food chain with a dark secret. Behind its bright colors and fried chicken wings, the company was a front for a powerful cartel that controlled much of the Southwest's underworld.

Lars was a master of manipulation, using his charming smile and quick wit to extract information from even the most tight-lipped targets. He had a reputation for being able to "teach" people lessons they would never forget, often leaving them disfigured or dead in their wake.

One day, Lars received a call from Don Hector Salamanca himself, ordering him to pay a visit to a wealthy businessman who had been making threatening remarks about the cartel's interests. Lars arrived at the businessman's mansion, dressed impeccably and carrying a small gift - a bouquet of flowers for his wife, who was waiting anxiously in the living room.

As Lars sipped champagne with the businessman's family, he expertly extracted their deepest fears and desires, using his charisma to put them at ease. Meanwhile, he kept a close eye on the businessman, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

Finally, after what seemed like hours of small talk, Lars made his move, strapping the businessman to a chair and pulling out a pair of bolt cutters. With a few swift cuts, he rendered the man helpless, leaving him writhing in agony as Lars handed him over to his waiting associates.

As Lars walked away from the mansion, he couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction at a job well done. He had once again proved himself to be the go-to guy for "lessons," and Don Hector would be pleased with the results.

Back at Los Pollos Hermanos, Lars slipped into his usual booth, ordering a plate of chicken wings and a cold beer as he watched the evening news scroll by on TV. Another day, another dollar - or rather, another victim to add to his long list of "students" who had learned the value of respect for those in power.

Lars Salamanca smiled to himself, knowing that his next assignment was just around the corner. After all, when you're a master of manipulation like him, there's always someone new to teach a lesson.
