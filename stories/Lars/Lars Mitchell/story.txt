The owner, a retired racing driver, wanted the car to be returned to its former glory and was willing to pay top dollar for it.

Lars accepted the challenge and threw himself into the project. He spent long hours researching the Mustang's specifications, gathering original parts, and carefully disassembling the engine to clean and refurbish every component.
