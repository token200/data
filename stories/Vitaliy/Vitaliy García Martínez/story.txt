Vitaliy García Martínez, a man with an untold past, stepped off the train and onto the worn platform. The station was small, with only one track that led to nowhere but further streets lined with identical houses. He wore a long coat that seemed out of place among the summer air, his eyes hidden behind sunglasses.

Vitaliy had been on the run for what felt like an eternity. His life before this moment was a patchwork of fragmented memories: streets in Buenos Aires where he'd lost himself, nights spent sleeping in abandoned buildings, and faces that lingered too long in his mind. He was a man with no clear identity.

He walked down the station's short corridor, past the waiting passengers who eyed him with suspicion. Some nodded to him; others crossed their arms, wary of this stranger. They knew not what he'd done or where he came from.

Vitaliy bought a ticket for a route that took him east. The landscape changed as the hours passed: deserts gave way to forests and then mountains. He had no destination in mind but the need to keep moving kept driving him forward.

He found a small hostel on the outskirts of town, tucked away among trees and silence. It was here he decided to stop running for now, if only because exhaustion threatened to consume him.

That night, Vitaliy lay in bed, listening to the sounds of sleep around him. He felt like an outsider, caught between worlds where no one could understand him. The ghosts of his past followed him in dreams, their faces blurred but unmistakable. They reached out with cold fingers, begging for a glimpse into a life he had long abandoned.

He slept fitfully, unable to shake the feeling that being still was a temporary reprieve from something inevitable.

Come dawn, Vitaliy left the hostel, taking up work as a gardener in town. It was a simple, quiet job, free of memories or emotions but with enough to keep him occupied. People learned his name and some became familiar faces; he saw the world through their eyes now, though it still felt foreign.

This life had its own rhythm – waking before sunrise to water the plants, walking home during lunch breaks when people were busiest, and coming back in the evening to watch the stars begin their dance again.
