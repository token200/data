Vitaliy Piotrowski was a man with a passion for photography. As a child, he would spend hours in his father's darkroom, learning the art of developing and printing film. Years went by, and Vitaliy honed his craft, becoming one of the most renowned photographers in Poland.

He felt grateful for the journey that had led him to this moment and realized that his passion for photography was not just about capturing images but also about telling stories of people's lives.
