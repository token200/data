Vitaliy Horv√°th stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the familiar station. It was a small, rural town in the heart of Eastern Europe, where he had grown up amidst the rolling hills and quaint villages of his homeland.

As he made his way through the quiet streets, the past seemed to come alive around him. The sound of old-world languages drifted from windows, while the scent of traditional cooking wafted through the air. He felt a sense of longing wash over him, a yearning for the simplicity and beauty of his childhood.

Vitaliy's thoughts were interrupted by the soft chime of a bicycle bell. A young woman with bright blue eyes and curly brown hair pedaled up to him, a backpack slung over her shoulder. "Hello, Vitaliy," she said, her smile radiant. "It's been too long."

He smiled back, feeling a spark of connection that he couldn't quite explain. "Roxana," he replied, his voice low and soothing. "I should have known you'd be the first one to greet me."

Their friendship had started years ago, when Vitaliy was returning from an extended stay abroad. Roxana, then a curious student, would take him on long walks through the forest, listening intently as he shared stories of his travels. As they grew older, their paths diverged, but their bond remained strong.

Now, Roxana told him she had been teaching in Paris for several years and was finally returning to Eastern Europe. "But I couldn't stay away forever," she said with a laugh. "I miss the old country."

Vitaliy nodded sympathetically, watching as Roxana settled into her routine of helping his mother prepare dinner. Her presence brought out the warmth and kindness in the older woman, qualities that Vitaliy had always admired.

As night began to fall, they sat on the porch together, sipping herbal tea and listening to the crickets serenade them. The conversation flowed easily, touching on everything from politics to personal dreams. It was as if no time had passed at all, yet the world around them had changed in ways both subtle and profound.

As Roxana prepared to leave again the next morning, Vitaliy walked her to the station with a newfound appreciation for his childhood home and its people.
