Vitaliy Angert stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. The air was heavy with the smell of damp earth and decay, a scent that seemed to cling to everything in this forgotten corner of the world.

As he made his way through the silence, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was a woman, her features gaunt and her eyes sunken, but there was something about her gaze that made Vitaliy feel seen.

"Welcome back," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Vitaliy hesitated, unsure of how to respond. This was the first time he'd returned to his hometown in years, since his mother's passing and his father's... departure. The weight of those secrets had stayed with him long after he'd left, but being back felt like confronting a part of himself he'd rather not face.

The woman nodded as if she knew exactly what he was thinking. "I've been waiting for you," she said, her eyes never leaving his.

Vitaliy's thoughts drifted to the old stories of this place - the whispers of curses and ancient powers that lurked in the shadows. He'd always dismissed them as mere myth, but now...now he wasn't so sure.

As they walked through the deserted streets, the silence was broken only by the sound of footsteps echoing off the buildings. The woman's name was Katarina, and she claimed to have known Vitaliy's mother in a time long past. She spoke of secrets and ancient rituals that had been passed down through generations, but Vitaliy's ears tuned out as his mind wrestled with the implications.

Eventually, they arrived at an old stone house on the outskirts of town. Katarina pushed open the creaking door, revealing a dimly lit room filled with dusty relics and forgotten artifacts. "This is where it all began," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Vitaliy's eyes roamed over the strange objects scattered about - ancient tomes bound in black leather, gemstones that glowed with an otherworldly light, and artifacts shaped like wings or serpents. He felt like he was staring into a doorway of forgotten knowledge, one that threatened to swallow him whole.

Katarina's hand touched his shoulder, stopping him from reaching out to touch the nearest relic. "This is where you come in," she said, her voice dripping with an unspoken warning.
