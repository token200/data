Aaron Hughes, a rugged and charismatic ex-soldier, stood at the edge of the bustling city square. He had left his military life behind after serving in Afghanistan for five years, and was still trying to find his place in the world.

As he scanned the crowd, his eyes landed on a familiar face - Emily, a social worker who had been assigned to help him adjust to civilian life. She had taken it upon herself to befriend him, and Aaron couldn't help but feel a spark of gratitude towards her kindness.

Aaron took a deep breath and began to walk towards Emily, his boots scuffling against the pavement. As he approached her, she turned around, a warm smile spreading across her face.

"Aaron, how are you doing today?" she asked, falling into step beside him.

"It's not so bad," Aaron replied, his voice gruff from disuse. "Just trying to get used to not being in the trenches every day."

Emily nodded sympathetically. "I know it can't be easy, but you're doing great. You've made a lot of progress since we started working together."

Aaron snorted, feeling a familiar twinge of self-doubt. "Progress is one thing, Emily. But I'm still not sure what I want to do with my life. Or who I am outside of the military."

Emily's expression turned thoughtful. "That's okay, Aaron. You don't have to figure it all out right now. Just take things one step at a time, and trust that you'll find your way."

As they walked, the sounds of the city swirled around them - children laughing, cars honking, people chattering on their phones. It was a cacophony Aaron had grown accustomed to in the past few months, but it still made him feel like an outsider.

Suddenly, Emily stopped in her tracks and turned to face him. "Aaron?"

"Yeah?" he replied, his eyes narrowing slightly.

"Can I ask you something?" she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Sure," Aaron said warily.

"What's the worst thing that happened to you while you were serving?" Emily asked, her eyes searching his face for answers.

For a moment, Aaron hesitated. He hadn't told anyone about it before, not even Emily. But there was something in her gaze that made him trust her.

"It was during my last deployment," he said finally, his voice low and rough. "We were on patrol when one of the guys...he got hit by an IED."

Aaron's eyes dropped to the ground as he struggled to hold back tears. Emily reached out and took his hand, offering him a comforting squeeze.

"I'm so sorry, Aaron," she whispered, her words barely audible over the din of the city.
