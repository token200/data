Aaron Kaczmarek stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, his eyes scanning the rooftops for any signs of movement. As a private investigator, he had seen his fair share of shady characters and illicit dealings, but tonight was different. Tonight, he was on the hunt for information about a wealthy businessman who had gone missing.

Aaron's gaze narrowed as he spotted a figure lingering in the shadows. He approached cautiously, his hand resting on the grip of his gun. The figure turned to face him, revealing a middle-aged woman with piercing green eyes.

"Can I help you?" she asked, her voice low and husky.

"I'm looking for information about Richard Langley," Aaron replied, his eyes locked onto hers. "He's been missing for weeks, and I need to know what happened to him."

The woman's expression remained impassive, but a flicker of unease danced in her eyes. "I don't know anything about Mr. Langley," she lied.

Aaron raised an eyebrow, sensing deception. He pulled out his phone and flashed the picture of Richard Langley on the screen. "Don't play dumb with me," he said, his voice firm but even. "I've been doing this job a long time. I know when someone is hiding something."

The woman hesitated, then slowly reached into her purse and produced a small notebook. She flipped through the pages, stopping at a scribbled note that read: "Langley - meet at warehouse @ midnight".

Aaron's eyes locked onto the page, his mind racing with possibilities. He tucked the notebook back into the woman's purse and handed it to her. "Thank you for your help," he said, his voice neutral.

As the woman took off into the night, Aaron watched her disappear into the crowd, a sense of satisfaction washing over him. Another lead had been unearthed, another piece of the puzzle falling into place. He tucked the notebook into his own bag and set off towards the warehouse, ready to uncover the truth behind Richard Langley's disappearance.

As he walked, Aaron couldn't help but think about the trail that lay ahead of him - a path fraught with danger and uncertainty. But one thing was certain: he would follow it, no matter where it led, because as long as his name was Aaron Kaczmarek, he would keep digging until justice was served.
