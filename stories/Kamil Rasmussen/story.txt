Kamil Rasmussen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station as he breathed in the damp air. He had been traveling for days, ever since he'd received that cryptic letter from an old friend in Oslo. The words had sent a shiver down his spine - "They're looking for you again." Kamil's stomach twisted with anticipation as he gazed out at the drizzly streets of Bergen.

As a child, Kamil had been an orphan living on the streets, surviving by his wits and a rare talent for picking locks. He'd eventually caught the attention of the Norwegian authorities, who'd taken him in and taught him how to use his skills for good. But the memories of those early days still lingered, like scars beneath the surface.

Kamil made his way through the station, nodding at familiar faces as he passed by. People here knew him - a skilled safe-cracker with a reputation for getting out of tight spots. He'd built a life for himself in Bergen, working odd jobs and keeping a low profile. But that letter had changed everything.

As he walked through the city streets, Kamil noticed that people were watching him, following him. He quickened his pace, but they kept pace with him, their eyes fixed on the tattoo of a snake coiled around his right wrist. It was an old habit, one he'd worn since his street days - a symbol of resilience and adaptability.

Eventually, Kamil found himself standing in front of a nondescript office building, its windows gleaming with a fresh coat of paint. He took a deep breath, mentally preparing for what lay ahead. This was it - the meeting, the reunion. His heart hammered as he knocked three times on the door.

The door creaked open to reveal a familiar face - Lena, his old friend from Oslo's underbelly. Her eyes sparkled with mischief as she ushered him inside. The room was filled with old faces, people Kamil had thought were long dead or retired. They all looked at him with an air of expectation, like he was here to make a deal.

Lena cleared her throat and began the conversation. "Kamil, we've got work for you again." Her voice sent shivers down his spine as he gazed around the room, taking in the stack of envelopes bearing his name. It seemed that some things never changed - the people who knew him best were still looking for ways to use him.

For a moment, Kamil felt like he was back on the streets, caught in a web of old alliances and rivalries. But then, something shifted inside him. He looked at Lena and smiled wryly, his mind racing with possibilities. "Tell me more."
