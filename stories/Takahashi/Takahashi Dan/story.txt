His innovative dishes quickly gained popularity among locals and tourists alike, with many praising his ability to evoke memories of childhood summers spent at family gatherings or late-night escapades with friends.

One dish that stood out was his signature "Takumi's Tears," a hearty tonkatsu served with a side of spicy miso soup and steamed vegetables.
