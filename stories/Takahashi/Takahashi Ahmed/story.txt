Takahashi Ahmed was a young and ambitious journalist who had just landed his first big assignment at the Tokyo Times. Born in Mumbai, India, to Japanese parents, Takahashi had always been fascinated by the culture and history of Japan, where he spent most of his childhood.

As a child, Takahashi would spend hours listening to his grandfather's stories about the Samurai era, and he was determined to learn more about this fascinating period in Japanese history. After completing his studies in journalism at Tokyo University, Takahashi Ahmed set out to make a name for himself in the competitive world of Japanese media.

His latest assignment took him to the countryside, where he was tasked with investigating the mysterious disappearance of a local farmer's daughter. The villagers were tight-lipped about the girl's whereabouts, and Takahashi was determined to get to the bottom of the story.

As he walked through the narrow streets of the rural village, Takahashi Ahmed couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The air was thick with tension, and the villagers seemed reluctant to talk to him. He pulled out his notebook and began to scribble down notes, trying to get a sense of what had happened.

After hours of questioning the villagers, Takahashi finally received a tip that led him to an abandoned barn on the outskirts of the village. There, he found a hidden room containing a cryptic message scrawled on a piece of paper. The message read: "The truth lies with the river".

Takahashi's eyes narrowed as he pondered the meaning behind the message. He knew that the river ran through the heart of the village, and it was possible that the farmer's daughter had gone there in search of something. With renewed determination, Takahashi set out to follow the river and uncover the truth.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the landscape, Takahashi finally stumbled upon a small boat half-hidden in the reeds. And there, tied to the boat, was a note addressed to him. The note read: "Meet me at the old oak tree at midnight. Come alone".
