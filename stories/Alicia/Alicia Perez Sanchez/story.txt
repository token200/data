Alicia's story was a huge hit, and soon she was in high demand as a reporter and interviewer. She spent the next few months working tirelessly to craft more stories, each one more explosive than the last. And through it all, Alicia Perez Sanchez remained true to herself - driven by a fierce commitment to truth-telling and a passion for sharing the voices of those who might otherwise be overlooked.

As she looked out over the city from her office window, Alicia felt a sense of pride and satisfaction wash over her.
