Alicia Németh stood at the edge of the bustling city square, her eyes scanning the crowd with a mixture of curiosity and disdain. As a renowned geologist, she had spent countless hours studying the earth's surface, but there was something about this particular site that left her feeling unsettled.

As she made her way through the throng of people, Alicia Németh couldn't help but notice the whispers and glances that followed her. She had always been a bit of an outsider, preferring the company of rocks to that of humans. Her colleagues at the university had grown accustomed to her eccentricities, but this latest development seemed to have taken them by surprise.

Alicia Németh stopped in front of a large stone pedestal, where a plaque proudly declared the discovery of a long-lost species of dinosaur. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she gazed upon the fossilized remains, its scales and bones expertly preserved for all to see. This was what she did best - uncovering secrets that lay hidden beneath the earth's surface.

But today, something about this discovery didn't sit right with her. The way the plaque seemed to gloss over the more mundane details of the find, the careful omission of any mention of potential contamination or exploitation. It made Alicia Németh feel like she was being sold a bill of goods, forced to admire the aesthetic appeal of the fossil while ignoring its true significance.

She watched as a group of schoolchildren gathered around the pedestal, their eyes wide with wonder as they took in the sight of the ancient creature. Alicia Németh felt a pang of guilt - was this what she had spent her career working towards? Preserving a piece of history for the masses to consume and forget?

As the children dispersed, leaving behind a scattering of discarded wrappers and water bottles, Alicia Németh couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. She took out her phone and began to make a list of potential concerns, her mind racing with the implications of this discovery.

For now, she would have to put on a brave face, but inside, Alicia Németh was already mentally excavating the bones of this supposed "discovery", uncovering the hidden truths that lay beneath.
