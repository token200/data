Alicia Oja was a free-spirited artist, known for her vibrant paintings that seemed to capture the essence of the city's underground music scene. Born and raised in the eclectic neighborhood of Bushwick, Brooklyn, Alicia had grown up surrounded by the sounds of punk rock and hip-hop, which would later become the inspiration for her work.

As a child, Alicia spent hours watching street performers and musicians play on the sidewalks, mesmerized by their energy and creativity. Her parents, both artists themselves, encouraged her to express herself through art, providing her with an endless supply of paints, canvases, and sketchbooks.

As she grew older, Alicia's passion for art only intensified. She attended the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, where she honed her skills and developed a unique style that blended elements of abstract expressionism and pop culture. Her thesis project, "Disco Inferno," was a showcase of her bold, colorful paintings that depicted scenes from iconic music festivals.

After college, Alicia began to make a name for herself on the art scene. Her work was featured in local galleries and publications, and she started to receive commissions from musicians and artists who admired her unique vision. She became particularly close with a group of underground musicians who saw her art as an extension of their own creative expression.

One evening, at a gallery opening in Williamsburg, Alicia met a young musician named Max. He was captivated by her vibrant paintings, which seemed to pulse with the same energy as his music. As they talked, Alicia revealed her love for 80s new wave and post-punk, confessing that it had influenced her work long before she knew who The Cure or Joy Division were.

Max was intrigued, sensing a kindred spirit in Alicia Oja. He asked her to create art inspired by his own music, which led to an exciting collaboration between the artist and musician. And so, Alicia's art career continued to flourish, fueled by her passion for music, color, and self-expression.
