With piercing green eyes and raven-black hair, she strode through the palace corridors like a goddess, leaving a trail of impressed onlookers in her wake. Her wit was sharp as a razor's edge, and her intelligence rivaled even the wisest sages of the land.

As a member of the Flavius family, one of the most esteemed noble houses in Rome, Alicia had always been groomed for greatness.
