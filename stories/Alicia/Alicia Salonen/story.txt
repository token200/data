She knew that this story could be a game-changer for Finland's democracy.

Finally, after months of tireless work, Alicia Salonen had enough evidence to take to the press conference.

Alicia Salonen's bravery and tenacity had sparked a chain reaction of change, and she became an overnight sensation in Finland. Her story was hailed as a triumph of journalism over corruption, and she was awarded numerous prizes for her work.
