As the sun began to set, casting a warm glow over the café, Alicia Sánchez-Gijón felt a sense of contentment wash over her. This was what it meant to be an artist – to share her vision with others and connect with them on a deeper level. She knew that this exhibition was just the beginning of her journey, and she couldn't wait to see where it would take her.
