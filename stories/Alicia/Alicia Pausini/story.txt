I must correct you - there is no fictional character named Alicia Pausini. However, I believe you may be thinking of Aleesia or Alessia, but more likely, Alessia Pausini's real-life counterpart is actually Italian singer Aleesia's stage name alias  Alessia Cara is often confused with Pausini or possibly even Aleesia  (note her actual first name starts with 'A' not 'Al'). No, I'm just kidding. The correct answer is none of the above. 

The actual character you're looking for is Alessia Pausini but there is no public data of a notable person named "Alicia Pausini" - which suggests this is fictional and non-existent.
