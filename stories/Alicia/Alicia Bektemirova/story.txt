Alicia Bektemirova stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of her contact. She had been traveling for hours, and the long journey had left her feeling restless and on edge.

As she made her way through the crowds, a familiar face emerged from the throng. It was Viktor, an old acquaintance from her days working as a freelance journalist in Moscow. They exchanged brief pleasantries before Viktor led Alicia to a waiting car.

"Where are we going?" Alicia asked, as they drove out of the station and into the city.

"A place I've rented for you," Viktor replied, his expression neutral. "You'll be staying there until your meeting."

Alicia's eyes narrowed slightly. She had agreed to meet with an anonymous source about a story she was working on, but she had suspected that it might not be entirely safe. The fact that Viktor was her contact made her feel a little better.

As they arrived at the rented apartment, Alicia could see that it was a nondescript one-bedroom flat in a seedy part of town. She raised an eyebrow as Viktor handed her a key and bid her good luck before turning to leave.

Alicia sighed and pushed open the door, stepping inside to find herself face-to-face with a note on the kitchen counter. It read: "Hello Alicia Bektemirova, I see you're a skeptic. Very well, let's meet in person."

She smiled wryly as she tucked the note into her bag and began to explore the apartment. The place was sparse but clean, and she could tell that whoever had rented it out was trying to keep an eye on things.

As she waited for her source to arrive, Alicia took a seat at the small table in the living room and began to go over some notes of her own. She was working on a story about corruption in the local government, and she had finally tracked down a source who was willing to come forward.

Just as she was starting to feel like she'd been stood up, there was a knock at the door. Alicia smiled, feeling a sense of excitement and trepidation as she made her way to answer it.

When she opened the door, she saw a figure cloaked in shadows. "Hello," the figure said, its voice low and gravelly. "My name is Alexander Petrov, and I have information about the corruption you're investigating."

Alicia's heart quickened as she stepped aside to let him in. She had a feeling that this was going to be a long and complicated conversation.
