Her thesis focused on the impact of pollution on local bird populations, and it was met with critical acclaim by her peers. Word of her groundbreaking research spread quickly, earning her a spot as a sought-after speaker at international environmental conferences.

As her reputation grew, so did Alicia's resolve to take action. She founded the Krakow Environmental Initiative (KEI), a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting sustainable practices and educating the local community about the importance of conservation.
