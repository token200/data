Alicia Wei-lun stepped into the crowded streets of Hong Kong, her long black hair whipping against her face as she navigated through the throngs of people. A young and ambitious journalist, Alicia had always been drawn to the fast-paced world of news reporting. With a keen eye for detail and a sharp mind for analysis, she had quickly risen through the ranks of her newspaper's investigative team.

As she walked, Alicia's thoughts turned to her latest story: a expos√© on corruption in the city's government. She had spent weeks researching, interviewing sources and piecing together evidence that would blow the lid off the scandalous practices of some of Hong Kong's most powerful politicians.

Alicia Wei-lun stopped at a street corner, pulling out her phone to scroll through her notes one last time before heading into the interview with her source. She had high hopes for this story - not just because it was big, but also because it would be a chance to shine in front of the paper's top editors.

As she arrived at the appointed meeting spot, Alicia spotted her source - a nervous-looking young man who introduced himself as Ken. With a mix of caution and determination, Alicia began her questioning, probing Ken for details about his involvement in the corruption scandal.

Ken hesitated, glancing nervously around the street before finally opening up to Alicia Wei-lun. "I didn't want to be part of it," he admitted, his voice barely above a whisper. "But I was getting paid too much to turn down the job."

Alicia's ears perked up at this - it was exactly the kind of explosive revelation she had been waiting for. She jotted down her notes furiously as Ken continued to speak, pouring out a torrent of information that would make her story all but unstoppable.

As the interview drew to a close, Alicia knew she had secured herself an ace piece. With her evidence in hand and her source safely hidden away, she felt a thrill of excitement - this was going to be one of the biggest scoops of her career, and she couldn't wait to get it out there for the world to see.
