Her studio became a veritable treasure trove of artifacts, with intricate textiles, wooden masks, and handmade ceramics scattered about.

One day, a prominent art gallery owner stumbled upon Basheera's work while browsing through a local market. Intrigued by her unique style and bold brushstrokes, the curator offered Basheera a solo exhibition at his gallery in New York City.
