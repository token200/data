Basheera Petersen stepped into the bustling streets of Marrakech, her senses overwhelmed by the vibrant colors and intoxicating scents of the ancient city. As a renowned travel writer, she had explored countless destinations, but there was something about Morocco that drew her in like no other.

A native of the United States, Basheera Petersen had always been fascinated by the rich history and culture of the Middle East. Her parents, both anthropologists, had instilled in her a deep appreciation for diversity and the importance of understanding different perspectives.
