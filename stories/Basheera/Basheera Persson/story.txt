As a child, Basheera had been known for her wild spirit and untamed hair, which cascaded down her back like a waterfall of night.

She devoured books on ancient civilizations, studying the mystics and philosophers who had come before. Her fascination with the human condition only deepened, leading her to become a skilled intuitive and mediator.

They whispered stories of ghostly apparitions and unexplained occurrences that seemed to emanate from within its walls.

With tears streaming down her face, Sophie confided in Basheera about her lost loved one.
