As a child, Basheera had spent hours watching her grandfather, a skilled craftsman, work on intricate wooden carvings in their family workshop. She would sit for hours, mesmerized by the way his hands moved deftly over the wood, bringing forth beautiful works of art from raw material. From that early age, Basheera knew she wanted to follow in her grandfather's footsteps and become an artist herself.

As she grew older, Basheera's passion for art only intensified.

As the festival drew to a close, Basheera knew that her life as an artist had just begun. She had gained international recognition, but more importantly, she had discovered a sense of purpose and belonging among like-minded creatives from around the world. With her grandfather's workshop in mind, Basheera returned to Tashkent with a renewed passion for her craft, eager to share her art with a wider audience and continue to push the boundaries of Uzbek culture.
