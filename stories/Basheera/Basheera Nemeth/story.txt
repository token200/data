With her wild mane of curly brown hair and bright green eyes that sparkled with creativity, she inspired those around her to take risks and pursue their passions. Born in the vibrant city of Cairo, Egypt, Basheera grew up surrounded by the rich history and culture of the Middle East.

As a child, Basheera spent hours sketching and painting, drawing inspiration from the ancient pyramids and mosques that dotted the city's landscape. Her parents, both artists themselves, encouraged her creativity and nurtured her talent for visual arts. They even set up a small studio in their home, where Basheera could hone her skills and experiment with different mediums.

She began to explore themes of identity, culture, and social justice through her art, using bold colors and striking imagery to convey powerful messages.
