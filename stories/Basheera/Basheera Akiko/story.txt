Born in Nairobi, Kenya, she had grown up surrounded by vibrant colors and patterns that would later influence her unique style. With a degree in fine arts from the University of Nairobi, Basheera had honed her skills in painting and drawing, but it was her passion for photography that truly set her apart.
