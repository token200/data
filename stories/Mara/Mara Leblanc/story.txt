Mara Leblanc stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. The small town of Ravenswood was quiet tonight, the only sound the distant hum of crickets and the faint whisper of wind through the trees.

As a journalist for the local newspaper, Mara had grown accustomed to the peace and solitude that came with living in such a rural community. But tonight felt different, the air thick with an unsettling energy that made her skin prickle.

Mara Leblanc made her way to the station's small office, where she spent most of her days pouring over files and conducting interviews. She had been investigating a string of mysterious disappearances in Ravenswood, all of which seemed to be linked to the old abandoned mine on the outskirts of town.

As she settled into her chair, Mara couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. She glanced around the small room, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Just the flickering fluorescent lights and the hum of the computer screen in front of her.

She sighed and began to sift through the latest batch of documents, searching for any clues that might lead her to the truth behind the disappearances. Mara Leblanc had always been driven by a strong sense of justice, and she was determined to uncover the secrets that Ravenswood seemed to be hiding.

Just as she was starting to make progress, the lights in the station began to flicker wildly, plunging Mara into darkness. She gasped and fumbled for her phone, but before she could manage to send a distress signal, everything went black.

When the lights came back on, Mara found herself alone in the station once more. But this time, something was different. On the wall opposite her desk, a single message was scrawled in red ink: "You're getting close, Mara Leblanc."
