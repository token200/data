Mara Szabo stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. She had been traveling for hours, and the isolation was starting to get to her. As she gathered her belongings, a familiar voice called out from across the platform.

"Mara Szabo!"

She turned to see her old friend, Jax, rushing towards her with a wide smile on his face. "Jax! It's so good to see you!" Mara exclaimed, embracing him in a warm hug.

Jax looked just as excited to see her, and the two of them stood there for a moment, laughing and chatting like no time had passed at all. But as they made their way out of the station, Mara couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. She had received a mysterious letter in the mail a few days ago, inviting her to meet with an old acquaintance from her past.

As they walked through the quiet streets, Jax filled Mara in on the latest news from his family and friends. But Mara's mind kept wandering back to the letter, and the sense of unease it had left her with. She tried to push it aside, but the feeling only grew stronger as the day wore on.

Eventually, they arrived at a small caf√© on the outskirts of town, where Jax had promised to introduce her to someone who knew her from before. Mara's heart skipped a beat as she saw a familiar face across the room - a woman with piercing green eyes and long, curly brown hair.

"Ah, this is Lena," Jax said, gesturing for them to join her at their table. "We met through... mutual friends." Lena smiled warmly, and Mara felt a sense of recognition wash over her.

"Mara Szabo," Lena repeated, as if trying the name on her tongue. "It's been a long time."

Mara nodded, feeling a shiver run down her spine. She had no idea what to make of this sudden reunion, but she was determined to find out.
