Mara Ivanov stepped out of the small café, her eyes scanning the bustling streets of Prague. As a freelance journalist, she had been tracking a lead on a potential whistleblower for weeks, and finally, she had a confirmed meeting.

She hailed a taxi and gave the driver an address in the outskirts of the city. The journey was uneventful, but Mara's mind was racing with possibilities. She had heard whispers of a high-ranking government official who was willing to come forward with information about a major corruption scandal. But so far, no one had ever been able to track her down.

As the taxi pulled up to the designated address, Mara's heart quickened. The building looked nondescript, but she knew that this was where her source would be waiting. She paid the driver and stepped out onto the sidewalk, her eyes locked on the door.

The door swung open, and a young woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair stood before her. "Mara Ivanov?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

"It's you," Mara replied, extending a hand.

The woman shook it firmly, and Mara felt a jolt of electricity run through her body. This was it – the moment she had been waiting for. The woman led Mara inside, where they sat down at a small table in a cramped back room.

"So, what do you have to tell me?" Mara asked, her pen poised over her notebook.

The woman hesitated, glancing nervously around the room before speaking. "I work in the Ministry of Defense," she said, her voice trembling. "I've seen some... unsavory things, things that could bring down entire governments if they were to come to light."

Mara's eyes widened as she scribbled furious notes on her pad. This was it – the story of a lifetime.

But just as she was about to ask another question, the woman's eyes locked onto something behind Mara's shoulder. "Wait," she said, her voice rising in alarm. "I think we're being watched."

Mara spun around, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. The woman's words sent a chill down her spine. Who had discovered their meeting? And what did they want?
