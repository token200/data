Mara Szymanski stood at the edge of the cliff, her eyes fixed on the vast expanse of ocean stretching out before her. The wind whipped through her long, dark hair as she gazed out at the waves crashing against the shore. She was lost in thought, her mind consumed by memories of the past.

It had been five years since Mara Szymanski left her small town in Poland to pursue a life abroad. She had always felt stifled by the familiarity and routine of her hometown, yearning for something more. Her decision to leave had not been taken lightly, but she knew it was necessary if she wanted to find herself.

As she stood there, Mara Szymanski felt a sense of freedom wash over her. The ocean air filled her lungs, and she breathed in deeply, feeling invigorated by the sheer vastness of it all. She thought about the people she had left behind, wondering how they were doing without her.

Her thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps approaching. It was her friend, Anna, who had also moved to the city for college. The two had met in their freshman year and had quickly become inseparable.

"Mara, what's wrong?" Anna asked, noticing the look of distraction on her face. "You seem lost in thought."

Mara Szymanski smiled wryly and shook her head. "Just remembering where I came from," she said. "I was starting to feel like I'd forgotten my roots."

Anna nodded understandingly. "You've always been one for adventure, Mara. You can't stay stuck in the past forever."

Mara Szymanski chuckled, feeling a surge of gratitude towards her friend. Anna had been a constant source of support and encouragement throughout her journey.

As they stood there, watching the sun begin to set over the ocean, Mara Szymanski felt a sense of peace wash over her. She knew that she still had so much to explore and discover in this new world, but for now, she was content to bask in the beauty of it all.
