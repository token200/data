Mara Woźniak walked into the bustling café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She had been searching for months, trying to uncover the truth about her past, and every lead seemed to end in a dead-end. As she waited in line, she noticed a young woman with piercing green eyes, sipping on a coffee.

Mara's instincts told her that this girl was different, that there was something about her that sparked a memory deep within Mara's mind. She ordered a black coffee and took a seat at the bar, trying to appear nonchalant as she watched the stranger finish her drink and leave.

As Mara waited for her turn, she noticed a piece of paper on the floor, partially hidden under the table. She picked it up, and to her surprise, it was a ticket stub from an old concert venue in Krakow. The date and time were eerily familiar - it was the same night that Mara had last seen her estranged father.

Mara's mind began racing as she showed the ticket stub to the barista. "I think I saw this girl before," she said, nodding towards the door. The barista followed her gaze, and together they watched as the green-eyed woman walked back into the café.

This time, Mara wasn't alone. As the woman approached, Mara stood up, her heart pounding in her chest. "Mara Woźniak?" the girl asked, a hint of uncertainty in her voice. "I've been looking for you."

Mara's eyes welled up with tears as she nodded, her mind reeling with questions and emotions. Who was this woman? How did she know Mara's name? And what did she want from her?

As they sat down at a table, sipping their coffee in silence, Mara felt a sense of hope that she hadn't felt in years. Maybe, just maybe, she had finally found the answers she had been searching for. And as she looked into the green-eyed stranger's eyes, she knew that her life was about to change forever.
