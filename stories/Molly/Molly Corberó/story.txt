If that's the case, here is a character profile for Molly Corberó:

Story:

Molly Corberó stepped out of her small apartment in Barcelona, into the crisp morning air. She had a feeling today was going to be the day she finally cracked the case against the corrupt officials who had been siphoning off funds from the city's budget.

She made her way to the police station, where she met up with her partner, Detective Carlos. "I've got some news," Molly said, as they sat down at their desks. "I think I know how we can get inside."

Carlos raised an eyebrow. "What have you got?"

Molly smiled sweetly. "Just a little something about being connected to the mayor's office. It seems he needs someone with my particular set of skills to help him deal with some... issues."

Carlos nodded, impressed. Together, they hatched a plan to go undercover and gather evidence, all while keeping their true identities hidden from their colleagues.
