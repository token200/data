Molly Salamanca, the infamous matriarch of the Salamanca cartel, sat in her plush, velvet armchair, surveying the dimly lit room. Her piercing green eyes scanned the space, taking in every detail, as she waited for her visitors.

The door creaked open and a young, eager associate, Juan, entered with a nervous smile on his face. Molly's gaze narrowed as he approached, her expression unreadable behind her veil of designer sunglasses.

"Señorita Salamanca," Juan began, his voice trembling slightly, "I've received an offer from the Morales organization to form a merger."

Molly raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the audacity of the Morales. She leaned forward in her chair, her hands clasped together.

"What makes you think I would be interested?" she asked, her voice low and husky.

Juan hesitated before speaking, "Because, señorita...the Morales organization has the resources to expand our operations and increase our profits."

Molly snorted, a small, amused smile playing on her lips. "Resources? You mean like their pathetic little cocaine operation in Mexico City?"

Juan's face fell, but Molly continued, "No, no, no...I have something far more valuable to offer you." She paused, letting the silence hang in the air.

"What is it?" Juan asked, his curiosity getting the better of him.

Molly leaned back in her chair, steepling her fingers together. "My connection to the Colombian government. My ability to grease the right palms and secure the necessary permits for your little operation."

Juan's eyes widened as he realized the scope of Molly's influence. He had heard whispers of her power and sophistication, but he never thought he'd be lucky enough to meet her.

"Señorita Salamanca," Juan said, trying to contain his excitement, "I accept your offer. We'll make a deal."

Molly's smile broadened, revealing perfectly white teeth. She extended a manicured hand, and Juan shook it firmly, sealing their partnership.

As the meeting drew to a close, Molly leaned forward once more, her eyes glinting with amusement.

"Remember, Juan," she whispered, "in my world, loyalty is a luxury I don't tolerate."

Juan nodded hastily, knowing that he had just made a deal with a woman who would stop at nothing to protect her empire.
