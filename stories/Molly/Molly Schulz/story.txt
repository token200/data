Molly Schulz walked into the small café, scanning the room for a familiar face. She had been friends with Rachel since childhood, and it was a rare occasion that they managed to catch up in person. As she waited in line, Molly's eyes wandered to the menu board, her stomach growling at the sight of the freshly baked pastries.

"Hey, Rach!" Molly called out as she spotted Rachel sitting at a corner table, sipping on a cup of coffee. Rachel looked up, flashing a warm smile that made Molly feel instantly at ease.

"I was starting to think I'd have to order for you," Rachel said, laughing, as Molly slid into the seat across from her.

The two friends spent the next hour catching up on everything they had missed since their last time together. Molly filled Rachel in on her latest adventure – a solo trip to Europe she had taken over the summer – while Rachel shared stories of her new job and latest escapades with her mischievous cat, Luna.

As they chatted, Molly couldn't help but feel grateful for this friendship that had stood the test of time. She and Rachel had been inseparable as kids, sharing secrets and laughter at sleepovers and school dances. Now, as adults, their bond remained strong – even if it was a little more understated.

"I'm so glad I could drag you out of the house today," Molly said, smiling at Rachel. "You look like you could use a break."

Rachel nodded in agreement, reaching for her coffee cup. "Definitely needed it. You know me too well, Moll – or should I say, Molly Schulz?"

Molly chuckled at the nickname, feeling a little nostalgic for their carefree childhood days. As they finished up their drinks and prepared to part ways, Molly couldn't help but feel grateful for this friendship that had endured through all of life's ups and downs.

As she walked out of the café with Rachel, Molly felt a sense of contentment wash over her. It was moments like these – spent with her dear friend by her side – that reminded her why life was worth savoring.
