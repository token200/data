Molly Kwiatkowski sat at her desk, staring blankly at the pile of unpaid bills in front of her. As a freelance writer, she had always prided herself on being independent and self-sufficient. But after a string of rejections and missed deadlines, it was starting to feel like the universe was conspiring against her.

She sighed and rubbed her tired eyes. It had been months since Molly's last big assignment, and she was starting to worry that she wouldn't be able to make ends meet much longer. She thought back to all the late nights spent typing away on her laptop, pouring her heart and soul into every article and blog post.

As a Polish-American woman growing up in Chicago's Polish West Side, Molly had always been fascinated by storytelling and language. Her parents, both immigrants themselves, had encouraged her love of writing from a young age. But it wasn't until she moved to New York City that she discovered her true passion – writing about social justice and identity.

Despite the rejection letters piling up, Molly refused to give up on her dreams. She poured all of her energy into creating content for marginalized communities, hoping to make a difference in some small way. And though it wasn't always easy, she found solace in the words of poet Warsan Shire, who wrote about the power of language and the importance of staying true to oneself.

Just then, Molly's phone rang. It was her best friend and fellow writer, Jen. "Hey, girl, I heard you're struggling," Jen said, her voice warm and supportive. "You need to take a break and focus on yourself."

Molly felt a lump form in her throat as she listened to Jen's words of wisdom. Maybe it was time to take a step back, recharge her batteries, and refocus on what made her tick.

With newfound determination, Molly began brainstorming ideas for new projects and collaborations. She knew that this too would pass – the struggles, the doubts, the rejections. And when she finally did land another big assignment, it would be all the sweeter for waiting patiently and staying true to herself. As Warsan Shire wrote, "You are one of them too."
