"Hey, Molly Briedite! What's the inspiration behind your latest pieces?" Emma asked, admiring a particularly vibrant painting.

With that, Emma departed, armed with new inspiration and a renewed sense of purpose. And as for Molly Briedite? She returned to her easel, ready to unleash another colorful masterpiece upon the world.
