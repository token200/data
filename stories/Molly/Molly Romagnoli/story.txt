Molly Romagnoli stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar station. She had returned to her hometown of Ravenswood after years away, and the feeling was still a little disorienting. As she made her way through the crowd, Molly's thoughts turned to the letter she had received from her grandmother just weeks before.

Grandmother Rosa had written to tell Molly that she was struggling to care for herself, and that it was time for someone to take over the family bakery. Molly had always been close to her grandmother, who had taught her everything she knew about baking and running a business. She felt a surge of responsibility wash over her as she thought about taking on this new role.

As she walked through the streets of Ravenswood, Molly couldn't help but notice how little things had changed. The same old diner was still serving up burgers and milkshakes, and the park where she used to play as a child was still filled with children's laughter. It was as if time had stood still while she was away.

Molly arrived at the bakery just as the sun was setting, casting a warm orange glow over the bustling kitchen. Her grandmother was nowhere to be found, but Molly knew that she would be in her favorite armchair by the window, watching the world go by. She smiled as she thought about her grandmother's presence, and made her way over to say hello.

As she sat down beside Rosa, Molly felt a sense of peace wash over her. This was where she belonged - among the mixing bowls and baking sheets, surrounded by the people and places she loved. She knew that taking on the bakery would be hard work, but with her grandmother's guidance, she felt ready to take on anything.

Molly Romagnoli took a deep breath, feeling a sense of purpose wash over her. She was home now, and it was time to get to work.
