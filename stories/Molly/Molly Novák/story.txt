Molly Novák stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of her friend, Emma. They had planned to meet up with Emma's brother, Max, who was home on leave from his military deployment.

As she waited, Molly's mind wandered back to their conversation earlier that day. Emma had been nervous about meeting Max again, having been friends since childhood but drifting apart as they grew older. Molly had reassured her friend that everything would be fine, and that Max still had the same easy smile and charming sense of humor.

Just then, a figure emerged from the crowd, his dark hair messy and his eyes crinkled at the corners. "Hey, guys!" he called out, spotting Molly with a broad grin. He was carrying a large backpack and looked exhausted, but happy to see them.

Molly hurried over to hug him, feeling a pang of concern about the toll his deployment must have taken on Max's appearance. She had always been protective of her friends, especially Emma, who had been struggling to cope with Max's absence. But as they chatted, Molly realized that Max was still the same person she had grown up with – quick-witted and adventurous.

As they made their way through the city, Emma hesitantly falling into step behind them, Molly asked Max how his deployment had been. He told her stories of the camaraderie he had found among his fellow soldiers, and the sense of purpose that had driven him to serve. His eyes sparkled with pride as he spoke, and for a moment, Molly felt like she was seeing a part of him that she hadn't seen in years.

Over coffee, Emma opened up about her struggles since Max's deployment, feeling lost without her friend by her side. But as they talked, Molly could see the tension easing from Emma's shoulders, replaced by a sense of gratitude and understanding. And as they sat together, watching Max laugh with someone new, Molly knew that their little trio was back to normal – if not exactly the same, but definitely more vibrant for it.
