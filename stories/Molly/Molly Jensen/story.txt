Molly Jensen sat alone in her small apartment, staring blankly at the wall as the rain pounded against the windows. It was a scene that had become all too familiar for her over the years.

Just six months ago, Molly's life had been turned upside down by the death of her husband, Adam. The grief had been overwhelming, and she had struggled to come to terms with the loss of the love of her life. Her daughter, Sophie, was only 11, but the impact on her young daughter's life had been immense.

As Molly sat there, lost in thought, she heard a knock at the door. It was Sarah, Adam's sister. Sarah had always been close to both Molly and Adam, and she had moved in with Molly after his passing to help care for Sophie.

"Molly, I brought some soup," Sarah said, holding up a steaming bowl. "I figured you could use a pick-me-up."

Molly smiled weakly and took the bowl from Sarah. The smell of chicken noodle wafted up, and her stomach growled in response. She hadn't eaten much all day.

As they sat down to eat, Molly couldn't help but think about how far she had come since that fateful night when Adam died in a car accident on his way home from work. It had been a tragedy, one that had shaken their small community to its core.

But as she looked around her apartment now, filled with memories of happier times, Molly felt a glimmer of hope. She was getting better, slowly but surely. Sophie was thriving at school, and Sarah was proving to be an invaluable source of support.

As they finished the soup and cleared the table, Sarah put a hand on Molly's shoulder. "You know, I've been thinking," she said. "I think it's time for you to start taking care of yourself again."

Molly raised an eyebrow, unsure what to make of this suggestion. But as she looked into Sarah's eyes, she knew that her sister was right. It was time to start living again, not just existing.

With newfound determination, Molly stood up and walked over to the window, pushing aside the curtain to let in some fresh air. The rain might still be falling outside, but Molly felt a sense of peace wash over her, knowing that she was on the road to healing once more.
