Molly Volkov stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of life. She had arrived in Ashwood just yesterday, but already felt a sense of unease settling in her stomach. As Molly Volkov, a name she rarely used out loud, she was accustomed to being invisible. The small town of Ashwood, however, seemed determined to make an impression.

As she made her way through the crowded station, a young woman with a friendly smile approached her. "Hey, you must be Molly! I'm Emily Wilson. Welcome to Ashwood."

Molly Volkov smiled politely, but couldn't shake the feeling that this was all too much. She had come to Ashwood seeking refuge, hoping to escape the memories that haunted her. But it seemed that everyone here knew who she was.

Over coffee at a quaint caf√©, Emily asked Molly Volkov about herself, eager to get to know the newcomer. As they chatted, Molly found herself opening up in ways she hadn't expected. She spoke of her life before Ashwood, of the mistakes she'd made and the pain she'd endured. Emily listened intently, her eyes filled with compassion.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the town, Molly Volkov felt a sense of peace wash over her. For the first time since arriving, she felt like she might belong here. And as she walked back to her small apartment, Emily by her side, she realized that maybe Ashwood was exactly what she needed.

The next day, Molly Volkov set out to explore the town, determined to get to know its secrets. She wandered through the quaint shops and cafes, exchanging smiles with the locals. As she passed by a bustling bakery, the scent of freshly baked bread wafted out, drawing her in. Inside, she found rows of golden pastries and an old man behind the counter, his eyes twinkling with warmth.

"Welcome to my shop," he said, his voice low and soothing. "I'm Sergei. I make a mean strudel."

Molly Volkov smiled, feeling a sense of belonging that she hadn't experienced in years. For the first time since her arrival, she felt like Molly Volkov, not just another face in the crowd. And as she took a bite of Sergei's warm pastry, she knew that Ashwood was starting to feel like home.
