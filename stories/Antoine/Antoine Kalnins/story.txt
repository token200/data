Antoine Kalnins was an enigmatic figure in the world of high-stakes art forgery. Few knew his true identity or the extent of his schemes, but those who did whispered warnings to each other about the "Kalnins Touch," a supposed guarantee of authenticity that made even the most dubious pieces sell for top dollar.

Antoine's real name was Antoine Viktor Kalnins, and he had spent years honing his craft in the shadowy underbelly of Europe's art scene. He could convincingly mimic the styles of Monet, Picasso, or Warhol, but it wasn't just the technique that set him apart – it was the aura of authenticity he brought to each piece.

One evening, at a exclusive gallery opening in Paris, Antoine unveiled his latest masterpiece: a stunning reproduction of Van Gogh's "Starry Night." The crowd gasped as he revealed the hidden details, from the subtle brushstrokes to the faint texture of the canvas. It was, without a doubt, one of the most convincing forgeries any of them had ever seen.

As the night wore on and the champagne flowed, Antoine regaled his audience with tales of his adventures – from forging ancient artifacts in Turkey to replicating rare seashells in the depths of the Amazon. He spoke with an air of authority that made everyone want to listen, even when they knew it was all a fabrication.

Later, as the gallery closed and the guests departed, Antoine slipped out into the cool night air. He lit a cigarette, feeling the familiar rush of adrenaline as he watched his creation disappear into the crowd. He was Antoine Viktor Kalnins, master forger and artist, forever bound to the shadows.

But tonight, something felt off. The piece had brought a spark of recognition from one of the guests – a collector with a keen eye for detail who might just uncover the truth behind Antoine's "Kalnins Touch." For the first time in years, Antoine felt a flicker of unease, a sense that his carefully constructed facade was about to be tested.
