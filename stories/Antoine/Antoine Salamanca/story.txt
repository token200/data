Antoine "Tio" Salamanca, also known as Gus Fring's right-hand man and one of the most ruthless figures in Las Vegas' underworld, sat at his desk, sipping on a cup of coffee. His piercing eyes scanned through the stacks of bills, invoices, and financial reports that filled his office.

As he reviewed the numbers, Antoine's mind wandered back to his past, where he had earned his nickname "Tio" - Spanish for uncle. He had grown up in a large family in Mexico, where he learned early on how to navigate the complex web of alliances and rivalries that defined their community.

Antoine Salamanca had built his empire from scratch, leveraging his charisma and cunning to rise through the ranks of the local crime syndicates. Eventually, he made his way to Las Vegas, where he settled into a life of luxury and ease.

But beneath the surface of his polished demeanor lay a calculating mind, always searching for ways to expand his operations and increase his wealth. Antoine Salamanca was a master strategist, always staying one step ahead of his competitors and adversaries alike.

As he delved deeper into the financial reports, Antoine's thoughts turned to Gus Fring, the man who had taken him under his wing and mentored him in the art of ruthless business. Gus had become like a surrogate uncle to Antoine Salamanca, teaching him the ways of the underworld and helping him build his empire.

With a satisfied nod, Antoine closed the reports and leaned back in his chair. He knew that as long as he continued to adapt and innovate, he would remain at the top of his game. The city's underworld would never be without its master manipulators - and Antoine Salamanca was one of them.
