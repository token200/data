Born Antoine Axel Stenström, he had always been fascinated by the inner workings of machines and mechanisms. As a young man, he spent countless hours tinkering with gadgets and machinery in his makeshift workshop, often leaving his fellow villagers bewildered at his creations.

One day, while working on a particularly complex device, Antoine's attention was diverted by a group of traveling performers who had arrived in town. Among them was a captivating fire dancer named Luna, whose mesmerizing routines left the entire village enthralled.

Entranced by Luna's artistry, Antoine became obsessed with understanding the physics behind her performances. He spent every waking moment analyzing the flames and sparks that danced across her body, convinced that he could harness their power to create something truly revolutionary.

Finally, after countless trial and error sessions, Antoine succeeded in creating a device that harnessed the power of fire itself. The contraption was a towering monstrosity, with flames shooting from its top like a miniature volcano.
