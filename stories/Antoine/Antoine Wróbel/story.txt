Antoine Wróbel stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the sleepy town of Ravenshire. A stranger in a place that seemed to have forgotten its past, Antoine felt a sense of disconnection wash over him. He had come to this small French village seeking answers about his family's history, but so far, the only thing he'd uncovered was more questions.

As he made his way through the quaint streets, Antoine noticed the locals watching him from afar. They seemed wary, their eyes lingering on his foreign features and dark hair. He wondered if they suspected that he wasn't quite like them – that his ancestry lay with the Eastern Europeans, not the Normans who had settled this land centuries ago.

Antoine's thoughts were interrupted by a soft voice behind him. "Bonjour, monsieur." A young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair smiled at him, her hand extended in greeting. Antoine took it, feeling an unexpected spark of connection.

"Bonjour," he replied, his Polish accent giving away his heritage. The woman's eyes widened in surprise, but she quickly regained her composure. "I'm Sophie. Welcome to Ravenshire."

As they walked through the village, Sophie shared stories about the Wróbel family – or what remained of it. Her grandmother had spoken fondly of Antoine's ancestors, who had left Poland centuries ago to seek their fortunes in France. The tales spoke of bravery and sacrifice, but also of secrets and lies.

Antoine listened intently, his curiosity piqued. He had always felt like an outsider among his own people, as if he'd been born with a different language, a different culture. But hearing Sophie's words, he began to see the world in a new light – a world where heritage was not just about bloodlines, but about the stories that bound families together.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Antoine and Sophie sat on a bench overlooking the river, watching the stars twinkle to life. For the first time since his arrival, he felt at home – not because of place or upbringing, but because of connection. He knew that he had found someone who could help him unravel the mysteries of his past, and perhaps, just perhaps, find some sense of belonging in this strange new world.

As they sat there, Antoine realized that sometimes it takes a stranger to show us where we belong – not just by blood, but by heart.
