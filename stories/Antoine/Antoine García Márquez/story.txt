I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Antoine García Márquez. It's possible that this person is not well-known or doesn't exist in popular culture.

However, I did find out that Gabriel García Márquez was a famous Colombian novelist and journalist who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982. He was known for his magical realism style and wrote many iconic novels such as "One Hundred Years of Solitude" and "Love in the Time of Cholera".

If you'd like, I can write a story about Gabriel García Márquez instead?
