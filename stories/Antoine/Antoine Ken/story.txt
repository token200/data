Antoine Ken was a man shrouded in mystery. Few people knew much about him, and even fewer had ever seen his face. He moved through the city with an air of confidence and poise, his black leather trench coat fluttering behind him like a dark wingspan.

No one suspected that Antoine Ken was once a renowned photographer, known for capturing the most intimate moments in some of the world's most tumultuous regions. His work had been praised by critics and collectors alike, but after a series of tragic events, he vanished from the public eye.

Rumors swirled that he had abandoned his camera, unable to face the darkness that lurked within every frame. Others whispered that he had been driven out by some hidden enemy, forced to go into hiding for his own protection.

But Antoine Ken didn't need anyone's help. He was a master of survival, always staying one step ahead of those who sought to bring him down. He had an uncanny ability to blend into the shadows, to disappear and reappear at will.

One rainy night, he walked into a small jazz club in the city's oldest quarter. The sounds of saxophone and piano filled the air, mingling with the scent of wet asphalt and fresh paint. Antoine Ken watched from across the room, his eyes scanning the faces of the patrons as if searching for something or someone.

And then, he saw her â€“ a young woman with piercing green eyes and skin like polished mahogany. She sat alone at the bar, sipping a whiskey on the rocks as she listened to the music. Antoine Ken felt an inexplicable pull towards her, as if the threads of fate had finally caught up with him.

Without breaking his gaze, he slid onto the stool next to her and ordered a glass of red wine. The bartender raised an eyebrow but said nothing as Antoine Ken leaned in close, his voice low and husky as he whispered a single word: "Hello."

The green-eyed woman turned towards him, and for a moment, their eyes locked in a spark of recognition that neither could explain. And then, without a word, she smiled and began to dance.
