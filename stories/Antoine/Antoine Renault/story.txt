A highly skilled operative, he had spent years honing his craft, working for top-secret agencies around the globe. With an uncanny ability to blend into his surroundings, Antoine Renault had become a ghost, able to slip in and out of the shadows unnoticed.

One day, his agency received intel about a rogue scientist who was developing a deadly virus with catastrophic potential. The scientist, known only by his alias "The Archon," was rumored to be hiding in a heavily fortified facility deep within Eastern Europe.

With quick thinking and cunning, Antoine Renault managed to evade capture by The Archon's henchmen and gather crucial information about the virus. He discovered that it had the potential to wipe out entire cities, and that The Archon planned to sell it to the highest bidder on the black market.
