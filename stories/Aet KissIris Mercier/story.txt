Aet Kiss, a young and ambitious journalist, sat at her desk, sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee. Her eyes were fixed on the article she was working on, trying to make sense of the cryptic message that had been sent to her by an anonymous source.

The note read: "Look again at the old case. The truth is hidden in plain sight."

Aet's mind was racing with possibilities. She had been investigating a string of mysterious disappearances in the city, and this could be the break she needed to crack the case wide open.

She spent the next few hours pouring over her notes and interviewing witnesses, trying to piece together the clues that would lead her to the truth. As the sun began to set, Aet finally made a breakthrough.

She remembered an interview with a former suspect who had been released from custody after new evidence came to light. He had mentioned a peculiar symbol that he believed was connected to the disappearances.

Aet quickly grabbed her camera and headed out to the old warehouse where she knew the suspect had last seen him. As she entered, she saw something that made her heart skip a beat - a large iron door with the same symbol etched into it.

She took out her phone and snapped a photo of the symbol, then began to investigate further. The door was locked, but Aet could sense that there was more to this symbol than met the eye.

Just as she was about to give up, she heard a faint noise coming from the other side of the door. It sounded like footsteps, followed by the sound of keys being inserted into a lock.

The door creaked open, revealing a narrow corridor lined with old pipes and flickering fluorescent lights. Aet's heart was racing as she stepped forward, her camera at the ready.

As she made her way down the corridor, she saw a series of doors leading to different rooms. Each one was locked, but they all had the same symbol etched into them.

Suddenly, the sound of footsteps grew louder, and Aet saw a figure emerging from the shadows. It was the former suspect, but his eyes were different now - they seemed haunted, as if he was running from something.

"What do you know?" Aet demanded, her voice firm but controlled.

The suspect looked around nervously before speaking in a barely audible whisper: "I didn't mean to... I was told to... It's all connected to the symbol..."

Aet's mind raced with questions
