Pauline Li trudged through the wet streets, her bright pink raincoat a stark contrast to the drizzly grey sky. A freelance writer and chronicler of Hong Kong's hidden corners, she knew every alleyway and laneway like the back of her hand.

As she turned into Temple Street, the neon lights of the night markets reflected off her glasses, making them sparkle like diamonds. She loved this time of day, when the city felt most alive – a melting pot of sounds, smells, and stories waiting to be uncovered.

Pauline stopped in front of a small, unassuming shop tucked away between two larger billboards. The sign above the door read "Mong Kong's Most Haunted" in bold red letters. She chuckled to herself; it was always her go-to spot for a good yarn. Tonight, she had heard whispers of an antique shop owner willing to share his collection of ghost stories – and he'd promised Pauline the exclusivity of sharing one of them with her alone.

As she pushed open the door, a bell above it let out a tinny ring, announcing her arrival to the proprietor, Mr. Wong. His eyes sparkled in the dim light, as if daring her to guess which story would make this night's special. Pauline slid onto a stool at the bar, ordering a lukewarm cup of jasmine tea from his daughter, Amei.

Mr. Wong unfolded a worn, yellowed handkerchief and cleared his throat, settling into an old tale about the White Lady of Causeway Bay – a spirit doomed to search for love in the city's labyrinthine streets for eternity. As he spoke, Pauline felt herself drawn into the world of legends, whispers of which danced on her eaves like fireflies.

As she scribbled notes with shaking hands, something odd happened: the colors in the room began shifting – pink gave way to mauve, and Amei's bright pink lipstick reappeared in Mr. Wong's handkerchief. For a fleeting moment, Pauline saw a figure – the White Lady herself, gazing through her with an unseen longing.

As the night wore on, the shop emptied, leaving only Pauline, her stories gathering like leaves under the streetlights outside, each word becoming a new tale waiting to be shared.
