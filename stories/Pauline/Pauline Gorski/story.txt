One sunny afternoon, Pauline Gorski walked into the office of the local newspaper, determined to get to the bottom of a recent scandal rocking the small town. The usually calm and collected editor, Mrs. Jenkins, looked frazzled as she ushered Pauline into her office.

"Pauline, I'm glad you're here," Mrs. Jenkins said, her voice trembling slightly. "We've been getting some disturbing reports about the new development project on the outskirts of town. Apparently, the developer has been making under-the-table payments to certain officials."

Pauline's eyes narrowed as she scribbled down notes in her notebook. She was a master of getting the scoop, and this story had all the makings of a big one.

"Don't worry, Mrs. Jenkins," Pauline Gorski reassured her. "I'll get to the bottom of it. Who can you trust around here?"

Mrs. Jenkins hesitated before mentioning a young intern named Alex, who had been asking too many questions about the project. Pauline's ears perked up as she jotted down Alex's name in her notebook.
