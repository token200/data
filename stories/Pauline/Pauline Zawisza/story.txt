Pauline Zawisza was known for her sharp wit and quick tongue, which often got her into trouble in the competitive world of high-stakes poker. As a former mathematics professor turned professional gambler, she had honed her skills on the tables to win big. But with great success comes great risk, and Pauline's latest gamble had left her on the verge of financial ruin.

Desperate for a way out, Pauline took a job as a temporary teacher at the local community college, where she taught statistics to students who couldn't quite make it in academia themselves. Her unorthodox teaching methods - which included using probability theory to explain why the cafeteria food was so consistently terrible - earned her both praise and scorn from her students.

Despite the challenges, Pauline found a strange sense of fulfillment in her new role. She loved watching her students' faces light up when they finally grasped a complex concept, and she took pride in knowing that she had helped shape their minds. As she graded papers and chalked up blackboards, Pauline couldn't help but think back to her own academic days, when mathematics was her true passion.

But even as she found joy in teaching, Pauline knew that she couldn't stay on the sidelines forever. She still had a poker table to get back to, and the bankrolls to rebuild. So, with a newfound sense of determination, Pauline set about plotting her next move. She started studying the market trends, looking for patterns and weaknesses to exploit. And as she pored over financial reports and statistical models, Pauline's eyes sparkled with the thrill of the game.

For Pauline Zawisza, it was never just about winning - it was about the chase itself. The thrill of the bet, the rush of adrenaline when the chips were on the line. And as she delved deeper into her research, Pauline knew that she would eventually strike gold once more. The question was, how soon?
