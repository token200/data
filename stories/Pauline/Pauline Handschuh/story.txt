Pauline Handschuh stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of life. As a private investigator, she had seen her fair share of dingy alleys and cramped dens, but there was something about this place that made her instincts scream.

She spotted the man in question, a scrawny figure huddled in the corner, nursing a cup of black coffee. Handschuh's gaze narrowed as she slid into the booth across from him. The air was thick with tension, and she could feel it crackling like electricity in the air.

"What can I do for you, Mr...?" She pulled out her notebook and pen, ready to take notes.

"Jackson," he spat, his eyes darting around the café as if searching for an escape route. "Just call me Jackson."

Handschuh raised an eyebrow, but let it slide. She knew better than to push him too hard. So far, this guy was a shell of a man, and she wasn't about to crack him.

"What's going on, Jackson?" she asked, her voice low and even.

He hesitated, his eyes flicking towards the door before settling back onto hers. "I need your help," he whispered, his words spilling out in a rush. "My sister is missing. The police don't believe me."

Handschuh's gut tightened with empathy. She'd seen plenty of cases like this one, but that didn't make it any easier to swallow.

"Tell me more," she said, her pen poised over her notebook.

As Jackson poured out his story – about the phone call he received, the cryptic message, and the frantic search for answers – Handschuh's mind began to spin. She'd been a PI for years, but this one had all the hallmarks of something sinister.

She scribbled notes furiously, her eyes never leaving Jackson's face. Something about him didn't add up, but she couldn't quite put her finger on it.

As they finished their conversation and the café began to empty, Handschuh leaned in close. "I'll take the case," she whispered. "But you need to be honest with me, Jackson. If I find out you're withholding anything..."

Jackson's eyes flashed with desperation. "You can trust me," he promised. "My sister would want me to."

Handschuh raised an eyebrow but nodded silently. She knew that in her line of work, trust was a luxury she couldn't always afford.

As they parted ways outside the café, Handschuh felt a shiver run down her spine. This case had just gotten a whole lot more interesting – and personal.
