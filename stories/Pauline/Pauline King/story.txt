She stood firm, her eyes flashing with indignation as she politely but firmly asked them to leave. When they refused, she called the local authorities, who arrived just in time to escort the misbehavers out of the diner.

The community rallied around Pauline, praising her for standing up to the troublemakers. The Oakdale Gazette ran a front-page story, highlighting Pauline King's bravery and dedication to her customers.
