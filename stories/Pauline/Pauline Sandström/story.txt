One fateful day, Pauline Sandström found herself stranded in the middle of the African savannah, far from civilization. With no phone signal and limited supplies, she was forced to rely on her wits and resourcefulness to survive. As night began to fall, Pauline Sandström huddled under a makeshift shelter, her camera slung over her shoulder.

As she lay there, listening to the sounds of the wild, Pauline Sandström began to ponder her life's work.

Finally, after hours of walking, Pauline Sandström caught sight of a distant town on the horizon. With renewed energy and a sense of accomplishment, she made her way towards it, camera still clutched in her hand. As she entered the town, Pauline Sandström was greeted by the warm smiles of locals who had been waiting for her return.
