Pauline Martínez López was known as the "Queen of Flamenco" in the small village of Almadén, Spain. Her fiery spirit and captivating dance moves had earned her the adoration of the local crowd, who would gather every night at the ancient tablao to watch her perform.

Born into a family of humble means, Pauline's early life was marked by hard work and dedication. She began dancing at the age of five, learning the intricacies of flamenco from her abuela, who had been trained in the art form herself.
