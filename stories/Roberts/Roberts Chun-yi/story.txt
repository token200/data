Roberts Chun-yi was a peculiar individual who defied conventions in every aspect of his life. As a child, he had been born with a rare condition that caused him to experience time dilation, allowing him to age at an alarming rate while the world around him remained stagnant.

As Roberts grew older, he learned to adapt and control his unique gift, using it to his advantage in various pursuits.

For the first time in his life, Roberts felt a sense of belonging. He confided in Sophia about his gift, and to his surprise, she accepted him for who he was. Together, they embarked on a journey of self-discovery, exploring the depths of Roberts' accelerated aging process and the secrets it held.

As the years went by, Sophia became an integral part of Roberts' life, helping him navigate the complexities of his condition.
