I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Roberts Luis Borges. It is possible that this character is not well-known or was created for a specific purpose.

However, I can create a story about a character named Roberto Luis Borges, who is the son of Argentine author Jorge Luis Borges.

Roberto Luis Borges was a young man with a passion for poetry and philosophy. He grew up in Buenos Aires, surrounded by the vibrant culture of Argentina's capital city. His father, Jorge Luis Borges, had been a prominent figure in the literary world, and Roberto often felt like he lived in his shadow.

Despite this, Roberto forged his own path. He spent most of his days studying philosophy at the University of Buenos Aires, where he became particularly interested in the works of Immanuel Kant and Friedrich Nietzsche. His nights were filled with writing poetry and playing guitar on the streets of La Boca.

One evening, as Roberto was strolling along the Rio de la Plata, he stumbled upon a small caf√© that reminded him of his father's favorite haunts. The owner, an old man named Carlos, invited Roberto to join him for a cup of coffee. Over their conversation, Roberto learned that Carlos had once been a close friend of Jorge Luis Borges.

As the night wore on, Roberto found himself talking about his own writing and the philosophical ideas that inspired it. Carlos listened intently, nodding his head and making supportive noises. When Roberto finished speaking, Carlos smiled and said, "You have your father's mind, Roberto Luis Borges, but you also have a unique perspective of your own."

Roberto was taken aback by the comment. He realized that he didn't need to be compared to his famous father; he simply needed to follow his own path and let his ideas shine through. From that day forward, Roberto Luis Borges wrote with renewed purpose, incorporating his philosophical insights into his poetry and playing guitar on the streets of Buenos Aires like a true son of Jorge Luis Borges.

Years later, when people asked him about his father, Roberto would smile and say, "I am not my father, but I carry his spirit within me."
