I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Roberts Dahir. It's possible that you may be thinking of a different person or character.

However, I did find information on Robert Dahi, a South African television presenter and radio host who was murdered in 2019. If you would like, I can write a story about him instead.

Alternatively, if you have any additional context or details about the Roberts Dahir you are thinking of, I may be able to help you better.

If you would like, I can provide more general information on how to write a character-centric story and include details on creating your character.
