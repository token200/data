I couldn't find any information on a person named Roberts DiCaprio. However, I believe you may be referring to Leonardo DiCaprio, an American actor.

Here is a 450-word short story about Leonardo DiCaprio:

Leonardo sat on the beach, watching the sunset over the ocean. He had just finished a long day of filming for his latest project and was grateful to have some time to himself. As he gazed out at the waves, he felt a sense of peace wash over him.

As an actor, Leonardo had seen it all. From the highs of winning awards on the red carpet to the lows of struggling with roles that didn't pan out. But through it all, he had remained committed to his craft and dedicated to using his platform to make a positive impact on the world.

Leonardo's thoughts turned to the environmental issues that were so close to his heart. He had long been an advocate for conservation and sustainability, and was deeply troubled by the state of our planet. As he sat there, feeling the sand between his toes and the wind in his hair, he felt a sense of determination wash over him.

He would continue to use his platform to raise awareness about these issues and inspire others to join him in making a difference. Whether it was through his films, his charitable work, or simply by living a more sustainable lifestyle, Leonardo was committed to leaving a lasting legacy that would outlast him long after he was gone.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the ocean, Leonardo felt a sense of gratitude for this life he had been given. He knew that he was privileged to be able to make a difference in some small way, and he was determined to use every opportunity to do so.

He stood up, brushing off his pants and walking towards the water's edge. The waves crashed against the shore, sending spray high into the air. Leonardo felt invigorated by the movement of the ocean, and he knew that he would carry this feeling with him for a long time.

As he walked back to his chair, he caught sight of himself in a reflective surface - a small mirror hidden among the beach gear. He smiled, admiring his own reflection. For a moment, he forgot about the pressures of fame and the weight of expectation. All that mattered was this moment, right here, with nothing but the sound of the waves and the feel of the sand beneath his feet.

And in that moment, Leonardo felt truly alive.
