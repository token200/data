Roberts Dubois stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the desolate landscape before him. A former soldier, he had seen his fair share of battles, but nothing could have prepared him for this. The small town of Willow Creek was where he had grown up, a place he thought he'd left behind forever.

As he made his way through the empty streets, Roberts couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. He remembered playing with the kids on Main Street, exploring the woods at the edge of town, and watching the sunset over the fields. It was all so familiar, yet so different now.

Roberts had come back to Willow Creek for one reason: to settle an old score. His former commanding officer, General Harris, had made a promise that Roberts never got to keep. Harris had promised him that if he ever found himself in trouble, he would watch his back. And now, with a rival militia leader threatening to take over the town, Roberts saw his chance.

He walked into the local saloon, his boots echoing off the walls. The patrons looked up as he approached, their faces a mix of curiosity and hostility. Roberts ignored them all, making his way to the bar where he knew the bartender would have heard rumors about Harris's whereabouts.

As he ordered a whiskey, Roberts caught sight of a familiar figure in the corner - General Harris himself. Their eyes met, and for a moment, it was like no time had passed at all. Then, Harris looked away, his expression cold and calculating.

Roberts Dubois knew that this was it. This was his chance to get revenge, to make good on the promise he had never gotten to keep. He pushed back from the bar, his eyes locked on Harris, ready to take him down once and for all. The game was on, and only one man would walk out of Willow Creek alive.
