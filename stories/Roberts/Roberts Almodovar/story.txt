I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Roberts Almodovar. It's possible that this is not a well-known or established character.

However, I can suggest an alternative approach. You may be thinking of Pedro Almodóvar, a renowned Spanish film director, screenwriter, and producer. If so, here's a 375-word story about him:

Pedro Almodóvar sat in his favorite café, sipping on a strong espresso as he pondered his next project. The Spanish director had already made a name for himself with films like "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" and "All About My Mother," but he was always looking to push boundaries and try new things.

As he thought, Pedro's mind wandered back to his childhood in Calzada de Calatrava. Growing up, he had been inspired by the works of Federico García Lorca and Luis Buñuel, two Spanish artists who had paved the way for him to become one of the most influential filmmakers of all time.

Pedro's latest film, "Volver," had been a critical and commercial success, earning him numerous awards and nominations. But he was already thinking about his next project, something that would allow him to explore themes of love, family, and identity in a way that was both intimate and epic.

As he sat at the café, Pedro began to scribble notes on a piece of paper, his pen moving quickly as he brainstormed ideas. He was known for his vivid characters and their sharp dialogue, and he wanted to create something that would showcase his unique voice and style.

Just then, a young actress walked into the café, catching Pedro's eye. She had a look about her that reminded him of one of his favorite actresses, Cecilia Roth. He smiled to himself, knowing that he might have found inspiration for his next project.

With renewed energy and ideas, Pedro finished his coffee and left the café, ready to tackle his next creative challenge. As he walked away, he felt grateful for the life he had built as a filmmaker, and excited for what the future held. He was Roberts Almodóvar, after all – a master of Spanish cinema with a reputation for creating unforgettable films.
