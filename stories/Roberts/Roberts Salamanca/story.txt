Roberts Salamanca sat in his favorite armchair, sipping his morning coffee and staring out the window at the grey New Mexico sky. As the former capo of the Ju√°rez cartel, he had seen his fair share of violence and bloodshed, but now he was content to live a quiet life, free from the chaos of his past.

As he gazed out at the desert landscape, Roberts Salamanca's mind wandered back to the days when he was a rising star in the cartel. He had been instrumental in the organization's growth and success, using his cunning and intelligence to outmaneuver their enemies. But after a falling out with the current leader, Hector Salamanca, Roberts had made the difficult decision to leave the business.

It hadn't been an easy choice, but Roberts knew it was the right one. He had lost too many friends and family members in the line of duty, and he couldn't bear the thought of losing himself to the same fate. So he had retired to this small house on the outskirts of town, where he could live a simple life and watch the world go by.

As he sipped his coffee, Roberts Salamanca's thoughts turned to Hector Salamanca, who was still out there, carrying on the family business without him. He wondered what Hector was up to these days, whether he had become as ruthless and cunning as his father before him. Probably, thought Roberts, but perhaps he had also learned from his mistakes.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was the local mechanic, come to fix Roberts' old truck. As they chatted, Roberts Salamanca couldn't help but think about how much his life had changed since leaving the cartel. He used to be feared and respected by all who knew him, but now he was just another old man living in the desert.

Roberts Salamanca smiled to himself as the mechanic left with a full tank of gas. He may not be the most powerful man in Mexico anymore, but he had gained something far more valuable - peace. And as he settled back into his armchair, feeling the warmth of the sun on his face, Roberts Salamanca knew that he had made the right decision all those years ago.
