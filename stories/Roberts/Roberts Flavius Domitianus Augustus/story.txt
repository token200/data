One fateful day, Roberts received an invitation from the Roman Emperor himself to serve as a counselor in the imperial court. It was a dream come true for the young nobleman, and he quickly accepted the offer. As he ascended the ranks of the imperial administration, Roberts proved himself to be a shrewd politician and a skilled diplomat.

Despite his rapid rise to power, Roberts remained humble and true to his roots. He never forgot the lessons of his childhood in Palmyra, and he used his newfound influence to promote education, tolerance, and justice throughout the empire.
