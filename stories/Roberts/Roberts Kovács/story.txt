Roberts Kovács stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out at the city below. His eyes were fixed on the twinkling lights that danced across the skyscrapers like fireflies in the night. He had always loved this view, but tonight it felt especially poignant.

As he turned to leave, a gust of wind whipped through his hair, sending him stumbling back against the railing. A sudden jolt of fear shot through his chest, and for a moment, he forgot where he was. The world around him grew dark and distant, and all he could see was himself, standing alone on the edge.

That was when it hit him – the memory that had been hiding in the back of his mind, refusing to surface. He thought of the last time they'd stood here together, watching the sun rise over the city. His partner, József, would always be there to share this moment with him.

Kovács took a deep breath and let his gaze drop to the ground below. The memories came flooding back – the long nights spent studying, the countless hours of training, and the final mission that had brought it all crashing down. He thought of József's words, etched into his mind like a mantra: "For country, for duty, for each other."

With a heavy heart, Kovács made his way back to the door, his eyes fixed on the floor. The world around him still seemed dark and distant, but he knew that with every step, he was drawing closer to something. He took one final look at the city below before disappearing into the night, leaving the view behind.

In the silence of his apartment, Kovács sat down at the small desk and began writing a letter – a message to be passed on to József's family, informing them that their brother was gone but would always be in their hearts. Tears streamed down his face as he sealed the envelope and dropped it into the mailbox.

For the first time since that night, the weight of grief felt like it might finally lift. Kovács rose from the chair, a small smile on his face. He knew József was with him now, in a place where memories were woven into reality, and all he had to do was close his eyes and remember.
