It was a crisp autumn evening in Los Angeles, and Roberto "Rob" Mastroianni was gearing up for the biggest game of his life. As captain of the LA Galaxy, he had led his team to the championship title every year since 2018. But this year was different - they were facing off against their arch-rivals, Seattle Sounders.
