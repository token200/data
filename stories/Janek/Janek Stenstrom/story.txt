Janek Stenstrom walked into the dimly lit caf√©, scanning the room for a familiar face. As he waited in line to order his coffee, his eyes landed on a figure huddled in the corner, nursing a mug of black tea. Janek's gaze narrowed as he approached the table, recognizing the worn leather jacket and the distinctive silver stud that adorned the stranger's left eyebrow.

It had been months since he'd last seen his old friend, Kaida, but she'd still managed to recognize him from afar. The two had parted ways under less than amicable circumstances, but Janek couldn't deny the sense of unease that settled in the pit of his stomach as he watched Kaida's eyes flicker towards him.

As he waited for his coffee, Janek took a seat at the bar and began to chat with the bartender, an old acquaintance who knew better than to pry into his business. Meanwhile, Kaida sipped her tea, lost in thought.

The tension between them was palpable, but neither of them seemed inclined to break it. Janek couldn't help but wonder what had driven Kaida to leave their shared past behind, and whether she'd come to regret her decision. He, on the other hand, had moved on with his life, focusing on his art and building a new community in the city.

When Kaida finally worked up the courage to approach Janek, it was clear that neither of them was eager to rekindle their friendship. The conversation was stilted, with small talk and polite gestures serving as a fragile barrier between them. As they parted ways, Janek couldn't shake the feeling that he'd seen a glimmer of something raw and vulnerable beneath Kaida's tough exterior.

Though the encounter had left him with more questions than answers, Janek knew that some wounds ran too deep to ever be fully healed. He watched as Kaida vanished into the crowded streets, wondering if their complicated history was one he'd ever be able to truly lay to rest.
