Janek Salonen stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station. As a seasoned journalist, he had spent countless hours in airports and train stations, gathering stories and interviews for his next big exposé. But there was something about this particular place that caught his attention - a sense of unease that lingered beneath the surface.

Janek Salonen's instincts told him that something was off, and he couldn't shake the feeling as he made his way through the crowds to the information desk. He flashed his press pass and introduced himself, explaining that he was there on assignment from the Helsinki Times.

The station attendant, a gruff but kind-eyed man named Marko, raised an eyebrow at Janek Salonen's credentials before handing him a small package. "For you," he said quietly, before turning back to the crowd of commuters rushing to catch their trains.

Janek Salonen unwrapped the package, revealing a single sheet of paper with a cryptic message scrawled on it: "Look again at the case of Elina Väisälä". The name meant nothing to him, but something about it resonated deep within his bones. Janek Salonen's curiosity was piqued, and he tucked the note into his pocket as he made his way back out onto the platform.

As he walked through the city streets, Janek Salonen couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He quickened his pace, weaving through alleys and side streets until he finally reached the small café where Elina Väisälä had been last seen. The air inside was thick with tension, and Janek Salonen's eyes scanned the faces of the patrons as he waited for someone to notice him.

Suddenly, a young woman with piercing green eyes locked onto his gaze, and Janek Salonen felt a jolt run through his veins. "You're looking for me?" she asked softly, her voice barely above a whisper. Janek Salonen nodded, his mind racing with questions as the truth about Elina Väisälä began to unravel before him like a thread pulled from a tapestry.
