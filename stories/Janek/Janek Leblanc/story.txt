Janek Leblanc strolled into the dimly lit room, his eyes scanning the familiar faces gathered before him. As a seasoned diplomat and advisor to King Robert Baratheon, Janek had seen his fair share of intrigue and politics in the Seven Kingdoms.

"Good evening, Your Majesty," Janek said with a bow, addressing the king himself. "I trust you're well?"

Robert nodded curtly, his expression as gruff as ever. "I'm fine, Janek Leblanc. What news do you bring me from the Reach?"

Janek unfolded a parchment in his hands and began to read from it. "It seems that Lord Mace Tyrell still seeks to expand his power and influence in the region. He's making overtures towards the Iron Islands, hoping to secure an alliance with the Kingsmoot."

Robert's brow furrowed in concern. "How far does he plan to go?"

Janek hesitated before answering. "As far as the Reach itself, Your Majesty. Mace is playing a delicate game, and one misstep could spark war on multiple fronts."

Just then, a soft voice interrupted their conversation. "Your Majesty, I couldn't help but overhear. Perhaps we should be cautious of Lord Tyrell's intentions?"

Janek followed his gaze to the speaker: Tyrion Lannister, seated in the corner of the room with his characteristic air of quiet confidence.

Robert nodded thoughtfully. "Tyrion speaks the truth as always, Janek Leblanc. We must tread carefully and not let Mace's ambition blind us to the greater threat lurking in the shadows."

Janek nodded in agreement, aware that the game of thrones was afoot once more. As he stood watch over the kingdom, Janek knew that his counsel would be crucial in navigating the treacherous waters of politics.

With a nod, Janek Leblanc excused himself, leaving Robert and Tyrion to ponder their next move in the ongoing dance of power and deception that defined Westeros.
