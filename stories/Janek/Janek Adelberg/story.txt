Janek Adelberg was a master of disguise, able to blend into any crowd with ease. As a freelance journalist, he had made a career out of uncovering secrets and exposing corruption. His sharp mind and quick wit made him a formidable opponent for those who sought to hide the truth.

One night, Janek Adelberg received a cryptic message from an anonymous source about a high-stakes deal being brokered by a powerful businessman in a luxurious penthouse apartment. The message read: "Meet me at 5pm at the rooftop bar. Come alone."

Janek's instincts told him this was too good to be true, but his curiosity got the better of him. He arrived at the penthouse apartment building just as the sun began to set, his eyes scanning the area for any sign of danger.

As he entered the rooftop bar, Janek spotted a familiar face - his source from years ago, a woman known only by her pseudonym "Specter." She nodded discreetly towards an empty seat at the bar. Janek sat down, keeping his eyes locked on Specter as she began to speak in hushed tones.

"Janek Adelberg, I have something big for you," she whispered. "The businessman we're here about is not who he claims to be. He's a shell company owner, using frontmen like himself to siphon off millions from his investors."

Janek's mind began racing with the implications of this revelation. He pulled out his recorder and notebook, ready to capture every detail.

But as he leaned in closer, Janek noticed something odd - Specter seemed nervous, glancing around the bar as if she feared being overheard. "Who do you think is watching?" he asked, his voice low and urgent.

Specter's eyes locked onto Janek Adelberg's face before responding, her voice barely audible. "The man himself." Suddenly, the lights in the penthouse apartment flickered and died, plunging the rooftop bar into darkness.
