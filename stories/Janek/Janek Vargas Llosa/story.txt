Janek Vargas Llosa stepped into the dimly lit café, the scent of freshly brewed coffee wafting through the air. As the owner's daughter, she had grown up among the hissing steam and murmured conversations that filled the cozy establishment. Janek Vargas Llosa's eyes scanned the room, searching for her father, who was notoriously absent-minded.

Just as she spotted him, lost in thought behind the counter, a flurry of activity erupted outside. A group of protesters had gathered on the sidewalk, holding signs and chanting slogans. The air grew thick with tension as Janek Vargas Llosa watched from the safety of the café's window perch.

Her father, oblivious to the commotion, began expertly crafting a latte art design on top of a customer's coffee. "Janek, help me with this," he called out, his brow furrowed in concentration.

As she set down her book and hastened to assist, Janek Vargas Llosa couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration wash over her. Her father's forgetfulness often left her to navigate the complexities of their family business alone. Yet, despite his shortcomings, he was kind-hearted and well-intentioned.

As the protesters' chants grew louder, Janek Vargas Llosa slipped outside to assess the situation. The group's demands seemed reasonable – fair wages for workers, better working conditions – but she knew her father would never agree to compromise on their principles.

The protests eventually dispersed, leaving behind a sense of unease that lingered in the air. As Janek Vargas Llosa returned to the café, her father looked up from his work, concerned by the worried expression on her face.

"What's wrong, mija?" he asked, using the affectionate term for "my daughter."

Janek Vargas Llosa sighed, shaking her head. "It's just... sometimes I wish you were more present in our lives, Papá." The words hung in the air like a challenge, but her father simply smiled and wrapped his arms around her, pulling her close.

In that moment, Janek Vargas Llosa understood that her father's absent-mindedness was merely a part of who he was – a flawed yet lovable person who needed her love and support.
