Janek Bergström stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. He spotted her across the way, sipping on a cup of coffee and typing away on her laptop. It had been months since they'd last seen each other, but Janek's thoughts of Anna remained etched in his mind.

As he made his way to their favorite booth, Janek couldn't help but reminisce about their time together. He remembered the laughter, the late-night conversations, and the countless memories they'd created side by side. Their whirlwind romance had been short-lived, but its impact still lingered deep within him.

Anna looked up as Janek approached, a hint of surprise dancing across her face. She set her laptop aside and smiled warmly, inviting him to join her. The two of them sat down, hands touching briefly as they exchanged pleasantries.

Over steaming cups of coffee, they delved into the present, discussing everything from their careers to their plans for the future. Janek was impressed by Anna's drive and determination, qualities that had drawn him to her in the first place. Though he knew she'd never be his wife – or so he thought – Janek couldn't deny the strong bond they shared.

As the conversation flowed effortlessly, Janek found himself opening up about his own aspirations. He spoke of starting a new business venture, one that would allow him to make a name for himself in the industry. Anna listened attentively, her eyes sparkling with encouragement and support.

Their talk eventually turned to their past, with reminiscences of better times flooding back. Janek recalled the countless nights they'd spent exploring the city together, laughing until their sides hurt. The memories were bittersweet, yet Janek knew he couldn't let them define him. He was forging a new path now, one that led him away from the heartache and toward something brighter.

As the evening drew to a close, Anna reached across the table and gently placed her hand on top of Janek's. "I'm glad we ran into each other," she said softly. "You're still an important part of my life, even if it's just as a friend." A wave of gratitude washed over Janek as he smiled at her, knowing that their connection would endure, no matter where life took them.

In this moment, surrounded by the quiet hum of the café and the soft glow of twinkling lights outside, Janek Bergström felt a sense of peace. He knew his journey was just beginning – one filled with uncertainty and possibility. And with Anna's presence in his life, he couldn't help but feel that it would be worth it.
