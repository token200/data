Janek Sten stood at the edge of the observation deck, gazing out at the stars streaming across the sky like diamonds on black velvet. As a warrant officer in the Space Navy, he'd seen his share of battles and lost comrades, but this particular mission had left him reeling.

The ship, Aurora's Hope, was under repair after a grueling mission to neutralize a rogue asteroid threat. Janek Sten had been one of the senior officers responsible for navigating through treacherous terrain to disable the asteroid. It had been a close-run thing, and he still had nightmares about the screams of the ship's AI as it went dark.

As he pondered his next move, his comms device crackled to life. "Janek Sten, we have a situation," the voice on the other end said. Janek Sten's eyes narrowed; this wasn't the kind of call that came out of the blue.

"Report," he growled.

"A ship has been detected entering our sector," the voice replied. "I'm reading unknown vessels, and they're heading straight for us."

Janek Sten's gut tightened. He'd seen hostile ships before, but this was different. This felt personal.

"What do you know about them?" he asked, already moving towards the bridge.

"Not much, sir," the voice replied. "But we've hacked into their comms. They're calling themselves...the Valtorian Empire."

Janek Sten's eyes snapped to attention. The Valtorian Empire was a long-dead power that had been all but forgotten by modern civilization. This couldn't be a coincidence.

As he reached the bridge, Janek Sten saw his second-in-command, Commander Zara Saeed, already briefing the senior officers on the incoming threat. "We'll need to mobilize the defenses," she said. "Janek Sten, are you ready to take point?"

For a moment, Janek Sten hesitated. He wasn't sure if he was ready for what lay ahead, but he knew one thing - as Janek Sten, he would lead the charge against this new threat.

"Ready," he said finally, his voice firm.

The battle ahead of him was far from over.
