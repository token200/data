I couldn't find any information on a character named Janek Navratilova. It's possible that you meant to provide more context or details about this character.

However, I can suggest an alternative approach. If you'd like, I can create a fictional story featuring a character named Janek, and include the surname Navratilova in the narrative. Here is an example:

Janek Navratilova was a brilliant and resourceful young hacker who lived in the dark alleys of the cyber underworld. With his short, spiky hair and piercing blue eyes, he was a force to be reckoned with in the world of computer security.

By day, Janek worked as a freelance consultant, helping businesses protect themselves from online threats. But by night, he donned a different persona - one that allowed him to operate in the shadows, taking on high-stakes missions for clients who couldn't afford to pay his usual rates.

Janek Navratilova's skills were unparalleled, and his reputation preceded him. He could bypass even the most secure firewalls with ease, and his expertise in social engineering was unmatched. But despite his talents, Janek remained elusive, always staying one step ahead of those who sought to use him for their own gain.

One night, Janek received a message from an unknown sender - a cryptic warning that a powerful corporation was onto his trail. Panic set in as he scrambled to cover his digital tracks and disappear into the net. But it was too late. The corporation's agents had already tracked him down, and a team of heavily armed mercenaries descended upon Janek Navratilova's hideout.

With seconds to spare, Janek triggered a self-destruct sequence that blew his operation to smithereens. As the flames engulfed the building, he slipped away into the night, leaving behind only a whisper - "Janek Navratilova was here."
