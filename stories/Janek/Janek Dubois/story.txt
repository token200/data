Janek Dubois sat alone in the dimly lit café, nursing a cup of black coffee. His piercing blue eyes scanned the room, taking in the eclectic mix of patrons that filled the space. He was a man out of place, with his sharp jawline and chiseled features that seemed to belong on a runway model rather than in a dingy café.

As a former mercenary, Janek had seen his fair share of battles and bloodshed. But after a fateful mission went sideways, he found himself on the run, forced to abandon his old life and start anew. It was a struggle, but one that he had grown accustomed to over time.

Janek's thoughts were interrupted by the soft chime of his phone on the table beside him. He pulled it out, revealing a text from an unknown number: "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone."

A thrill ran through Janek's veins as he read the message. It was a summons from someone who knew him well – and poorly enough to send such a cryptic invitation.

He finished his coffee in silence, his mind racing with possibilities. Who could be behind this mysterious text? And what did they want from him?

As the hours ticked by, Janek's excitement grew. He knew that he couldn't just walk away – not without knowing what was waiting for him on the other side of midnight.

At 11:45 PM sharp, Janek stood outside the clock tower, his hand resting on the grip of his gun. The air was heavy with anticipation as he waited for the signal to enter.

The chime sounded, and Janek took a deep breath before stepping into the shadows. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the darkness – a woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair that cascaded down her back like a waterfall.

"Janek Dubois," she said, her voice low and husky. "I see you received my message."

Janek's grip on his gun tightened as he took in the sight of his old comrade-in-arms. It had been years since they'd last seen each other – and yet, it felt like no time had passed at all.

"What do you want?" Janek asked gruffly, trying to keep his cool.

The woman smiled, her eyes glinting with mischief. "I think we both know what this is about, Janek. Let's just say I have a proposition for you – one that could change the course of your life forever."
