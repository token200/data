Janek Novak stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a skilled mercenary, he had seen his fair share of battles and bloodshed. The patrons of this particular establishment seemed like an average bunch of travelers and locals, but Janek's instincts told him otherwise.

He spotted a hooded figure sitting in the corner, sipping a mug of ale. Janek's gaze lingered on them for a moment before he turned to make his way to the bar. The bartender, a gruff old man with a thick beard, nodded at Janek as he approached.

"What can I get you, Novak?" the bartender asked, his voice low and gravelly.

"Just a pint of your finest ale, please," Janek replied, sliding a few coins across the bar.

As the bartender poured his drink, Janek's eyes never left the hooded figure. He sensed that something was off about them, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it.

The hooded figure finally looked up, their eyes locking with Janek's for a brief moment before quickly looking away. Janek felt a shiver run down his spine as he realized that this person was not like the others in the tavern.

Just then, the door burst open and a group of armed men stormed in, searching for someone. The patrons scrambled to get out of their way, but Janek stood his ground, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword.

The leader of the group, a burly man with a scar above his left eyebrow, spotted the hooded figure and let out a growl. "You!" he shouted, pointing at the mysterious stranger. "We've been looking for you."

Janek's instincts kicked in, and he stepped forward to protect the hooded figure. The bartender, sensing the tension, reached under the bar and pulled out a small vial of liquid.

"What's that?" Janek asked, his eyes narrowing as he watched the bartender toss the vial at the armed men.

The liquid splashed onto their faces, causing them to stumble and momentarily blind themselves. In the chaos, Janek grabbed the hooded figure's arm and dragged them out of the tavern, into the safety of the night.

As they emerged onto the cobblestone street, Janek turned to his mysterious companion and demanded, "Who are you?"

The hooded figure slowly pulled back their hood, revealing a beautiful woman with piercing green eyes. "I am Elara Vex," she replied, her voice barely above a whisper.
