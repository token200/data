Janek Ryota stood at the edge of the small, dusty town, his eyes scanning the crumbling buildings and dirt-strewn streets. He had been here before, but it was a memory that he tried to suppress. The air was thick with an unspoken expectation, like a heavy mist that clung to every surface.

Janek's gaze fell upon a figure standing across from him – a woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She wore a white shirt, billowy at the sleeves, and her hands were clasped behind her back as if in prayer. Her name was Lyra, and she had been waiting for Janek's return.

"Long time no see," Lyra said, her voice husky but laced with a hint of dryness. "I didn't think you'd show up after all."

Janek shrugged, a small movement that belied the turmoil brewing within him. He had been running from this town for what felt like an eternity – and himself, he couldn't help but wonder. What was it about this place that drew him back in?

Lyra watched Janek with an intensity that made his skin crawl. She had always been perceptive, picking up on the smallest hints of emotion. He knew she could see right through him.

"You still got questions," Lyra said, as if reading his thoughts. "About your past, about what happened to you... What are you waiting for?"

Janek turned away from her, his eyes drifting over the empty streets once more. It was a habit of his – the ability to detach himself from reality. People often thought him aloof, distant, but it was a defense mechanism he'd honed long ago.

"The past," Lyra repeated, her voice softer now. "I'm not going anywhere."

Janek nodded without looking at her. They had both seen their share of darkness, done things they wished to forget. But there were secrets here that couldn't be buried – and Janek knew Lyra understood him more than anyone.

"I'll take you," he said finally, turning back to face the town's center. "You can try and unravel whatever mysteries you think I've got locked up inside me."

The streets narrowed as they walked toward the old town hall. Painted signs creaked in the wind – advertisements for local businesses and services long gone. Lyra fell into step beside him, her hand brushing against his. He flinched but didn't pull away.

Inside the musty hall, shelves groaned under the weight of yellowing records. A faded tapestry hung on one wall, depicting scenes from this town's forgotten history. Janek stopped in front of a particular shelf, scanning the names and dates etched into the cards.

"Try to remember," Lyra said gently, her eyes meeting his across the narrow space between them. "When was it? Before... or after?"

Janek closed his eyes as memories began to surface – pieces from an incomplete puzzle. Fragments that were almost like a dream.

"Fourteen," he whispered finally, opening his eyes. "It's been fourteen years."

Lyra reached out, placing her hand on his arm. The contact was electric.

You were seventeen then," she reminded him softly. "I knew you before it happened... Whatever 'it' is that you're running from."

Janek wrenched free from her grasp, walking away from the shelf as if to distance himself from these recollections. He felt like a stranger to his own past – detached and disconnected.

"What do you know about your father?" Lyra asked abruptly, halting in front of him.

The query jarred Janek more than he wanted it to. His eyes dropped to the floor, but not before Lyra caught the flicker of something almost like fear in them.

"I don't know anything," he said flatly. "Leave me alone."

For a few tense moments, they stood there – Janek and Lyra – until she spoke up again.

"My mother used to tell stories about your father," Lyra continued softly. "She said... that you were born to be haunted by something in this town."

Janek's eyes snapped up to hers. For an instant, the weight of his secrets seemed too much to bear.

They walked out into the bright sunlight together – Janek, with his past clinging like a shadow; Lyra, trying to bring him back from wherever it was he'd been hiding.
