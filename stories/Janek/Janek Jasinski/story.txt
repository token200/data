Janek Jasinski walked into the small café, scanning the room for a familiar face. He spotted his friend, Rachel, sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee. As he approached her table, she looked up and smiled.

"Hey, Janek Jasinski," she said, using his full name as always.

Janek chuckled and took a seat across from her. "What's up, Rach? I need a refill on my coffee."

Rachel laughed and signaled the barista for another cup. As they waited, Janek filled Rachel in on his latest project at work. She listened intently, asking thoughtful questions and offering words of encouragement.

As they chatted, Janek couldn't help but think about how much he valued their friendship. Rachel was one of the few people who knew him well enough to call him out when he was being stubborn or obtuse. And yet, she always managed to make him laugh, even on his worst days.

Just then, the barista arrived with Janek's refilled coffee and a slice of lemon pound cake. Janek took a bite, savoring the sweet and tangy flavors. Rachel watched him, a small smile playing on her lips.

"You know, Janek Jasinski," she said, "you're not as grumpy as people make you out to be."

Janek raised an eyebrow, laughing. "Hey, I'm just passionately expressing myself, Rach."

Their banter continued, flowing easily from one topic to the next. As they talked, Janek felt his worries and cares melting away. Being around Rachel made him feel seen and heard in a way that few others could.

As the afternoon wore on, Janek knew it was time to head back to work. He thanked Rachel for meeting up with him and promised to catch up soon. As he left the café, he felt rejuvenated and ready to tackle whatever challenges lay ahead. And he knew that no matter what, he could always count on Rachel – his friend Janek Jasinski – to have his back.
