Janek Fontaine sat at his desk, staring blankly at the sheet of paper in front of him. He was a private investigator, and it was cases like this that kept him up at night.

A wealthy businessman had gone missing, leaving behind only a cryptic note: "The truth is hidden in plain sight." The police were stumped, and Janek's client was growing restless. It was time for him to dig deeper.

Janek's eyes scanned the room, taking in the familiar surroundings of his office. It was a cluttered space, filled with dusty files and half-empty coffee cups. But Janek knew every inch of it by heart. He had been here for years, solving cases that others wouldn't touch.

As he stood up to pace around the room, Janek's mind began to wander. He thought back to his own past, growing up on the streets of Paris. His father had been a thief, and Janek had learned early on how to pick locks and sweet-talk his way into (or out of) trouble.

But it was more than just instinct that drove him now. It was a sense of justice. When someone went missing, it wasn't just about finding them - it was about uncovering the truth behind their disappearance.

Janek stopped pacing and picked up his phone. He dialed a number, waiting for the person on the other end to answer.

"Bonjour, Colette," he said, using her nickname.

Colette was an old flame of Janek's, now a journalist at Le Figaro. She had a nose for news, and Janek knew she would be interested in this case.

"What have you got?" she asked, her voice husky over the phone.

Janek smiled to himself. "I think I've found our first lead."

He told Colette about the businessman's disappearance, and the cryptic note he had left behind. As he spoke, Janek could almost see the wheels turning in her head.

"You think it's a setup?" she asked, her voice laced with skepticism.

Janek shrugged. "I don't know yet. But I'll find out."

As they hung up the phone, Janek felt a sense of determination wash over him. This case would be solved, no matter what it took. He picked up his coat and headed out into the Parisian night, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
