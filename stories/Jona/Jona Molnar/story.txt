Jona Elara Molnar was known for her striking features and razor-sharp wit. A free-spirited artist, she had always been drawn to the unconventional and the unknown. Her latest project, a mixed-media installation titled "Echoes in the Abyss," was set to debut at a local gallery, and anticipation was building among art enthusiasts.

As Jona worked tirelessly in her studio, pouring her heart and soul into the piece, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. She had received an unusual commission from a mysterious client, who wanted her to incorporate a specific symbol into the installation – one that seemed eerily familiar yet impossible to place. Despite her reservations, Jona felt compelled to push through with the project.

The night of the gallery opening arrived, and Jona's nerves were on edge. As she unveiled "Echoes in the Abyss" to the gathered crowd, a sense of unease settled over her. The symbol, once again, seemed to stare back at her like an unblinking eye. She tried to brush it off as mere paranoia, but the feeling persisted.

As the evening wore on and the crowd began to disperse, Jona found herself alone in front of her installation. It was then that she noticed something strange – a small, hand-delivered note attached to the wall, bearing only a single sentence: "You shouldn't have done this, Jona Elara Molnar."

The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end as Jona realized that the mysterious client had indeed been more than just a curious patron. She felt a shiver run down her spine, and for the first time in weeks, she began to wonder if she had made a terrible mistake.

Despite her growing unease, Jona couldn't help but feel a twisted sense of pride in having pushed the boundaries of art and convention. As she gazed upon "Echoes in the Abyss," now seeming more like a macabre puzzle than a masterpiece, she knew that this was just the beginning – and not necessarily the end.
