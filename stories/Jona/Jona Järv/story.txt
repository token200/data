Jona Järv was a name that evoked a sense of mystery and intrigue in the small town of Põlva, Estonia. As a renowned folk musician, she had spent her life collecting and preserving the traditional songs and dances of her people.

Born to a family of musicians, Jona had grown up surrounded by the sounds of the fiddle, accordion, and vocals that filled their small cottage on the outskirts of town. From a young age, she was trained in the art of music-making by her parents, who taught her the intricacies of traditional Estonian folk music.

As she grew older, Jona began to venture beyond the boundaries of her village, performing at festivals and events throughout the country. Her unique voice and skillful fingers on the fiddle quickly earned her a reputation as one of Estonia's most talented musicians.

And so, she began to sing and play, her voice and the sound of the fiddle weaving together in perfect harmony.
