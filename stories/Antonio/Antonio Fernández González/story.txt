Antonio Fernández González was known for his sharp wit and quick tongue in the small town of San Miguel. As the owner of the local tavern, El Jardín, he had a knack for getting everyone to open up about their troubles.

One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, a young woman named Sofía walked into El Jardín, her eyes red from crying. Antonio Fernández González immediately sensed that something was wrong and offered her a warm smile. "¿Qué pasa, mi amor?" he asked, his voice low and soothing.

Sofía sniffled and told him about how she had just received a letter from her estranged mother, informing her that she would be moving to the city. Sofía was heartbroken, feeling like she was losing a part of herself. Antonio Fernández González listened attentively, nodding his head from time to time.

As he poured Sofía a cup of strong coffee, he shared a story about his own struggles with his late father. "He used to say that the key to happiness is not in where you're going, but in who's by your side," Antonio Fernández González said, his eyes locked onto Sofía's.

Sofía smiled slightly, feeling a small sense of comfort. Antonio Fernández González continued to chat with her, sharing tales of the town's history and the people who lived there. As the night wore on, Sofía found herself laughing and forgetting about her troubles.

Just as she was starting to feel better, a group of rowdy travelers stumbled into El Jardín, seeking refuge from the rain. Antonio Fernández González welcomed them with open arms, expertly juggling multiple conversations at once. As he juggled his tasks, Sofía noticed that despite the chaos, Antonio Fernández González remained calm and composed.

As the night drew to a close, Sofía thanked Antonio Fernández González for listening to her troubles and offering words of wisdom. "Gracias, señor," she said, smiling. Antonio Fernández González smiled back, his eyes twinkling with kindness. "No de nada, mi amor. That's what friends are for."
