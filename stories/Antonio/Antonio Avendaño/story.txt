Antonio Avendaño stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his piercing green eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a former mercenary and current owner of the small town's security firm, Antonio had seen it all - from petty theft to high-stakes robberies.

The patrons fell silent as he made his way to the bar, his broad shoulders and rugged jawline commanding attention. Antonio ordered a whiskey, his voice low and smooth as he asked about any recent incidents in the area. The bartender, a gruff old man with a bushy beard, shook his head. "Just the usual, Antonio. Some kids causing trouble outside town, but nothing serious."

Antonio nodded thoughtfully, his mind already racing with scenarios and countermeasures. As he sipped his drink, a commotion erupted from the corner of the room. A group of rough-looking men had just entered, their eyes fixed menacingly on Antonio.

Without hesitation, Antonio stood up, his hand resting on the grip of his holstered pistol. The leader of the group sneered at him, but Antonio's calm demeanor put them off guard. "What can we do for you?" he asked, his tone firm but polite.

The man snarled, baring his teeth, and the situation escalated quickly. Antonio reacted instinctively, disarming the would-be attackers with swift precision. In an instant, the room was quiet once more, the patrons watching in awe as Antonio dispensed with the thugs.

As the dust settled, the bartender sidled up to him, a look of admiration on his face. "Thanks again, Antonio Avendaño," he said. "You're a lifesaver." Antonio smiled wryly and took another sip of his whiskey, the cool liquid soothing his parched throat.

Antonio had always been drawn to work that needed doing, whether it was protecting a small town from threats or simply making sure justice was served. He'd never sought fame or fortune; for him, there was no greater reward than knowing he'd made a difference in someone's life. With his drink finished and the night young, Antonio Avendaño stood up, ready to face whatever came next.
