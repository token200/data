As a young boy, Antonio had grown up on the streets, surviving by his wits and cunning. He quickly learned to navigate the treacherous world of organized crime, working his way up the ranks with ruthless efficiency.

Despite the risks, Antonio pressed on, driven by an insatiable hunger for success. He built a vast network of loyal followers and operatives, each one bound to him by a shared commitment to his vision. And as he rose to power, Antonio's legend grew, with people speaking in awe of the enigmatic figure known only as "Il Cavaliere" (The Knight).

But there were those who saw through the facade, who knew that behind Antonio Michielin's charming smile and razor-sharp mind lay a calculating killer. They waited patiently for their chance to strike, knowing that one day the great Knight would fall.
