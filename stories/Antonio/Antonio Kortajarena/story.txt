In the quiet moments between performances, when the lights dimmed and the spotlight faded, Antonio would allow himself to simply enjoy the music, feeling Granados' melodies resonate deep within his chest. It was then that he felt truly alive, connected to the world around him through the language of dance and song.

And so, as a dancer with the Ballet Nacional de España, Antonio Kortajarena had found his true calling – one that would bring him joy, fulfillment, and a sense of belonging for years to come.
