As he strolled along the Seine, taking in the city's magical energy, he began to hum a melody that had been swirling around his head for days. Without even realizing it, he started to play, the notes flowing effortlessly from his fingers as if guided by some unseen force.

In that moment, Antonio Palmas knew exactly what he wanted to create â€“ a symphony of hope and joy, one that would bring people together in a shared celebration of music's transformative power.
