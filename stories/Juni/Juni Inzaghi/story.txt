His full name, Roberto Inzaghi, was often chanted by the fans at the San Siro stadium, where he spent many happy years playing for the club.

Despite his success on the pitch, Inzaghi's true passion lay off the field. He was a devoted family man and loved nothing more than spending time with his wife and children. He was also known to be a bit of a bookworm, often sneaking away to read in his spare time.
