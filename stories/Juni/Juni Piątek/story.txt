As he prepared for the exhibition, Juni couldn't help but think back to his childhood days spent exploring the winding streets and alleys of Krakow with his grandfather.

The night before the exhibition, Juni's nerves got the better of him. He sat in front of one of his paintings, staring at it blankly, unable to see anything that he liked.
