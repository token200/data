The client was taken by her innovative approach and effortless style, and soon Juni found herself working on high-profile branding campaigns that showcased the Laine family's expertise.

Juni's success didn't go unnoticed within her own family. Her siblings couldn't help but marvel at her quick rise to fame, proud of their youngest sibling for forging her own path. As they gathered around the dinner table, discussing Juni's latest project over steaming plates of family-cooked cuisine, it was clear that she had finally found her place in the world.
