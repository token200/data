Juni Maldini walked through the streets of Milan, her designer heels clicking on the pavement. She was a fixture in the fashion world, known for her sharp jawline and razor-sharp tongue. As a renowned fashion editor, Juni had an eye for talent – or talent that was willing to sell its soul.

Her gaze landed on a young woman with a portfolio slung over her shoulder. Juni's curiosity piqued, she strode over to intercept the girl. "Can I help you?" Juni asked, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

"I-I have some designs I'd like to show you," the young woman stammered.

Juni raised an eyebrow. "How original."

The girl hesitated before launching into a breathless pitch about her inspirations and ideas. Juni listened intently, her expression unreadable. When the girl finished speaking, Juni offered a critique that left the young woman quivering with insecurity.

"Don't get discouraged," Juni said as she handed back the portfolio. "Fashion is a cruel mistress. You need to prove yourself – over and over again."

The girl nodded hastily and beat a hasty retreat. Juni watched her go before turning her attention to her own phone. She had a meeting with a potential new client in an hour, and she still needed to review the latest designs from emerging designers.

As she scrolled through the images on her screen, Juni's mind wandered back to her own struggles in the fashion world. She had once been a talented young designer herself, but after a falling out with her mentor, she was forced to start over from scratch.

Now, Juni's sharp tongue and acid wit were her greatest assets – as well as her most formidable enemies. People either loved or hated her, there was no middle ground.

Just then, her assistant burst in with an urgent message: "The new designer, Alessandro, is here. He has a proposal for you."

Juni raised an eyebrow as she rose from her seat. She had heard rumors about this young upstart – that he had connections to some of the biggest names in Milan's fashion elite.

"Send him in," Juni said, her voice dripping with curiosity.

As Alessandro entered the room, Juni sized him up with a practiced gaze. There was something about his eyes that sparked recognition – something that hinted at a deeper connection beneath his smooth facade.

"Well?" Juni asked, leaning forward in her seat. "What's your proposal?"

Alessandro took a deep breath before launching into his pitch. Juni listened intently as he showed her designs, each one more stunning than the last.

For once, Juni's sharp tongue was silenced by surprise. Maybe this young designer wasn't just another wannabe after all...
