Juni Hideki stepped out of the train station, her eyes scanning the crowded streets of Tokyo. She had just arrived in the city from rural Hokkaido, eager to start her new life as an apprentice at the famous Tendo Institute for Geocraft. The wind whipped through her long black hair as she made her way through the throngs of people.

Juni had always been fascinated by the ancient art of geocraft, a traditional Japanese technique that used the natural world to create intricate designs and patterns. Growing up in Hokkaido, she would spend hours watching the snow fall gently outside her window, mesmerized by its delicate beauty. As she grew older, Juni became determined to master the art of geocraft herself.

Now, at the age of 20, Juni was finally taking her first steps towards achieving her dream. The Tendo Institute was renowned for producing some of Japan's most skilled geocrafters, and Juni hoped to learn from the best in the business. She made her way through the winding streets of Tokyo, following the directions given to her by a friend who had studied at the institute.

As she turned a corner, Juni caught sight of the institute's imposing stone building. The entrance was guarded by two tall statues of mythical creatures, their eyes gleaming with an otherworldly light. Juni felt a shiver run down her spine as she pushed open the door and stepped inside.

The air inside the institute was thick with incense and the scent of wood and fabric. Juni followed the directions to a small room deep in the heart of the building, where a kindly old geocrafter waited for her. He introduced himself as Tendo-sensei, and welcomed Juni warmly into his workshop.

Over the next few weeks, Juni threw herself into her studies, learning the intricacies of geocraft from one of the most experienced masters in Japan. She spent long hours practicing the delicate strokes and patterns that made up this ancient art, slowly but surely mastering the techniques.

As she worked, Juni felt a sense of peace wash over her. For the first time in her life, she felt like she was exactly where she was meant to be. The wind outside may have been fierce, but inside the Tendo Institute, Juni had found a calm and peaceful refuge that she knew would stay with her for the rest of her life.
