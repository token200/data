As she began her investigation, Juni noticed that all the missing persons had one thing in common: they had been seen arguing with a reclusive businessman named Marcus Thompson. She decided to pay him a visit, hoping to uncover some clues.

Upon arriving at Marcus's mansion, Juni was greeted by his stern-looking butler, who refused to let her in. However, Juni's persistence eventually won out, and she managed to sneak past the butler and into the mansion.

 Inside, Juni discovered a series of cryptic messages scrawled on the walls, which seemed to point to Marcus's involvement in the disappearances. She also found a hidden room, where she stumbled upon a collection of disturbing photographs.
