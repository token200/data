Juni Fernández González sat alone in her small, cluttered apartment, staring at the worn wooden chair across from her. The same one where her abuela used to sit and tell stories of their family's history, of their struggles and triumphs.

Abuela was gone now, but Juni held onto the memories like a lifeline. She had always felt lost after Abuela passed away, as if she was wandering through life without a purpose. But then she discovered her love for photography, and it all came flooding back - the way light danced through the lens, the way stories were told in a single frame.

Juni's fingers began to tremble as she picked up her camera, the one Abuela had given her before passing away. She opened the shutter and focused on the worn armchair, trying to recreate the exact moment when Abuela would sit down. The result was nothing short of magical - the chair seemed to come alive, its wooden slats glowing with a warm, golden light.

As Juni continued to shoot, she felt Abuela's presence around her, guiding her hand and offering words of encouragement in her mind. She began to see the world through different eyes now, capturing every moment, every conversation, every laugh and tear as if it was the last time she would ever experience them.

She took her camera out into the city, capturing the vibrant colors and textures of the streets, but most importantly, the stories hidden in plain sight - a street performer's joyous grin, a child's first steps, an elderly woman's wise eyes. And with each frame, Juni felt Abuela's love growing stronger within her.

Juni's apartment became a museum of memories, filled with photographs that told stories of their family's past, of struggles and triumphs, but most importantly, of the present moment. She began to write the captions for each photo, weaving together fragments of Abuela's words and stories into a narrative of love, resilience, and hope.

And when she looked at her photos, Juni could almost see Abuela sitting across from her, smiling proudly as if to say "I'm with you, mija. We're telling our story together."
