Juni Müller had always been fascinated by the world of clockwork machines. As a young apprentice to the renowned horologist, Herr Schneider, she spent countless hours learning the intricacies of gears and springs. But Juni's true passion lay in creating her own timepieces, ones that not only kept perfect time but also told stories of their own.

One day, while rummaging through an antique shop, Juni stumbled upon an old, mysterious clockwork box with a delicate silver latch.
