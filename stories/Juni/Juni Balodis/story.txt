Juni Balodis sat at her desk, staring blankly at the stack of bills in front of her. As a freelance writer and editor, she had grown accustomed to the uncertainty of her schedule and income, but it still stung to see those numbers add up so quickly.

Just as she was about to give in to frustration, Juni's phone rang. She picked up, and her best friend and colleague, Lily, was on the other end. "Hey, Juni! I just got accepted into the grant program for our writers' collective," Lily exclaimed.

Juni let out a whoop of excitement. This was exactly what she needed - a steady stream of income to support herself while she worked on her own projects. She had been putting off submitting her latest novel, partly because she didn't want to juggle multiple editing jobs and her own writing, but also because she was waiting for the perfect moment.

"That's amazing, Lil!" Juni replied, trying to contain her enthusiasm. "I've got a few clients lined up, so I'm thinking of taking on more work to make sure I can cover my expenses."

As they chatted, Juni couldn't help but think about how far she'd come since graduating from college with an English degree and a vague idea of wanting to write novels one day. She had worked her way up through the ranks of various writing gigs, learning as she went and honing her skills.

Now, at 28 years old, Juni was finally starting to find her footing. She was building a portfolio, networking with other writers, and slowly but surely making a name for herself in the industry. It wasn't always easy - there were plenty of rejections and setbacks along the way - but Juni had learned to persevere.

As she hung up with Lily, Juni felt a sense of renewed purpose wash over her. She was exactly where she needed to be, working on projects that challenged her and allowed her to grow as a writer. With this grant money in hand, she could finally start focusing on the novel she'd been putting off for so long.

"Okay," she said to herself, smiling, "it's time to get back to work."
