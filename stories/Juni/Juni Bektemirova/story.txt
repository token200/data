Despite her success, Juni remained humble and true to her roots. She continued to paint without commission or recognition, simply because it brought her joy. Her art was a reflection of her love for her city and its people, and she poured every ounce of herself into each new piece.

One day, a prominent local collector stumbled upon one of Juni's murals while exploring the streets of Ashgabat.
