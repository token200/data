Juni Ahmed walked into the dimly lit caf√©, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She had received a cryptic message from an old acquaintance, inviting her to meet in person. Juni had always been one step ahead of the game, but this time, she was on edge.

As she waited, sipping on a cup of coffee, the door swung open and a figure emerged from the shadows. It was Marcus, a former colleague who had turned against her years ago. Juni's instincts told her to leave, but curiosity kept her rooted to her seat.

Marcus slid into the booth across from her, a sly smile spreading across his face. "Juni Ahmed, it's been too long," he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. Juni's grip on her cup tightened as she eyed him warily.

"What do you want, Marcus?" she asked bluntly, trying to keep her tone even.

"I have information about your sister's disappearance," Marcus stated, his eyes glinting with a mixture of triumph and malice. Juni's heart skipped a beat - her younger sister, Leela, had vanished five years ago without a trace.

Marcus leaned in, his voice taking on a conspiratorial tone. "I know who was involved, Juni Ahmed. I can take you to them."

Juni's mind reeled as she weighed the risks and benefits of trusting Marcus. Part of her wanted to believe that he was telling the truth, but another part of her suspected a trap.

"What makes you think I'll listen to you?" she asked, her voice firm but cautious.

Marcus chuckled. "Because, Juni Ahmed, we have a shared history. And I know how much you want the truth about Leela's disappearance."

Juni hesitated, her grip on her cup still clenched in her hand. She couldn't deny that Marcus had brought up a vulnerable spot - her desire for answers about her sister's fate.

"Okay," she said finally, making a decision. "Tell me what you know."

Marcus leaned back in his seat, a self-satisfied smirk on his face. Juni wondered if she was walking into a trap or getting closer to the truth. One thing was certain - with Marcus Ahmed, nothing was ever as it seemed.
