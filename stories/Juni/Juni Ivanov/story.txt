One fateful evening, Juni received a cryptic message from an anonymous source, hinting at a massive data heist planned by a shadowy corporation. Intrigued, she decided to take on the challenge, eager to uncover the truth behind the message.

As Zero Cool, Juni set her sights on the corporation's mainframe, expertly navigating through layers of firewalls and security protocols with ease. Her fingers flew across her keyboard as she worked tirelessly to unravel the mystery, fueled by a combination of caffeine and pure adrenaline.
