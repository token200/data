Juni Boulanger stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station. She had been traveling for hours, and finally, she was here. The place where it all began.

She made her way through the empty station, the only sound being the soft click of her heels on the tile floor. As she emerged into the bright sunlight, she took a deep breath, feeling the cool air fill her lungs. It had been years since she'd last set foot in Ashwood, but it felt like no time had passed at all.

Juni's eyes wandered to the small town, nestled in the heart of the Pacific Northwest. The same place where her family had raised her as a child, teaching her the art of healing and the magic that lay within the natural world. Her grandmother, Ophelia, had been a wise woman, known for her extraordinary abilities and kind heart.

As Juni walked through the streets, people nodded in recognition, their faces filled with warmth and curiosity. They knew who she was, or at least, they suspected. After all, she had grown up in this very town, studying under Ophelia's guidance before venturing out into the world to hone her craft.

Juni had returned to Ashwood after years of travel, seeking a new purpose. She had been running from her past, trying to outrun the pain and heartache that lingered within her. But as she walked through these familiar streets, she began to feel a sense of peace settle over her. It was as if the very earth itself was welcoming her back home.

As she approached the old cabin where Ophelia had lived and taught Juni, she felt a strange tingling sensation in her fingers. The trees seemed to lean in, their branches tangling together above her head like a protective canopy. Juni smiled, feeling a sense of belonging wash over her.

She stepped inside the cabin, her eyes adjusting to the dim light within. The air was thick with the scent of old books and earthy spices. Juni's heart swelled with emotion as she remembered her grandmother's words: "Juni, your healing hands are not just for the body, but also for the soul."

In this moment, Juni knew that she had come home to Ashwood for more than just physical refuge. She had returned to reclaim her place as a healer, and to honor the legacy of her beloved grandmother, Ophelia Boulanger.
