Tõnis Bauer stepped out of his small apartment, taking a deep breath of the crisp Estonian morning air. He lived in a world where time was currency, and every moment counted. As a "time scavenger," he made a living by tracking down and collecting discarded hours, minutes, and seconds.

Tõnis had always been drawn to this work because it allowed him to move at his own pace. Unlike the rushing masses of Tallinn's city streets, where time was constantly slipping away, Tõnis could savor each fragment of lost time. He'd spend hours rummaging through trash cans, scouring for stray seconds, or even negotiating with other scavengers over who'd found the most valuable scraps.

One day, while exploring a forgotten alleyway near the old town, Tõnis stumbled upon an extraordinary find: a single, shimmering second, suspended in mid-air like a tiny, translucent star. As he reached out to touch it, the world around him began to distort and blur. The buildings seemed to melt away, revealing a hidden courtyard filled with clocks of every shape and size.

In the center of this mystical space stood an ancient clockmaker's workshop. Tõnis felt an inexplicable pull towards it, as if he'd been brought there for a reason. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of oil and metal, and the sound of ticking echoed through the room like music.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows: an old man with eyes that shone like stars on a clear night. He introduced himself as Johannes, the keeper of time's lost hours.

"You have a gift, Tõnis," Johannes said, his voice low and gentle. "A gift to understand the hidden rhythms of the world. I will teach you how to harness this power, to weave together the fragments of lost time into something new."

Tõnis listened, entranced, as Johannes revealed the secrets of timekeeping. He learned to hear the subtle whispers of discarded moments, and to shape them into tiny, shimmering orbs that could be stored away like precious jewels.

As he left the workshop, Tõnis felt a sense of purpose he'd never known before. His work as a scavenger would take on a new meaning – not just collecting lost time, but crafting it into something beautiful, something that would change the world forever.
