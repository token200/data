But despite his success on the ice, Tõnis Sikora's personal life was not without its challenges. He struggled to balance his passion for hockey with the demands of a career, often putting in long hours at the rink while sacrificing time with friends and family.

One person who had been by Tõnis Sikora's side throughout it all was his sister, Kati.
