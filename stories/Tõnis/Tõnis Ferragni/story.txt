I couldn't find any information on the character "Tõnis Ferragni". It's possible that this character is fictional or not well-known.

However, I can create a story around the name "Tõnis Ferragni" and write about him in the style of an Estonian author. Here it is:

Tõnis Ferragni was a young man from Tallinn who had always been fascinated by the sea. Growing up near the Baltic coastline, he spent most of his childhood exploring the rocky shores and dreaming of adventure on the high seas.

As he grew older, Tõnis's love for the ocean only deepened, and he became determined to make a name for himself as a sailor. He spent years studying navigation and sailing techniques, working hard to save up enough money to buy his own boat.

Finally, the day arrived when Tõnis Ferragni set sail on his own vessel, a sturdy little yacht that he had named "Vana Lume" (Old Light). He spent months at sea, exploring the coastlines of Estonia and Latvia, and marveling at the beauty of the ocean's moods.

Tõnis's journey took him to hidden coves and secret islands, where he would anchor his boat and spend hours exploring the natural wonders of the Baltic. He became known among local fishermen as a wise and skilled sailor, who knew every hidden reef and rocky outcropping in the area.

One day, Tõnis Ferragni received an offer from a wealthy collector to join him on a voyage around the world. The collector was looking for a skilled sailor to navigate his yacht through treacherous waters, and he had heard of Tõnis's reputation as one of the best sailors in Estonia.

Tõnis Ferragni accepted the offer, and spent several months at sea with the collector. He saw wonders beyond his wildest dreams, including schools of dolphins and towering icebergs. When the voyage finally ended, Tõnis returned to Tallinn a hero, his name on everyone's lips as a brave and skilled sailor.

From that day forward, Tõnis Ferragni was known throughout Estonia as one of the greatest sailors in the country's history.
