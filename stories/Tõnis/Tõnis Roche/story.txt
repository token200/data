Tõnis Roche was a man with a passion for restoring old machines to their former glory. A master mechanic by trade, he spent most of his days tinkering with engines and gears in his small workshop nestled in the heart of Tallinn's Old Town. Tõnis Roche took pride in his work, carefully disassembling each piece of machinery before reassembling it with precision and care.

One day, a customer arrived at Tõnis Roche's doorstep, seeking his expertise in repairing an antique tractor that had been out of commission for decades. The customer, an elderly Estonian farmer named Aigi, had inherited the tractor from his late father but was having trouble getting it to run. Tõnis Roche listened intently as Aigi described the problem, nodding sympathetically before beginning the repair.

Tõnis Roche spent hours examining the tractor's engine, searching for any signs of wear or damage that could be causing the failure. He replaced a faulty valve and cleaned the fuel injectors, patiently waiting for the results of his efforts. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the tractor roared back to life beneath Tõnis Roche's skilled hands.

Aigi was overjoyed when Tõnis Roche presented him with the fully restored tractor, its bright red paint gleaming in the sunlight. "Arustan tänan!" (Thank you!) he exclaimed, shaking Tõnis Roche's hand warmly. The two men spent the rest of the afternoon riding across the Estonian countryside, the tractor's powerful engine rumbling beneath them.

As they rode, Aigi asked Tõnis Roche about his background and how he had come to become such a skilled mechanic. Tõnis Roche smiled wistfully, recalling the many hours he spent as a young boy helping his father in their own small workshop. "I've always loved working with machines," he said simply, "and I feel lucky to be able to make a living doing something I love."

Tõnis Roche's reputation as a master mechanic soon spread throughout Estonia, drawing clients from all over the country to his humble workshop. And though he never forgot his roots or the joy of tinkering with engines, Tõnis Roche remained humble and dedicated to his craft, always striving to improve and perfect his work. As Aigi drove away in his restored tractor, he knew that he could count on Tõnis Roche to get him back on the road again, whenever he needed it most.
