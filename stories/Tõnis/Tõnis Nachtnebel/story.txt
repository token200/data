Tõnis Nachtnebel, also known as Thomas Nightshade, was a mysterious and elusive figure in Estonian folklore. His name meant "Night Shade" or "Shadow", which suited him perfectly, given his affinity for darkness and the unknown.

Legend had it that Tõnis was once a humble villager who lived on the outskirts of a rural village. However, after stumbling upon an ancient tome hidden deep within the nearby forest, he became consumed by its dark magic. The book, bound in black leather and adorned with strange symbols, revealed to him the secrets of the shadows, allowing him to manipulate darkness and bend it to his will.

As Tõnis delved deeper into the mysteries of the tome, his behavior became increasingly erratic. He would disappear for hours at a time, only to return with an otherworldly glow in his eyes. His fingers began to take on a shadowy quality, as if they were made of the very darkness he had learned to command.

The villagers grew wary of Tõnis, sensing that something was amiss within him. They whispered among themselves about his strange powers and the eerie feeling that he was not quite human anymore. Despite their concerns, no one dared approach him, lest they be drawn into his dark world.

One fateful night, a group of brave villagers decided to confront Tõnis, determined to put an end to his mysterious antics. They snuck up to his cottage, ready to face whatever lay within. However, as soon as they entered the door, they were met with an unrelenting darkness that seemed to suffocate them.

Tõnis appeared before them, his eyes blazing with an ethereal light. With a mere wave of his hand, he conjured up tendrils of shadow that snaked around their ankles, holding them fast. The villagers were paralyzed with fear, unable to move or escape.

As the darkness closed in around him, Tõnis vanished into thin air, leaving behind only a whisper: "Tormas ja ööd" – "Storm and Night". From that day on, the legend of Tõnis Nachtnebel spread throughout Estonia, a cautionary tale about the dangers of meddling with forces beyond human understanding. The villagers whispered that on certain nights, when the moon was new and the wind howled like a wolf, you could still hear Tõnis' eerie voice, summoning forth the shadows to do his bidding.
