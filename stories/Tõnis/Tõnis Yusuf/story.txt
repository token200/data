Tõnis Yusuf sat alone on the edge of his bed, staring blankly at the worn wooden wall. He had always been drawn to the sea, and now, as a young man in exile, he felt it was calling to him once more.

As a member of Estonia's resistance during World War II, Tõnis had played a key role in smuggling anti-German propaganda and helping downed pilots escape. After the war, however, his involvement with the resistance led to a lifetime sentence for treason.

Now, at 35 years old, he was living in exile in Sweden, struggling to find work as a mechanic. His once-sharp mind and quick wit felt muddled by the weight of his past. The loneliness was suffocating, and every night, Tõnis felt like he was drowning under the surface.

But tonight was different. Tonight, as he gazed out at the sea through the small window of his cramped apartment, Tõnis felt a stirring within him. It began with a single thought: "I remember how to sail."

He recalled the summer days spent sailing on Lake Peipus with his siblings, feeling the wind in their hair and the sun on their faces. The memories were hazy, but the sensation of freedom they brought was palpable.

Without thinking, Tõnis stood up and began to pace around the room. He remembered how he had constructed a small wooden boat from scratch as a child, using salvaged materials and scraps. It had been his pride and joy, and now, in this moment, it seemed like a lifeline.

For weeks, Tõnis had been scavenging for parts and materials in the city's workshops and markets. He had managed to gather enough to build a simple but sturdy sailboat, one that he could launch on the lake just outside Stockholm.

As the night wore on, Tõnis made his way down to the docks, determined to bring his vision to life. The stars twinkled above as he pushed his wooden boat into the water, feeling the familiar rush of excitement and purpose. He took a deep breath, knowing that this was his chance to rediscover himself – and set sail for a brighter future.

For Tõnis Yusuf, there would be no turning back now.
