Tõnis Németh was a man shrouded in mystery. His past was a labyrinth of secrets, and he preferred it that way. A Estonian émigré living in Berlin, Tõnis worked as a private investigator, taking on cases that no one else wanted to touch.

His latest assignment came from an anonymous source: a missing person case involving a young woman named Anna. She had disappeared without a trace three weeks ago, leaving behind only a cryptic message on her social media accounts. The client paid Tõnis handsomely to find her before it was too late.

Tõnis arrived at the small café where Anna's phone had last been seen. He ordered a coffee and began asking questions, but everyone seemed evasive. It wasn't until he struck up a conversation with the barista that he got his first real lead: a suspicious individual who had visited the café on the night of Anna's disappearance.

Tõnis spent the rest of the day tracking down the barista's alibi, only to discover that she was hiding something herself. As he pressed her for more information, Tõnis noticed something peculiar - the way her eyes darted towards a small tattoo on her wrist. He recognized it immediately: the same symbol as the one in Anna's message.

Suddenly, pieces began falling into place. The missing person case wasn't just about finding Anna; it was about unraveling a larger conspiracy that had been hiding in plain sight. Tõnis knew he had to act fast - but at what cost? He took a sip of his coffee, lost in thought, as the world outside began to spin faster.

The rain poured down on Berlin's streets like a metaphor for the turmoil brewing inside Tõnis Németh. As the detective delved deeper into the mystery, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched - by someone or something waiting for him to make his next move.
