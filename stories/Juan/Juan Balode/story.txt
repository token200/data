Sofia's eyes lit up with curiosity. "Tell me more about your art, Mr. Balode?" she asked, using her formal title for him.

Juan Pablo chuckled, feeling a sense of ease wash over him. "Please, call me Juan Pablo," he said gently. "I'm not one for formalities."

As they spoke, the city around them pulsed with energy – a symphony of sounds and colors that filled Sofia's heart with joy. In this moment, she knew that Juan Pablo Balode was more than just an artist; he was a guardian of Buenos Aires' soul.
