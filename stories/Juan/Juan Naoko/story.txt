Despite the demands of running a successful business, he remained committed to using only the freshest ingredients and traditional techniques passed down through generations of Japanese bakers.

As he looked out over the bustling streets of Sakura, Juan Naoko knew that he owed it all to the love and support of those who had taught him the art of baking.
