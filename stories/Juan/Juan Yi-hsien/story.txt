Juan Yi-hsien stood at the edge of the bustling street, his eyes scanning the crowded marketplace below. His long black hair was tied back in a neat ponytail, revealing a determined face with high cheekbones and piercing green eyes. As a member of the prestigious Chao family, Juan had always been expected to take on the traditional role of merchant or noble.

But Juan's heart belonged to another path. He had always been fascinated by the stories of the ancient Taiwanese aborigines who roamed the island's rugged wilderness, living in harmony with nature and mastering its secrets. As a young man, he had spent countless hours pouring over dusty tomes in the family library, devouring tales of the Hakka people and their unique culture.

Now, at the age of 25, Juan had finally decided to take a chance on his dreams. He had saved enough gold to purchase a small wooden boat, which he planned to use as a base for exploring the island's hidden waterways and encountering the remnants of Taiwan's indigenous tribes.

As he pondered the best course of action, a gust of wind swept through the market, rustling vendor stalls and scattering fresh produce. Among the chaos, Juan spotted a young woman with striking features and jet-black hair – a member of the Wamai tribe, he realized, known for their exceptional knowledge of medicinal herbs.

Without hesitation, Juan hurried down the steps to approach her. "Hello," he said, bowing respectfully. "I am Juan Yi-hsien. I've been studying the customs of Taiwan's indigenous people and I'm drawn to your... ah, unique features."

The young woman raised an eyebrow but smiled warmly. "My name is Lin, and I sense that you're not just interested in our customs for their own sake," she said with a hint of amusement.

Juan was taken aback by her perceptiveness. He explained his passion for the Hakka people's way of life, and to his surprise, Lin shared her own experiences as a Wamai medicine woman.

For hours, they spoke, exchanging stories and knowledge like old friends. By the time the sun began to set, Juan knew that he had stumbled upon something much greater than just another merchant or noble. He had discovered a community of people who understood him in ways he never thought possible – people who welcomed him with open arms.

As he watched Lin disappear into the crowd, Juan Yi-hsien smiled to himself, knowing that his true journey was only just beginning.
