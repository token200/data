Juan Lemoine was a man of mystery and intrigue, known only by his first name to those who knew him well. A former detective turned private investigator, he had a reputation for being one of the best in the business. His piercing green eyes seemed to bore into the souls of those he met, as if searching for secrets they didn't even know themselves.

Juan Lemoine had been hired by a wealthy socialite to investigate a series of strange occurrences at her mansion on the outskirts of town.
