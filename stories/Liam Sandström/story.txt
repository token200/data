Liam Sandstr√∂m stood at the edge of the frozen lake, the icy wind whipping his dark hair into a frenzy. He gazed out across the expanse of white, his eyes narrowing as he scanned the horizon for any sign of movement.

A Swedish detective with a reputation for being one of the best in the business, Liam had been called to investigate a string of mysterious disappearances in the small town of Kiruna. The locals were spooked, and the police department was stumped.

As Liam's eyes adjusted to the pale light, he spotted something movement out of the corner of his eye. He turned, his gaze following the trajectory of a small bird taking flight across the lake. But as it vanished into the trees on the other side, Liam felt a shiver run down his spine.

He was no fool, but there was something about this case that didn't sit right with him. The victims all seemed to have one thing in common: they'd been out on the lake when they vanished. And the only clue left behind was a small, intricately carved wooden box with a single phrase etched into its lid: "The ice is not always what it seems."

Liam's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps crunching through the snow behind him. He turned to see his partner, Sofia, approaching him with a concerned look on her face.

"Liam, I found something," she said, holding up a small notebook.

As Liam took the notebook from her, his eyes scanned the pages and he felt a jolt of recognition. The notes were taken by one of the missing persons themselves - a young woman named Lena. She'd been a local guide on the lake, and it seemed she'd stumbled upon something that made her go running.

The final entry was dated the day before her disappearance. Liam's eyes widened as he read the words scrawled in hasty handwriting: "I found it. It's not what I expected."

Suddenly, the pieces fell into place for Liam. He remembered a local legend about an ancient tribe that had once inhabited these lands - one that spoke of a hidden world beneath the ice.

Without a word, Liam turned and began to make his way back across the lake, Sofia following closely behind him. As they walked, the silence between them grew thicker than the snow around their feet.

They reached the far shore and began to trudge through the trees, the darkness gathering around them like a living thing. And as they emerged into the bright lights of the town, Liam's eyes locked onto something that made his blood run cold: a wooden box, partially buried in the snow.

The lid was slightly ajar, revealing a message scrawled inside: "The ice is not always what it seems."
