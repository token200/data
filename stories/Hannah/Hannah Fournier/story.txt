Hannah Fournier stepped out of her small apartment and into the crisp morning air, the scent of freshly brewed coffee wafting from the café below. As a freelance writer, she spent most of her days hunched over her laptop, pouring her heart onto the page.

Her latest article was due soon, and Hannah couldn't shake off the feeling of restlessness that had been plaguing her for weeks. She took a deep breath, shouldering her bag, and set off on the short walk to the café.

 Inside, she spotted her friend Emma sipping on a cappuccino by the window. "Hey, Em!" Hannah called out, plopping down beside her. "How's it going?"

Emma smiled warmly. "Just getting some work done, Han." She nodded towards Hannah's laptop. "What's new with you? Any progress on that article?"

Hannah rubbed the back of her neck, feeling a twinge of anxiety. "Nah, still stuck," she admitted. "I just can't seem to get into it."

Emma leaned in, her eyes sparkling with understanding. "Maybe you need a change of scenery?" She gestured towards the park outside. "Why don't we take a walk and clear your head?"

Hannah hesitated for a moment before nodding. As they strolled through the park, the sun casting dappled shadows on the grass, Hannah felt her mind begin to untangle. Ideas started to percolate, like tiny seeds taking root.

"Thanks, Em," she said, feeling a wave of gratitude towards her friend. "I think I needed that."

Back at the café, Emma pressed Hannah with questions about her article, but this time, Hannah was ready. The words began to flow, like water pouring from a faucet, and before long, she had written a solid draft.

As she packed up her things to head home, Hannah couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment wash over her. She was grateful for the break, and for friends like Emma who knew just what to say to get her creative juices flowing once more. And as she walked back into her apartment, laptop open, ready to tackle whatever came next, she smiled to herself – Hannah Fournier was on a roll.
