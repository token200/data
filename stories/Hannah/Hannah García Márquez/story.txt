One day, Hannah received a call from her editor, begging her to investigate a series of strange occurrences in the city's poorer neighborhoods. Rumors had been circulating about a mysterious figure, known only as "La Llorona," who was said to appear at night, weeping and wailing for unknown victims.

Despite her growing unease, Hannah refused to drop the story. She was determined to get to the bottom of the mystery, and she was convinced that La Llorona was more than just a myth. As she dug deeper, she began to uncover a web of corruption and deceit that went all the way to the top of the city's government.
