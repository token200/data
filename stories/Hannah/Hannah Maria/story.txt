Hannah Maria had always been fascinated by the world of art. As a child, she would spend hours sketching and painting, lost in her own little world of color and creativity. As she grew older, her passion only intensified, and she went on to study fine art at college.

After graduating, Hannah Maria began working as an intern at a small gallery in the city. She was tasked with organizing exhibitions and helping artists prepare their work for show.

Her reputation as a rising star in the art world began to spread, and she found herself being sought after by collectors and galleries alike.

One day, the gallery owner approached Hannah Maria with an offer that would change her life forever. He wanted her to curate an exhibition featuring her own work, alongside some of the most talented artists in the city.
