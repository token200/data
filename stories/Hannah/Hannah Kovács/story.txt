Hannah Kovács stepped into the old café, its wooden floor creaking beneath her feet. The dim lighting and aroma of freshly brewed coffee transported her to a bygone era. As she waited for her friend, Mária, she noticed a peculiar poster on the wall: "Wanted: Storytellers."

Just then, Mária walked in, flashing a bright smile. "Hannah Kovács, I knew you'd be here! Come try some of this famous paprika cake." The cake was indeed heavenly, and they spent the next hour engrossed in conversation.

As they sipped their coffee, Hannah couldn't help but wonder about the story behind that poster. Who could have created it? What secrets were hidden within those pages?

Just then, a frail old woman with wispy grey hair walked into the café. She introduced herself as Éva, and explained that she was indeed one of the storytellers they had seen advertised.

Éva began to speak in hushed tones about the art of collecting tales from the people around her. "I've spent my life gathering stories, just like you," Hannah said to Mária, eyes shining with excitement.

Éva nodded knowingly. "Ah, yes! Some of us have an innate gift for listening and weaving words into magic."

Mária chuckled. "And now, Éva is going to share one of her famous tales with us!"

As the old woman began to speak, Hannah felt as though she was transported to a different world. The room melted away, leaving only the soft glow of candles, the flickering flames dancing on the walls.

Hannah Kovács listened in awe as Éva wove her tale, entranced by the whimsical language and vivid imagery. When the story finally came to an end, she felt rejuvenated, invigorated by the creative energy that had been unleashed before them all.

With a final smile, Hannah turned to Mária and whispered, "That was truly enchanting."
