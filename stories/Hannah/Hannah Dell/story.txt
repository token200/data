Hannah Dell stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the city as the sun set behind her. She took a deep breath, feeling the cool breeze fill her lungs and clear her mind. This was her sanctuary, a place where she could escape the chaos of her life.

As a successful event planner, Hannah had always been driven by her passion for bringing people together. But it came at a cost – she had few true friends and often found herself surrounded by acquaintances who only called when they needed something from her.

Tonight was different, though. Tonight was about closure. Her best friend, Emma, had passed away just a year ago, leaving Hannah feeling lost and alone. Since then, she had thrown herself into her work and tried to distract herself from the pain.

But as she stood there on the rooftop, watching the city lights twinkle to life below her, Hannah realized that it wasn't working. The emptiness inside her was still there, and it seemed to be growing louder by the day.

Just then, a gentle touch on her shoulder made her jump. She turned to see an old friend, Jack, standing beside her with a sympathetic smile.

"I saw you were coming here tonight," he said quietly, as if afraid to break the spell of the moment. "I wanted to make sure I wasn't interrupting anything."

Hannah shook her head, feeling a lump form in her throat. "Just needed some space," she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper.

Jack nodded understandingly and leaned against the railing beside her. They stood there for a while in silence, watching as the stars began to twinkle overhead.

Finally, Jack spoke up. "You know, I've been thinking – maybe it's time you took a break from all this planning business," he said with a sly grin. "Maybe you need some time just for yourself."

Hannah raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean?"

"I mean, Emma would want you to be happy," Jack said softly. "She'd tell you to take risks and follow your heart – not just about weddings and parties, but about life itself."

Something in Hannah's chest shifted at his words. Maybe it was time to listen to her own heartbeat for once. Maybe it was time to start living, rather than just existing.

As the city lights shone on below them, Hannah Dell took a deep breath and smiled, feeling the weight of her loneliness slowly lift.
