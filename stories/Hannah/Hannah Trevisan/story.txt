Hannah Trevisan had always been drawn to the world of art. As a child, she would spend hours sketching and painting, lost in her own little world of color and creativity. Growing up in a small town in Italy, Hannah's talent was encouraged by her family, who owned a quaint little shop filled with handmade crafts.

As Hannah grew older, her passion for art only intensified.
