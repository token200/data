Hannah Davies stood at the edge of the cliff, her toes curled over the rugged stone as she gazed out at the crashing waves below. The wind whipped through her dark hair, whipping it into a frenzy as she breathed in the salty air. It was moments like these that she felt most alive.

As a child, Hannah had always been drawn to the ocean's power and mystery. She spent hours exploring the tide pools and hidden coves along the coast, searching for secrets and stories locked away beneath the waves. Her parents had encouraged her fascination, taking her on long walks and camping trips to explore the rugged coastline.

Now, as a young adult, Hannah was still captivated by the ocean's rhythms and moods. She spent her days working at the local marine research center, studying the creatures that lived in the waters off the coast. Her colleagues called her "the tide goddess" for her intuitive understanding of the tides and the ways they influenced the marine life.

But it was when she was out on her own, out in the open water, that Hannah felt most free. She loved to sail solo, feeling the wind and waves beneath her feet as she charted her course through the misty veil of dawn or the stormy veil of dusk.

Tonight, however, was different. Tonight, Hannah had set a special plan in motion – one that she knew would change the course of her life forever. She felt a thrill of excitement mixed with trepidation as she checked her watch for what felt like the hundredth time.

At exactly 8pm, the tide began to shift, carrying with it the faint sound of whalesong carried on the wind. Hannah's heart skipped a beat as she realized that tonight was the night – the one she had been waiting for months to take place. She took a deep breath, feeling the ocean spray wet her lips and the moonlight brighten her eyes.

With a quiet smile, Hannah slipped into the darkness, ready to embark on the next chapter of her journey.
