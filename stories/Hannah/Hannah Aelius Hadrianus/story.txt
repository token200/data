In the scorching desert city of Palmyra, a young apprentice named Hannah Aelius Hadrianus toiled away in the shadows, learning the intricacies of ancient magic from the revered sorceress, Ariana. With an unyielding passion for the mystical arts, Hannah had spent countless hours poring over dusty tomes and practicing spells beneath the starry night sky.

As she delved deeper into her studies, Hannah's prowess grew, and whispers began to circulate about the prodigious apprentice. Her mentor, Ariana, smiled knowingly whenever the young woman's name was mentioned in hushed tones.

One fateful evening, as the sun dipped into the dunes, a group of robed figures arrived at Ariana's humble abode, their faces shrouded in an air of mystery. They bore an invitation from the enigmatic leader of the mystical order, Erebus – an entity rumored to wield powers beyond the comprehension of mortal men.

Ariana, sensing the weight of the moment, presented Hannah Aelius Hadrianus as a worthy representative of her craft. With a nod of approval, Erebus extended his own hand, bestowing upon Hannah a small, ornate box adorned with cryptic symbols. As she took hold of the box, an electric jolt coursed through her veins – a spark that ignited within her an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and power.
