However, not everyone was pleased with Hannah's progress. The CEO of the firm, a wealthy and well-connected individual named Marcus Thompson, had caught wind of her investigation and was determined to silence her.

But Hannah was not easily intimidated. She knew that she had done nothing wrong, and she was confident that the truth would ultimately come out. As she continued to work on her story, Hannah's colleagues at the news organization began to rally around her, offering their support and expertise.
