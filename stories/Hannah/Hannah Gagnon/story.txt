Hannah Gagnon was a free-spirited artist with a passion for painting and exploring the world's hidden gems. Born in Quebec, Canada, to a family of artists, she grew up surrounded by colors, textures, and creativity. As a child, Hannah spent hours watching her parents work on their latest projects, mesmerized by the way they could transform ordinary objects into masterpieces.
