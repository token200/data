The store's owner, an elderly woman named Sophia, welcomed Hannah with open arms and introduced herself as someone who shared similar passions for art and literature. Over steaming cups of coffee, they discussed everything from their favorite authors to the intricacies of color theory.

Sophia was immediately drawn to Hannah's infectious energy and encouraged her to exhibit her work in the store. And so, Hannah Wisniewska found herself showcasing her vibrant paintings amidst shelves of dusty classics.
