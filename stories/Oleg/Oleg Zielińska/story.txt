As he grew older, Oleg's passion for music only intensified. He spent countless hours practicing, perfecting his technique and learning new compositions. His dedication paid off when he was invited to join "Mątowicz" as a young man. The band's leader, Paweł Mątowski, was impressed by Oleg's raw talent and took him under his wing.

His ability to weave together traditional Polish melodies with modern flair earned them a loyal following among folk music enthusiasts.
