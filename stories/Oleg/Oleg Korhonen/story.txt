Oleg Korhonen stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the familiar surroundings. It had been twenty years since he'd last set foot in Helsinki, Finland, but it still felt like home.

As a child, Oleg had spent summers with his grandparents in this small town on the outskirts of the city. They'd sit by the lake, watching the fish swim lazily beneath the surface, and listening to the sounds of nature. It was there that he'd developed a love for woodworking, teaching himself the intricacies of traditional Finnish craftsmanship.

Years later, Oleg had left to explore the world beyond his hometown. He'd worked as a carpenter in Sweden, then started his own business in Los Angeles, crafting bespoke furniture pieces from reclaimed wood. But something had been missing – the connection to his heritage, the sense of community that came with working with his hands and creating something beautiful.

Now, Oleg had returned to Helsinki, determined to rebuild his life and reconnect with the roots he'd left behind. He'd inherited a small workshop from his grandfather, and was planning to reopen it as a way to preserve traditional Finnish craftsmanship while also forging his own path.

As he walked through the quiet streets, Oleg felt a sense of belonging wash over him. The familiar scents of freshly baked bread and roasting coffee filled his nostrils, transporting him back to his childhood. He stopped at the local market, haggling with vendors over prices for fresh cedar and birch bark. The sounds of laughter and conversation swirled around him – a language he knew intimately.

Back in his workshop, Oleg began to measure out the wood for a new project, his hands moving instinctively as if guided by a sense of memory rather than skill. He envisioned the finished piece – a sturdy wooden bench with intricate carvings of leaves and vines, reminiscent of the ones his grandfather used to make.

Oleg's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of hammering on the other side of the workshop door. It was Kristiina, an old friend from school, who'd dropped by to check in. Together, they sat on stools beside the workbench, sipping coffee and chatting about their lives – Oleg telling her stories of his time in LA, Kristiina sharing tales of her latest travels.

In this quiet moment, surrounded by the sights and smells of home, Oleg felt a sense of peace settle over him. He knew that he still had much to learn, but for now, he was exactly where he needed to be – rekindling old connections, forging new paths, and honoring the traditions of his past.
