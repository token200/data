Oleg Nieminen stepped off the crowded train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the dimly lit station. It was a small town in the middle of nowhere, the kind of place where everyone knew everyone's name and nothing ever changed. Oleg wasn't here to stay, but he had been lured back by an old acquaintance.

As he walked through the station, the familiar face of Kari, the owner of the local caf√©, greeted him with a warm smile. "Oleg, long time no see! Come for a visit?"

Oleg hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. He hadn't been back in years, and his past was... complicated. But something about the quiet, unassuming town had drawn him back, like a moth to a flame.

Over coffee and a plate of Kari's famous karjalanpiirakka, Oleg filled her in on the details of his life: the job, the apartment, the string of failed relationships. It was a litany of disappointments, but as he spoke, something shifted inside him. Maybe it was the genuine interest from someone who knew him before all that had fallen apart.

As they chatted, Oleg noticed a stranger lingering on the periphery of their conversation. A young woman with an enigmatic gaze and hair that seemed to shift like the shadows themselves. She caught his eye once, twice, but quickly looked away, as if hesitant to be seen.

Oleg's curiosity piqued, he excused himself from Kari's company and followed the stranger out of the station. They walked side by side through the deserted streets, not speaking a word until they reached the old windmill on the outskirts of town.

The woman turned to him, her eyes like pools of darkness. "You're looking for something, Oleg."

He shrugged, feeling a thrill of fear and anticipation. "Maybe just someone who knows me before all that fell apart."

Her lips curled into a faint smile. "I think I can help you with that."

In the windmill's creaky silence, the two strangers began to unravel the tangled threads of Oleg's past, the enigmatic woman leading him further down the rabbit hole than he'd ever intended.
