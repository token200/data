Oleg Larsson stood alone on the worn wooden dock, his eyes fixed on the horizon where the Baltic Sea met the gray sky. It was a moment he had always savored, one that brought him peace and solace from the chaos of his life.

As Oleg Larsson, the 45-year-old former engineer, had lost his job six months prior due to company restructuring, he found himself wandering the streets of Stockholm, trying to make sense of it all. His marriage had been on shaky ground for years, and now with a dwindling bank account, it seemed like the final nail in the coffin.

But as he gazed out at the water, Oleg Larsson felt a spark of determination ignite within him. He thought back to his childhood, spent along this very coast, where his father had taught him the art of sailmaking and woodworking. His hands moved instinctively to the pocket watch chain dangling from his waistcoat pocket, a gift from his grandfather before he passed away.

A gust of wind swept across the water, sending ripples through the waves. Oleg Larsson took a deep breath, feeling the cool air fill his lungs, and began to walk along the dock's edge. He pondered what lay ahead – starting anew, maybe even taking up one of his old hobbies again like sailing or woodworking.

His phone buzzed in his pocket; it was his wife, calling to discuss their living arrangements. Oleg Larsson hesitated before answering, knowing that this conversation might be the final straw for their relationship. He put on a calm demeanor and listened intently as she outlined her new plans – relocating to Malmö for work.

As he ended the call, Oleg Larsson felt his resolve harden. No more would he be bound by the expectations of others or caged in his own doubts. Today marked the beginning of something new; today was a chance for him to forge his own path as Oleg Larsson, unshackled from the weights of his past.
