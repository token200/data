Oleg Maria stepped out of the misty rain and into the warm glow of the café. He took a seat at the counter, running a hand through his damp hair as he waited for his drink to arrive. The barista, a friendly woman with a pierced nose, greeted him with a smile.

"Hey, Oleg Maria! Your usual coffee, right?" she asked, expertly brewing a shot of espresso.

Oleg nodded, digging into his jacket pocket for the cash. "Yeah, please."

As he waited, he pulled out his phone and checked the time. He had a meeting with a potential client in an hour, and he still needed to review their presentation one last time. Oleg Maria took a deep breath, mentally preparing himself for the pitch.

The barista slid his coffee across the counter, and Oleg took a sip, feeling the caffeine kick in. It was just what he needed to shake off the morning fog.

As he sat there, people-watching, Oleg couldn't help but notice the eclectic crowd that filled the café. There were artists huddled over sketchbooks, students typing away on their laptops, and tourists sipping lattes with their faces buried in guidebooks.

Oleg Maria finished his coffee, set the cup down, and stood up to leave. He was already running late for his meeting, but he couldn't shake off the feeling that this was going to be a good day. Maybe it was the caffeine, or maybe it was just his intuition, but he had a gut feeling about this client.

He took one last glance at the crowded café before slipping out into the rain-soaked streets. As he disappeared into the mist, the barista called after him, "Break a leg, Oleg Maria!"

Oleg chuckled to himself as he quickened his pace. He was ready for whatever lay ahead – and with his presentation review complete, he felt confident that he could close this deal. The city streets blurred together as he walked, but one thing remained clear: Oleg Maria was on fire today.
