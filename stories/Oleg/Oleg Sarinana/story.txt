Oleg Pavlovich Sarinana was a man shrouded in mystery. Few people knew much about him, except that he was a master of disguise and deception. A former spy for the KGB, Oleg had spent years honing his skills of infiltration and manipulation. After defecting to the West, he had begun working as a freelance consultant, using his talents to help corporations and individuals navigate the complex world of international espionage.

One day, Oleg received a cryptic message from an old acquaintance, requesting his presence at a high-stakes poker game in Monte Carlo. The invitation was clear: come alone, and be prepared for anything. Oleg arrived at the luxurious casino, his eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. He spotted his contact, a woman with piercing green eyes, sitting at a table near the bar.

As he approached, she stood up, her smile flashing in the dim light. "Oleg Sarinana," she purred, extending a manicured hand. "It's been too long." Oleg took the hand, feeling an electric spark as their palms touched.

The game began, with players from all over the world vying for the top prize. Oleg played it cool, his eyes darting between opponents as he expertly read their tells. But beneath the surface, he was on high alert, sensing that something was off. The stakes were higher than anyone let on, and Oleg's instincts told him to get out while he still could.

As the night wore on, Oleg found himself at a mental standoff with the woman, who seemed to be playing a game of her own. He knew better than to trust his instincts alone; he needed concrete evidence before taking any action. That's when he spotted it – a tiny tattoo on her wrist, shaped like a snake eating its tail.

A sign of membership in an exclusive organization, Oleg thought, his mind racing with possibilities. This was no ordinary poker game; this was a recruitment effort, and Oleg Sarinana had just become the target. With that realization, he knew it was time to make his exit – and to regroup for the next move in his ongoing cat-and-mouse game with those who sought to control him.
