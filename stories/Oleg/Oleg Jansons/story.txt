Oleg Jansons, a former KGB agent turned high-stakes art dealer, sat behind his sleek, black desk, sipping a whiskey as he surveyed the latest addition to his collection. The rare Picasso, acquired through "negotiations" with a prominent Russian oligarch, sparkled in the soft light of the evening.

It was a chilly Moscow night, and Oleg's thoughts turned to the memories he'd made on this very same streets when he first joined the KGB. He recalled the thrill of infiltration, the rush of adrenaline as he outmaneuvered his targets. But that chapter of his life had ended with a dramatic explosion - literally - at a meeting with a CIA agent in a Berlin nightclub.

Oleg took another sip of his drink, feeling the burn down his throat. His past life was far behind him now. Art was where it was at, and he'd built an empire from scratch. The rarefied world of high art collecting had become his playground, where he played with giants like the oligarchs.

But Oleg's reputation came with a price. People whispered that he could buy secrets as easily as he bought paintings. And buy him out were the whispers that accompanied any hint of trouble. He'd made connections with powerful people, and for now, it was enough.

As the clock struck midnight, the lights dimmed, and Oleg's assistant ushered in a young woman who introduced herself as Sofia. She had something he wanted - a rare, ancient artifact from the Caucasus Mountains that might fetch a small fortune on the black market. Oleg listened intently as she outlined her story: a treasure passed down through generations of her family, with legends claiming it held the power to change fortunes.

Oleg's eyes narrowed. Power? Change fortunes? He was intrigued. A game like this was what got him out of bed in the morning. With just two words - "Name" and "Price" - Oleg set Sofia on the path to securing the artifact, paving the way for a lucrative opportunity that would leave his art collection richer than ever.

Oleg raised the glass to his lips once more, the fire burning within him intensifying as he contemplated the next move. In this world of intrigue, deception, and deals made in shadows, there was always room for one more step forward - into the night.
