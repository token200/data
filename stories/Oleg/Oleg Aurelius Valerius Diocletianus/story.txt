In the scorching desert of Roman Africa, Oleg Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus trudged through the sand, his worn sandals sinking into the dunes. As a former soldier and now a humble merchant, he had grown accustomed to the harsh conditions. His eyes scanned the horizon for any sign of the oasis he sought, a haven from the blistering sun.

As he walked, Oleg's mind wandered back to his life before the desert. Born into a family of modest means, he had risen through the ranks to become a respected officer in the Roman army. But after years of service, he had grown disillusioned with the politics and bloodshed that seemed to drive emperors like himself – Oleg Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus.

Despite his reservations, Oleg had remained loyal to Rome, earning the respect of his comrades and superiors alike. Yet, when Emperor Constantine had appointed him as a regional governor, Oleg had been ambivalent at best. The responsibility was too great, the weight of decisions too crushing.

Now, as he navigated the unforgiving landscape, Oleg felt a sense of liberation wash over him. He was no longer bound by the duties and expectations that had weighed him down for so long. His merchant's cart, laden with goods from all corners of the empire, would carry him where he pleased – or at least, as far as the desert could take him.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the dunes, Oleg spotted an inviting cluster of palms in the distance. With renewed energy, he quickened his pace, feeling the stress and anxiety of his former life slowly seeping away with each step. He would find rest and respite here, surrounded by the beauty and solitude of the desert.

As he approached the oasis, Oleg Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus smiled to himself, feeling a sense of peace he had not known in years. The name "Diocletianus" still echoed within him, a reminder of his past life, but it no longer held the same weight – or authority. In this desert haven, Oleg was free to be himself, unencumbered by the expectations of others.
