Oleg Salvini stepped into the dimly lit room, his eyes adjusting to the warm glow of the candles scattered across the wooden table. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the scent of old books and worn leather. He took a seat, running his hands over the intricate carvings on the chair's arms.

As he waited for his contact, Oleg couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. His reputation as a skilled thief had preceded him, and he knew that not everyone was eager to share information with him. The door creaked open, and a figure emerged from the shadows.

"Rosa," Oleg said, using her pseudonym, his voice low and smooth.

Rosa's eyes locked onto Oleg's, assessing him before nodding in greeting. "Oleg Salvini. I've heard a lot about you."

"I'm sure it's all... exaggerated," Oleg replied, a hint of amusement dancing on his lips.

Rosa chuckled, her expression softening. "Let's just say I have a certain interest in your particular set of skills."

Oleg raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "And what makes you think I'm the man for the job?"

The air was thick with tension as Rosa revealed her proposal: a priceless artifact hidden within the city's most heavily guarded museum. The catch? It required Oleg's unique expertise to extract without triggering any alarms.

Oleg sipped his coffee, weighing the risks and rewards. He knew that taking on such a high-stakes mission would mean putting himself in harm's way. But the allure of the artifact was too great to resist.

"I'm listening," he said finally, his voice firm.

Rosa nodded, producing a small device from her bag. "I have all the details right here. The museum's security system will be upgraded next week; that's our window."

As Oleg examined the data on the device, his mind began to whir with strategy and potential escape routes. This was going to be a challenge unlike any he'd faced before.

When he looked up at Rosa, her eyes seemed to gleam in the dim light. "I knew I could count on you," she said.

Oleg smiled, a cold glint in his eye. "Let's just say I'm always happy to oblige."

With a nod, Oleg stood, the artifact's promise burning within him like a fire. This was going to be a night he wouldn't soon forget.
