Oleg Thompson stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station. He had been away for months, working as a freelance journalist in Moscow, and was now returning to London for good. The chill of the British autumn air hit him like a slap in the face, a welcome change from the sweltering summer heat of Eastern Europe.

As he made his way through customs, Oleg's mind wandered back to the stories he had written while abroad. His byline had appeared on several major outlets, and he was starting to make a name for himself as a foreign correspondent. But it wasn't just the recognition that drew him home – it was the sense of unease he'd developed about his work.

In Moscow, Oleg had noticed the ever-present feeling of surveillance. Every move seemed to be monitored, every word counted. He'd grown to loathe the idea of being a pawn in someone else's game, and London offered a chance to break free from that cycle.

Oleg hailed a taxi on the street outside the station and gave the driver the address of his flat in Hackney. As they sped through the city streets, he caught glimpses of familiar landmarks – the bright lights of Camden Market, the imposing stone façade of the British Museum. It was as if coming home had brought with it a newfound sense of belonging.

When Oleg arrived at his flat, he was greeted by an unassuming package on the doorstep. No note or indication of who it was from, but inside, he found a worn leather notebook filled with handwritten notes and cryptic messages. His mind racing, he scanned the pages for any sign of meaning – but they were blank.

A chill ran down his spine as he turned the final page, revealing a single phrase scrawled in bold letters: "You're not who you think you are." Oleg's journalist instincts told him this was more than just a prank – it was a message from someone with an ulterior motive. He knew that the life of a foreign correspondent wasn't without its risks, but he had no idea what lay ahead.

With the notebook still clutched in his hand, Oleg settled onto the couch and lit a cigarette. As he watched the smoke curl towards the ceiling, he couldn't shake the feeling that his return to London was only the beginning of a new story – one he wasn't quite ready to tell just yet.
