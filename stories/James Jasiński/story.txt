James Jasi≈Ñski, or "The Hammer" as he was known in the underworld, sat at his desk, staring blankly at the photo in front of him. It was an old picture of himself and his late wife, Sophia, taken on their wedding day.

It had been five years since her passing, but the pain still lingered. He had lost count of how many times he'd relived that moment, replaying it over in his mind like a broken record.

As a hitman, James had seen and done things no one should ever have to experience. The weight of his conscience was crushing at times, but he knew what needed to be done. He was the best in the business, feared by those who deserved it.

But today wasn't about work. Today was a day for reflection. James took a deep breath and let his gaze wander around the room. His modest apartment was filled with mementos of Sophia - family photos, love letters, even her favorite perfume. It was all here, reminders of what he had lost.

He heard a knock at the door and stood up to answer it. On the other side was Jack, an old acquaintance from his hitman days. Jack was a rough man with a heart of gold, and James knew that if anyone could help him get through this tough time, it would be him.

"What's on your mind, Jase?" Jack asked as he walked in.

"Just feeling stuck, I guess," James replied, gesturing for Jack to take a seat. "It's been five years since Sophia left us, and I still feel like I'm walking around with a hole in my stomach."

Jack nodded sympathetically. "You know, I've seen you do some terrible things over the years, but I never thought you were capable of taking it so hard on yourself."

James shook his head. "I'm not capable of feeling anything else when it comes to Sophia. She was everything to me - my reason for being."

They sat in silence for a moment before Jack spoke up again.

"You know what they say, Jase - the only way to get over someone is to move on and start living again. It's easy enough to say, but I'm not sure you're ready to do that just yet."

James looked at him with a hint of desperation in his eyes. "I want to move on, Jack. But it's hard when all I can think about is what could've been."

Jack placed a comforting hand on James' shoulder.

"I know it's going to take time, but maybe we can help you start moving forward.
