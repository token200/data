Ito Morgan stepped off the train and onto the platform, gazing out at the misty dawn breaking over the city. It was a familiar sight, one that never failed to fill him with a sense of melancholy. He had always loved this place, but it seemed to grow more somber with each passing year.

As he made his way through the station, Ito's eyes scanned the crowds for a glimpse of the person who had been waiting for him. His sister, Lena, had sent word that her friend was in town and wanted to meet up. Ito wasn't sure what to make of it - they hadn't spoken in years.

He spotted a young woman with striking features - piercing green eyes and jet-black hair - sitting on a bench, sipping a coffee. There was something about her that looked... familiar. Ito's heart skipped a beat as he approached her.

"Rachel?" she said, looking up at him with an uncertainty in her gaze.

Ito nodded, still trying to wrap his head around the sudden reunion. "It's been ages."

They sat down on the bench together, and for a while, there was no need for words. The city bustled around them, but they were lost in their own little world. As the sun rose higher in the sky, Ito finally found his voice.

"What brings you here?" he asked Rachel.

She smiled wistfully. "I came to tell you that I'm leaving."

Leaving? What did she mean?

"I'm moving to Tokyo," she said flatly. "Starting a new life."

The words hit Ito like a slap in the face. He had never thought of her as leaving, only as his constant companion - someone who had been by his side since childhood.

Ito looked at Rachel with newfound understanding. They sat there for a while longer, watching the city wake up around them. Eventually, they stood up and started walking, hand in hand, into an uncertain future.

As they vanished into the crowd, Ito Morgan felt something stirring within him - a spark of hope that had been dormant for years. Maybe this was what he needed - someone to push him out of his comfort zone and show him that there was more to life than just sitting around feeling sorry for himself.

Together, they walked off into the unknown, leaving their past behind them like a ghostly apparition in the misty dawn light.
