Ito Krūmiņš was known for his unorthodox approach to magic. While many wizards adhered to traditional spellbooks and incantations, Ito preferred to rely on his intuition and observation skills. He spent countless hours studying the movements of the stars, the patterns of nature, and the behavior of animals in order to understand the underlying forces that governed the universe.

One day, a young apprentice named Jānis arrived at Ito's tower seeking guidance. Jānis was struggling with his own magical abilities, unable to cast even the simplest spells without causing unintended consequences. Ito Krūmiņš listened attentively as Jānis described his troubles, nodding thoughtfully and making occasional notes in his worn leather journal.

"I think I know what your problem is," Ito said finally, his eyes twinkling with insight. "You're trying too hard to control the magic. You need to learn to listen to it, rather than forcing it to obey you."

Jānis looked skeptical, but Ito continued undeterred. "Come with me," he said, beckoning Jānis to follow him outside into the forest. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the songs of birds as they walked along a winding path. Ito stopped at a clearing and gestured for Jānis to watch.

A small rabbit darted across the clearing, its movements swift and unpredictable. Ito Krūmiņš smiled as he observed the creature's actions. "See how it moves?" he asked Jānis. "It's not thinking about the path ahead of it – it's simply responding to the world around it."

Jānis watched in fascination as Ito demonstrated a series of subtle gestures, his own movements mirroring those of the rabbit. Suddenly, a small sprig of herbs fell from the air and landed at Jānis' feet. "It's like that with magic," Ito explained. "We need to learn to respond to it, rather than trying to control it."

As the sun began to set, casting a warm golden light over the forest, Ito Krūmiņš turned to Jānis and smiled. "I think you're starting to understand," he said. And with that, the young apprentice's eyes lit up with newfound insight, ready to embark on his own journey of discovery under the guidance of Ito Krūmiņš.
