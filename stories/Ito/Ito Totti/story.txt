I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease as I walked into the small, dimly lit café. It was a place where time seemed to stand still, and the only sound was the soft hum of conversation from the patrons. My name is Akira, and this was the one place in town where I could escape the prying eyes of my village.

As I waited for Totti to arrive, my thoughts drifted back to our last encounter. He had been distant that day, his usual spark missing. I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was bothering him. Little did I know, today would be no different.

The door swung open, and in walked a figure shrouded in shadows. Totti's eyes scanned the room, locking onto mine with an intensity that made my heart skip a beat. He slid into the booth across from me, his movements economical and controlled.

"Ito Totti," he said, his voice low and gravelly, sending a shiver down my spine.

I nodded, trying to compose myself. "Totti-san."

He didn't speak for a moment, his gaze piercing mine like ice picks. Then, in a movement that seemed almost...human, he reached across the table and gently brushed a strand of hair from my forehead.

"Your eyes are haunted," he said softly, his words dripping with an understanding I couldn't quite grasp.

I felt a lump form in my throat as memories flooded back – the pain, the loss, the weight of secrets kept hidden. Totti knew me better than anyone, but even he didn't know everything.

Without another word, he stood and offered me a hand up from the booth. Together, we walked out of the café into the crisp evening air. The stars twinkled above, their light barely piercing the darkness that seemed to be closing in around us.

As we strolled through the village, Totti's silence became almost palpable. I sensed him weighing his words carefully, choosing them with precision and care. It was a skill he'd honed over years of carrying secrets and lies, but tonight, for some reason, it felt like an act of selflessness.

Eventually, we found ourselves at the edge of town, where the forest loomed like a presence waiting to swallow us whole. Totti stopped, his eyes gleaming in the moonlight.

"We have to be careful," he whispered, his voice barely audible over the rustling of leaves. "Not everyone knows our secrets."

I nodded, knowing that even with him by my side, the world was full of mysteries and dangers waiting to pounce.
