Ito Haruko sat in the small café, sipping on her coffee and staring out the window at the rainy street below. She was waiting for her friend, Ito Mustermann, who was running late as usual.

As she checked her watch for what felt like the hundredth time, the door to the café swung open and Mustermann strode in, his bright yellow raincoat a stark contrast to the drizzly weather outside. He spotted Haruko and smiled, waving enthusiastically at her table.

"Sorry I'm late!" he exclaimed, plopping down into the chair across from her. "Traffic was a nightmare!"

Haruko raised an eyebrow good-naturedly. "Mustermann, you know it's always bad traffic on Fridays," she teased. "But I'll forgive you this time... for now."

The two friends chatted and laughed together, catching up on each other's lives as they sipped their coffee and nibbled on pastries. Mustermann regaled Haruko with stories of his latest business venture – a small startup focused on sustainable energy solutions.

"Ito Mustermann is going to be a millionaire by the end of the year!" he declared, his eyes shining with excitement. "Mark my words!"

Haruko smiled warmly at her friend, impressed as ever by his drive and determination. She knew that beneath his boisterous exterior lay a kind and thoughtful person who genuinely cared about making a positive impact on the world.

As they finished their coffee and prepared to part ways, Haruko leaned over and gave Mustermann a gentle nudge. "Hey, Ito Mustermann?" she said softly.

He looked up at her, his expression curious. "Yes?"

"You know, sometimes I worry that you're spreading yourself too thin," Haruko said gently. "But then I see the passion in your eyes when you talk about your business, and I realize it's all worth it."

Mustermann smiled, his face softening with gratitude. "Thanks, Haruko. That means a lot coming from you." He stood up, brushing off his raincoat, and turned to make his way out of the café.

As Haruko watched him go, she felt a warmth in her chest that had nothing to do with the coffee they'd shared. She knew that their friendship – and Mustermann's unwavering dedication to his dreams – was something truly special.
