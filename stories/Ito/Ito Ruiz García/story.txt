I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Ito Ruiz García. It's possible that this person is not well-known or doesn't exist in popular culture.

If you'd like, I can create a new story with a character of your choosing. Alternatively, if you have any specific details or traits about the character Ito Ruiz García, I may be able to help you write a story around them.

However, if you are referring to Ito Ruifuku García (also known as "Itzcoatl Tonatiuh Ruifuku") also known as "García", Itzcoatl being the Aztec god of water and a Nahuatl name meaning "Lord Water" this is my response 

Garcia was a quiet but fiercely determined individual who had grown up on the streets of Mexico City. As a member of an indigenous community, he had always felt like an outsider in his own city. His days were spent scrounging for scraps and avoiding the authorities.

One day, while rummaging through a dumpster, Garcia stumbled upon a mysterious book hidden amongst the trash. The cover was worn and dusty, but as he opened it, he discovered that the pages were filled with ancient Nahuatl texts.

As he delved deeper into the book, Garcia realized that he had a connection to his people's past. He felt an inexplicable sense of pride and belonging, knowing that he was carrying on the traditions of his ancestors.

Determined to learn more, Garcia spent every waking moment studying the book and practicing the rituals described within its pages. His skills improved dramatically, and soon, he became known among the community as a healer and spiritual leader.

Word of Garcia's abilities spread quickly, and people from all over the city began seeking him out for guidance and healing. Despite his newfound fame, Garcia remained humble and grounded, always remembering where he came from.

Years went by, and Garcia continued to grow in power and wisdom. He became a respected elder in his community, using his gifts to help those in need and fight against injustice.

As the sun set over Mexico City, Garcia would sit on the rooftop of his small home, gazing out at the stars and feeling grateful for the mysterious book that had changed his life forever.
