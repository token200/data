Ito Mikhailov was a mysterious figure, shrouded in secrecy and intrigue. A brilliant cryptologist by trade, he had spent years studying the intricacies of codes and ciphers. His latest obsession was an enigmatic puzzle known only as "The Phoenix Code," rumored to hold the key to unlocking unimaginable power.

Rumors swirled about Ito Mikhailov's past, with some claiming he was once a high-ranking spy or assassin. Others whispered that he possessed a unique gift for deciphering even the most complex codes.
