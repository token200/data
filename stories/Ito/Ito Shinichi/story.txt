Ito Shinichi sat alone in his small Tokyo apartment, staring blankly at the TV as it played an endless loop of news coverage. The rain poured down outside, casting a gloomy shadow over the city. It was moments like these that Ito Shinichi preferred to spend indoors, lost in his own thoughts.

As a detective, he had seen his fair share of darkness and despair. But as a person, he struggled with his own demons. The loss of his partner, Wataru, still weighed heavily on him, and the case they had worked on together, the Kirishima murders, was still haunting him.

Ito Shinichi's eyes drifted to the photograph on his mantlepiece – a picture of him and Wataru standing proudly in front of their office building. It was taken just before the murders took place, a time when everything seemed bright and full of promise. Now, the two men were gone, leaving behind only memories.

Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. Ito Shinichi's heart skipped a beat as he got up to answer it. It was an unknown woman, drenched from the rain and shivering with cold. She introduced herself as a journalist, looking for him to discuss his connection to the Kirishima murders.

Ito Shinichi hesitated at first, unsure if he wanted to revisit the past. But something about the woman's determination struck a chord within him. He agreed to talk, and for the next few hours, they poured out their hearts, sharing stories and memories of that fateful day.

As the rain continued to pour outside, Ito Shinichi felt a weight lift off his shoulders. For the first time in months, he began to feel like himself again – not just as Detective Ito Shinichi, but as a person, capable of healing and moving forward.
