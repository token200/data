Michał Khan stood at the edge of the frozen lake, his breath misting in the crisp winter air. He gazed out across the frozen expanse, his eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of movement. It was a habit he'd developed over years of living and working in the harsh Russian wilderness.

As a member of the Red Watch, Michał's job was to track down and neutralize any rogue soldiers who'd escaped their base during the recent uprising. His unit had been dispatched from Moscow to quell the rebellion, but Michał knew that the farther north he went, the more isolated and difficult it would become.

He took a deep breath, feeling the cold air fill his lungs, and began to move across the ice. The sound of crunching snow beneath his boots was familiar, like music to his ears. He'd spent countless hours on this very lake, training and preparing for missions just like this one.

As he walked, Michał's mind turned to his family back in Moscow. His wife, Katarzyna, had been worried about him since he left, but he knew she understood the nature of his work. His children were old enough now to understand the risks, too – they'd even helped him pack some of his gear before he set out.

Suddenly, Michał's eyes landed on a faint disturbance in the snow. He froze, his hand instinctively reaching for the pistol at his hip. A figure emerged from the trees, its face obscured by a scarf and goggles.

Michał approached cautiously, his senses on high alert. The figure stopped as he drew near, revealing a young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She seemed to be studying him intently, her gaze lingering on the scar above Michał's left eyebrow.

"Who are you?" Michał asked gruffly, trying to keep his tone neutral.

"I'm Svetlana," she replied, her voice low and husky. "I've been tracking you for days."

Michał narrowed his eyes. What was this woman doing out here? And how did she know he was on the Red Watch?

Svetlana took a step closer, her eyes locked on Michał's. For a moment, they just stared at each other, the only sound the distant call of snowy owls.

"I have information," Svetlana said finally, her voice barely above a whisper. "Information about the uprising. If you want to know what's happening in the north – and who's behind it – I can give it to you."

Michał hesitated for a moment before nodding. This could be the break they needed to turn the tide of the rebellion. He reached into his pack, pulling out a notebook and pen.

"Tell me everything," he said, his voice low and urgent.
