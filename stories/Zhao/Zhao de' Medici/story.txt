I couldn't find any information on a historical figure named "Zhao de' Medici." However, I can create a fictional story for you.

In the bustling city of Florence, a young artist named Ling Zhao de' Medici was making waves in the art world. A member of the powerful Medici family, Ling had been trained by the finest artists of the time and had developed a unique style that blended traditional Chinese techniques with Renaissance flair.

As she set up her easel on the banks of the Arno River, Ling's thoughts turned to her patron, Lorenzo de' Medici. The elderly statesman had taken a liking to Ling's work and had commissioned several pieces for his palace. She was determined to create something truly special for him.

Ling's brushstrokes danced across the canvas as she brought her vision to life. The colors blended and swirled, telling a story of ancient wisdom and modern innovation. When she finished, she stepped back to admire her work, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment.

Just then, Lorenzo de' Medici appeared at her side, his eyes shining with approval. "Ling, you have outdone yourself," he said, taking the canvas from her hands. "Your art is a reflection of your soul – full of life and energy."

Ling blushed at the praise, but couldn't help feeling grateful for Lorenzo's support. As a member of the Medici family, she had always been aware of the weight of responsibility that came with her name. But with Lorenzo by her side, she felt like she could conquer anything.

Over the next few weeks, Ling Zhao de' Medici's fame spread throughout Florence. Her paintings were sought after by collectors and connoisseurs, and she became known as one of the most talented artists of her time. And through it all, Lorenzo remained a steady source of encouragement, reminding her that with hard work and determination, anything was possible.

As Ling looked out at the city she loved, she knew that she had found her true calling – to create beauty and inspire others through her art. And with Lorenzo de' Medici's blessing, she felt like she could take on the world.
