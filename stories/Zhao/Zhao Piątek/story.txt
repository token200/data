In the scorching summer of 1923, in the small village of Lin'an, China, a young boy named Zhang Rongxiang was known for his exceptional marksmanship skills. He was nicknamed "Piątek" by the villagers, which roughly translates to "Little Fifth" in Chinese, after the famous revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen's assassination plot that involved five conspirators.

As Piątek grew older, he became increasingly restless with the strict social hierarchy of his village. He yearned for adventure and a chance to make a name for himself outside of Lin'an. His desire for change was sparked by the whispers of his mother, Zhao Rongxia, who had once been a member of the local revolutionary group.

One fateful day, Piątek stumbled upon an old map hidden away in the attic of his family's ancestral home. The map led him to a secret hideout deep within the nearby mountains, where he encountered a mysterious woman named Ling Mei. She revealed herself as a former member of the Chinese Communist Party and had been hiding in the mountains for months.

Ling Mei took Piątek under her wing, teaching him the ways of communism and the art of warfare. As they journeyed together through the treacherous mountains, Piątek discovered his true passion for revolutionary work and vowed to follow in Ling Mei's footsteps. He adopted a new name, Zhao Piątek, as a symbol of his commitment to the cause.

Under Ling Mei's guidance, Zhao Piątek honed his skills, learning how to read, write, and shoot with precision. They traversed the countryside, spreading propaganda and recruiting like-minded individuals to join their ranks. As word of their revolutionary activities spread, they attracted the attention of local authorities, who deemed them a threat to social order.

Despite the danger, Zhao Piątek remained undeterred, driven by his conviction that China needed a revolution. With Ling Mei's support, he continued to fight for a better future, one that would bring equality and justice to the Chinese people. As the sun set over the mountains, Zhao Piątek smiled to himself, knowing that he had found his true calling as a revolutionary leader, forever changed by the whispers of his mother, Zhao Rongxia's, words echoing in his mind.
