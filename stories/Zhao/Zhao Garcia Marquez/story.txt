Zhao Garcia Marquez walked into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee and staring intently at his laptop screen. Zhao Garcia Marquez slid onto the chair across from him, a hint of a smile playing on her lips.

"Hey, Max," she said, using his nickname instead of his full name, which was often awkward for others to pronounce.

Max looked up, catching her gaze and flashing a warm smile. "Hey, ZGM. What brings you here?"

Zhao Garcia Marquez shrugged, taking a seat and unwinding the scarf from around her neck. "Just needed some coffee and some people-watching," she said, nodding toward the eclectic crowd that filled the café.

Max chuckled. "I can relate. I've been trying to meet a deadline for my novel, but it's like the words just won't come."

Zhao Garcia Marquez leaned in, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. "What's the story about?"

Max hesitated before launching into an explanation of his latest manuscript. As he spoke, Zhao Garcia Marquez listened intently, offering insightful comments and suggestions that left Max impressed.

The hours passed by quickly as they sipped their coffee and talked, discussing everything from literature to music to their shared love of old movies. Despite the distractions of the bustling café, the conversation flowed effortlessly between them, like a well-rehearsed dance.

As the sun began to set outside, casting a warm glow through the windows, Max turned to Zhao Garcia Marquez with a grateful smile. "Thanks for coming over today," he said, his voice sincere. "I really needed that."

Zhao Garcia Marquez smiled back, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "Anytime, Max. Now let's grab some dinner and celebrate the start of a new chapter."
