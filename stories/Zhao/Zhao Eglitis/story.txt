Here is a 375-word story about Zhao Eglitis:

Zhao Eglitis, the infamous space smuggler, navigated his ship through the crowded asteroid field. His reputation preceded him, striking fear into the hearts of those who knew his name. With a quick wit and faster reflexes, he had evaded capture more times than he could count.

As he expertly maneuvered his vessel, the "Marauder's Revenge," Zhao Eglitis couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. He thought back to his days as a young smuggler, flying from planet to planet, taking on odd jobs and living off the grid. It was a hard life, but one he loved.

But that all changed when he stumbled upon a mysterious artifact hidden deep within an ancient ruin. The artifact, known as the "Eye of Eglitis," granted its wielder unimaginable power and wealth. Zhao Eglitis knew he had to get it out of there, or risk losing control over his newfound fortune.

As he continued on his journey, Zhao Eglitis couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He glanced around, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Shrugging it off as mere paranoia, he focused on navigating the treacherous asteroid field ahead.

Suddenly, a loud alarm pierced through the ship's speakers, signaling an incoming attack. Zhao Eglitis' eyes snapped to the viewscreen, where a fleet of enemy ships loomed large. His heart racing, he quickly assessed the situation and began to plot his escape route.

With seconds to spare, the Marauder's Revenge shot out of the asteroid field, narrowly avoiding destruction. Zhao Eglitis let out a sigh of relief as the pursuers gave up the chase. It was just another day in the life of the infamous space smuggler, Zhao Eglitis.
