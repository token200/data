Zhao Hébert walked into the dimly lit café, scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting alone in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee. He was even more handsome than she remembered.

As she approached, he looked up and caught her gaze, flashing a small smile. "Zhao Hébert," he said softly, his voice carrying across the room.

She smiled back, feeling a flutter in her chest. "And you are?" she asked playfully.

He chuckled and stood up, offering his hand for her to take. "I'm Li Wei," he said, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he smiled.

As they ordered coffee and sat down, Zhao Hébert couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her. She had known Li Wei since childhood, growing up in the same small town. They had been inseparable, exploring the countryside and sharing secrets under the stars.

But life had taken them down different paths, and they had lost touch after high school. Zhao Hébert had never forgotten about him, however, always wondering what could have been if they had stayed together.

Now, as they sipped their coffee and talked, it was like no time had passed at all. They laughed and reminisced about old times, sharing stories about their lives since high school.

Zhao Hébert found herself opening up to Li Wei in ways she never had before. She told him about her dreams of becoming a writer, and he listened intently, offering words of encouragement. He shared his own struggles as an artist, and she offered support.

As the night wore on, Zhao Hébert realized that she was falling for Li Wei all over again. It wasn't just his charming smile or his quick wit – it was the way he made her feel seen and heard.

As they said their goodbyes outside the café, Li Wei turned to her and smiled. "Zhao Hébert," he said softly, his eyes shining with affection.

She smiled back, feeling a sense of joy wash over her. "And you are?" she replied, her voice barely above a whisper.

Li Wei chuckled and wrapped his arms around her waist. "I'll always be Li Wei to you, Zhao Hébert," he whispered into her ear.
