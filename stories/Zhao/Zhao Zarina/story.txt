As Zhao Zarina delved deeper into the mysteries of Xylophia-IV, she couldn't help but think of her parents, who had inspired her to pursue a life of discovery. They had encouraged her dreams, even when others doubted them, and now their legacy lived on through her groundbreaking research. With every step forward, Zhao Zarina knew that she was carrying the torch for her family's name - and that her work would forever be remembered as Zhao Zarina, the space explorer who changed the course of human understanding.
