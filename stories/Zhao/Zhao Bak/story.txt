In the scorching desert landscape of Xiyang, a young warrior named Zhao Bak trained tirelessly under the watchful eye of his mentor, Master Li. Born as the youngest son of a humble family, Zhao Bak's path to becoming a great warrior was not one he had chosen for himself, but one that fate had ordained.

Despite the odds against him, Zhao Bak persevered, driven by an insatiable desire to prove himself worthy of respect and recognition. His days were filled with rigorous training sessions, where he honed his skills in combat, strategy, and physical endurance.

One fateful day, a messenger arrived at Master Li's humble abode, bearing an urgent plea for aid from the besieged city of Yumen. The rival warlord, Xue Wei, had laid siege to the city, and its defenders were on the brink of collapse. Zhao Bak, sensing this was his moment, volunteered himself to lead a rescue mission.

With Master Li's blessing, Zhao Bak set out with a small band of trusted warriors, determined to turn the tide in favor of Yumen. The battle was fierce, but under Zhao Bak's command, they managed to break through Xue Wei's defenses and send the rival warlord fleeing.

As news of his victory spread, people began to recognize the name "Zhao Bak" as synonymous with bravery and unwavering dedication.
