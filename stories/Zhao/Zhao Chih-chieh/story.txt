Zhao Chih-chieh stood atop the windswept peak, her long black hair whipping about her face as she gazed out at the breathtaking view below. As a member of the Imperial Guard, she had been tasked with protecting the emperor himself, and tonight was no exception.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the city, Zhao Chih-chieh's thoughts turned to the night ahead. She was scheduled to join the emperor for a private audience, where they would discuss matters of state and strategy. It was a privilege she took seriously, knowing that her actions could mean the difference between life and death.

As she descended the mountain, her thoughts turned to the rumors circulating about an impending assassination attempt. Some said it was the work of a rogue general, while others whispered of a plot by a rival faction within the palace itself. Zhao Chih-chieh's instincts told her that something was amiss, but she had no concrete evidence to support her suspicions.

As she entered the imperial chambers, she was greeted by the familiar sight of silk tapestries and intricately carved wooden panels. The emperor himself sat upon his throne, his eyes gleaming with a sharp intelligence behind his spectacles. "Ah, Zhao Chih-chieh," he said, his voice dripping with warmth. "I'm glad you could join me tonight."

Zhao Chih-chieh bowed deeply, her mind racing with the possibilities. She knew that she had to be on high alert, ready for anything that might come her way. As they began their discussion, she listened intently, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of danger.

But despite her vigilance, nothing seemed out of place. The conversation flowed smoothly, with the emperor and his advisors debating matters of state with ease. It was almost as if Zhao Chih-chieh had been...distracted. She shook off the thought, focusing instead on the task at hand. For now, all seemed quiet. But in the shadows, she knew that danger lurked, waiting to strike.
