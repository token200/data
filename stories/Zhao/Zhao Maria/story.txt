Zhao Maria walked into the small café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Alex, sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee. As she approached him, he looked up and smiled.

"Hey, Zhao Maria," he said, using her full name for the first time that day.

Zhao Maria chuckled and plopped down into the chair across from him. "Only you would use my full name, Alex."

Alex shrugged. "I figure it's only fitting. You're one of a kind, Zhao Maria."

They chatted for a while, catching up on each other's lives. Zhao Maria had been feeling stuck lately, unsure of what she wanted to do with her life. Alex listened intently, offering words of encouragement and advice.

As they talked, a young woman walked into the café, looking lost. She scanned the room, her eyes locking onto Zhao Maria and Alex. For a moment, they all just stared at each other, frozen in time.

The woman finally broke the silence, approaching their table with a hesitant smile. "I'm so sorry to intrude," she said, "but I couldn't help but notice you two...you seem like you know what you're doing."

Alex and Zhao Maria exchanged a knowing look. They had been friends for years, and they knew that sometimes the right people came into your life at exactly the right time.

"Sit down," Alex said, gesturing to the empty chair at their table. "We've got room for one more."

The woman sat down, introducing herself as Sophia. As they talked, Zhao Maria found herself feeling a sense of clarity she hadn't felt in months. She realized that sometimes you just needed to take a chance and follow your heart.

As they finished up their coffee, Alex turned to Zhao Maria and said, "You know, I think Sophia is exactly what we need around here."

Zhao Maria smiled, feeling grateful for her friend's insight. "I couldn't agree more," she said, using her full name once again as a way of acknowledging the connection she felt with Alex.
