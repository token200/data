Zhao Adelberg sat alone in her small apartment, staring blankly at the wall as she strummed a melancholy tune on her guitar. The dim lighting cast long shadows across her face, accentuating the lines etched into her skin from years of traveling and living on the fringes.

As she played, memories flooded her mind - of distant lands, exotic creatures, and people who had become like family to her over the years. There was Marco, the charming Italian thief with a heart of gold; Ling, the enigmatic Chinese warrior with a penchant for poetry; and Jax, the rough-around-the-edges American outlaw with a quick wit and quicker draw.

Zhao Adelberg's thoughts drifted back to the days when she had been known as Zhao "The Fox" Adelberg, a notorious thief and con artist in her own right. She had built a reputation for being able to talk her way out of (or into) just about any situation, using her quick wit and silver tongue to swindle even the most skeptical of marks.

But after years on the run, Zhao Adelberg had finally grown tired of the life. She had settled down in this small apartment, taking up the guitar as a way to pass the time and quiet the whispers of her past. It was a simple existence, but one that brought her a measure of peace she had never known before.

As she finished her song, Zhao Adelberg set the guitar aside and rose to her feet. She walked over to the window, pushing back the curtains to let in a sliver of sunlight. For a moment, she stood there, lost in thought, as the world outside seemed to stretch out before her like an endless canvas waiting to be explored.

But then, with a quiet sigh, she turned and made her way back to the couch, settling into the worn cushions as if returning home after years away. Zhao Adelberg smiled wistfully to herself, knowing that no matter where life took her next, a part of her would always remain this small, peaceful place - where the music soothed her soul and the memories were hers alone.
