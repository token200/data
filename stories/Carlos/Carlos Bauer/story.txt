Carlos Bauer stepped into the dimly lit bar, the sounds of salsa music and hushed conversations enveloping him like a warm hug. He had always been drawn to places like this - a haven for those who knew the language of secrets and whispers.

As he made his way to the end of the bar, the bartender nodded in recognition, her eyes gleaming with a knowing spark. "The usual, se√±or?" she asked, already pouring a shot of tequila into his waiting glass.

Carlos raised an eyebrow as he took a sip, his mind wandering to the reason he had come tonight. A message from an old flame, one that had been simmering in the back of his mind for years. The words on the piece of paper had been simple: meet me at the old windmill on the outskirts of town at midnight.

He downed the shot and slid a twenty-dollar bill across the bar to the bartender, his eyes scanning the room with an air of practiced caution. This was a place where allegiances were tested and reputations were made - or lost.

As he sipped his drink and surveyed his surroundings, Carlos noticed a figure watching him from across the room. Tall, imposing, and dressed in black, they seemed out of place among the lively throng of patrons. His instincts prickled with unease.

The music shifted into a slower rhythm, and Carlos felt himself drifting towards the stranger, drawn by an unseen thread. They locked eyes for a fleeting moment before he disappeared into the crowd.

The hours ticked by like grains of sand in an hourglass, each one feeling longer than the last. Finally, the clock struck midnight, casting an eerie light over the deserted streets. Carlos made his way towards the windmill, the creaking of the old wooden slats beneath his feet echoing through the night air.

As he pushed open the door and stepped inside, a figure emerged from the shadows, their eyes gleaming in the moonlight. "Welcome, Carlos," they whispered, their voice barely audible over the rustling of the windmill's sails. And with that, everything changed.
