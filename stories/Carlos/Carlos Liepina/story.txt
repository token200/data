Carlos Liepina was a man with a passion for music and photography. By day, he worked as a freelance photographer, capturing the beauty of the world around him through his lens. But by night, he transformed into a rockstar, playing guitar and singing in local bands.

One evening, Carlos Liepina received an offer to photograph a gig at a popular club downtown. The band, "Electric Storm," was looking for someone to capture their high-energy performance, and they had heard that Carlos Liepina's work was top-notch.
