Carlos Sandström stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the sleepy station. He had been on the move for weeks, ever since he'd left the city behind to escape the memories that haunted him. The wind whipped through his dark hair as he pulled his jacket tighter around him.

A local approached him, eyeing Carlos's worn jeans and faded band t-shirt. "You lost?" he asked gruffly.

Carlos shook his head. "No, I'm here for Elsi."

The man nodded. "She lives in that old cabin on the outskirts of town. You can't miss it."

As he walked through the deserted streets, Carlos felt a sense of unease settle over him. He'd been searching for Elsi for what felt like an eternity – ever since his sister's disappearance five years ago. The police had given up, and Carlos was no closer to finding out what had happened to her.

He finally arrived at the cabin, its wooden walls weathered to a soft gray. Smoke curled from the chimney, carrying the scent of baking bread. Carlos's stomach growled in response as he knocked on the door.

It swung open, revealing Elsi herself – tall and slender, with piercing blue eyes that sparkled like stars. She smiled warmly at him, ushering him inside.

The cabin was warm and cozy, filled with the scent of fresh coffee and baking bread. Carlos felt a sense of belonging wash over him as he sat down at the table alongside Elsi.

They talked for hours, catching up on old times and sharing stories about their lives since Carlos had left. Elsi's children were grown now, moving off to start their own families – but she still kept a garden full of wildflowers in her backyard, tended by Carlos himself when he'd visited before.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the cabin in a warm orange glow, Carlos felt his heart begin to heal. Maybe, just maybe, this was where he belonged. Not in the city, but out here – surrounded by nature and the people who had become like family to him.

Elsi reached across the table, her hand finding his. "You've come home, Carlos," she said softly.

And for the first time in years, Carlos felt a sense of peace that he'd never known before.
