Carlos Jie was a man with a passion for art and music. Growing up in a small town surrounded by lush green forests and rolling hills, he spent most of his childhood exploring the outdoors and creating his own brand of folk music on his guitar.

He worked as an apprentice to a local painter, learning new techniques and experimenting with different mediums. But music remained his true love.
