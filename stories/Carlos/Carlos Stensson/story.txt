Carlos Stensson stepped into the dimly lit bar, scanning the room for his contact. The patrons were few and far between, but he knew the owner, Viktor, took care of the regulars. As he made his way to the end of the counter, a figure emerged from the shadows.

"Carlos Stensson," Viktor said, his voice low and gravelly. "It's been too long."

Carlos nodded, taking a seat next to the barstool. "Viktor, good to see you. I've got a package for you."

He handed over a small box, wrapped in brown paper and twine. Viktor's eyes lit up as he unwrapped it, revealing a sleek silver watch.

"Where did you get this?" Viktor asked, his voice filled with admiration.

"Just acquired it," Carlos replied, taking a sip of the whiskey on the bar. "It's not much, but it'll do."

Viktor nodded, tucking the watch into his pocket. "I owe you one, Carlos Stensson. You've got a good eye for things."

The two men chatted for a while, discussing everything from politics to sports. Viktor was a man of few words, but when he spoke, it was always worth listening to.

As they talked, the door swung open and a young woman walked in, her eyes scanning the room until they landed on Carlos and Viktor. She smiled, making her way over to their table.

"Viktor," she said, her voice husky. "I see you're entertaining again."

Viktor nodded, gesturing for her to take a seat. "Just having a little chat with my friend here, Lena. What brings you out tonight?"

Lena leaned in, her eyes locking onto Carlos' watch. "I heard it was on sale," she said, winking.

Carlos chuckled, feeling a sense of unease. He didn't like people poking around his business, but Viktor vouched for him, so he let it slide.

As the night wore on, the conversation turned to more serious matters. Carlos Stensson listened intently, weighing his options carefully. In the world of espionage, loyalty was a luxury few could afford. But for now, at least, he had found a place where he belonged â€“ and people who would watch his back.
