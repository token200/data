Carlos Neumann, a former CIA operative turned private investigator, sat at his desk, sipping on a cold coffee. His office was a small, cramped room in a dingy part of town, but it had been his haven for years.

It had started with a phone call from an old acquaintance, a retired agent named Rachel who had gone rogue after discovering some classified information that threatened to bring down the entire agency. She had left everything behind and was now in hiding, unable to trust anyone.

Carlos's mission had been simple: find Rachel and get her out of the country before she got caught by the Agency. It wasn't a straightforward task - Rachel had been on the run for months, always staying one step ahead of her pursuers. But Carlos had finally tracked her down to a small coastal town in Portugal.

As he sat at his desk, staring at the faded photograph of Rachel that he kept next to his phone, Carlos's mind began to wander back to their time together at the Agency. They had been an unlikely pair - Carlos, a rough-around-the-edges kid from Brooklyn, and Rachel, a polished, Ivy League-educated blonde. But they had clicked, bonding over late-night conversations about the intricacies of espionage.

The memories came flooding back as he thought about his decision to leave the Agency. It had been a tough one - Carlos had always prided himself on being a patriot, but after what he had seen during his years as an operative, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

He pushed the thoughts aside and focused on the present. Rachel needed help, and Carlos was determined to get it to her. He picked up the phone and dialed the number of his contact in Portugal - a local hacker who had promised to keep an eye out for Rachel's whereabouts.

As he waited for the call to connect, Carlos's mind began to wander to all the things that could go wrong. The Agency would stop at nothing to bring her down, and if they caught wind of their location...Carlos shuddered at the thought.

But he pushed it aside. He had come too far and sacrificed too much to let that happen now. Rachel needed him, and Carlos was determined to be there for her, no matter what.

The phone rang, and Carlos picked it up, his eyes locked on the screen as the hacker's face appeared in front of him.

"Hey, Carlos," the voice said, low and gravelly. "I've got some news. Rachel is hiding out at a small hotel near the beach."

Carlos's heart skipped a beat as he scribbled down the address on a piece of paper. He was ready to get moving - for Rachel's sake, if not his own.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Carlos Neumann stood up from his chair, his eyes fixed on the photograph of Rachel that still sat next to him. It was time to go home.
