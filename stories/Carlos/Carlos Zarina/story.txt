Carlos Zarina was known for his exceptional skills as a street artist in the bustling city of Rio de Janeiro. Born Carlos Zarina in the impoverished neighborhood of Rocinha, he had grown up surrounded by vibrant colors and lively rhythms that inspired his art.

As a child, Carlos would often sneak into the local markets to watch the vendors at work, mesmerized by the way they transformed everyday objects into breathtaking works of art.

His bold, abstract pieces adorned buildings across Rio, sparking conversations about social justice, politics, and culture.
