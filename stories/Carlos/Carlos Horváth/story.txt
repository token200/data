Carlos Horváth stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of his contact. As he waited, sipping on a cup of strong coffee, he couldn't help but think about the strange circumstances that had led him here.

A former CIA operative turned freelance journalist, Carlos Horváth had a knack for uncovering secrets that others thought were buried forever. His latest lead had taken him from the streets of Budapest to the back alleys of Prague, and now, it seemed, to this small café in Berlin.

Just as he was starting to lose hope, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was a woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair, dressed in a fitted leather jacket that made her look like a 1970s punk rockstar.

"Carlos Horváth," she said, her voice husky and confident. "I've heard a lot about you."

"And I've heard nothing about you," Carlos replied, his eyes narrowing as he took in the woman's demeanor. There was something about her that didn't quite add up.

"My name is Sophia," she said, smiling for the first time. "And I think we have a mutual interest. You see, I've been investigating some... irregularities within the European Union."

Carlos's ears perked up at this. He had always suspected that there was more to the EU than met the eye.

"What kind of irregularities?" he asked, his curiosity piqued.

Sophia leaned in close, her voice barely above a whisper. "I think it goes all the way to the top. And I need your help to prove it."

Carlos Horváth's mind was racing with possibilities. This could be the story of a lifetime, one that would make his career as a journalist and put him firmly on the map.

As he nodded for Sophia to continue, Carlos couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and trepidation. He knew that this was just the beginning of a journey that would take him to the darkest corners of power and corruption. But with Sophia by his side, he felt ready to face whatever lay ahead.
