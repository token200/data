With a deep breath, Malia sprang into action, her slender fingers closing around the vase's neck like a vice. In a flash of movement, she vanished into the crowd, leaving behind only whispers and speculation about The Shadow Fox's next move.

The night was young, but for Malia Jhih-hao, it had already been a success. As she disappeared into the shadows, her reputation grew, whispered among those in the know: this enigmatic thief would stop at nothing to claim the prize, and only time would reveal her true intentions.
