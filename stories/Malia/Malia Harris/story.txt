I couldn't find any information on a well-known person named Malia Harris. It is possible that you are thinking of a different person, such as Malia Obama, who is the daughter of former U.S. President Barack Obama.

However, I did find information on a character named Ma'ale'ula "Malia" Harris, who is a main character in the popular young adult novel series "The Five" by Kiersten White. In the story, Malia is a member of an elite group known as The Five, tasked with keeping the world safe from supernatural threats.

Here's a 400-word story about Ma'ale'ula "Malia" Harris:

Ma'ale'ula "Malia" Harris was always one step ahead of the game. As a member of The Five, she had been trained to fight and defend herself against any supernatural threat that came their way. With her quick wit and sharp instincts, Malia was the perfect candidate for this elite group.

As she walked through the crowded streets of Los Angeles, Malia's eyes scanned the crowd for any signs of danger. She had a sixth sense when it came to sensing evil, and today she couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. Suddenly, her phone buzzed with an alert from The Five's headquarters - a powerful demon had been spotted in the area.

Without hesitation, Malia sprang into action. She sprinted through the streets, weaving past pedestrians and cars as she made her way to the location of the demon. As she arrived, she could feel its dark energy coursing through the air. With a deep breath, Malia summoned her powers and prepared for battle.

The fight was intense, with Malia dodging the demon's attacks and striking back with precision and skill. But as the battle raged on, Malia began to tire. She knew she couldn't keep this up forever - The Five was counting on her. Just when it seemed like all hope was lost, Malia remembered the words of her mentor: "The power is within you, Malia. Trust yourself."

With newfound determination, Malia focused all her energy and unleashed a devastating attack that sent the demon flying. As the dust settled, Malia stood victorious, her chest heaving with exhaustion. She had saved the day once again, proving herself to be one of The Five's most valuable assets.

As she walked back to headquarters, Malia couldn't help but smile - being a part of this team was the best job in the world. And as she flashed her iconic silver pendant - given to her by The Five - she knew that she would always stand ready to face whatever supernatural threats came her way.
