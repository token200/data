One day, while investigating a lead on a corruption scandal, Malia received a cryptic message from an anonymous source. The message read: "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone." Intrigued, Malia decided to take a chance and attend the meeting.

As she arrived at the clock tower, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was Ahmed Hassan, a former government official who had been accused of embezzlement. He revealed that he had evidence of a massive corruption scheme that went all the way to the top of the government.

Malia was determined to expose the truth and get her story out to the public. With Ahmed's help, she spent the next few weeks gathering evidence and conducting interviews.
