Malia Kulbayeva stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station. She had been on the move for days, ever since she'd received that cryptic message from an old acquaintance. "Meet me in Nur-Sultan," it had read, with nothing else. Simple yet clear.

Malia's thoughts were a jumble of emotions as she collected her luggage and made her way to the taxi rank. Her family had been accused of treason by the government, and with no one left to trust, she'd had to flee for her life. The message from her old friend, Victor, was all she had to hold onto.

As she settled into the taxi, Malia pulled out her phone to check the number of times it had vibrated in her pocket since leaving home. Seventeen. It was a small comfort, but one that gave her hope. She wondered what Victor wanted, and why he'd chosen this place to meet.

The driver navigated through the dusty streets of Nur-Sultan, eventually pulling up to an unassuming building. Malia's eyes locked onto the address scrawled on the door: "Old Town". A wave of nostalgia washed over her as she stepped out of the taxi and into the cool evening air.

Victor stood waiting for her in the doorway, a furtive smile playing on his lips. The two had grown up together, exploring these streets and sharing secrets. Malia's heart swelled with affection as he pulled her into a brief hug.

"What is it?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. Victor hesitated before leading her inside, to a small café tucked away in the corner of the Old Town square. Over steaming cups of tea, he revealed that he'd been working undercover for an organization determined to take down the corrupt government.

As Malia listened intently, she realized that this was what she'd been searching for – purpose, and a reason to keep going even when all seemed lost. Victor spoke of plans to expose corruption and bring about change, and for a moment, Malia felt like she could breathe again.

But as the night drew to a close, and Victor's words began to sound more ominous, Malia sensed danger lurking in the shadows. Her instincts screamed at her to leave, to disappear into the crowd before it was too late. She did not have time for the comfort of being with friends – she needed to keep moving.

In a flash, the room seemed darker and smaller than before. The lights flickered and died, plunging them into darkness. Malia grabbed Victor's arm, her heart racing as they heard footsteps outside, heavy and deliberate.
