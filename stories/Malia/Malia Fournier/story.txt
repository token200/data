Malia Fournier stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar station. It had been five years since she'd last set foot in Ravenswood, and yet the small town felt like home. Malia's thoughts were consumed by the letter she'd received a week ago - an invitation from her estranged father to meet him for the first time.

As a child, Malia had always heard stories about her father's abandonment, how he'd left without a word or explanation. Her mother had never spoken of it again, but the pain and anger still lingered within Malia. Now, at 25, she was determined to confront the past and understand why her father had walked away.

With a deep breath, Malia made her way through the quiet streets, following the familiar map etched in her mind. She stopped in front of the old Victorian house where she'd grown up, its windows like empty eyes staring back at her. A sense of nostalgia washed over her as she gazed up at the faded sign that creaked in the gentle breeze - "Fournier Manor".

She pushed open the door and stepped inside, calling out into the silence. There was no response, but Malia's heart quickened with anticipation. She walked through the rooms, each step leading her further back in time. Finally, she reached the door to the study where her father had spent countless hours as a child.

Malia took a final deep breath before turning the handle and pushing open the creaking door. A figure sat behind the desk, his eyes locked onto hers with a mixture of guilt and resolve. Malia's voice trembled as she asked the question that had haunted her for so long - "Why did you leave me?" The silence that followed was palpable, but it was the words that came next that left Malia breathless - "I'm sorry, Malia Fournier. I was young and scared, and I made a mistake."

The weight of those four words settled upon her like a shroud, but as she looked into her father's eyes, Malia saw something there that gave her pause. Maybe, just maybe, forgiveness was possible.
