I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Malia Saldana. It's possible that you may be thinking of a different person or character.

However, I can suggest some information on Gina Carano and Zoe Saldana who are actresses with similar names.

Gina Carano is an American actress and former mixed martial artist. She was born on April 22, 1982, in San Diego, California. Carano began her acting career in the early 2000s, appearing in films such as "Haywire" and "Deadpool." She also played the role of Angel Dinahmar in the TV series "Magnum P.I."

Zoe Saldana is an American actress born on June 19, 1978, in Passaic, New Jersey. She rose to fame for her roles in the "Avatar" franchise as Neytiri and the "Guardians of the Galaxy" series as Gamora. Saldana has also appeared in films such as "Collateral" and "Star Trek."

If you would like me to write a story about either Gina Carano or Zoe Saldana, I can certainly do that!
