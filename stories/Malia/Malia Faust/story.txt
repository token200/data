Malia Faust sat in the dimly lit coffee shop, nursing a cup of cold brew as she stared out the window. It had been months since she'd seen her family, and the distance was starting to take its toll. As a powerful mutant with the ability to control and manipulate technology, Malia had always felt like an outsider. Growing up in a world where humans feared and hunted those like her, she'd learned to rely only on herself.

But despite her tough exterior, Malia couldn't shake the feeling of loneliness that had settled in over the past few years. She missed her family's warmth and love, and the memories of happier times felt like a distant dream. Her full name, Malia Faust, seemed like a cruel joke now – "Faust" being the surname of a man who had made a pact with Mephistopheles in exchange for power.

Malia's eyes wandered to her phone, which sat on the table beside her. She'd received a message from a fellow mutant just that morning, inviting her to meet up and discuss a potential mission. It was always something like this – a reminder that she was still part of a larger community, even if it felt like an exile from society.

As she pondered whether or not to respond, Malia's gaze drifted back to the window. The sun was setting over the city, casting long shadows across the pavement. She imagined her family gathered around a dinner table, laughing and talking as they had so many times before. Her full name, Malia Faust, felt like a weight on her shoulders then – a constant reminder of what she'd lost.

The sound of the coffee shop door breaking open snapped Malia back to reality. A young mutant girl stood in the doorway, looking around nervously as if she didn't know where she was or who she was with. Malia recognized the look – it was one she knew all too well.

She smiled wryly to herself, remembering when she'd been that same scared and uncertain teenager. Taking a deep breath, Malia stood up and walked over to the girl, offering her a warm smile and an outstretched hand. "Hey there," she said softly. "Welcome to the world of mutants."

For a moment, Malia's eyes met those of the young girl, and she felt a spark of recognition – a sense that this child was about to embark on the same journey she'd taken all those years ago. As they exchanged stories and information, Malia knew that she wasn't alone anymore – not truly, at least. And for that, she was grateful.
