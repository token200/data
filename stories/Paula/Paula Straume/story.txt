Paula Straume stepped out of her apartment and onto the rain-soaked streets of Oslo. She pulled her waterproof jacket tighter, bracing herself for the long day ahead. As a journalist, she had grown accustomed to the city's grey skies, but it never failed to dampen her spirits.

She made her way to the coffee shop where she would meet her source, an anonymous whistleblower who had been feeding her information about a potential corruption scandal involving some of Oslo's most influential politicians. Paula took a seat at a small table by the window, nursing a lukewarm coffee as she waited for her contact to arrive.

The door swung open and a figure slid into the booth across from her, eyes scanning the room before focusing on Paula. She nodded curtly, acknowledging the connection without making eye contact. This was what made her job so frustrating – the constant need to be paranoid about being discovered.

"Paula, I have something for you," the source said, voice low and gravelly. "It's big. A money-laundering scheme that goes all the way to the top."

Paula pulled out her notebook and pen, her mind racing with possibilities. She had been investigating rumors of a connection between Oslo's politicians and some shady business deals, but nothing like this.

The source handed over a folder filled with documents and audio recordings, each one detailing transactions that seemed too good to be true. As Paula flipped through the pages, she felt a shiver run down her spine – this was it, the story of a lifetime.

But as she looked up at her contact, she saw something in their eyes that chilled her to the bone. Fear. They knew they were taking a huge risk by coming forward.

"Who are you?" Paula asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

The source leaned in, their face inches from hers. "I'm not who I used to be," they whispered. "And neither are you."

Before she could respond, the contact stood up and vanished into the crowd, leaving Paula with more questions than answers. She scribbled down some notes, her mind racing with the implications of what she had been given.

As she left the coffee shop, she knew that this story was going to change everything – for herself, for her source, and for the city of Oslo itself.
