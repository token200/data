Jessica Meyer walked into the coffee shop, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of her missing friend. It had been three days since Emily's disappearance, and the police were no closer to finding her.

As she waited in line, Jessica's mind wandered back to their last conversation before Emily vanished. They had talked about everything from their jobs to their personal struggles, but one thing stood out: a mysterious phone number that Emily had given to Jessica just hours before she disappeared.

Jessica took a deep breath and ordered her usual coffee. As she waited for her drink, she pulled out her phone and dialed the number. It rang several times before a familiar voice picked up.

"Hey, Jess," Emily said, sounding a bit disoriented. "What's going on?"

Jessica's heart skipped a beat as she heard Emily's voice, but it was clear that something was wrong. The tone was flat, detached - like she was speaking from behind a mask.

"What happened?" Jessica asked, trying to keep her voice steady. "Where are you?"

There was a pause on the other end of the line before Emily replied, "I'm...I'm okay. I just need some time."

Jessica's mind reeled as she tried to process what Emily was saying. Time? What did that even mean?

"I want to know what's going on," Jessica pressed, trying to keep her voice firm.

Emily sighed before responding, "Just...just trust me, Jess. I'll talk to you soon."

The line went dead, leaving Jessica staring at her phone in confusion. Who was Emily really talking to? And why did she seem so scared?

Jessica finished her coffee and left the shop, determined to find out what had happened to her friend. She spent the rest of the day researching, scouring the internet for any mention of Emily or that mysterious phone number.

As night began to fall, Jessica finally stumbled upon a lead: an online forum where someone claimed to know Emily's location. With shaking hands, Jessica typed in the coordinates and waited.

The screen flickered to life as a low-resolution video began to play. It showed Emily, her eyes sunken and her skin pale, but still smiling weakly at the camera.

"Jessica," Emily whispered, "I'm sorry. I was caught...and now they're watching me."

The video cut off abruptly, leaving Jessica staring at the screen in horror. Who were these people? And what did they want with Emily?

As she sat there, trying to process everything, a chill ran down her spine: she had just received a message from an unknown number.

"You shouldn't have looked for me," it read. "You should have stayed silent."

Jessica's heart sank as the realization hit her: she was next on their list.
