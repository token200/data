Jessica Alexandra Wrobel stepped onto the bustling streets of Manhattan, her eyes scanning the crowded sidewalks with a practiced air of disinterest. As a journalist for a prominent magazine, she was no stranger to the fast-paced world of New York City.

At 28, Jessica had already established herself as a rising star in the industry, known for her incisive reporting and sharp wit. Her latest article, exposing corruption within the city's government, had generated a firestorm of controversy and praise alike.

As she navigated through the throngs of people, Jessica's mind began to wander to the upcoming interview with her subject, a reclusive billionaire with ties to some of the most powerful figures in the city.
