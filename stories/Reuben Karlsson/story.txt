Reuben Karlsson trudged through the snow-covered streets, his eyes scanning the desolate landscape for any sign of life. As a former detective, he'd seen it all - the crimes, the victims, the cold, calculating minds that committed them. But nothing could have prepared him for what he'd been through.

It had started with a phone call from an old acquaintance, hinting at a job that required his unique set of skills. Reuben had agreed, thinking it would be just another way to pass the time since leaving the force. But as soon as he'd walked into the dingy office, he knew something was off.

The man who handed him the folder had been a stranger - no badge, no ID, just an eerie smile that sent shivers down Reuben's spine. Inside the folder lay photos of children, all smiling and carefree, with one crucial detail: they were dead.

Reuben had spent years tracking down killers, but this was different. This was personal.

He began to investigate on his own, pouring over evidence and following leads that led him deeper into the darkness. The closer he got, the more Reuben realized that nothing about this case made sense. It was as if someone - or something - had carefully orchestrated every move, leaving a trail of breadcrumbs for him to follow.

One evening, while reviewing surveillance footage, Reuben noticed a detail he'd missed before: a small piece of fabric caught on a window frame, flapping in the wind like a forgotten ghost. He sent it to forensics, hoping it might be enough to crack the case.

Days turned into weeks, and Reuben's obsession grew with each new twist and turn. He spent every waking moment researching, interviewing witnesses, and digging up dirt on anyone who'd ever been connected to the victims. His apartment became a labyrinth of notes and files, as if he was determined to unravel every thread of this macabre tapestry.

And then, one night, it all fell apart. Reuben received a phone call with no answer, just an ominous silence that seemed to stretch on forever. Suddenly, everything clicked into place - the fabric, the photos, the web of deceit he'd spun around him.

Reuben's eyes widened as realization dawned: this wasn't about solving a crime; it was about unmasking himself. He'd been playing a twisted game all along, and now that the mask came off, he stared into the abyss of his own vulnerability.

With shaking hands, Reuben ripped apart the remaining pieces of evidence, scattering them to the wind like autumn leaves. The case - or whatever it was - went cold once more, leaving him with nothing but the echoes of a forgotten past and the faint whisper of 'who are you?'
