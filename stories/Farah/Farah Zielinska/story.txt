Born in Warsaw, Poland, Farah's passion for mystery and detection began at a young age. Her father, a retired police officer, often took her on patrols around the city, teaching her the intricacies of human behavior and observation. This early exposure laid the foundation for her exceptional skills as a detective.

One rainy evening, Farah received an urgent call from the local police department. A wealthy businessman had been found dead in his mansion, with no signs of forced entry or struggle.
