But few people knew that behind the confident exterior of Farah Ruiz García lay a complex web of emotions and motivations.

Growing up in the sun-scorched streets of Madrid, Farah Ruiz García had always been driven by a fierce determination to succeed.

And challenge it, Farah Ruiz García did. On the court, she was a whirlwind of athleticism and skill, her serves rocketing down the line with pinpoint accuracy.
