I couldn't find any information on a person named Farah DiCaprio. However, I found that Leonardo DiCaprio's mother is Dede DiCaprio and his first name is not Farah.

If you'd like, I can create a story around a fictional character with the name Farah. Please let me know!

Alternatively, if you would like to write a short story about a character related to Leonardo DiCaprio or another celebrity, please provide more information on who that character is and what kind of story you would like it to be.

If neither of those options are correct, I can write a random 400-word story for you.
