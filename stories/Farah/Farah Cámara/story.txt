Farah Cámara stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station with a mixture of nostalgia and apprehension. It had been years since she'd returned to her hometown in Puerto Rico, and yet the memories still felt as fresh as if they were yesterday.

As she made her way through the bustling streets, Farah's thoughts turned to the vibrant colors and sounds that once defined her childhood – the smell of coconut ice cream from street vendors, the sound of salsa music drifting from the corner store, and the feel of warm sand beneath her bare feet. Her mother used to take her on long walks along the beach at dawn, watching as the sun slowly rose over the ocean.

But life had taken Farah in a different direction. She'd moved to New York City after college, chasing dreams of becoming a journalist, but eventually losing her passion for the craft. Now, at 30, she found herself back on the island, trying to rediscover the sense of purpose and belonging that had eluded her.

As she walked through the streets, Farah felt the weight of expectation settling upon her shoulders. She was the daughter of a famous Puerto Rican poet, after all – her name had been written in textbooks and recited by scholars across the globe. But what did that even mean for her? Was she just a legacy, or could she forge her own path?

Farah arrived at the small apartment she'd rented near the old family house, feeling a mix of excitement and trepidation. Her abuela had invited her to stay with her while Farah settled back into life on the island.

That evening, as they sat around the kitchen table sipping coffee and swapping stories, Farah's abuela asked about her plans for the future. "What do you want to be when you grow up, mija?" she asked, a hint of mischief in her voice.

Farah hesitated, unsure of how to answer. She'd never thought of herself as the next great poet or leader, but maybe that was exactly what she needed to rediscover – a chance to create something new and true for herself.

"I don't know," Farah admitted, feeling a glimmer of hope ignite within her. "But I want to try again."
