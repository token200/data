János Gagnon stepped out of the rain and into the small café on the outskirts of town. He was a man with a mysterious past, and the locals had grown accustomed to whispering about him behind his back. But János didn't let it faze him - he was used to being an enigma.

As he waited in line to order, János's eyes scanned the room, taking in the familiar faces of the regulars. There was Olga at the counter, sipping on a cup of black coffee as usual; Tomás sitting alone by the window, nursing a whiskey; and the twins, László and Ernő, engaged in a heated game of cards.

János finally reached the front of the line and ordered his usual: a strong espresso and a slice of cherry pie. As he waited for his drink, he noticed a young woman sitting at a table by the door, her eyes fixed on him with an unnerving intensity. János felt a shiver run down his spine as their gazes met, but he quickly looked away, intrigued.

As the rain poured down outside, János Gagnon sat back down at his usual table, lost in thought. He was a man with many secrets, and not everyone knew the truth about him. Some said he was a former spy, while others claimed he was a wealthy businessman with connections to the highest echelons of power.

János just smiled to himself, knowing that only a select few truly understood his true nature. And as he took a sip of his espresso, the young woman by the door caught his eye once more - this time, she was holding up a small piece of paper with a cryptic message scrawled on it: "Meet me outside at midnight. Come alone."

János's eyes narrowed, his mind racing with possibilities. Who was this mysterious woman, and what did she want from him? As he finished his drink and prepared to leave, János Gagnon couldn't help but feel a spark of excitement - it seemed like his life was about to get a whole lot more interesting.
