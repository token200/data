János Ángel Silvestre was a man shrouded in mystery. Few knew his true name, and even fewer had seen him smile. He wore a mask of stoic resolve, hiding behind an unyielding gaze that could freeze blood at twenty paces.

Born on the sun-scorched streets of Budapest, János grew up as an orphan, forced to fend for himself in the city's unforgiving underbelly. His early life was marked by street fights and scrapes, but it was here he honed his unique skillset – a deadly blend of martial arts, acrobatics, and cunning that would make him one of the most feared assassins on the continent.

Years went by, and János' reputation spread like wildfire. Kings and nobles sought his services, willing to pay top dollar for the silent eliminator who could take out their enemies without leaving a whisper. He worked for whoever paid the most, always staying one step ahead of those who'd seek to bring him down.

But there was more to János than met the eye. Behind the mask, he harbored a deep sense of loneliness – a reminder that in his line of work, attachments were liabilities. As the years went by, however, whispers began to circulate about an older woman living in a dingy apartment on the outskirts of town. Few had seen her face, but they knew she was the only one who could claim János' heart.

One stormy night, as the rain lashed down and thunder boomed outside, a hired gun came knocking – seeking to collect his final paycheck and deliver the news that János had finally retired from the game. But when he entered the apartment, all was quiet. The candles burned low, casting eerie shadows on the walls, and in the corner sat an old piano, its lid open like a mouth.

Suddenly, the door burst open, and an elderly woman emerged, her silver hair blowing wildly as she sang – a haunting melody that sent shivers down the hired gun's spine. He froze as János stood up from behind his chair, mask glinting in the candlelight, for the first time letting a hint of vulnerability seep into his gaze.

The hired gun tried to flee, but it was too late. Silvestre swiftly overpowered him and dispatched him with an ease that defied human explanation. When he finally lay still, János gently closed the lid on the old piano and took one last glance at the lifeless body before turning back to his beloved companion.

"Thank you," she said softly, her voice like a benediction.
