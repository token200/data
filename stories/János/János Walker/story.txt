Born in Budapest, Hungary, János had always been fascinated by the secrets hidden beneath the city's streets. Her family, descendants of Hungarian aristocrats, had encouraged her curiosity from a young age. With a PhD in archaeology from the University of Oxford, she had made a name for herself as an expert in the field.

As János carefully brushed away the dirt and debris, she uncovered a previously unknown inscription etched into the stone wall.

The significance of János Walker's discovery soon became apparent: it revealed a previously unknown chapter in Hungarian history, one that had been shrouded in mystery for centuries. News of the find spread like wildfire, drawing international attention from museums and collectors alike.
