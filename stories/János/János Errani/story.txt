János Errani trudged through the rain-soaked streets, his eyes fixed on the pavement as if searching for answers that only the wet earth could hold. He had always been a man of few words, content to let the world speak for itself, but today even the silence seemed oppressive.

As he turned a corner, a glint of light caught his eye – a small café, its door slightly ajar, beckoning him in like an old friend. János pushed open the door and stepped inside, shaking the rain from his coat. The warm scent of coffee enveloped him, transporting him to better times.

He took a seat at the bar, where a familiar face waited with a knowing smile – Zsófi, the café's owner. "János, my friend," she said, pouring him a steaming cup without asking. He nodded, his eyes drifting out the window as if trying to leave the past behind.

The rain pattered against the glass like a chorus of fingers on a piano, echoing János' own restless heart. What was he running from? The ghosts that haunted him, or the choices that led him here? Only Zsófi seemed to understand the language of silence between them, and she didn't pry.

János took a sip of his coffee, feeling it spread through his chest like a slow-burning fire. It wasn't warmth, but some semblance of comfort he had grown accustomed to. As an orphan, taken in by Zsófi's family when János was just a boy, he'd learned the value of quiet strength.

But today, that strength felt frayed, like threads unraveling from a once-sturdy fabric. The memories swirled around him – his parents' laughter on the day they died, the scorching heat of the desert sun beating down upon him as a refugee, and Zsófi's own tears falling onto his shoulders during times when words failed him.

The rain slowed to a gentle patter outside, its rhythm soothing János' frazzled nerves. He closed his eyes, letting the warmth seep into his bones. Perhaps, in this quiet refuge, he could listen for what was no longer being spoken – the whispers of what once was, and what could be.

Zsófi slid a plate of fresh pastries onto the counter beside him, her expression softening like moonlight on a winter night. "Eat, János," she said gently, her voice barely audible above the rain's lullaby.
