János, whose full name was indeed János Szymanski, had grown up surrounded by music. His parents, both classically trained musicians themselves, had encouraged his love for music from a young age, teaching him how to play the piano and sing. As he grew older, János's passion for music only intensified, leading him to study at one of Budapest's prestigious music academies.
