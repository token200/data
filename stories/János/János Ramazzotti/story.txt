After weeks of trial and error, János Ramazzotti finally succeeded in creating a working prototype of his latest invention: a machine that could convert sunlight into mechanical energy. The machine was a marvel of its time, and János Ramazzotti's reputation as a genius inventor spread throughout the city.

As news of his discovery reached the ears of the royal family, János Ramazzotti was summoned to the palace to showcase his invention. The monarchs were impressed by the machine's potential and offered János Ramazzotti a lucrative contract to build more machines for their estate.

Overjoyed by the opportunity, János Ramazzotti accepted the offer and set to work on producing more machines. His workshop became busier than ever, as he worked tirelessly to meet the demands of his new patron.
