János Lundgren stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. As a retired spy, he had seen his fair share of covert operations and clandestine meetings. The kind of places that only came alive after dark.

He spotted her, sipping a coffee at a corner table, her piercing green eyes locked onto his. Ágnes Szabó, an old acquaintance from his espionage days. Their paths crossed often enough, but their conversations always seemed to veer into the realm of the abstract, avoiding any real discussion.

János slid into the seat opposite her, ordering a whiskey as he settled in for what promised to be a long conversation. Ágnes smiled, unfazed by the bartender's raised eyebrow.

"So, János," she said, her voice husky and confident, "I hear you're back from your travels. You've been... absent for quite some time."

He snorted, downing his whiskey in one gulp. "The usual. Countries with nice wine, beautiful women, and questionable morals. What's new with you?"

Ágnes leaned forward, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "I've got a proposition for you, János. A job that requires your... unique set of skills."

János raised an eyebrow. "What makes you think I'm interested?"

"Your reputation precedes you," she said dryly. "Besides, we have a common enemy to deal with. One who's been leaving breadcrumbs all over Europe, and it seems to be getting more brazen by the day."

He leaned back in his chair, intrigued despite himself. Ágnes had always been one for keeping her cards close to her chest, but something about this job resonated with him.

"What's the target?" he asked finally, pulling out a cigarette from his pocket and lighting it with an expert flick of his thumb.

A sly smile spread across Ágnes' face. "Ah, that would be telling. But let's just say our friend has a thing for art and artifacts, and we aim to... reacquaint him with the world."

János chuckled, exhaling a stream of smoke as he set his cigarette in the ashtray. It was going to be a long night.
