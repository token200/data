János Angert stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the familiar scene before him. The sleepy town of Kalocsa was not much changed since he'd left it all those years ago. As János Angert, he had always felt a sense of restlessness, like there was something more out there for him.

He made his way through the crowded station, dodging vendors and pedestrians as he searched for a familiar face. That's when he saw her - Szilvia, his old friend from school. They'd grown up together, exploring the countryside and dreaming of adventures beyond Kalocsa.

Szilvia spotted János Angert first, her eyes lighting up with a warm smile. "János! It's been ages!" she exclaimed, as he dropped his bag onto the platform.

The two friends spent hours catching up, reminiscing about old times and sharing stories of their lives since leaving Kalocsa. Szilvia had become a successful teacher, while János Angert had traveled the world, working odd jobs to make ends meet. As they talked, it became clear that neither of them had ever truly found their place in the world.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the town, János Angert felt a sense of nostalgia wash over him. He'd always known he wanted more out of life, but the comfort and security of Kalocsa had held him back. Szilvia seemed to understand, her eyes sparkling with a knowing glint.

"I've been thinking," she said, as they walked through the quiet streets. "We should start something together. Something that brings us both back home."

János Angert's heart skipped a beat. Could this be the opportunity he'd been waiting for? He looked at Szilvia, his friend and confidante, and knew that with her by his side, anything was possible. As they walked towards the town square, János Angert felt a sense of hope rising up within him, like a beacon guiding him towards an unknown future.

Perhaps it was time for János Angert to put his dreams back on track, with Szilvia by his side to guide him every step of the way. The possibilities seemed endless, and János Angert felt a sense of excitement that he hadn't felt in years.
