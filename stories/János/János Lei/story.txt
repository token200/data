János Lei stood in front of the worn wooden door, hesitating for a moment before pushing it open. He had been searching for this small café for weeks, and finally, he had found it hidden away in a quiet alleyway.

As he stepped inside, the bell above the door jingled, and the owner, an elderly woman with a warm smile, looked up from behind the counter. "Ah, János Lei! Welcome back to my humble abode."

János Lei, whose full name was János István Lei, smiled as he took a seat at the small table by the window. He had always been drawn to this café, where he could escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life and lose himself in a good book.

The owner, who introduced herself as Éva, brought him his usual cup of strong black coffee and a plate of freshly baked croissants. János Lei took a sip of the rich brew and closed his eyes, savoring the flavor. It was moments like these that he cherished, surrounded by the quiet rhythms of the café and the gentle hum of conversation from the other patrons.

As he ate and drank, János István Lei's thoughts turned to his latest writing project. He had been working on a novel for months, pouring his heart and soul into the words. But it was proving difficult, and he often found himself stuck in a creative rut.

Éva, sensing his frustration, reached out and patted his hand with her wrinkled palm. "Don't worry, János Lei," she said softly. "The muse will come when you least expect it. Just keep writing, and the words will flow."

János István Lei smiled, feeling a sense of gratitude towards Éva and this small café that had become his sanctuary. He took another sip of his coffee, feeling invigorated and refreshed, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. As he left the café, he knew that he would be back again soon, surrounded by the comforting rhythms of Éva's world.
