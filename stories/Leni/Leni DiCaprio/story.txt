I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Leni DiCaprio. However, I believe you may be referring to Greta Gerwig's film "Lady Bird" (2017) or Leonardo DiCaprio's sister, Camila DiCaprio is also an actress but not well known yet, another sibling of Leo who has appeared in a few films.

But there is a character named Leni in the movie Lady Bird. Here's a story about her:

Leni was Greta's best friend since childhood. She lived just across the street from Greta and they would spend hours playing together, getting into mischief, and dreaming big. As they grew older, their friendship remained strong despite the ups and downs of adolescence.

Leni was always the free spirit, the rebel, while Greta was more responsible and practical. Leni loved art, music, and poetry, whereas Greta was more into sports and academics. Despite these differences, they balanced each other out perfectly.

In high school, Leni became a fixture in Greta's life, attending her parties, singing along to punk rock anthems, and encouraging Greta to be bold and take risks. She even started a school newspaper with Greta, where they wrote about social justice and activism.

As graduation loomed, Leni began to drift away from Greta's tight-knit group of friends. She left for art school in New York City, chasing her dreams and ambitions. Greta watched from afar as Leni grew into a talented artist, with a unique voice and perspective.

Despite their physical distance, the two remained close, exchanging letters and phone calls whenever they could. When Greta graduated high school, she sent a letter to Leni, expressing her gratitude for being such an important part of her life. Leni wrote back, promising to stay connected and support Greta's endeavors from afar.

Years later, when Greta became the acclaimed filmmaker she is today, Leni was one of the first people she called to share the news. They celebrated over coffee, reminiscing about old times and discussing their latest projects. Their bond remained strong, a testament to the power of true friendship and the impact one person can have on another's life.

Leni DiCaprio, the free-spirited artist, had left an indelible mark on Greta's heart and mind, inspiring her to be brave, take risks, and follow her dreams. And though they lived far apart, their friendship continued to flourish, a reminder that true connections can transcend distance and time.
