Leni Petrovich stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the desolate landscape. She had been away for months, but the familiar contours of the village remained unchanged. The thatched roofs of the cottages, the rusty water pump, and the old oak tree with its gnarled branches - all were still there, waiting for her return.

Leni's thoughts were consumed by the letter she had received from her brother, Viktor, just a week ago. He wrote of his struggles to maintain their family farm, the debts piling up and the creditors breathing down his neck. Leni felt a pang of guilt, knowing that she had left him to face this alone.

As she made her way through the village, the villagers nodded in greeting, but their smiles seemed forced. Leni sensed a tension in the air, a undercurrent of discontent that went beyond mere small talk. She knew that the war was far from over, and its effects were felt here too.

Leni had come back to find that the once-thriving village square was now empty and still. The children who used to play there were either fighting or hiding, and the few women left behind were huddled in their homes, trying to make sense of a world gone mad.

At the center of it all stood Leni's family farm, its fields still productive but its crops stunted by lack of water. Viktor's words echoed in her mind: "Leni, I don't know how much longer we can hold on." She felt a surge of determination - she would do whatever it took to save the farm and bring life back to their village.

As she walked towards the farm, Leni noticed something strange - a small wooden cart parked by the well, adorned with the red emblem of the resistance movement. A note attached to the wheel read: "Meet me at the old windmill tonight at midnight. Come alone." The message was unsigned, but Leni's heart skipped a beat as she realized that this might be her chance to make a real difference.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Leni made her way back to her family's cottage, determined to face whatever lay ahead and fight for the future of their village.
