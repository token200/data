As Leni delved deeper into her investigation, she encountered numerous obstacles and setbacks. But she refused to back down, driven by her determination to expose the truth and bring justice to those affected.

She knew that she had done something important, and that the public deserved to know the truth.

As for Leni herself, she smiled humbly when asked about the praise. "I'm just doing my job," she said. "But it's a privilege to be able to use my skills to make a difference in people's lives." And with that, she returned to her desk, already planning her next move in pursuit of truth and justice.
