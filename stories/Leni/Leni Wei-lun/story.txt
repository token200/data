Leni Wei-lun stood at the edge of the ocean, her long black hair whipping about her face as she gazed out at the waves. The sun was setting over the water, casting a warm golden light across the horizon. She felt a sense of peace wash over her, a sense of belonging to this place.

As a young child, Leni had spent countless hours playing on these beaches, exploring the tide pools and searching for shells. Her parents had owned a small shop just down the road, selling fresh seafood and trinkets to tourists. But when she was old enough, Leni had left home to explore the world beyond her little island.

She had traveled far and wide, working odd jobs and collecting stories. She had met people from all walks of life, each with their own unique struggles and triumphs. And through it all, she had discovered that the greatest journey was within herself.

Leni's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps behind her. She turned to see her old friend, Kaito, approaching her with a curious expression on his face. They had grown up together, exploring the island and sharing secrets.

"What brings you back?" Leni asked, smiling as Kaito joined her at the edge of the water.

"I just needed some time away," Kaito replied, his eyes fixed out to sea. "It's nice to be back."

Leni nodded sympathetically. She knew that feeling all too well. Sometimes, the world could feel overwhelming and suffocating. But in moments like these, when the sun was setting over the ocean, she felt her worries fade away.

As they stood there in silence, a pod of dolphins swam past them, their clicks and whistles echoing through the air. Leni felt a sense of wonder wash over her. These creatures were wild and free, unencumbered by the burdens of the world. They reminded her that even in the darkest moments, beauty could still be found.

After a while, Kaito spoke up again. "I've been thinking about starting my own business," he said, his eyes lighting up with excitement. Leni smiled, happy for him.

"I'd like to help you brainstorm," she replied, her mind already racing with ideas. Together, they spent the next hour tossing around concepts and sharing laughter.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Leni knew that this was where she belonged â€“ on this beach, surrounded by friends, and with the ocean stretching out before her.
