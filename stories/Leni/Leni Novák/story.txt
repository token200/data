Leni Nov√°k was known for her striking appearance and razor-sharp wit. As a renowned journalist, she had made a name for herself by exposing corruption and bringing light to the darkest corners of society. With her sharp mind and quick tongue, Leni had become a thorn in the side of those who sought to hide their secrets.

One day, while investigating a lead on a high-profile case, Leni received an anonymous tip about a mysterious figure known only as "The Architect." The source claimed that this individual was responsible for a string of seemingly unrelated events, all of which seemed to be connected to the city's most powerful elite.

Intrigued by the prospect of uncovering a larger conspiracy, Leni set out to track down The Architect. She scoured the streets, interviewing sources and gathering clues, but every lead seemed to end in a dead-end. It was as if The Architect had vanished into thin air.

Determined to crack the case, Leni turned her attention to the city's most powerful figures, searching for any hint of connection between them and The Architect. She spent long hours poring over documents and conducting private interviews, but it wasn't until she stumbled upon an obscure newspaper article that the pieces finally began to fall into place.

The article revealed a shocking connection between The Architect and one of the city's most influential businessmen, a man named Marcus Thompson. Leni knew she had to confront him, and so she scheduled a meeting with the enigmatic businessman.

As they sat down in his opulent office, Leni noticed that Marcus seemed...off. His smile was too wide, his eyes too calculating. She leaned forward, her eyes locked on his, and asked the question that would change everything: "Who is The Architect?"
