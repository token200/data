With his characteristic decisiveness, Leni ordered a team of soldiers to be dispatched to the merchants' warehouses immediately. He also instructed them to work with the local police to track down the perpetrators and bring them to justice.

As the days passed, the bandits were gradually rounded up, and the merchants' goods were secured. The people of Rome began to notice the change in Leni's favorability towards them, and his popularity soared.
