Leni González stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the cityscape. The sun had just set, casting a warm orange glow over the towering skyscrapers and bustling streets below. She took a deep breath, feeling the cool night air fill her lungs as she tried to clear her mind.

As a successful businesswoman, Leni had it all - wealth, power, and influence. But at what cost? She couldn't shake the feeling of emptiness that seemed to follow her everywhere she went. Her high-profile career had left her few real friends, and even those she did have felt like they were just trying to get close to the "Leni González" persona, rather than the person behind it.

Just then, a gentle voice interrupted her reverie. "Hey, Leno? Can I talk to you for a minute?"

Leni turned to see her assistant, Maria, hovering nervously at the edge of the rooftop. Leni's expression softened as she smiled at Maria's concern. "What's up, M?

Maria hesitated before speaking. "I was just wondering if you've thought about taking a break from work? You seem really stressed out lately."

Leni snorted, feeling a familiar sting of defensiveness. But something about Maria's gentle tone put her on guard. Maybe it was the softness in Maria's eyes, or maybe it was the fact that she was right - Leni did feel like she was burning out.

"I'm fine," Leni said gruffly, but Maria just shook her head.

"Leni, you're not fine. You need to take a step back and recharge. Your people are worried about you."

For a moment, Leni felt a surge of anger at Maria's words. Who was she to tell her what she needed? But then she looked out over the city again, feeling the weight of her exhaustion bear down on her.

Maybe it was time to listen to Maria. Maybe it was time for Leni González to take a break from being "the face" and just be herself.

As she turned back towards Maria, a sense of resolve formed in her chest. She would take a step back from work, and see what happened next. For the first time in a long while, Leni felt like she might actually have a chance to find happiness.
