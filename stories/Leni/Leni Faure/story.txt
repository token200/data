Leni Faure was known for her fiery personality and sharp tongue, but beneath that tough exterior lay a heart of gold. As the lead singer of the indie rock band "Wildflower," Leni had built a reputation as one of the most talented and outspoken musicians in the industry.

Born on a sunny summer day in 1992, Leni Faure grew up with music running through her veins.

One night, after a particularly grueling tour schedule, Leni Faure returned home to her quiet studio apartment in Brooklyn. Exhausted and worn out, she collapsed onto her couch, guitar in hand, and began to strum a melancholy tune.
