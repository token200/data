One evening, as Olivia Jiménez López sipped coffee at a local café, she noticed a young woman sitting across from her, watching her with a mixture of curiosity and admiration. The woman introduced herself as Sophia, a aspiring journalist who looked up to Olivia Jiménez López as a role model.

Sophia confided in Olivia Jiménez López about her own struggles to get published, despite her best efforts.
