With renewed determination, Olivia spent every waking moment preparing for the competition. She worked tirelessly on new pieces, pouring her heart and soul into each one until they were finished. Finally, the day of the judging arrived, and Olivia's nervous excitement was palpable as she waited to hear the results.
