Olivia Nowakowski sat alone in her small apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and fading photographs. She stared blankly at the worn wooden table, the only sound the soft hum of the old record player in the corner.

It had been five years since she'd lost him - five long, agonizing years without a word, without a glimpse of his familiar face or warm smile. The pain still lingered, a constant ache that threatened to consume her whole.

Olivia's mind wandered back to the summer they met, the way he'd laughed at her jokes and listened with an intensity that made her feel seen. They'd danced under the stars, their feet moving in perfect sync as if fate had orchestrated it all. And then, just like that, he was gone.

She rose from her chair, padding over to the record player. A worn copy of Ella Fitzgerald's "Songbird" slipped into the slot, and the sweet, melancholy notes filled the air. Olivia closed her eyes, letting the music wash over her like a bittersweet solace.

As she swayed to the rhythm, memories began to flood back - the way he'd held her hand on long walks along the lake, the late-night conversations that left her breathless with wonder. The pain still lingered, but for a moment, it receded, replaced by a sense of peace.

The door creaked open, and Olivia's best friend, Rachel, slipped in, carrying a plate of fresh-baked cookies. "I brought lunch," she said, setting the plate down on the coffee table. "We've been cooped up for too long."

Olivia smiled weakly, feeling a surge of gratitude towards her friend. It was people like Rachel who kept her grounded, who reminded her that life went on even in the midst of heartache.

As they ate and talked, Olivia began to feel the weight of her grief slowly lifting. Maybe it wouldn't disappear completely, but perhaps, just maybe, she could find a way to live with it - to learn to love again without expecting it to be the same as before.

The record player continued to play softly in the background, Ella's voice soaring through the silence like a beacon of hope. Olivia took a deep breath, feeling a sense of resolve settle within her. It was time to start writing her next chapter - one filled with uncertainty, but also possibility.
