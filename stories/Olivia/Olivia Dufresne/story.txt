Olivia Dufresne stepped out of her small apartment, gazing up at the grey sky that seemed to match her mood. It was a typical Monday morning in the city, with people rushing to and fro, unaware of the turmoil brewing inside her.

As she walked to work, Olivia's mind wandered back to the argument she had with her best friend, Emma, the night before. They had been inseparable since college, but a misunderstanding about a past mistake had driven them apart. Olivia couldn't shake off the feeling that she was losing herself in this friendship.

She arrived at her job as a graphic designer and tried to focus on her work, but every time she opened a new file or clicked the mouse, she thought of Emma's words: "You're not good enough, Liv." The sting still lingered, making it hard for her to concentrate.

Just then, her phone buzzed with an unexpected text from an old flame, Jack. They had parted ways after graduation, but he had always held a special place in Olivia's heart. Their friendship remained strong over the years, and she knew she could count on him anytime.

"Hey, Liv," his message read. "Need some company today? I'm free if you want to grab coffee."

Olivia hesitated for a moment before responding with a simple "yes." There was something about Jack's easy smile that made her feel like she could be herself around him. Maybe it was time to take a break from the stress and confront the doubts plaguing her mind.

At the coffee shop, Jack arrived early, holding a cup of steaming hot coffee. They hugged warmly, exchanging gentle banter as they sat down at a cozy table by the window.

"So, what's going on?" Jack asked, noticing Olivia's subdued demeanor.

She took a sip of her own coffee and began to open up about her argument with Emma and the lingering feelings of inadequacy. Jack listened attentively, his expression softening with every word.

"You're amazing, Liv," he said softly. "Your talents shine bright in every project you work on. And as for your friendship... we'll figure it out together."

In that moment, Olivia felt a weight lift off her shoulders. With Jack's words ringing in her ears, she knew that she wasn't alone and that the uncertainty was just an illusion.

As they sipped their coffee in silence, Olivia realized that sometimes all it takes is someone to believe in you to turn your world around.
