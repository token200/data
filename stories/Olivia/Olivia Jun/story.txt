Emma hesitated before speaking up again. "It's...it's a bit unusual. We don't usually use rhubarb in savory dishes." Olivia Jun smiled, her eyes sparkling with excitement. "That's exactly why I want to try it," she said. "It will add a unique twist to our menu."

With Emma's support, Olivia Jun set to work incorporating the rhubarb into the evening's specials.
