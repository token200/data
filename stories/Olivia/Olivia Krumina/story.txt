As she worked on her latest piece, "Echoes in the Night," Olivia found herself drawn into a world of surreal landscapes and symbolism. She spent hours perfecting every detail, pouring her emotions and thoughts onto the canvas. Her studio was filled with an assortment of eclectic trinkets and books that inspired her work.
