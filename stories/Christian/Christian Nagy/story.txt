Christian Nagy stepped out of his small apartment and took a deep breath, letting the cool morning air fill his lungs. As he began his daily routine, the city outside seemed to come alive with sounds and smells. He walked towards the local bakery, where the owner, Madame Dupont, greeted him with a warm smile.

Christian had known Madame Dupont since he was a child. She would often save him a croissant or two when his mother couldn't afford them. Over the years, their friendship had grown stronger. She'd listen to his stories and offer words of encouragement whenever he needed it.

As Christian waited in line for his usual morning pastry, his mind wandered back to his life as an orphan. He had been shuffled from one foster home to another until Madame Dupont took him under her wing. For the first time, he felt a sense of belonging.

Madame Dupont handed him a flaky, buttery croissant, and Christian's eyes lit up with gratitude. She patted his hand and whispered, "Today will be a good day, Christian."

He took a bite of his pastry and walked to the local park, where children were playing and laughing together. He watched them for a while, feeling a pang of longing. What would it have been like if he had parents to take him on trips or attend school with friends?

But as he continued on his walk, Christian noticed a small boy sitting alone on a bench, staring at the ground. The child looked no older than 10 years old, with eyes that seemed to hold a world of sorrow.

Christian's heart went out to the little boy, and without thinking twice, he knelt down beside him. "Hey, what's wrong?" Christian asked softly.
