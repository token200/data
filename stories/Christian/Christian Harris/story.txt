Christian Harris stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, his eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of movement. As a former cop turned private investigator, he had seen his fair share of dark corners and seedy characters. But tonight was different.

He was here to meet an old acquaintance, one who owed him a favor. The streets were empty, save for the distant hum of a neon sign flickering like a siren's call. Christian lit a cigarette, feeling the familiar crunch of nicotine as it hit his lungs.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the darkness. It was Vinnie "The Bull" LaRosa, a notorious small-time mobster with a penchant for violence and a reputation for being untouchable. Christian had a deal to make with him – one that required a delicate touch.

Vinnie slid into the alleyway beside Christian, his eyes squinting against the cigarette smoke. "What's this about, Harris?" he growled, his voice like a rumble of thunder.

Christian snubbed out his cigarette and pulled up his jacket, revealing the tattoo of a badge on his left bicep. "I heard you had some info on my sister," he said, his tone measured. "Info about her involvement with the Morano family."

Vinnie raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. Christian knew that look – it was the one that signaled he had something to sell.

The two men stood in silence for a moment, the only sound the distant thrum of a bassline from the nightclub across the street. Then Vinnie spoke up, his voice dripping with menace. "I might know something, Harris. But it's going to cost you."

Christian nodded, knowing he had to tread carefully. He handed over the cash, and Vinnie produced a folder containing a single sheet of paper with a single address on it.

"My sister," Christian said, his eyes scanning the address. "That's where she is."

He tucked the folder into his pocket and turned to leave. As he did, Vinnie called out after him. "Be careful, Harris. The Morano family don't take kindly to strangers."

Christian smiled wryly, knowing that was an understatement. He vanished into the night, ready to face whatever lay ahead – armed with nothing but his wits and a determination to uncover the truth about his sister's disappearance.
