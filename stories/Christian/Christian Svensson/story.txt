Christian Svensson stepped into the dimly lit bar, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. He spotted her sitting alone at the end of the bar, sipping on a whiskey on the rocks. It had been months since they'd last seen each other, but Christian knew he could always count on Emma to be there.

As he approached her, she looked up and smiled, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "Hey," she said, her voice low and husky. Christian slid onto the stool beside her, feeling a sense of comfort wash over him.

They chatted for a while, catching up on each other's lives. Emma had just finished grad school, and was now working as a freelance writer. Christian, on the other hand, had taken a break from his music to focus on himself. It was a necessary step, he told her, but it was hard not to feel restless without something creative to channel.

As they talked, Christian couldn't help but think about how far Emma had come. She'd always been the driven one, the one who pushed herself to be better every day. He admired that about her, even if it sometimes made him a little jealous.

After a while, Emma finished her drink and stood up, stretching her arms over her head. "I should probably get going," she said, glancing at Christian. But he just shook his head, taking another sip of his own drink.

"I'm not done talking to you yet," he said, grinning. Emma laughed, a soft sound that made Christian feel all warm inside. They spent the rest of the night lost in conversation, sharing stories and laughter like they used to when they were younger.

As the bar began to close, Christian knew it was time for him to leave too. He walked Emma out into the cool night air, feeling grateful for the chance encounter. "Thanks for tonight," he said, his voice low and sincere. Emma smiled up at him, her eyes shining with a warmth that made Christian's heart skip a beat.

"Anytime," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.
