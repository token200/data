The 25-year-old fashion designer was on a mission to find the perfect fabrics for his upcoming collection. As he navigated through the vibrant throng, Christian's mind wandered back to his childhood in Montreal, where his passion for fashion first began.

Growing up, Christian spent hours poring over fashion magazines and sketchbooks, dreaming of one day showcasing his designs on the world's biggest runways.

He stopped at a stall run by a elderly woman who sold hand-woven silk scarves from Tunisia. The softness of the fabric caught his eye, and he couldn't resist buying several yards.

Next, Christian visited a local weaver who specialized in traditional Provençal cotton prints. The vibrant colors and intricate patterns on display transported him back to his childhood summers spent playing in the French countryside. He bought several rolls of the beautiful fabric, envisioning how it would add depth and texture to his designs.
