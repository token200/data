Christian Sharma sat alone in his small apartment, staring blankly at the wall as he sipped on a cup of cold coffee. It had been months since his mother passed away, and the pain still lingered like an open wound. As he thought back to all the memories they shared, a faint smile crept onto his face.

Christian Sharma was a writer, or at least he tried to be. He spent most of his days holed up in this apartment, scribbling away in his journal and struggling to come up with something worthwhile. His mother had always been his biggest supporter, encouraging him to chase his dreams no matter how impossible they seemed.

As he wandered around the room, Christian Sharma's eyes landed on a photo of himself and his mother. They were both smiling, arms wrapped around each other in a tight hug. He remembered the day that picture was taken like it was yesterday. His mother had taken him to the beach for the first time, and they had spent hours building sandcastles and collecting seashells.

The memories came flooding back as Christian Sharma sat down at his desk, picked up his pen, and began to write. The words flowed effortlessly onto the page, telling the story of his childhood, of his mother's love and support. Tears pricked at the corners of his eyes as he wrote, feeling a sense of peace wash over him.

As the sun began to set outside, Christian Sharma finally put down his pen, exhausted but exhilarated. He had written something beautiful, something that truly captured the essence of who he was. For the first time in months, he felt like he could face the world again, armed with the knowledge that his mother's love would always be with him.

Christian Sharma smiled to himself, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over him. He knew that his mother would be proud of him too, and that thought gave him the strength to keep going, to keep writing and telling his story to the world.
