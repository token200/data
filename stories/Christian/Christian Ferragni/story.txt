Christian Michele Ferragni was born to build an empire. As a young boy growing up in Sardinia, Italy, he had big dreams and a passion for fashion that would eventually take him to the top of the industry.

After studying business administration at the Politecnico di Milano, Christian decided to pursue his true calling - becoming a successful entrepreneur.

One day, Christian announced that he was expecting his first child with his husband, Thiago de Freitas Silva. The news sent shockwaves through the fashion world, but Christian's devoted fans rallied around him, wishing him all the best for this new chapter in his life.

As a devoted father-to-be, Christian took some time off from his empire to focus on family planning. He often shared updates about his pregnancy and baby bump photos with his followers, who couldn't get enough of his adorable outfits and charming personality.

When his little one arrived, Christian was over the moon. As he juggled parenthood with his business ventures, he proved that even the busiest of people can make time for love and family. His full name may have become synonymous with style and entrepreneurship, but now it's also a testament to the importance of balance in life.
