Thierry Sikora was a man with a mysterious past. He had no memory of his childhood, and the only clue to his identity was a small tattoo of a snake coiled around his left wrist. The tattoo seemed to be his sole connection to his family, but he knew nothing about them.

As he walked through the bustling streets of Paris, Thierry couldn't shake off the feeling that he was being watched. He had always been on the move, never staying in one place for too long. It was as if he was hiding from something - or someone.

One day, while working at a small café in Montmartre, Thierry stumbled upon an old woman who claimed to know him. She introduced herself as Madame Dupont, and told Thierry that he was her nephew. The revelation sparked a flurry of questions, but before he could ask any, the old woman slipped away without explanation.

Thierry spent the next few days trying to piece together his past. He scoured through old records and newspapers, searching for any mention of his name. It wasn't until he stumbled upon an article about a young boy who went missing in the early 1990s that the puzzle began to fall into place.

The missing boy was identified as Thierry Sikora, age 10. His disappearance had sent shockwaves through the small town of Étampes-sur-Seine, where he lived with his family. But there was a strange twist: Thierry's parents were never found, and their whereabouts remained a mystery.

Thierry felt like he was staring into the face of his own identity crisis. Was he truly the son of two people who had vanished into thin air? He couldn't shake off the feeling that Madame Dupont had been telling the truth - but why?

As he delved deeper into the mystery, Thierry found himself entangled in a web of secrets and lies. There were whispers of a secret organization, known only as "The Phoenix," which was rumored to have been involved in the disappearance of many young children.

Thierry's eyes narrowed as he considered the possibility that his entire life had been orchestrated by this enigmatic group. He knew one thing for sure: he would stop at nothing to uncover the truth about himself and his past. The hunt had begun, and Thierry was ready to face whatever lay ahead, snake tattoo and all.
