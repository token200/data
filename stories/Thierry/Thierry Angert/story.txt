A brilliant detective with a reputation for solving the most complex cases, Thierry had built a name for himself in the city's underground crime scene.

He watched as she quickly left the premises, disappearing into the night.

Thierry followed at a safe distance, his eyes locked on the woman's fleeing figure. As he turned a corner, he spotted her enter a dilapidated warehouse on the outskirts of town. Without hesitation, Thierry sprang into action, bursting through the door and confronting the mysterious woman.

"Who are you?" Thierry demanded, his voice firm but controlled. The woman hesitated before revealing her true identity - one that would send shockwaves throughout the city's underworld.
