Thierry was born to a Taiwanese mother and French father, and this multicultural upbringing had instilled in him a unique perspective on life. He grew up surrounded by the vibrant colors and textures of traditional Taiwanese art, yet his mother's love of Impressionism had instilled in him a deep appreciation for the softer, more ethereal side of art.

As Thierry Yi-hsien navigated the streets of Taipei, he was drawn to the city's many markets and alleyways. There, he discovered a world of colors and textures that rivaled anything he'd ever seen in galleries or museums. He spent hours watching the artisans at work, mesmerized by their skill and creativity.

But Thierry Yi-hsien wasn't content to simply admire from afar; he wanted to create art that captured the essence of Taipei itself. And so, he set up his easel on a street corner, paintbrush in hand, and began to capture the city's frenetic energy on canvas.

As passersby stopped to watch him work, Thierry Yi-hsien would smile and chat with them, sharing stories about the different neighborhoods and landmarks that inspired his art. People were drawn to his infectious enthusiasm, and soon a crowd had gathered around him, eager to see what he'd create next.

In that moment, Thierry Yi-hsien knew he was exactly where he belonged â€“ in the heart of Taipei, surrounded by the people and the art that fueled his passion. And as the sun dipped below the city's towering skyscrapers, casting a warm orange glow over the scene, Thierry Yi-hsien smiled to himself, knowing that this was just the beginning of an incredible journey.
