Thierry Laurent Huffington was known for his unconventional approach to art and life. A French-American entrepreneur, he had made his fortune by selling his early online business, Odeo, for $100 million. However, it wasn't his business acumen that defined him, but rather his passion for art.

After buying the Paris Review in 2006, Thierry Huffington transformed it into a digital platform, allowing artists to showcase their work and connect with each other globally. His vision was to democratize access to art, making it more inclusive and accessible to people from all walks of life.

He was always drawn to the avant-garde movement, which emphasized experimentation and pushing boundaries. As he grew older, his love for art only deepened, and he began to collect modern and contemporary works by artists like Cy Twombly and Robert Rauschenberg.

In 2007, Thierry Huffington created the website Artsy, a digital platform that allowed art lovers to discover new artists, learn about their work, and buy art online. The site quickly gained popularity, becoming a go-to destination for collectors, galleries, and artists alike.

Despite his success in the business world, Thierry remained committed to his passion for art. He was always on the lookout for emerging talent, supporting artists like Ai Weiwei and Takashi Murakami. His love for art was infectious, and soon, he had attracted a community of like-minded individuals who shared his enthusiasm.

In 2017, Thierry Huffington stepped down as CEO of Artsy, citing a desire to focus on his philanthropic efforts. He continued to support artists and charities, using his platform to amplify marginalized voices and promote social justice.
