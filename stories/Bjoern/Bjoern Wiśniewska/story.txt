One day, while traveling in Southeast Asia, Bjoern stumbled upon a small village in Cambodia that she had never seen before. The villagers welcomed her with open arms, and she soon found herself participating in their daily rituals and traditions. It was there that she discovered a hidden talent for traditional Khmer dance.
