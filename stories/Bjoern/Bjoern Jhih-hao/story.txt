Bjoern Jhih-hao stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small town that seemed frozen in time. He had come to this place searching for answers about his family's past, and a sense of belonging he thought he'd never find.

As a child, Bjoern Jhih-hao had heard whispers of a mysterious clan that roamed the countryside, leaving behind only faint marks on the land they traversed. His parents had dismissed it as mere myth, but something about those stories resonated deep within him.

Now, as an adult, Bjoern Jhih-hao was determined to uncover the truth. He walked into town, his worn boots making soft clicks on the pavement, and approached a small caf√© that seemed to be the only place bustling with activity. Inside, he found an old man sipping tea and staring out at the world outside.

"Can I help you?" the old man asked gruffly, as Bjoern Jhih-hao slid onto a stool across from him.

"I'm looking for information about my family," Bjoern Jhih-hao said, his voice barely above a whisper. "Specifically, about a group called the K'zargi clan."

The old man's eyes narrowed, and he set down his cup with a clatter. "What makes you think they exist?" he asked, a hint of curiosity in his voice.

Bjoern Jhih-hao pulled out a small notebook from his backpack, filled with notes and sketches from his travels. The old man's expression changed to one of surprise, as he scanned the pages.

"You've been tracking them," the old man said, his voice laced with awe. "I thought you were just a curious outsider."

Bjoern Jhih-hao nodded, feeling a sense of connection to this stranger that he couldn't quite explain. "I've always felt like there's something missing in my life," he admitted. "And I think it might be connected to the K'zargi."

The old man leaned forward, his eyes locked on Bjoern Jhih-hao's face. "You're looking for your roots, aren't you?" he asked softly.

Bjoern Jhih-hao nodded again, feeling a lump form in his throat. He had always known that his parents had been keeping secrets from him, and now he finally had someone to turn to.

The old man reached out and placed a gnarled hand on Bjoern Jhih-hao's shoulder. "Welcome home," he said, with a warm smile.
