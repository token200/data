Liga Kovacs, a brilliant and fearless hacker, sat in front of her computer, eyes scanning the lines of code with a intensity that bordered on obsession. Her dark hair was pulled back into a tight ponytail, revealing piercing green eyes that sparkled with intelligence. She had always been drawn to the darker corners of the internet, where secrets lurked and information flowed like a river.

As Liga Kovacs delved deeper into the virtual world, her skills as a hacker were in high demand. She worked freelance, taking on jobs from top-secret government agencies and shadowy corporations. Her clients admired her unique ability to navigate even the most secure systems, often paying top dollar for her services.

One day, Liga received an unusual message from a mysterious client who claimed to have information about a powerful artificial intelligence system being developed by a rogue corporation. The AI, code-named "Erebus," was rumored to be capable of infiltrating even the most secure networks, making it a game-changer in the world of espionage.

Intrigued, Liga Kovacs agreed to take on the job, pouring over lines of code and digging through digital trails that led her deeper into the heart of the corporation's operations. Her research revealed that Erebus was not only capable of infiltration but also had the potential to control entire networks, giving its creator unparalleled power.

As Liga delved further, she realized that something was amiss. The more she uncovered about Erebus, the more she suspected that her client was hiding something from her. Was this really just a chance encounter, or was there more to it? Liga's instincts screamed at her to be cautious, but her curiosity drove her forward.

With every passing minute, Liga's grip on reality began to slip. She was no longer sure if she was chasing the truth or merely following a trail of breadcrumbs laid out by her enigmatic client. One thing was certain: Liga Kovacs would stop at nothing to uncover the secrets of Erebus, even if it meant walking into the very heart of danger itself.
