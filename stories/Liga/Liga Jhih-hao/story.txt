In the bustling streets of Taipei, a young woman named Liga Jhih-hao stood out among the crowds. Her long, dark hair was tied back in a ponytail, and her bright smile could light up even the darkest of alleys. As the daughter of a renowned martial arts master, Liga had been trained in the ancient art of Tai Chi since she was a child.

Liga's parents had hoped that their talented daughter would one day follow in their footsteps and become a master herself. However, Liga's true passion lay elsewhere - in music. She spent most of her free time playing the erhu, a traditional Chinese instrument that required great skill and finesse to master.

One evening, as Liga was practicing her scales on the rooftop of her family's martial arts school, she noticed a group of thugs attempting to steal valuable artifacts from the nearby museum. Without hesitation, Liga sprang into action. Using her Tai Chi skills, she took down the would-be thieves with ease, her movements so fluid and precise that it seemed almost supernatural.

The police arrived soon after, and they were amazed by Liga's agility and quick thinking. As they took the thugs away, one of the officers approached Liga's parents, who had been watching from a distance. "Your daughter is quite the talented young woman," he said, nodding in respect. "She has a true gift for martial arts."

Liga's mother smiled proudly, knowing that her daughter was destined for great things. "Yes, she has always shown a natural talent for Tai Chi," she replied. "But music will always be her first love." Liga's eyes sparkled with excitement as she thought about her next erhu practice - the sound of the instrument was like nothing else to her.

As the night wore on, Liga returned to her family's school, where she was greeted with a hero's welcome. Her parents were overjoyed to see their daughter in action, and they knew that Liga Jhih-hao was truly destined for greatness - whether in martial arts or music, she would shine brightly wherever she went.
