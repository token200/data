Liga Michielin stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar streets of Rome. It had been five years since she'd left this city, driven by a sense of restlessness and discontent with her life as Liga Alexandra Michielin, heiress to the Michielin textile empire.

Now, Liga stood on her own two feet, armed with nothing but a worn passport and a small savings account. She had sold everything – property, art, and even most of her belongings – to fund her journey around the world. The experience had been transformative, teaching her the value of hard work and human connection in a way that wealth never could.

As she walked through the winding streets, Liga felt a sense of peace settle over her. She passed by the ancient forum, where children played tag among the crumbling columns, and the Trevi Fountain, whose waters seemed to whisper secrets to those who listened closely. It was a city reborn in her mind – a place where art and life blended seamlessly together.

Eventually, Liga arrived at the small apartment she'd rented for the duration of her stay. She spent the afternoon unpacking, sorting through her belongings with a newfound sense of purpose. As she settled into her new space, Liga felt the weight of her name begin to lift. For the first time in years, she allowed herself to call out simply "Liga," rather than Liga Alexandra Michielin.

In that moment, she realized that she had finally shed the skin of her former life, embracing a simpler, more authentic self. The world was full of possibilities, and Liga felt ready to explore them all – as Liga, not Liga Alexandra Michielin. She smiled, feeling the warmth of the sun on her face, and knew that this time, she would find her own path, without the burden of expectation or reputation. With a sense of liberation, Liga closed her eyes, letting the city's rhythms lull her into a well-deserved rest.
