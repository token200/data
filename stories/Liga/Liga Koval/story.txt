Liga Koval was a young and ambitious journalist who had always been driven to uncover the truth. Born and raised in the small town of Krasnohorskyj, Liga's curiosity and passion for investigation had taken her far from home. Now, as a reporter for the influential newspaper, Kiev Times, Liga was determined to make a name for herself in the cutthroat world of journalism.

Liga's latest assignment was to investigate a string of mysterious disappearances in the outskirts of Kiev. The police were stumped, and the local community was on edge. Liga was determined to get to the bottom of the story, no matter what it took. She spent countless hours poring over documents, interviewing witnesses, and following leads.

As she delved deeper into the investigation, Liga began to notice a pattern. All of the missing persons had one thing in common: they had all been involved with the local construction company, Krasnohorskyj Builders. Liga's instincts told her that there was more to this story than met the eye.

Determined to get closer to the truth, Liga paid a visit to the CEO of Krasnohorskyj Builders, a wealthy and influential businessman named Viktor Petrov. Viktor was a man known for his ruthless tactics and disregard for the law, and Liga knew that she had to tread carefully if she wanted to uncover any evidence.

As she sat across from Viktor in his opulent office, Liga couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. She watched as he smoothly spun her questions, avoiding any direct answers about the disappearances. But Liga was not one to be deterred. She pressed on, determined to expose the truth behind the mysterious disappearances.

As she left Viktor's office, Liga felt a sense of satisfaction wash over her. She had gotten a glimpse into the inner workings of Krasnohorskyj Builders, and she knew that she would be back with more questions. The game was on, and Liga Koval was ready to play.
