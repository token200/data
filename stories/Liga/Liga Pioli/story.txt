Liga Pioli stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar town. She had been on the move for weeks, trying to escape the memories that haunted her. As a renowned detective, Liga had solved some of the city's most baffling cases, but she couldn't shake the feeling of emptiness within.

Liga made her way through the cobblestone streets, taking in the quaint shops and cafes. She had been told this was the perfect place to lay low for a while, to recharge before diving back into her work. But as she walked, she couldn't help but feel like an outsider.

As she turned a corner, Liga spotted a small antique shop tucked away on a side street. She pushed open the door and stepped inside, where the scent of old books and dust wafted through the air. The shopkeeper, an elderly man with kind eyes, looked up from behind the counter.

"Welcome, young one," he said, his voice warm. "I'm glad you found my humble shop."

Liga smiled, feeling a sense of belonging for the first time since her arrival. She browsed the shelves, running her fingers over the intricate carvings and worn leather bindings.

"You're Liga Pioli, the detective?" the shopkeeper asked, his eyes lighting up with recognition.

I am," she replied, surprised by the accuracy.

The shopkeeper nodded knowingly. "I've heard of you. You have a reputation for being one of the best in the business."

Liga chuckled, feeling a flutter in her chest. She had always prided herself on her ability to stay focused, but there was something about this stranger's kind words that made her feel seen.

As she prepared to leave, the shopkeeper handed her a small package wrapped in brown paper. "A gift," he said with a smile. "Open it when you need something to lift your spirits."

Liga smiled, feeling a sense of gratitude towards this mysterious man and his quaint little shop. Maybe, just maybe, Liga Pioli had found a new place to call home.
