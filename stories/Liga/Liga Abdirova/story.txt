Liga Abdirova was a force to be reckoned with in the competitive world of extreme sports. A Russian-born, Kazakhstani-raised thrill-seeker, Liga had always been drawn to the rush of adrenaline that came with taking risks. She had spent her early years working as a stunt double for film and television productions, but it wasn't until she stumbled upon parkour that she truly found her calling.

Liga Abdirova's athleticism and agility allowed her to navigate the urban landscape with ease, dodging pedestrians and leaping over obstacles with precision.
