Liga Mercier stepped out of her small apartment and onto the bustling streets of Tokyo. The neon lights of the city's skyscrapers reflected off the wet pavement as she made her way to the local park for a solo jog.

As Liga ran, her mind focused on the upcoming tournament, where she would be competing against some of the world's best ninjas. Born with a rare genetic mutation that allowed her to harness the energy of ki, Liga had spent years honing her skills in the ancient art of ninja combat.

At just 25 years old, Liga Mercier was already an accomplished ninja and one of the most sought-after mercenaries on the black market. She had fought for everything from high-stakes treasure hunting expeditions to covert ops for wealthy clients, but she never let her work compromise her values or morals.

As she entered the park, Liga noticed a group of locals eyeing her suspiciously - a rare phenomenon in Tokyo, where outsiders were often met with hostility. But Liga's unique aura and striking features, which had been honed through centuries of ninja training, commanded respect rather than fear.

With a nod to herself, Liga began her warm-up routine, executing flawless flips and strikes on the wooden beams set up for her practice sessions. She was focused on perfecting her signature move: the Celestial Claw, a devastating technique that left opponents stumbling in agony.

A voice interrupted her concentration, calling out from behind. "Liga Mercier! You're looking particularly fierce tonight." Liga turned to see Kenji, her friend and fellow ninja mentor, grinning at her with a knowing glint in his eye.

"Lena-san," she replied, with a hint of mischief. It was an inside joke - the nickname Lena that only a handful knew had been passed down through generations of Liga's family, and even fewer understood its significance.

With renewed energy, Liga dove into her training session, unleashing a whirlwind of kicks, punches, and ki blasts onto the park's wooden structures. The wind ruffled her hair as she executed flawless combinations, each one building her strength for the trials ahead.

When she finally emerged from her workout, panting heavily but exhilarated, Kenji offered her a knowing smile. "You're going to crush that tournament, Liga. I can feel it." With a nod of gratitude, Liga took to the night air once more, her eyes fixed firmly on the challenges that awaited her in the shadows of Tokyo's underbelly.
