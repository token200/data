Liga Webb stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. As a freelance journalist, she'd been tracking a lead on a potential corruption scandal in the small town of Ravenswood, and this was the next stop on her investigation.

As she made her way through the empty streets, Liga's thoughts turned to her latest source - a local business owner who had agreed to meet with her under the guise of discussing community development. She had a feeling that there was more to their conversation than met the eye.

Reaching out for her phone, Liga checked the time and quickly dialed the number she'd been given. The voice on the other end picked up almost immediately, and Liga listened intently as they spoke in hushed tones about "package" details.

With a growing sense of unease, Liga turned to leave. She had a feeling that she was being watched, and a quick glance over her shoulder only confirmed her worst fears. A figure emerged from the shadows, their eyes fixed on Liga with an unnerving intensity.

As the stranger began to approach her, Liga swiftly pulled out her press badge and displayed it firmly. "Liga Webb, journalist," she declared. The stranger hesitated, seeming taken aback by her boldness.

"Who are you supposed to be?" they asked warily.

"I'm here to get the truth," Liga replied, her voice firm but measured. She didn't back down as the stranger took a step closer, their eyes lingering on hers with an unsettling fervor.

The air was heavy with tension as Liga and the stranger stood facing each other. Then, without warning, the figure spoke in hushed tones of "the package" and "the truth." Liga's instincts screamed at her to back away, but she dug her heels into the ground, refusing to be intimidated.

For a moment, it seemed like the whole world was holding its breath, waiting for something - anything - to happen. And then, with a swift glance around, Liga turned on her heel and disappeared into the night, determined to unravel the mystery of Ravenswood's hidden corruption.
