Liga Rothbauer stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, her eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of trouble. As a skilled assassin and mercenary, she had faced countless dangers in her line of work, but this job felt different. It was personal.

Liga's thoughts drifted back to her past, when she was still known as Lena Rothbauer, a young orphan living on the streets of New Haven. She had grown up quickly, relying on her wits and cunning to survive. But after a fateful encounter with a group of ruthless thugs, Liga had undergone a transformation, shedding her old identity like a skin.

Now, she was Liga Rothbauer, feared and respected by those who knew her true worth. Her latest client, a wealthy entrepreneur named Marcus, had hired her to take out a rival businessman, Victor Vex. Liga had accepted the job without hesitation, sensing that there was more to it than met the eye.

As she entered the luxurious high-rise building where Victor resided, Liga's instincts screamed at her to be cautious. She moved stealthily through the corridors, avoiding security cameras and guards with ease. Her target was waiting for her in his penthouse office, surrounded by expensive artwork and lavish furnishings.

Liga approached him calmly, a hint of curiosity on her face. "Victor Vex," she said, her voice dripping with disdain. "I'm here to collect my payment."

The older man sneered at her, but Liga could see the fear lurking behind his eyes. She had discovered that Victor was involved in some shady dealings, and Marcus wanted him silenced.

With a swift motion, Liga ended Victor's life, feeling no remorse for her actions. It was what she did best â€“ kill on command. As she collected her payment and made her escape, Liga couldn't help but wonder if she had made a mistake by taking on this job. But the truth was, Liga Rothbauer didn't get involved in things that didn't concern her.

She disappeared into the night, leaving behind a trail of bodies and broken dreams, forever changing the world around her.
