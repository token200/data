Liga Ahmed stepped onto the worn asphalt of the old basketball court, her eyes scanning the familiar landscape. She had spent countless hours here as a child, practicing her jump shot and perfecting her fadeaway. Now, as a young adult, Liga was back to revisit her roots.

As she began to warm up, a group of kids gathered around her, watching with wide eyes as she effortlessly sank shot after shot. One of them, a scrappy little girl with a mop of curly hair, approached Liga and asked for advice on how to improve her own game.

Liga smiled and took the girl's hand, leading her through a series of drills that would help her develop her footwork and balance. As they worked together, Liga couldn't help but think back to her own early days on this very court. She had been known as one of the best players in school, and she had always dreamed of playing at the next level.

Years later, Liga's hard work and determination had paid off. She was now a star player on the local women's basketball team, and she had even caught the attention of college scouts. But despite all her success, Liga knew that she still owed a debt to this old court and the community that had supported her from the very beginning.

As the sun began to set, Liga called out to the kids to gather around her once more. This time, she pulled out a small ball and began to dribble it, weaving in and out of cones with ease. The kids cheered as she performed trick after trick, each one landing with precision and skill.

When she finally finished, Liga looked out over the group, her eyes shining with pride. "Remember, practice is key," she said, her voice carrying across the court. "Never give up on your dreams, no matter how hard things get." The kids nodded eagerly, their faces set with determination. And as they packed up to leave, Liga knew that a new generation of basketball stars was being born.
