Liga Kaminska stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the crowded station for any sign of her brother, Maksim. She had received a cryptic message from him just hours before, saying only that he needed to meet with her in person. Liga's instincts told her that something was off, but she couldn't shake the feeling that this was important.

As she made her way through the throngs of people, Liga's mind wandered back to their childhood. She and Maksim had grown up on the streets of Prague, always relying on each other for survival. They had lost their parents at a young age, and it was Liga who had taken on the responsibility of caring for her brother. But now, as adults, they were living separate lives. Maksim had disappeared years ago, and Liga had assumed he was dead.

She spotted a figure in the distance, dressed in black, and her heart skipped a beat. It was him. She quickened her pace, weaving through the crowds until she reached his side. He turned to face her, his eyes locking onto hers with an intensity that made her skin prickle.

"Liga," he said softly, using their given name for the first time in years. "I've been waiting for you."

Liga's mind was racing. What did Maksim want from her? Why had he come back now? But before she could ask any questions, he reached out and took her arm, pulling her through the station.

They emerged into a narrow alleyway, lined with crumbling buildings and flickering streetlights. Liga felt like she was stepping into another world. "Come," Maksim said, his voice low and urgent. "We need to talk."

Liga followed him, her senses on high alert. She had no idea what lay ahead, but she was ready for anything. For the first time in years, she felt like herself again â€“ Liga Kaminska, the person who knew her brother's secrets.

As they walked, Liga realized that Maksim's message had been more than just a plea for help. It had been a warning. And now, as they disappeared into the shadows, Liga wondered what other surprises lay in store for her.
