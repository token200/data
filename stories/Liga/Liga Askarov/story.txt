Liga Askarov was known for her unyielding spirit and unwavering dedication to justice. As a renowned detective in the city of Ashkabad, she had built a reputation for solving cases that others deemed impossible. Her sharp mind and keen instincts made her a force to be reckoned with, and those who crossed paths with Liga Askarov often found themselves intimidated by her unrelenting pursuit of truth.

Liga's latest case was particularly intriguing - the disappearance of wealthy businessman, Rashid Aliyev. The police were stumped, and the family was beside themselves with worry. Liga saw this as an opportunity to prove herself once again, and she threw herself into the investigation with characteristic fervor.

As she dug deeper, Liga discovered a web of deceit that went all the way to the top of Ashkabad's elite.
