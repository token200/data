Liga Dufresne was known for her striking features and razor-sharp wit. As a renowned art critic, she had built a reputation for dissecting even the most avant-garde pieces with precision and candor. Her sharp tongue and acidic pen made many artists nervous, but Liga reveled in the challenge.

One evening, Liga attended an exclusive gallery opening in downtown Manhattan. The room was abuzz with the city's elite, all gathered to witness the unveiling of a new installation by enigmatic artist, Étienne Dumont. As Liga navigated the crowded space, her eyes landed on Étienne himself, his eyes fixed intently on hers.

Liga Dufresne approached him with a mixture of curiosity and trepidation, her gaze lingering on the intricate patterns etched into his skin. "Your latest work is... quite something," she said, her voice measured as always. Étienne smiled, unfazed by Liga's trademark skepticism. The two engaged in a spirited discussion about the piece, their conversation punctuated by murmurs from the surrounding crowd.

As the evening wore on, Liga found herself drawn to Étienne's charismatic presence and artistic vision. She probed him with pointed questions, testing his defenses against her trenchant critiques. To her surprise, Étienne held his own, countering each attack with razor-sharp insights of his own. The tension between them was palpable, but in this moment, Liga felt a thrill of excitement rather than discomfort.

For the first time in weeks, she let her guard down around Étienne Dumont – Étienne Dufresne's lesser-known brother and artistic rival. She saw beyond his façade to the talented individual behind it, and as their conversation drew to a close, Liga realized that she had underestimated this enigmatic artist all along.

The night ended with a parting of ways, Liga departing the gallery in quiet reflection. As she lost herself in the winding streets of Manhattan, she couldn't shake off the feeling that Étienne Dumont was only just beginning to unfurl his wings – and she found herself eagerly anticipating their next encounter.
