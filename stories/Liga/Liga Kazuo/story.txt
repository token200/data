Liga Kazuo stood atop the wind-swept rooftop, gazing out over the cityscape below. Her raven-black hair whipped about her pale face as she inhaled the salty air, a habit she'd developed during her years spent sailing the high seas.

Born Liga Elara Kazuo, to a family of renowned shipwrights, Liga had always felt stifled by the conventions of her upbringing. As a child, she'd spent countless hours watching her father work, fascinated by the way he coaxed shape from raw wood and seaweed into vessels that seemed to defy gravity.

But it was on the waves that Liga discovered her true calling – as a master navigator and cartographer. She'd sailed with various crews over the years, charting unexplored islands and mapping hidden shoals. Her reputation grew, earned through a combination of luck, cunning, and an uncanny sense of direction.

As she gazed out at the glittering city lights below, Liga's mind began to wander back to her family's workshop. What would they make now? Would they build another great ship, or perhaps something entirely new?

The wind died down, and a faint hum caught Liga's attention – a solitary lute playing on the rooftop across from her. The melody was melancholy, but somehow, it resonated with Liga on a deep level. She descended into the city streets, following the sound of the music.

The rooftop came into view once more, this time to find a young musician huddled on the edge, the lute cradled in his lap. His eyes flicked up at Liga's approach, and for an instant, they locked gazes.

"Well met," he said softly, offering her a hesitant smile. "I am Kael Jenson – or Kael Arden, if you'd like it so."

Liga raised an eyebrow. She liked the sound of that name on her tongue. 'Kael Arden Kazuo' seemed to hold a certain charm.

Without another word, Liga settled beside him, her eyes returning to the cityscape as one with the music, and the sea's vastness within them both.
