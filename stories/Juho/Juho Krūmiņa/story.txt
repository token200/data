Juho Krūmiņa was a 25-year-old Latvian photographer who had always been fascinated by the intersection of nature and urban life. Born in Riga, he spent much of his childhood exploring the city's hidden corners and learning to navigate its labyrinthine streets.

As he grew older, Juho began to notice how these two seemingly disparate worlds were connected - the wild woods that sprawled beyond the city limits, and the steel skyscrapers that pierced the sky. He saw parallels between the way trees adapted to urban decay, wrapping themselves around abandoned buildings, and the way humans too could find beauty in disrepair.

Juho's passion for photography led him to pursue a career capturing these contrasts. His lens danced across the city, finding light and shadow in crumbling facades, tangled streets, and overgrown parks. He became particularly drawn to the neglected corners of Riga, where decaying Soviet-era architecture stood alongside newly minted glass towers.

One day, Juho received an invitation from a local gallery to exhibit his work in a group show celebrating urban renewal. The theme was "Transforming Cityscapes," and Juho saw it as a chance to showcase the beauty that lay hidden within Riga's decay. As he prepared for the exhibition, Juho began to shoot with a newfound sense of urgency, capturing images of forgotten alleys and overlooked vistas.

The day of the show arrived, and Juho's photographs stunned the audience. His vibrant, high-contrast images transported viewers into the heart of the city - to secret gardens hidden behind Soviet-era apartment blocks, where graffiti artists had left their mark; to street markets bursting with color and life.

But what really struck about Juho's work was its quiet subversion of the conventional urban landscape narrative. Instead of glorifying sleek glass towers or manicured parks, he celebrated the beauty that arose from neglect - a testament to Riga's complex history as a city shaped by both socialism and capitalist fervor.

As the show came to a close, Juho's photographs began to attract attention from local residents, artists, and journalists. They saw in his work not just an artist's vision but a window into the soul of Riga - its messy, contradictory heart beating strong.
