Juho Lopez Rodriguez stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the unfamiliar landscape. A native of Mexico City, he had left behind the vibrant streets and bustling markets to start anew in the small town of Puerto Viejo.

As he walked through the cobblestone streets, Juho's eyes adjusted to the bright sunlight. The sound of laughter and chatter filled the air, mingling with the smell of fresh fruit and baked goods from the local market. He had always loved food, and the prospect of discovering new flavors in this small Costa Rican town excited him.

Juho made his way to the small café on the corner, where he had agreed to meet his host family's daughter, Maria. She was a warm smile as he entered, her dark hair tied back in a ponytail as she worked behind the counter.

"¡Hola! I'm so glad you're here," Maria said, as Juho took a seat at the small table by the window. "I've got just the thing for you - our famous gallo pinto and fresh coconut water."

As they sipped their drinks, Maria asked Juho about his plans for the summer. He had always been interested in photography, and he hoped to capture the beauty of Puerto Viejo on film. Maria's eyes lit up at the suggestion, and she offered to show him the best spots around town.

Over the next few weeks, Juho and Maria explored the coast together, camera in hand. They hiked through the lush jungle, capturing stunning vistas and intimate moments with the locals. As they worked side by side, Juho began to feel a sense of belonging in this new place, and he knew that his decision to leave Mexico City had been the right one.

As the sun set over the ocean, Juho smiled, feeling grateful for Maria's kindness and the opportunity to experience life in Puerto Viejo. He was Juan Lopez Rodriguez, but here, in this small Costa Rican town, he felt like Juho Lopez Rodriguez - free to explore, create, and discover the beauty of a new world.
