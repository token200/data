Juho Vergara was a man with a mysterious past, shrouded in secrecy and intrigue. Few people knew much about him beyond his striking features and enigmatic smile. Born as Juan Hernán Vergara, he had grown up on the streets of Medellín, Colombia, where he quickly learned to rely only on himself.

As he grew older, Juho began to cultivate a reputation for being fearless and cunning. He navigated the city's underworld with ease, always staying one step ahead of his adversaries. His striking features, which included piercing green eyes and chiseled jawline, seemed almost otherworldly in their intensity.

Despite his tough exterior, Juho had a soft spot for those in need. He often used his skills to help those less fortunate than himself, earning him a reputation as a hero to many. However, this was not something he would ever publicly acknowledge. To him, it was simply a part of who he was.

One night, Juho received a message from an old acquaintance, requesting his presence at a secluded location on the outskirts of town. Curious, Juho agreed to meet, knowing that there was more to the invitation than initially met the eye. As he arrived at the designated spot, he spotted a figure cloaked in shadows.

The figure stepped forward, revealing a woman with long, flowing hair and piercing blue eyes - someone who knew him intimately. "Juan Hernán," she whispered, her voice barely audible over the wind. "I've been searching for you."

Juho's expression remained neutral, but his mind was racing. What did this woman want from him? And what secrets lay hidden in her words? As he pondered these questions, the woman handed him a small package, containing a note that read: "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone."

Without hesitation, Juho took the package and turned to leave. He knew that his life was about to change forever.
