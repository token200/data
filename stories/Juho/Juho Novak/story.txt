Juho Novak stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, his eyes scanning the crowded streets above for any sign of trouble. As a renowned detective with the Helsinki Police Department, he had seen his fair share of dark alleys and shady characters. But tonight was different. Tonight, Juho Novak had received a cryptic message from an anonymous source, leading him to this very spot.

As he waited, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was Elina Väki, a former informant who had turned up in the department's radar recently. Her eyes locked onto Juho Novak's, and for a moment, they simply stared at each other.

"What do you want, Elina?" Juho Novak asked gruffly, his hand resting on the grip of his gun.

"I have information," Elina replied, her voice barely above a whisper. "About the new string of murders that have been happening across the city."

Juho Novak's interest was piqued. He had been following the case, but every lead seemed to end in a dead-end. This could be the break he needed.

"Who is behind it?" Juho Novak asked, his eyes narrowing.

Elina hesitated before speaking. "I think it's connected to an old case... one that I was involved in years ago."

Juho Novak's mind began to spin. He had worked on countless cases with Elina Väki, but this one was different. This one seemed personal.

"What do you know about the case?" Juho Novak pressed, his voice firm but controlled.

Elina took a deep breath before speaking. "I knew a victim back then... a young woman named Sofia Laine. She had been killed in a similar manner to these recent murders."

Juho Novak's eyes snapped towards Elina. This was it – the connection he needed. He pulled out his notebook and jotted down notes, his mind racing with possibilities.

"This changes everything," Juho Novak said, his voice low and determined. "I'll need all the details you can provide, Elina."

As Elina handed over her phone records and witness statements, Juho Novak knew that this case was about to take a dark and twisted turn – one that would lead him straight into the heart of madness.
