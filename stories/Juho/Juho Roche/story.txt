Juho Roche stepped into the dimly lit room, his eyes scanning the space for any signs of life. The air was thick with tension as he made his way to the table where his former business partner, Victor, sat with a smirk on his face.

"You should have stayed out of my affairs, Juho," Victor sneered, his voice dripping with malice.

Juho's expression remained stoic as he pulled up a chair across from Victor. "I didn't get involved in this for the thrill of it, Victor. I did it to protect our company and the people who rely on it."

Victor snorted, his laughter echoing through the room. "Protect them? You call letting me steal millions of dollars worth of intellectual property 'protecting' them?"

Juho's jaw clenched in anger, but he kept his cool, knowing that Victor was trying to provoke him. He took a deep breath and began to speak, his words measured and deliberate.

"I may not have been the most ruthless businessman, Victor, but I did what I thought was right. And I won't let you take advantage of that."

Victor's smirk faltered for a moment, before he regained his composure. "You're just saying that because you've realized your mistake," he spat.

Juho leaned forward, his eyes locking onto Victor's. "I know what happened to those people, Victor. I know who they are and what they deserve. And I won't let you harm them."

Victor sneered again, but this time there was a hint of doubt in his voice. Juho knew he had gotten under Victor's skin.

"You really think you can take me down, don't you?" Victor asked, his voice laced with desperation.

Juho stood up, his movements swift and decisive. "I'm not here to fight you, Victor. I'm here to put an end to this. You're going to pay for what you've done."

As the police sirens outside grew louder, Juho watched Victor's face crumble under the weight of his own guilt. He knew that justice would be served, and he was ready to see it through.

With a quiet determination, Juho turned and walked out of the room, leaving Victor to face the consequences of his actions. The door closed behind him with a finality that echoed through the empty space.
