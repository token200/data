In the scorching summer of 1485, Juho de' Medici, the illegitimate son of Lorenzo de' Medici and a young woman named Caterina, found himself entangled in the intricate web of Florence's politics. As the rightful heir to his family's vast fortune and power, Juho had always felt like an outcast, shunned by his powerful father due to his illegitimate birth.

Despite this, Juho de' Medici was determined to prove himself worthy of his family's name. He spent countless hours studying the art of politics, diplomacy, and warfare, becoming a skilled strategist in the process. His natural charisma and intelligence drew attention from prominent figures in Florence, who began to see him as a potential ally in their quest for power.

One fateful evening, Juho de' Medici received an invitation from the powerful leader of the Pazzi family, Jacopo de' Pazzi. The two men met in secret, discussing a potential alliance that would secure Juho's position within the city's elite. However, unbeknownst to Juho, his father Lorenzo had discovered their meeting and saw it as an opportunity to discredit his son.

Lorenzo, enraged by Jacopo's treachery, ordered his loyal guards to capture the Pazzi leader and anyone associated with him. In the ensuing chaos, Juho de' Medici found himself caught in the crossfire. As he watched his father's guards surround and apprehend Jacopo, Juho realized that his life was now forever entwined with the fate of Florence.

With a heavy heart, Juho de' Medici knew that he had to take drastic action to protect himself and his family's interests. He began to secretly gather allies among the city's dissatisfied factions, waiting for the perfect moment to strike back against those who sought to destroy him.

As the months passed, Juho's calculated movements and strategic alliances slowly transformed him into a formidable force in Florence. His name became synonymous with cunning and determination, striking fear into the hearts of his enemies. Though still an outcast among his own family, Juho de' Medici had finally emerged as a master of his own destiny, refusing to be defined by the circumstances of his birth.

And so, Juho de' Medici continued to navigate the treacherous waters of Florence's politics, ever vigilant and always planning for the next move. His future was shrouded in uncertainty, but one thing was clear: this illegitimate son of Lorenzo had finally found his place in the world.
