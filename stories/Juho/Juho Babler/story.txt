Born into a family of modest means, Juho's earliest memories were filled with the sound of clanging pots and pans in the kitchen, where his mother would cook up hearty meals for her brood of children. It was amidst this chaotic backdrop that music began to seep into his consciousness, like a gentle rain after a long drought.

As he grew older, Juho's fascination with music only deepened, leading him down a path of solo study and practice.
