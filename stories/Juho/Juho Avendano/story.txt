Juho Avendano stood on the rooftop, gazing out at the cityscape below. As a freelance journalist, she had seen her fair share of crime scenes, but there was something about this one that caught her attention. A young woman, no more than twenty-five years old, lay lifeless on the ground.

Juho Avendano's eyes narrowed as she surveyed the area. She had been investigating a string of similar murders in the city, all with the same M.O.: a single bullet to the head, no signs of forced entry or struggle. The police were stumped, but Juho Avendano had a hunch.

As she examined the crime scene, she noticed a small piece of paper clutched in the victim's hand. She carefully picked it up and examined it. It was a receipt from a local convenience store, but what caught her attention was the handwritten note on the back: "Meet me at 5th and Main if you want to know the truth."

Juho Avendano's mind began racing. Who could have written this? And what did they mean by "the truth"? She tucked the receipt into her pocket, deciding to pay a visit to the convenience store and see if anyone remembered anything unusual.

As she walked away from the crime scene, Juho Avendano couldn't shake off the feeling that she was onto something big. Her full name, Juho Avendano, seemed to echo in her mind as she made her way back to her office to dig deeper into the case.

Back at her desk, Juho Avendano began to research the convenience store and its employees. She found a mention of a new employee who had started just last week - a quiet, reserved young woman named Sarah. According to eyewitnesses, Sarah had been acting suspiciously, nervous and jumpy whenever anyone asked her about anything.

Juho Avendano's eyes lit up with excitement as she made the connection. This could be it - the break in the case she had been waiting for. She pulled out her phone and dialed a number, ready to start unraveling the threads of this mysterious crime.
