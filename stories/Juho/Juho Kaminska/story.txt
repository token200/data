Juho Kaminska stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the crowded station. He had been traveling for hours, and the excitement to return home was starting to wear off. As he made his way through the throngs of people, he spotted a familiar face - his best friend, Lumi.

"Juho!" she exclaimed, rushing over to hug him tightly. "I'm so glad you're finally here!"

Juho smiled wearily as he hugged her back. "Thanks, Lumi. I'm beat. How's the family?"

"They're all doing well," Lumi replied. "Your mom is still making a fuss over you, of course."

Juho chuckled and shook his head. He had always been the easygoing one in their family, but his mother's constant worrying had never gone unnoticed.

As they walked through the station, Juho couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. This was where he had grown up, where he had learned to swim and ride a bike and explore the world around him. It felt like just yesterday that he was running through these halls as a child.

When they finally reached their apartment building, Juho's stomach growled loudly. "Time for some real food," he said, following Lumi into the kitchen.

His mother was waiting for them, a look of delight on her face. "Ah, welcome home, Juho Kaminska!" she exclaimed, opening his arms for another hug. "I've made your favorite dinner - karjalanpiirakka and mashed potatoes."

Juho smiled and kissed her cheek. "Thanks, Mom. You know the way to my heart."

As they sat down to eat, Juho couldn't help but think about how much he missed this life. This routine, this comfort and familiarity. He had been away for so long, chasing his dreams in the city, that it felt like a whole different world was waiting for him at home.

But as he looked around at Lumi's smiling face and his mother's warm eyes, Juho knew that no matter where life took him, home would always be here - with the people who loved him most.
