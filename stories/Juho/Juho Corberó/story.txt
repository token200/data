Juho Corberó sat on the edge of his bed, staring at the old photograph in his hands. It was a faded black-and-white image of himself as a child, smiling with his family by the sea. He hadn't seen this picture in years, not since his parents' passing.

As a teenager, Juho had always felt like an outsider among his peers. His love for sailing and the ocean seemed to set him apart from the rest. But his family's history was one of hardship and struggle. His parents had been fishermen who disappeared at sea when he was just a boy. The loss had left him feeling lost and alone.

After the funeral, Juho's aunt had given him this photograph as a gift. It reminded him of happier times, before the tragedy that had shattered his life. He hadn't looked at it in years, but something about it felt like a call to return to the sea.

Over the past few months, Juho had found himself drawn back into the water. He'd started taking sailing lessons again and even signed up for a solo voyage across the Mediterranean. It was a risk, he knew, but one he couldn't ignore.

As he looked at the photograph, memories flooded his mind – of laughter-filled days on the beach, of fishing trips with his parents, and of the countless hours spent watching the waves roll in from the shore. He felt a sense of longing wash over him, a desire to return to those carefree days.

Juho's eyes drifted out the window, where the city lights twinkled like stars. He knew that this journey wouldn't be easy, but he was determined to find closure and rediscover himself on the open sea. The photograph seemed to whisper secrets in his ear – of a family lost at sea, and of a life left unlived.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Juho tucked the photograph into his pocket and stood up. He knew that tomorrow would bring its own challenges, but he was ready to face them head-on. The ocean had always called to him, and now it was time for him to answer.
