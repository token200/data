Juho Stenstr√∂m stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the sleepy town before him. A native of Helsinki, Juho had spent most of his adult life traveling the world, working odd jobs to fund his wanderlust. But now, after a decade on the road, he found himself back in his hometown, searching for something more.

As he made his way through the quiet streets, Juho couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. He had grown up playing in these same fields, exploring the local markets with his grandmother, and listening to his parents' stories about the war that had shaped their country's history. But life had taken him far from this humble existence, and he was starting to wonder if there was more to life than just surviving.

Juho's thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door of the small apartment he had rented for the night. He opened it to find his old friend, Pekka, standing on the threshold with a wide grin on his face. "Hey, Juho! Long time no see!" Pekka exclaimed, as if he hadn't noticed the worn expression etched on Juho's face.

Over a warm dinner of karjalanpiirakka and salmiakki, Pekka listened intently as Juho shared his plans to start over in this small town. He confided in Pekka about his struggles to find purpose, his longing for connection, and his fear that he might never find his place in the world again. Pekka listened attentively, nodding along as Juho spoke, before finally asking, "So, what do you need from me, buddy?"

Juho hesitated, unsure of how to articulate his desires. But with Pekka's encouragement, he found himself opening up about his dreams of starting a small business, of building something that would give him a sense of belonging and fulfillment. As the night wore on, Juho felt a weight lift from his shoulders, knowing that he wasn't alone in this journey. And as he looked at Pekka, with their eyes shining in the dim light of the apartment, he knew that he was one step closer to finding himself again.
