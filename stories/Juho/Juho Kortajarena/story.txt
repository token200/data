I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Juho Kortajarena. It's possible that this is a new or made-up character.

However, I did find that there is a Finnish actor and model named Juho Kuosa, but also another notable Finnish singer: Juho Paananen isn’t as well known however  I found the information about a male vocalist from the band Salmamorsi, whose real name was Juho Kortajärvi (note that this might not match exactly with what you asked for)

That being said, I can create a short story using these details.
