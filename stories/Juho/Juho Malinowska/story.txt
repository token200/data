Juho Malinowska sat alone at the wooden café table, nursing a lukewarm coffee. The Finnish summer sun cast a golden glow over the quiet streets of Helsinki, but Juho's mind was elsewhere. His eyes wandered to the photographs on his phone, the faded Polaroids of loved ones long gone.

It had been three years since the accident took him and his friends from a secluded forest getaway. Juho still couldn't shake the memory of that final night, when everything went wrong in an instant. The darkness seemed more suffocating now than it did then.

As he stared blankly at his phone, a figure approached. It was Anna, an old friend from childhood, her silver hair styled in a neat bob. They had drifted apart after the accident but remained close over the years.

"Juho," she said softly, taking a seat across from him. "I brought some company."

He raised an eyebrow, surprised by her presence. The café was empty, and Anna's visit felt like an invasion of his solitude. Yet, he welcomed it – anything to break the monotony of these quiet days.

They talked about everything and nothing: old times, their dreams, and fears. Juho found himself opening up to Anna in ways he hadn't thought possible. It was as if the past few years had been waiting for this moment, just for her to show up with a listening ear.

Over coffee and shortbread cookies, they discussed his art, the sketches scattered around him on a nearby stool. Anna's eyes sparkled with curiosity as Juho showed her his latest work: charcoal portraits of cityscapes at dusk. She commended him on the use of light and shadows, something he'd always struggled to master.

As the afternoon sun dipped below the horizon, casting the café in a soft orange glow, Juho realized that Anna's visit was more than just companionship. It was a reminder that life went on, that moments like these existed outside the dark recesses of his mind.

The wooden table creaked softly as he placed his hand on hers. For an instant, they sat there in silence, the weight of their memories suspended between them. Then, with a warm smile, Anna squeezed Juho's hand and said, "We have so much to catch up for."

As the café emptied out, Juho felt the first faint stirrings of hope. Maybe, just maybe, he could learn to find solace in the world beyond his own sorrow.
