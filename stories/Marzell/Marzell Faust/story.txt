Marzell Faust stood at the edge of the rooftop, his eyes scanning the desolate cityscape below. The dim glow of neon lights cast an eerie shadow on the walls as he lit a cigarette, blowing out a plume of smoke that wafted away into the night air.

As the master of the occult and wielder of ancient powers, Marzell had seen it all - the battles fought, the lives lost, and the destinies forever altered. Yet, tonight felt different. Tonight, he felt the weight of his own mortality.

It had been years since Marzell had walked among mortals, hiding in plain sight as a humble occult shop owner in the heart of New York City. But the whispers began to spread - rumors that the devil himself had risen from the ashes to reclaim his rightful place on earth. Some claimed to have seen him walking down the streets at night, dressed in black and carrying an aura of dark energy.

Marzell snorted, dismissing the tales as mere fantasy. Yet, deep down, a part of him wondered - was it true? Had he been asleep for so long that the world had moved on without him?

He took another drag on his cigarette, feeling the familiar rush of nicotine coursing through his veins. But this time, instead of calmness, he felt an itch - a sense of unease that settled in the pit of his stomach.

As the night wore on, Marzell felt himself being drawn to the city's underbelly. He knew the streets and alleys like the back of his hand, had walked them countless times as a mortal. Tonight was no different. The pull of dark magic called to him, beckoning him deeper into the shadows.

With each step, Marzell felt himself becoming more...human. His senses sharpened, and his eyes saw things that shouldn't be seen - the faint outlines of hidden forces lurking just beyond the veil of reality.

And then, in a flash of insight, it hit him - he was no longer a puppet master but a pawn himself. The world had changed since he'd last walked among mortals, and Marzell Faust was nothing more than a relic of a bygone era.
