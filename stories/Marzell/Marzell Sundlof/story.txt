Marzell Sundlof stepped into the dimly lit tavern, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. The patrons were a mix of shady characters and worn-down travelers, all sharing a common thread - they had all been to the Red Griffin Inn before. Marzell had lost count of how many times she'd walked through those doors, but one thing remained constant: the sense of unease that settled in the pit of her stomach.

As she made her way to the bar, Marzell's gaze landed on a figure huddled in the corner, nursing a mug of ale. It was Ryker, an old acquaintance from her days as a smuggler. He nodded at her, his eyes gleaming with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion.

"What brings you here, Marzell Sundlof?" Ryker asked, his voice low and gravelly.

Marzell slid onto the stool beside him, signaling the bartender for a drink. "Just passing through," she said, her tone neutral. "I've got a job lined up in the next town over."

Ryker raised an eyebrow. "That's not like you to be so tight-lipped about your business. What's really going on, Marzell?"

Marzell sighed, taking a sip of her ale. "Let's just say I've got a client with a... delicate cargo. And I'm not the only one who knows what it is."

As they spoke, the tavern patrons began to take notice of their conversation. Whispers spread like wildfire, and soon the room was abuzz with speculation. Marzell's reputation as a skilled smuggler had preceded her, and she knew that discretion was key.

Ryker leaned in closer, his voice barely audible over the din of the tavern. "Be careful, Marzell Sundlof. The wrong people are always looking for an angle. You know how it is."

Marzell nodded, her eyes locked on Ryker's. She did indeed know how it was - she had spent years navigating the treacherous underworld of smuggling and deception. And in this line of work, you were either on top or at the bottom.
