Born into a family of artists, Marzell had always been drawn to the creative process. As a child, he spent hours sketching and painting alongside his parents, learning the intricacies of color and composition. As he grew older, his passion only intensified, leading him to study at some of the most prestigious art schools in Europe.

After completing his formal education, Marzell set out on his own, establishing a studio in Paris and beginning to make a name for himself as a rising star in the art world.
