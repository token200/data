Marzell Eben stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. He had been away for years, and the familiar scent of coal smoke and damp earth brought back memories he'd rather forget.

As a child, Marzell had spent summers in this very town with his grandparents. His mother had left when he was young, and his father's absence had left him feeling lost and alone. But there was something about this place that felt like home. Maybe it was the way the sun dipped behind the mountains, casting a golden glow over everything. Or maybe it was the sound of the river winding its way through the town, its gentle song a reminder that even in silence, there was always movement.

Marzell made his way to his grandparents' old house, the one with the porch and the garden that had once been full of life. Now, it was overgrown and neglected, but Marzell's heart swelled as he pushed open the creaky door. The interior was just as he remembered â€“ musty and worn, with a fireplace that seemed to lean in, as if listening.

His grandmother lay on the couch, her eyes sunken and tired. She looked up at him, and for a moment, Marzell thought he saw a flicker of recognition. But it was quickly extinguished, replaced by a look of confusion.

"Marzell?" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Is that you?"

He nodded, feeling a lump form in his throat. His grandmother's eyes welled up with tears, and Marzell felt a pang of guilt for not visiting sooner.

As the days passed, Marzell stayed by his grandparents' side, listening to stories about their lives before him. He learned about his mother, who had left under mysterious circumstances, and his father, who had disappeared into the city never to be seen again. The more he heard, the more Marzell realized that some wounds would never fully heal.

But as he looked out at the river, watching the sun set behind the mountains, Marzell felt a sense of peace wash over him. He knew that no matter what lay ahead, he had a home here, and people who cared for him. And with that knowledge, he began to let go of the past, if only for a little while at a time.
