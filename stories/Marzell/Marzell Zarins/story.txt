A select group of individuals, known only as "the patrons," supported him financially and offered their services when needed. These patrons were bound to him by a code of silence, sworn to protect his interests at all costs.

One fateful night, Marzell Zarins received an invitation from one of his most trusted patrons, requesting his presence at a high-stakes poker game. The game would be held in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town, and only those deemed worthy were invited. Marzell Zarins accepted the challenge, intrigued by the promise of a hefty payday.

As he entered the dimly lit warehouse, Marzell Zarins was greeted by his patrons and a select few other players. The air was thick with tension as the game began, each player vying for control. Marzell Zarins played with calculated precision, his movements economical and deliberate.

The night wore on, the stakes growing higher with each hand. In the end, it was Marzell Zarins who emerged victorious, collecting a small fortune in winnings. As he walked away from the table, a hint of a smile playing on his lips, it was clear that this was just another night in the life of Marzell Zarins, a man whose legend would only continue to grow with time.
