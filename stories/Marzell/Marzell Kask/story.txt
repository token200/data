Marzell Kask was known for his peculiarities, but none more so than his extraordinary ability to collect forgotten memories. As a child, he would often wander through alleys and abandoned streets, collecting small trinkets and scraps that others had discarded. But it wasn't until he stumbled upon an old, mysterious pocket watch that he discovered his unique gift.

The watch, passed down to him from a great aunt he never knew, allowed Marzell to tap into the memories of those who possessed it. He would hold the watch against their palms, and suddenly find himself flooded with visions of forgotten moments: laughter shared on holidays, first kisses under starry skies, or the whispered secrets of loved ones.

As Marzell grew older, his gift became both a blessing and a curse. People from all walks of life came to him, seeking refuge in the memories he could unlock for them. A young couple hoping to relive their wedding day, an elderly woman longing to recall her childhood summers, or a grieving son searching for solace in the memories of his late father – Marzell helped them all.

But with each memory that faded into view, Marzell felt himself losing bits of his own identity. He became a conduit, a vessel carrying the thoughts and emotions of others. His friends and family grew concerned, unable to grasp the layers of reality that seemed to exist only for him.

One rainy evening, as the city's lights reflected in the raindrops like shattered mirrors, Marzell received an unexpected visit from an old friend he hadn't seen in years. Together, they sat in a small café, sipping coffee and talking about nothing in particular. But it was during this quiet conversation that something shifted – for the first time in his life, Marzell saw his own memories reflected back at him.

A memory of laughter with his childhood best friend, an autumn afternoons spent exploring the woods behind their homes, or a summer spent watching fireworks light up the night sky. The moments he had longed to remember but never quite recalled now flooded his consciousness like a tidal wave. For Marzell Kask, in that instant, he reclaimed his place within himself – not as a collector of other's memories, but as a guardian of his own.

In the end, it was this rediscovery of self that freed him from the burden of collecting forgotten memories. With a newfound sense of purpose, Marzell continued to help others find solace in their recollections, knowing that he would always have a few memories left to cherish for himself.
