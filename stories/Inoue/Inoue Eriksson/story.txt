Inoue Eriksson was a master thief known for his lightning-fast hands and unparalleled ability to slip in and out of the shadows unnoticed. His real name, Eriksson Inoue, was often lost on those who didn't know him well, but he preferred it that way.

Eriksson's latest mark was the wealthy collector, Mr. Jenkins. He had been tracking him for weeks, studying his movements and waiting for the perfect moment to strike. That moment arrived one fateful night when Eriksson slipped into the mansion disguised as a janitor.

As he worked, Eriksson couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction at having finally found his next target. His skills were unmatched, and no one was better at what they did than him. He had a reputation for being untouchable, and it seemed that way to everyone except those closest to him.

Just as Eriksson was about to make off with the valuable artifact he had come for, he heard a voice behind him. "You're not going anywhere," Mr. Jenkins said, his eyes narrowing in anger.
