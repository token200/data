Inoue Kaito was known to his friends as Nightshade, but only a select few knew that he was actually Inoue Kaito Nachtnebel, the heir to the notorious Nachtnebel crime family. Growing up in the shadow of his infamous surname, Kaito had always felt the weight of expectation on his shoulders.

As a young man, Kaito had rebelled against his family's dark legacy, opting instead to pursue a career in art. However, his family's influence was too strong, and they eventually coaxed him back into the fold, forcing him to take over the Nachtnebel empire.

Despite his reluctance, Inoue Kaito Nachtnebel proved to be a shrewd businessman, earning the respect of even his most hardened opponents. His ability to navigate the complex web of underworld politics had earned him a reputation as a master strategist, and those who crossed him did so at their own peril.

One fateful night, Inoue Kaito Nachtnebel received an unexpected visit from an old flame, Akane. She was a former associate of his family's business dealings, but her true intentions were far more sinister. As the two reminisced about old times, Akane revealed that she had been secretly working to take down the Nachtnebels from the inside.

Inoue Kaito Nachtnebel was both intrigued and repelled by Akane's offer. Part of him wanted to trust her, but another part knew better than to let his guard down around his enemies. As he pondered his next move, the shadows in the room seemed to grow longer and darker, as if the very night itself was conspiring against him.

Inoue Kaito Nachtnebel knew that he couldn't trust anyone anymore, not even himself. The weight of his family's legacy bore down on him like a physical force, threatening to crush him beneath its oppressive yoke. He could feel the Nachtnebel curse bearing down on him, urging him towards destruction and chaos.

As the night wore on, Inoue Kaito Nachtnebel realized that he had two choices: succumb to the darkness or fight against it. Only time would tell which path he would choose, but one thing was certain - his fate hung precariously in the balance, as the shadows danced and twisted around him like living things.
