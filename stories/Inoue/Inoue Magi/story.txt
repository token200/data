Inoue Magi sat alone in the dimly lit tavern, nursing a mug of lukewarm ale. Her full name was whispered among the patrons, but few knew her true nature. She was a Kage Bunshin, a spirit who took on human form to navigate the mortal realm.

As she listened to the hushed conversations around her, Magi's ears perked up at the mention of the powerful Oni, demon-like creatures said to be able to control the elements. Her eyes narrowed, and her fingers drummed an impatient rhythm on the tabletop.

A hooded figure slipped into the tavern, their presence drawing Magi's attention. The air around them seemed to ripple with an otherworldly energy, a sign of their true power. Magi's instincts told her that this was no ordinary human.

Without drawing attention to herself, Magi slid out of her chair and followed the hooded figure into the tavern's back room. There, she found a map etched onto a piece of parchment, seemingly leading to an ancient ruin hidden deep within the nearby mountains.

Inoue Magi knew that this was no coincidence. The Oni's power signature was evident on the map, and she suspected that this ruin held secrets about her own past as a Kage Bunshin. Her curiosity piqued, Magi carefully examined the map, committing its twists and turns to memory.

As the hooded figure slipped away into the night, Magi knew she had to follow. She took a deep breath, shouldering her pack and setting off towards the mountains. The night air was filled with an eerie silence as she traversed the rugged terrain, her senses on high alert for any sign of danger.

Finally, after hours of walking, Inoue Magi arrived at the ancient ruin. As she pushed open the creaky doors, a warm glow spilled out into the darkness, beckoning her towards secrets and revelations about her own mysterious past. With a deep breath, Magi stepped forward, ready to face whatever lay within.
