Inoue Salamanca was known throughout the land for his cunning and strategic mind. As a master thief and con artist, he had earned the nickname "The Fox" among his peers. But few knew that behind the charming smile and quick wit lay a complex individual with a rich history.

Born Inoue Kazuki to a family of modest means, Salamanca's early life was marked by hardship and struggle. However, it was this same determination that drove him to excel in his chosen profession. He honed his skills on the streets, learning to pick locks and palm objects with ease. As he grew older, his reputation as a skilled thief spread, attracting the attention of wealthy clients who sought his expertise.

One fateful evening, Inoue Salamanca received an offer from a mysterious client that would change the course of his life. The job was simple: steal a valuable artifact from a high-security museum and deliver it to a secluded location. The reward was substantial, but the risk was high. Salamanca knew that this was an opportunity he couldn't resist.

The night of the heist arrived, and Inoue Salamanca put on his most charming smile as he made his way into the museum. He navigated the security system with ease, exploiting vulnerabilities that no one else had noticed. The artifact was extracted from its display case, and Salamanca made his escape.

As he delivered the artifact to the designated location, Inoue Salamanca couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. It was a job well done, and the reward was substantial. But as he collected his payment, he caught a glimpse of something that made him pause. A young woman, dressed in a plain yet elegant gown, watched him with an intensity that unnerved him.

For a moment, Inoue Salamanca's mask slipped, revealing a glimmer of uncertainty beneath. Who was this woman, and what did she want from him? The encounter left him unsettled, but he knew he had to keep moving forward. After all, Inoue Salamanca was a master of his craft, and no one could outwit the Fox.

As he vanished into the night, the young woman's eyes followed him, her gaze lingering on the familiar contours of Inoue Salamanca's face. Though she remained hidden, it was clear that their paths would cross again, and next time, only one of them might emerge unscathed.
