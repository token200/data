Inoue Mercier stepped into the quaint café, her eyes scanning the room with a mix of curiosity and wariness. As a skilled thief, she had grown accustomed to navigating the shadows, but there was something about this particular establishment that made her feel like an outsider.

The proprietor, a stout man with a bushy mustache, greeted her warmly as he took in her slender frame and piercing green eyes. "Inoue Mercier, welcome back! I see you're still as charming as ever."

Inoue smiled wryly, running a hand through her dark hair. She had indeed returned to this café before, under the guise of gathering information for a mysterious client. The proprietor, who went by the name of Monsieur LaFleur, seemed to know more than he let on, but she had never been able to extract any concrete information from him.

As she waited for her coffee to be prepared, Inoue's gaze wandered around the room, taking in the eclectic assortment of patrons. There was a young couple giggling over a plate of crepes, while an elderly gentleman hunched over his newspaper with an air of disinterest. A lone figure sat in the corner, cloaked in shadows and eyeing her with an unnerving intensity.

Just as Inoue's nerves began to fray, Monsieur LaFleur brought over a steaming cup of coffee and a small plate of pastries. "On the house, Inoue Mercier," he said with a sly smile. "I believe you're waiting for someone?"

Inoue raised an eyebrow, her mind racing with possibilities. How did he know? She had deliberately kept her true intentions hidden from him, despite their repeated encounters.

As she took a sip of the rich coffee, Inoue Mercier knew that she would have to tread carefully. The thread of connection between them was beginning to unravel, and she wasn't sure if it was safe for her to keep poking at the edges. For now, she'd have to content herself with observing Monsieur LaFleur from afar, waiting for him to reveal more about his own secrets.

With a nod of thanks, Inoue Mercier slid out of the café, disappearing into the crowded streets like a ghost.
