Inoue Ángel Silvestre was known for her razor-sharp wit and cunning smile. As a master thief in the city of Novigrad, she had earned a reputation for being untouchable. Her real name was Inoue Ángel Silvestre, but to those who knew her, she was simply Angel - the ghost of the underworld.

Angel's latest mark was the wealthy merchant, Marcellus Thorne. He had recently acquired a valuable artifact that Angel aimed to steal, and she spent weeks casing his estate, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. On a stormy night, Angel snuck into Thorne's mansion, avoiding the guards with ease.

As she made her way deeper into the house, Angel couldn't help but feel a thrill of excitement. She had always loved the rush of adrenaline that came with pulling off a heist. With a wink, she disabled the security charms and made her way to the artifact - a priceless gemstone encrusted necklace.

Just as she reached for the necklace, Angel heard a noise behind her. Turning around, she saw Thorne's son, Victor, standing in the doorway. He was young, but his eyes burned with determination. "You'll never leave this house alive," he spat at Angel.

Angel smiled sweetly, unfazed by Victor's threat. She knew that this was just a minor setback. With a flick of her wrist, she conjured up a smoke bomb and made a run for it. Victor gave chase, but Angel was too quick. She escaped into the stormy night, the gemstone necklace clutched in her hand.

As she vanished into the shadows, Angel couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. Inoue Ángel Silvestre had once again pulled off the impossible. And as she disappeared into the darkness, her reputation grew, whispered among the underworld's elite: "Angel is back, and no one can stop her."
