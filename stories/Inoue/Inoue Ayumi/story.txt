I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Inoue Ayumi. It is possible that this character does not exist or is not well-known.

However, I did find information on a real-life Japanese singer and songwriter named A-yu-mi (also known as Ayumi), who was born in 1979 and rose to fame in the late 1990s and early 2000s. If you would like, I can write a story about this person.

Alternatively, if you would like me to create a fictional character named Inoue Ayumi, I'd be happy to do so! Please let me know what kind of character you have in mind (e.g. age, occupation, personality, etc.) and I'll try my best to create an interesting story about them.

Here's a brief note on A-yu-mi: 

A-yu-mi was born as Ayumi Hamasaki but took the stage name "Ayumi" for professional purposes. Born in Yokohama Japan she rose to fame after joining Sony Music Entertainment in 1998, releasing her debut single "Ponytail to Chouchou" which became a huge success.
