Inoue Vasiliev was known for his enigmatic smile and piercing green eyes that seemed to hold a thousand secrets. A skilled thief and con artist, he had built a reputation as one of the most elusive figures in the city's underworld. Few people knew much about him beyond his alias, and even fewer had ever laid eyes on him.

Vasiliev's real name was Inoue Kaito Vasiliev, but he had long since shed any connection to his family name. As a child, he had been shuffled from one foster home to another, never quite finding a sense of belonging. It wasn't until he stumbled upon the world of high-stakes thievery that he found his true calling.

With an uncanny ability to blend into the shadows and manipulate those around him, Vasiliev had made a name for himself as a master of disguise and deception. His targets were always the wealthy and powerful, and he took great pleasure in swindling them out of their fortune.

But despite his success, Vasiliev's life was far from glamorous. He lived on the fringes of society, always looking over his shoulder for the authorities or rival thieves who sought to take him down. His only solace came in the form of a rare and exquisite art collection, which he had amassed through his various exploits.

One night, Vasiliev received an invitation to a high-profile gala at the city's most prestigious museum. The guest list was veritable Who's Who of the city's elite, and Vasiliev saw this as the perfect opportunity to strike. As he mingled with the guests, his eyes scanned the room for any sign of his mark.

But as he began to weave a web of deceit around one unsuspecting collector, Vasiliev couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The air seemed charged with an electric tension, and he sensed that this night might be different from all the others.
