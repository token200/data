Inoue Muller was a man shrouded in mystery. His striking features and charismatic smile had captivated many, but few knew the truth behind his enigmatic persona. Born as the illegitimate son of a wealthy Japanese family, Inoue Muller had been raised with every privilege at their disposal. However, this privileged upbringing had come at a steep price - he was forced to keep his true identity hidden.

As a young adult, Inoue Muller found himself drawn to the world of high-stakes espionage. Utilizing his natural charm and cunning, he quickly rose through the ranks of a secret organization known only as "The Order." With each mission completed, Inoue Muller's reputation grew, and so did the secrets surrounding him.

Utilizing his charm and wit, he lured the thugs into a trap, allowing him to escape with minimal injury.

Word of Inoue Muller's daring escape spread quickly, earning him both admiration and suspicion within The Order. Some saw him as a hero, while others viewed him as a liability - too reckless for his own good. Whatever the truth may be, one thing is clear: Inoue Muller will stop at nothing to protect himself and those he cares about.

Despite this reputation, few know that beneath Inoue Muller's tough exterior lies a complex web of emotions and motivations. Driven by a deep sense of loyalty and justice, Inoue Muller finds himself torn between the duties of his organization and the secrets of his own past. Can he find a way to reconcile these competing forces, or will they ultimately tear him apart?
