Inoue Xia stood alone on the deserted beach, her long black hair whipping wildly in the wind as she gazed out at the vast expanse of ocean before her. A native of the small coastal town of Kaimana, Inoue Xia had always felt an inexplicable connection to the sea.

As a child, Inoue Xia spent hours exploring the tide pools and hidden coves along the shoreline, collecting shells and seaweed for her mother's famous soups. But as she grew older, Inoue Xia began to feel an increasing sense of restlessness, as if there was something more out there for her than the familiar rhythms of her small town.

One day, while wandering through the local market, Inoue Xia stumbled upon a tattered old book of ocean legends and myths. As she flipped through its yellowed pages, one story in particular caught her eye: that of the Merrow, a mystical tribe of sea spirits said to inhabit the depths of the Pacific.

Inoue Xia was entranced by the tale, feeling an eerie sense of recognition as if she were somehow connected to these mythical beings. She spent countless hours poring over the book, researching and learning everything she could about the Merrow. And as she delved deeper into her studies, Inoue Xia began to notice strange occurrences in her own life - the way the ocean seemed to respond to her presence, the strange symbols that appeared on the beach at night.

It was as if Inoue Xia herself was becoming a part of the myth, a bridge between the world of mortals and the realm of the Merrow. And with this realization came a sense of purpose, a feeling that she had finally found her true calling - to serve as an ambassador for these mystical sea spirits, to communicate their secrets and whispers to the world above.

As Inoue Xia stood on the beach, the wind whipping her hair into a frenzy, she knew that her life would never be the same again. The ocean had claimed her, body and soul, and she was ready to follow its call wherever it might lead.
