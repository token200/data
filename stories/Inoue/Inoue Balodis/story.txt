Inoue Balodis sat alone in her small apartment, staring blankly at the walls that seemed to close in on her. A successful businesswoman by day, she was a recluse by night, haunted by the demons of her past. Her parents had always been her rock, but they were gone now, and she felt lost without them.

As she poured herself a glass of whiskey, Inoue Balodis thought back to the days when life was simpler. She had grown up in a small town, surrounded by friends and family who knew her name. But after college, she had made the bold decision to leave it all behind and start fresh in the city. It had been a risk, but one that had paid off handsomely.

Now, as she gazed out the window at the dark, rain-soaked streets, Inoue Balodis felt a pang of regret. She had worked so hard to build her career, to become one of the most respected figures in her industry. But at what cost? Her personal life was nonexistent, and her relationships were shallow and fleeting.

Just then, her phone buzzed with an incoming call. It was her best friend, Kaito. "Hey, I heard you're feeling down," he said, his voice warm and reassuring. Inoue Balodis smiled, feeling a lump form in her throat. She had always been close to Kaito, who had known her since college.

"What's wrong?" Kaito asked, sensing her distress. "You can tell me anything," he promised. Inoue Balodis hesitated, unsure of how much she wanted to share. But something about Kaito's gentle tone put her at ease. She told him everything - her fears, her doubts, her sense of disconnection.

Kaito listened attentively, offering words of comfort and encouragement. When she finished talking, he said, "You're not alone, Inoue Balodis. We all feel lost sometimes. But you have us, and we'll be here for you whenever you need us." As they parted ways, Inoue Balodis felt a weight lift off her shoulders. Maybe, just maybe, she didn't have to face her demons alone after all.
