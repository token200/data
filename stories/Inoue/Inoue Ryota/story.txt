Inoue Ryota sat alone in his small apartment, staring blankly at the wall as he thought about his past. His full name, Inoue Ryota Taro, echoed in his mind like a mantra, reminding him of who he used to be. A successful businessman, with a beautiful wife and two young children. But that was before the accident.

As he sat there, memories flooded his mind - the sound of shattering glass, the feel of weightlessness as he fell, and the sensation of pain that seemed to radiate from every cell in his body. It had been three years since the accident, and yet it still felt like yesterday. The injuries he sustained had left him with a broken neck and a shattered sense of purpose.

Inoue Ryota Taro's life was now one of quiet desperation. He struggled to find meaning in his days, feeling like a shadow of his former self. His friends and family tried to be supportive, but they couldn't understand what he was going through. They would ask him about his job, or what he liked to do for fun, but Inoue Ryota Taro knew that those things didn't matter anymore.

One day, as he was wandering aimlessly around the city, Inoue Ryota Taro stumbled upon a small art studio. The owner, an elderly woman named Kiyomi, took one look at him and said, "You're a painter." She led him to a table covered in canvases, paints, and brushes, and Inoue Ryota Taro felt a spark of interest ignite within him.

For the first time in years, he picked up a brush and began to create. Colors flowed from his fingertips like blood from a wound, as he poured all his emotions onto the canvas. Kiyomi watched him with tears in her eyes, nodding in approval as Inoue Ryota Taro's hands moved deftly over the surface of the painting.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the studio in a warm orange glow, Inoue Ryota Taro felt a sense of peace wash over him. For the first time in years, he felt like himself again - full name and all.
