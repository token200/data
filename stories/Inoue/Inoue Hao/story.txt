Inoue Hao stood before the Galactic Senate, his piercing blue eyes scanning the room as he addressed the gathered leaders from various planets. His voice, strong and commanding, echoed through the chamber.

"Honorable members of the Senate, I come before you today to discuss a grave threat to our galaxy," Inoue Hao declared. "The return of the ancient being known as Baito has awakened a power that could destroy entire star systems."

As the senators murmured among themselves, Inoue Hao continued, his words dripping with urgency. "I, Inoue Hao, have spent countless cycles studying the ancient lore and unlocking its secrets. I am convinced that Baito's return is not a coincidence, but rather a deliberate attempt to reclaim our galaxy."

The senators exchanged skeptical glances, but Inoue Hao pressed on, undeterred. "I propose that we form an alliance with the most skilled warriors of the galaxy, including my own people, the Inners." His words carried weight, as many of the senators knew of his unwavering dedication to protecting their galaxy.

One senator, a representative from the planet of Tiamat, spoke up, her voice laced with doubt. "But, Inoue Hao, your methods have been...unorthodox, to say the least. How can we trust that you will lead us to victory against this new threat?"

Inoue Hao's expression remained stoic, his eyes burning with intensity. "I am not asking for trust," he replied. "I am offering a chance to prove my conviction. I have spent cycles studying the ancient arts, and I am confident in my ability to defeat Baito."

As the debate raged on, Inoue Hao stood firm, his resolve unwavering. He knew that the fate of their galaxy hung in the balance, and he was determined to do whatever it took to protect it. With a fierce determination burning within him, Inoue Hao Hao vowed to lead the charge against Baito and reclaim their galaxy from the brink of destruction.

The senators nodded, acknowledging his resolve, and the alliance was formed. Together, they would face the challenges ahead, with Inoue Hao Hao at the forefront, guiding them towards victory.
