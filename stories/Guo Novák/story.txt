It was a chilly winter morning in Prague, and Guo Novák stood at the edge of Charles Bridge, gazing out at the frozen Vltava River. The city was quiet, save for the sound of ice crackling beneath his boots as he walked along the bridge.

Novák was a mysterious figure, shrouded in intrigue and rumor. Few people knew much about him, except that he was an artist, a painter of breathtaking beauty and skill. His works were sought after by collectors and museums alike, but Novák himself remained elusive, rarely giving interviews or appearing in public.

As he walked, Novák's thoughts turned to the latest commission he had received – a private buyer, willing to pay top dollar for a new piece. The subject was a woman, with porcelain skin and raven hair, posed against a backdrop of snow-covered mountains. It was a challenging piece, but one that excited him.

After a few minutes of contemplation, Novák reached the end of the bridge and continued on into the city streets. He knew exactly where he was going – to his studio, tucked away in a secluded alleyway near Old Town Square. The building was small, with narrow windows and a heavy wooden door, but Novák had a key hidden somewhere, just in case.

Once inside, Novák lit the gas lamps and began to set up his easel and paints. He worked with incredible speed and precision, lost in the world of color and light that he created on canvas. Hours passed, and the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the room.

Finally, exhausted but exhilarated, Novák stepped back from the canvas, surveying his work. It was beautiful – a woman, poised against the mountains, with eyes closed as if in rapture. The snowflakes around her seemed to be suspended in mid-air, like tiny diamonds on black velvet. He smiled to himself, knowing that this piece would be truly special.

Just then, there was a knock at the door, followed by a soft voice, asking for permission to enter. Novák opened the door to reveal his assistant, an agile young woman named Maja. She had been working with him for months, learning the intricacies of his art and assisting with commissions.

"What's new?" Novák asked, gesturing her inside.

Maja handed over a letter, sealed in red wax. "From our buyer," she said quietly.

Novák unsealed the envelope and scanned its contents – a message requesting an early meeting to discuss further details about the commission. He nodded, his mind racing with ideas. This was going to be good. Very good indeed.

With renewed energy, Novák dived back into his work, lost once more in the world of color and light that he created on canvas. The night seemed to stretch out before him like an endless canvas, waiting for him to bring his vision to life.
