Clara Ozoliņš stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the chill of the Baltic air hitting her like a slap in the face. She had been away for what felt like an eternity, and yet the city seemed to have changed little since she last set foot here.

As she made her way through the crowded station, Clara's thoughts were consumed by the letter she had received that morning. Her mother, the woman who had raised her alone after her father's disappearance, lay dying in a small hospital bed on the outskirts of town. The words blurred together on the page as Clara struggled to come to terms with the reality of her situation.

The streets of Riga were narrow and winding, lined with crumbling buildings and vendors hawking their wares from street corners. Clara navigated them with ease, having grown up here in this very same city. She had always known its rhythms and secrets, but now she felt like a stranger to it all.

She turned onto the Kalku iela, her heart heavy with foreboding. The hospital loomed before her, a squat building with a cold stone façade that seemed to absorb the light around it. Clara pushed open the door and stepped inside, the sterile smell of disinfectant greeting her like an old friend.

The waiting room was dimly lit, its chairs arranged in neat rows as if inviting patients to sit for extended periods. Clara's eyes scanned the space, searching for a familiar face among the scattered families and anxious relatives. And then she saw her - her mother, frail but still radiant in her own quiet way, lying in bed with a mask covering her nose and mouth.

"Clara," a soft voice called out, and Clara rushed to her side. Her mother's eyes flickered towards her, a hint of recognition sparking within them before they seemed to fade once more. "I'm so glad you're here, darling," she whispered, the words barely audible.

The next few hours passed in a blur of tears and whispers, Clara holding her mother's hand as the life ebbed slowly from her body. As the doctor led her out of the room, Clara felt a sense of emptiness wash over her, like a part of her had been torn away.
