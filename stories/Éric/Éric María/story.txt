Éric María stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the familiar sights of his hometown. The once-thriving industrial town had seen better days, but to Éric, it was home. He had returned after years away, seeking refuge from the chaos of his past.

As he made his way through the deserted streets, the only sound being the soft crunch of gravel beneath his feet, Éric felt a sense of nostalgia wash over him. He thought back to his childhood, playing in these very same streets with his siblings and friends. His parents had always been proud of their son, who had grown up to become a successful businessman.

But success had come at a cost. Éric's marriage had crumbled under the pressure of his demanding career, and he had lost touch with the people and things that truly mattered to him. He had spent years trying to fill the void, but it seemed like no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't shake the feeling of emptiness inside.

As he approached his family's old house, now faded and worn, Éric felt a pang of sadness. His parents were gone, and his siblings had long since moved away. But he knew that this place still held memories, good and bad. It was where he had grown up, learned to walk and talk, and made countless mistakes.

Éric opened the creaky front door and stepped inside, his eyes adjusting to the dim light. The air was thick with dust and the scent of decay, but Éric felt a sense of peace wash over him. This was home, where he could be himself without the pretenses of the world outside.

For the first time in years, Éric María felt like he was exactly where he was meant to be. He took a deep breath, letting the familiar scent fill his lungs, and knew that he was ready to face whatever lay ahead.
