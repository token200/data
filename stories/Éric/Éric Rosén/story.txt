Éric Rosén stepped into the misty night air, his eyes fixed on the old café in front of him. The sign creaked in the gentle breeze, reading "La Belle Époque" in faded gold letters. He had received a message from an unknown sender, hinting at a long-lost family secret hidden within the café's walls.

As he pushed open the door, a bell above it rang out, and the room fell silent. The patrons turned to regard him with curiosity, their faces illuminated by the warm glow of candles and the soft hum of jazz music in the background. Éric took a seat at the bar, ordering a whiskey as his eyes scanned the space.

A woman with piercing green eyes watched him from across the room, her gaze both wary and inviting. She introduced herself as Colette, the café's owner, and invited Éric to join her for a conversation. As they sipped their drinks, Colette began to weave a tale of family history, speaking in hushed tones of his great-grandfather, a notorious smuggler who had operated under the cover of La Belle Époque.

Éric listened intently, his mind racing with memories and questions. His parents had always been tight-lipped about their past, but now he felt an insatiable urge to uncover the truth. Colette revealed that his great-grandfather had hidden a treasure somewhere within the café's walls, and only those who knew the correct password could access it.

Intrigued, Éric asked for the password, but Colette merely smiled enigmatically, hinting that it lay in the eyes of another patron. As he turned to investigate, his gaze locked onto a man sitting alone at a corner table, watching him with an intensity that made Éric's skin prickle.

Without hesitation, Éric rose from his seat and approached the mysterious stranger, who revealed himself as Jean-Pierre, a direct descendant of Éric's great-grandfather. Together, they began to unravel a complex web of secrets and family history, their conversation spilling over into the night air like stars bursting into the sky.

As the hours passed, the café grew quieter, its patrons disappearing one by one. Colette locked up the shop, leaving Éric alone with Jean-Pierre and the whispers of La Belle Époque's past. Together, they vanished into the misty darkness, their footsteps echoing through the night, as if the very secrets themselves were alive and walking beside them.
