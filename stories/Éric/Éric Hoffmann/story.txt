Éric Hoffmann stepped into the dimly lit café, the soft hum of conversation and clinking cups enveloping him like a warm hug. As a journalist, he'd spent countless hours in places like this, gathering stories and sipping coffee with sources who shared their tales of woe or triumph.

But today was different. Today, Éric was here to meet an old friend, a man named Marcel who'd been missing for weeks. The police had given up on him, but Éric's instincts told him that Marcel was still alive, and he aimed to find out why.

As he waited for Marcel to arrive, Éric sipped his coffee and surveyed the café. It was one of those places where time stood still, where the world outside receded and all that mattered was the present moment. He felt a pang of nostalgia wash over him; he'd spent many late nights in this very same chair, working on stories and chasing leads.

The door swung open, and Marcel strode in, his eyes tired but his smile warm. Éric rose to greet him, embracing him warmly as they exchanged air-kisses. The two friends had grown up together, exploring the city's hidden corners and sharing secrets.

"Where have you been?" Éric asked, as they slid into a booth.

Marcel took a deep breath before answering. "I've been hiding," he said quietly. "From my past."

Éric raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean?"

Marcel leaned in close, his voice barely above a whisper. "I was involved in something... unsavory. Something that could get me killed if the wrong people found out."

Éric's journalist instincts kicked in, but he didn't press Marcel for details just yet. He wanted to hear more about what had driven his friend to flee, and whether there was truth to Marcel's warnings.

As they talked, the hours slipped by like grains of sand in an hourglass. Éric listened intently, his mind racing with theories and questions. He knew that he'd need to dig deeper, but for now, he was content to sit with Marcel and hear his story.

The night wore on, the café growing quieter as the patrons departed. But Éric and Marcel remained, lost in conversation, their bond strengthened by the secrets they shared. As the darkness outside seemed to press in, Éric knew that this was just the beginning of a new investigation – one that would take him down a path he wasn't sure he wanted to tread.
