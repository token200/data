Éric Junko stepped off the crowded train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the familiar landscape of his hometown. The scent of saltwater and seaweed filled the air as he made his way down to the dock, where his old wooden sailboat waited.

As a child, Éric had spent countless hours on this very boat, learning the ins and outs of sailing from his father, who had been a master sailor in his own right. The sea had called to him from a young age, and he had always felt most at home when the wind was in his hair and the waves crashed against the hull.

Years had passed since Éric last sailed on his beloved Junko, but he couldn't shake the feeling that it was time to set sail once more. His father had passed away, leaving him a small inheritance and a lifetime of memories tied to the sea.

Éric's thoughts turned to his sister, Sophie, who had taken up her father's legacy, restoring many of their family's old boats and sailing them around the world. He hadn't seen her in years, but he knew that she would be thrilled to hear that he was back on the water.

As he cast off and motored out of the harbor, Éric felt a sense of peace wash over him. The rhythmic creaking of the wooden hull and the cries of seagulls overhead were like music to his ears. He knew every inch of this boat, every knot, every sail trim. This was home.

The sea was rougher than he remembered, but Éric's hands moved with practiced ease as he adjusted the sails and trimmed the boat for speed. The wind howled around him, whipping his hair into a frenzy, but he felt alive.

Suddenly, on the horizon, Éric spotted a figure standing on the deck of a passing ship. As the vessel drew closer, he saw that it was Sophie, her eyes shining with excitement as she waved at him.

Éric grinned, feeling a sense of joy and connection that he hadn't experienced in years. He raised his own arms, shouting out into the wind to be heard over the thunder of the waves.

"Junko is home!"
