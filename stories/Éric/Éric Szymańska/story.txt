Éric Szymańska sat alone at his desk, staring blankly at the wall as he tried to muster up the motivation to start working on his novel. A struggling writer in his mid-twenties, Éric had always dreamed of making a name for himself in the literary world, but so far, his writing career had been met with nothing but rejection letters and crushing disappointment.

As he sipped on his lukewarm coffee, his mind wandered to all the times he'd heard about successful writers who seemed to effortlessly produce bestselling novels. How did they do it? What was their secret? Éric felt like a failure, stuck in a dead-end job while his friends were out living their lives.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was his neighbor, Mrs. Kowalska, a kind-hearted woman who always brought him fresh-baked pastries and warm smiles.

"Hey, Éric! I saw you sitting here staring at the wall like a lost puppy," she said with a chuckle. "Do you need some company or just want to talk?"

Éric sighed and rubbed his temples, feeling a headache coming on. "Just a little bit of inspiration would be great, Mrs. Kowalska. I'm stuck."

Mrs. Kowalska plopped down beside him, her hands clasped together in her lap. "Let me tell you a secret," she said with a sly grin. "The best writers aren't those who produce bestselling novels; they're the ones who write from the heart. Don't worry about what others think; just write what moves you."

Éric raised an eyebrow, intrigued by Mrs. Kowalska's words. He thought back to his childhood days of writing short stories and poems for his school newspaper. When had he stopped doing that?

"Write something bad," she said with a mischievous twinkle in her eye. "Write something ridiculous, something that makes you laugh or cry or feel uncomfortable. Just write."

Éric hesitated at first, but something about Mrs. Kowalska's words resonated deep within him. He picked up his pen and began scribbling furiously on a blank sheet of paper. The words flowed out of him like water from a fountain: "The sky was a giant purple eggplant that hung in the sky, slowly rotting away...and I felt its weight upon my shoulders..."

As he wrote, Éric felt a strange sense of liberation wash over him. He forgot about his fears and doubts and rejections. All that mattered was the flow of words onto the page.

Mrs. Kowalska smiled at him, her eyes shining with approval. "That's it, Éric! You're writing from the heart."

Éric looked up at her, feeling a renewed sense of purpose. He knew he still had a long way to go, but for now, he was content with just starting again.
