Éric Korolev stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit café, shaking the water from his coat. A former KGB agent turned freelance journalist, he had a knack for uncovering secrets that others didn't dare to touch. His reputation as a tenacious investigator had earned him a steady stream of clients willing to pay top dollar for his services.

As he waited in line to order, Éric's mind wandered back to his days working for the Soviet Union's infamous intelligence agency. It was there that he had been known by his codename, Korolev-4. The memories still lingered, a constant reminder of the life he had left behind.

He ordered a coffee and took a seat at the bar, scanning the room for familiar faces. A young woman with piercing green eyes caught his attention – she looked like a novice operative, eager to prove herself. Éric's instincts told him that this was someone worth watching.

Over the next few hours, he observed her interactions with other patrons, noting the way she asked pointed questions and deftly steered conversations toward sensitive topics. It wasn't long before he became convinced that she was a rookie agent, fresh out of the academy and eager to make a name for herself.

As the evening wore on, Éric made his move, striking up a conversation with the woman under the guise of a chance encounter. She hesitated at first, but her curiosity eventually got the better of her. They chatted about everything from politics to literature, with Éric expertly probing for information without arousing suspicion.

It wasn't until they left the café and stepped out into the cool night air that he sensed she was more than just a curious journalist. There was something in the way she looked at him, a glimmer of recognition that made Éric's skin prickle. He realized, with a start, that he had been played – she wasn't here to interview him, but to test his skills.

As they parted ways, Éric couldn't help but smile. Another puzzle solved, another secret kept safe from those who would misuse it. The game was far from over, and Éric Korolev-4 was ready for whatever came next.
