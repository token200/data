Éric Farah sat alone at his small café, sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee. His piercing green eyes seemed to hold a thousand secrets as he stared out into the rain-soaked streets of Montmartre. The artist's latest piece, "La Nuit Éternelle," hung unfinished in his studio above, a canvas shrouded in mystery and despair.

As a child, Éric had always been fascinated by the night sky – its celestial maps etched across his bedroom ceiling like constellations on a velvet sheet. His parents, both struggling artists themselves, encouraged his curiosity, but it wasn't until he met Aurélie that his passion for stargazing became an all-consuming force.

Aurélie was gone now, lost to the cruel hand of fate just as Éric's career began to take off. The memory of her bright smile still lingered in his thoughts like a ghostly whisper in the dead of night. He felt lost without her – like a sailor adrift on an ocean of uncertainty.

The café door creaked open, and a young woman slipped inside, shaking the rain from her coat. Her eyes locked onto Éric's, and for an instant, he thought he saw a flicker of recognition. Perhaps it was just his imagination playing tricks on him, but he felt a jolt of hope.

As she waited in line to order, Éric rose from his seat and wandered over to the window, gazing out at the rain-drenched streets below. He noticed the woman lingering by the door, watching him with an intensity that made his skin prickle.

"Bonjour," she said softly, approaching him with a smile that might have been mistaken for a sigh of relief. "I saw your work online and just had to meet you. You're Éric Farah?"

He nodded warily, unsure where this chance encounter would lead.

"My name is Léa," she continued. "And I'm an art student at the École des Beaux-Arts. Your work speaks to me on a level that feels almost...home."

Éric's eyes locked onto hers once more, searching for any sign of deceit or false enthusiasm. But what he saw there was genuine awe and curiosity.

"Come see my studio," he said finally, extending a hand in invitation.

Léa's smile deepened as she took his hand, and together they stepped into the night, leaving behind the lonely café and its unfinished masterpiece.
