Éric Rasmussen stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out at the glittering lights of Copenhagen. The Danish night air was crisp and cool, carrying the scent of saltwater and freshly brewed coffee from the café below. He lit a cigarette, feeling the familiar tension in his chest as he stared out at the city.

Éric was a man of contradictions – a quiet introvert with a penchant for danger, a careful planner with an unshakeable sense of impulsiveness. As a freelance journalist, he had made a name for himself by poking around the darker corners of Copenhagen's society, always on the lookout for the next big story.

Tonight, Éric was waiting for a source who promised to reveal some explosive information about a local politician's shady dealings. He checked his watch for what felt like the hundredth time, his eyes scanning the rooftops for any sign of movement.

As he waited, Éric couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He glanced around, but the only sound was the distant hum of traffic and the occasional bark from a stray dog. Still, the sensation persisted, sending a shiver down his spine.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows, moving with an air of stealth that belied their age. Éric recognized the tall, lanky frame of his source, Jens, who had promised to bring him some explosive intel on the local council's corruption scandal.

Jens slid onto the rooftop beside Éric, handing over a sheaf of documents and a CD containing audio recordings that would blow the whole thing wide open. As they exchanged pleasantries, Éric couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement – this was it, the break he had been waiting for.

But as Jens turned to leave, Éric caught a glimpse of something out of the corner of his eye – a second figure, lurking just beyond the edge of the rooftop. This one was different from Jens – shorter, younger, with eyes that seemed to gleam in the dark.

For an instant, their gazes locked, and Éric felt a jolt of recognition. He had seen those eyes before, in a surveillance photo of a notorious hacker group operating on the fringes of Copenhagen's underworld. Suddenly, the whole situation took a deadly turn – this was more than just a story; it was a trap.

Without hesitation, Éric snatched Jens's documents and CD, shoving them into his bag as he followed the second figure off into the night. The darkness closed in around him like a shroud, but he knew one thing for sure: he would get to the bottom of this – no matter what it took.
