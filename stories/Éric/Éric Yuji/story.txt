Éric Yuji trudged through the streets of Tokyo, his eyes fixed on the pavement beneath his feet. It had been three days since his grandmother's passing, and he couldn't shake off the feeling of emptiness that lingered in his chest. She was more than just a family member to him - she was his closest friend.

As a child, Éric Yuji spent countless afternoons playing with his grandmother in their small apartment. She taught him how to cook traditional Japanese dishes, played old records of Enya and Sarah McLachlan on repeat, and even shared her own stories of love and loss. Her eyes sparkled like the stars on clear nights as she whispered tales of her youth, her voice weaving a spell that only Éric could hear.

Now, Éric's thoughts wandered back to those afternoons spent with his grandmother. He remembered how she'd gently pat his hair, her fingers tracing the shape of his eyes in the mirror. "You have my sparkles inside you, kiddo," she'd say, smiling at him like a secret was being shared between two conspirators.

As Éric turned a corner, he noticed an old record store tucked away on a side street. A bell above the door jingled softly as he pushed it open, and the musty scent of aged vinyl wafted through the air. The shopkeeper, a bespectacled man named Taro, looked up from behind the counter.

"Ah, welcome to our humble abode!" Taro said with a warm smile. "What brings you here today?"

Éric hesitated for a moment before running his fingers over the spines of the records stacked against the shelves. They were his grandmother's favorite albums - Enya, Sarah McLachlan, and a tattered copy of Maria Callas' opera recordings. As he touched each disc, memories flooded back: lazy Sunday afternoons spent dancing to "Voyageur" on repeat, singing along to "Music Was My Heartbeat", and the tender lullaby of "Hallelujah".

Taro noticed Éric's fascination with the records and nodded knowingly. "Your grandmother's treasures, I presume?" He placed a worn copy of Enya's 'Watermark' into Éric's hands, his eyes shining with understanding.

As Éric listened to the opening notes of 'Watersong', he felt his grandmother's presence surround him once more - like she was singing softly in the shadows, her sparkles alive within him.
