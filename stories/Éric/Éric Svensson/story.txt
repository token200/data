Éric Svensson stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out at the cityscape below. The wind whipped his dark hair into a frenzy as he clenched his fists, his eyes scanning the streets for any sign of trouble. As a freelance journalist and private investigator, Éric had seen it all - from corporate espionage to high-stakes heists.

But tonight was different. Tonight, Éric was on the hunt for answers about his sister's disappearance. It had been six months since Lena Svensson vanished, leaving behind only a cryptic message that read: "They're watching me."

Éric's mind replayed the events leading up to her disappearance - the strange phone calls, the suspicious strangers lurking in the shadows. He was convinced that someone was out to get him too, and now he was more determined than ever to uncover the truth.

As he scanned the rooftops, a figure caught his eye. A woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair perched on the edge of a nearby building, her gaze locked onto Éric's. For a moment, they just stared at each other, the tension between them palpable.

Without hesitation, Éric sprinted towards the woman, dodging construction equipment and leaping over obstacles as he went. He finally reached her side, his breath coming in ragged gasps.

"Who are you?" he demanded, his hand on her arm.

The woman smiled, a mischievous glint in her eye. "I'm someone who can help you find your sister," she said, producing a small USB drive from her pocket. "But first, you have to trust me."

Éric hesitated for a moment, but something about the woman's words resonated with him. He nodded, and together they descended into the darkness below, ready to face whatever lay ahead.

As they disappeared into the night, Éric knew that his search for answers had just become a whole lot more complicated - and a whole lot more personal. With Lena's disappearance still fresh in his mind, he was willing to risk everything to uncover the truth. Little did he know, this was just the beginning of an adventure that would take him to the very limits of his sanity - and beyond.
