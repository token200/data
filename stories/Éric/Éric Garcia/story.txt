Éric Garcia stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the worn wooden planks creaking beneath his feet. He gazed out at the sleepy town, its streets lined with ancient stone buildings that seemed to lean in as if sharing a secret.

It had been twenty years since Éric left this place, fleeing the shadows of his own making. As a teenager, he'd been part of a tight-knit group of friends who'd stumbled upon an ancient ritual hidden deep within the woods. The forbidden knowledge they'd unlocked had changed everything -Éric's life forever.

He'd tried to suppress the memories, to erase the nightmares that haunted him still. But as the years passed, the ghosts of his past began to resurface. He'd lost touch with his friends, each one disappearing into their own separate lives, leaving Éric feeling like a ghost himself.

Now, he was back in Saint-Cyrille, the very place where it all began. A chill ran down his spine as he made his way through the deserted streets. The once-thriving town seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for something - or someone.

As he walked, Éric felt an inexplicable sense of unease, like being watched by unseen eyes. He quickened his pace, dodging alleys and side streets until he finally reached the old oak tree where they'd first performed the ritual.

The wind rustled through its leaves, whispering secrets in a language only the wind could understand. Éric's heart pounded as he remembered that fateful night - the laughter, the excitement, and the madness. He felt the weight of his past bearing down on him like a physical force, threatening to consume him whole.

With shaking hands, Éric reached into his pocket and pulled out an old photograph. It was a picture of himself, standing alongside his friends beneath the same ancient oak tree. The smile he'd worn that night had long since faded, replaced by a haunted look that now seemed laughable.

As he gazed upon the image, something shifted inside Éric. He felt the memories surge back to life, flooding him with a tidal wave of emotions. Tears streamed down his face as he realized he wasn't alone anymore - there was still a piece of himself left in Saint-Cyrille, and it was calling out for release.

The oak tree's branches creaked in the wind, whispering secrets that only Éric could hear: "It's time to let go. Time to finally set you free."
