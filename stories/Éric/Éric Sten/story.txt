Éric Sten stood at the edge of the bustling city, gazing out at the endless sea of strangers rushing to and fro. As a freelance journalist, he was no stranger to the anonymity of the urban jungle. But tonight, he felt a sense of unease wash over him. It had been three years since his sister's disappearance, and the case remained unsolved.

Éric Sten took a deep breath, squaring his shoulders as he set off into the fray. He had received a cryptic tip about a potential lead in the investigation, and he was determined to follow it down. The streets were crowded, but Éric Sten navigated them with ease, his trained eye scanning the crowds for any sign of trouble.

As he walked, the sounds of the city enveloped him – car horns blaring, people shouting, sirens wailing in the distance. It was a cacophony that usually brought him alive, but tonight it felt oppressive. He quickened his pace, his heart beating just a little faster with every step.

He turned down a narrow alleyway, the walls towering above him like sentinels. The air was thick with the smell of trash and exhaust fumes. Éric Sten's eyes adjusted slowly to the dim light, and he saw it – a small piece of paper tacked to a wall, with a single sentence scrawled on it in red ink.

"It started here," the note read. "Look again at the night she vanished."

Éric Sten's mind racing, he quickly pulled out his notebook and jotted down every detail. This was it – this was the break he had been waiting for. He tucked the paper into his pocket, feeling a surge of excitement course through him.

For the first time in years, Éric Sten felt like he might actually find his sister's killer. The city seemed to stretch out before him like a promise, full of possibilities and secrets waiting to be uncovered. With renewed determination, he set off into the night, ready to follow the trail wherever it led.
