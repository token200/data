One evening, as Éric was preparing for an exhibition opening, he received an unexpected visit from his estranged father, who had been living abroad for years. The two had a complicated relationship, but on this particular night, they seemed to put their differences aside.

Over a bottle of wine, Éric's father shared stories of his own adventures, and the two began to reconnect on a deeper level. As the night wore on, Éric realized that his journey was not just about showcasing art, but also about understanding his own place in the world.
