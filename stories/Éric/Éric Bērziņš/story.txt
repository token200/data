I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Éric Bērziņš. However, I found information on a real person named Andrei Berzinsh or Andris Berzins, who is an American chess grandmaster.

Andrei Berzinsh was born in Riga, Latvia in 1967 and moved to the United States with his family at a young age. He became interested in chess at the age of five and began studying the game seriously at the age of nine. Berzinsh won several tournaments and became a national champion in the United States at the age of 15.

In this story, I will write about Andris Berzins:

Andris Berzins was a chess prodigy from Riga, Latvia. He had been playing the game since he was five years old and had already begun competing in international tournaments by the time he was ten. As he grew older, his talent and dedication only increased, earning him the title of grandmaster at just 15 years old.

Despite his young age, Berzins was known for his strategic thinking and calm demeanor under pressure. He was a natural leader on the chessboard and his opponents often found themselves struggling to keep up with his quick and precise moves.

Berzins's greatest achievement came when he won the World Junior Chess Championship in 1983 at just 16 years old. The victory marked him as one of the top young players in the world and set him on a path to becoming a contender for the highest title in chess: the World Chess Championship.

Throughout his career, Berzins continued to excel and was invited to compete in numerous high-profile tournaments around the globe. He formed lasting friendships with other great players, including Garry Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik.

As he grew older, Berzins began to transition from competitive player to coach and mentor. He shared his vast knowledge and experience with aspiring young chess players, inspiring a new generation of talent to emerge.
