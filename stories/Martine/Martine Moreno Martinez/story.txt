Martine Moreno Martinez was known for her infectious laughter and warm smile that could light up a room. As a child, she had always been the center of attention, with her bright hazel eyes sparkling like diamonds in the sunlight. Growing up in a small town surrounded by rolling hills and lush forests, Martine spent most of her days exploring the outdoors, collecting leaves and watching birds.
