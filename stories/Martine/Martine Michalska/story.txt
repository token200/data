One day, while investigating a string of high-end jewelry store robberies, Martine Michalska was called to the scene of the latest heist. The owner, Mrs. Jenkins, was frantic and accused one of her employees, a young man named Alex, of being the culprit.

Martine Michalska listened intently as Mrs. Jenkins recounted the events leading up to the robbery. She noticed that Alex seemed nervous and fidgety, but she couldn't quite put her finger on what was amiss. As she began her investigation, Martine Michalska discovered a small thread of fabric caught in the window lock.

She took the fabric to her lab for analysis and soon found out that it came from a bespoke suit made by none other than Alex's uncle, a high-end tailor. This revelation led Martine Michalska to suspect that Alex was indeed involved, but she knew she needed more evidence.

Over the next few days, Martine Michalska pieced together the events of the heist and discovered that Alex had been coerced into participating by his uncle, who stood to gain a large sum from the sale of the stolen jewels. However, it turned out that Alex's uncle was not the mastermind behind the robberies.
