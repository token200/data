Martine Ospanov stepped into the small café on the outskirts of town, her eyes scanning the dimly lit room with a mixture of curiosity and caution. As an expert in rare artifacts, she had been tracking this particular lead for weeks, and finally, she had received a tip that a valuable relic was hidden somewhere within these walls.

With a practiced air of nonchalance, Martine made her way to the counter, where a gruff but friendly barista greeted her with a nod. "Coffee or tea?" he asked, his voice low and gravelly.

"Just coffee," she replied, unwrapping the scarf from around her neck as she waited for her drink to be prepared. The café was small, with only a handful of patrons scattered throughout, all of whom seemed oblivious to Martine's true intentions.

As she sipped her coffee, Martine took in her surroundings, her trained eye scanning the room for any sign of suspicious activity. That's when she saw it – a small, intricately carved box on the table beside an elderly man with wispy white hair and piercing blue eyes.

Martine's heart skipped a beat as she recognized the symbol etched onto the box's lid. It was an ancient rune, one that indicated this artifact was far more valuable than she had initially thought. She watched intently as the old man pulled out a small key and inserted it into the box's lock.

With a soft click, the box swung open, revealing a stunning golden statue within. Martine's breath caught in her throat as she reached for her phone to take a photo of the relic. But before she could snap a picture, the old man caught her gaze and smiled knowingly.

"You're Martine Ospanov," he said, his voice low and gravelly, just like the barista's. "I've been expecting you."

Martine's eyes narrowed as she took in the old man's words. What did he know about her? How had he known she was looking for this artifact? She smiled coolly, intrigued by the mystery unfolding before her.

With a practiced air of professionalism, Martine Ospanov reached out to extend her hand, sealing the deal and claiming the statue as her own.
