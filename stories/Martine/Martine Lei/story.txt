Martine Lei had always been fascinated by the art of calligraphy. Growing up in a family of traditional Chinese artists, she was taught the intricacies of brushstrokes and ink from a young age.

The owner, an elderly man named Mr. Wong, took notice of her sketchbook and offered to teach her the art of traditional Chinese printing. Entranced by the process, Martine spent hours learning the intricacies of woodblock printing.

As she worked with Mr. Wong, Martine discovered a new passion for storytelling through visual arts. She began creating intricate prints that told stories of ancient myths and legends, using bold colors and delicate patterns to bring her designs to life.
