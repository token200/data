Martine Jie was a young and ambitious journalist who had just landed her first job at the prestigious New Taipei Times. Born and raised in Taiwan, Martine had always been fascinated by the stories of her ancestors, who had fled to China during the Japanese colonial period. Her family's history had instilled in her a strong sense of social justice, and she was determined to use her journalism career to tell the stories that needed to be told.

One day, while researching for an article on the struggles of migrant workers in Taiwan, Martine stumbled upon an old man named Lin who had been working on the construction site for over 20 years. Lin's story was one of resilience and sacrifice, but also of exploitation and neglect by the government and corporate interests. Despite his age, Martine saw something in Lin that reminded her of herself - a fire in his eyes that refused to be extinguished.

Moved by Lin's tale, Martine decided to write an expos√© on the migrant worker crisis in Taiwan. Her article sparked outrage among the public and brought attention from policymakers and human rights groups. Overnight, Martine became a rising star in Taiwanese journalism, known for her courage and dogged determination.

However, not everyone was pleased with Martine's newfound fame. A powerful business lobby group launched a smear campaign against her, labeling her as "radical" and " unpatriotic". Undeterred, Martine continued to push forward, knowing that the truth she had uncovered would eventually win out in the end.

The battle between Martine and the business lobby was far from over, but for now, she stood tall, her words ringing out across the headlines. She knew that there were more stories like Lin's out there, waiting to be told, and she was determined to tell them all. As she left the office one evening, Martine smiled to herself, knowing that she had found her calling in life - to shed light on the darkest corners of society and to fight for justice.

With a sense of purpose and conviction, Martine walked into the night, ready to take on whatever challenges lay ahead, armed with nothing but her pen and her unwavering commitment to truth.
