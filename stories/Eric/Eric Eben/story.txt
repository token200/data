One fateful evening, Eric Eben received a visit from the beautiful and intelligent Detective Emily Wilson. She was working on a high-profile murder case, and her team was struggling to crack it. Eric Eben listened intently as she explained the details of the crime scene, his eyes narrowing as he took in every piece of information.
