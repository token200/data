Growing up in a small town, he had seen firsthand the impact that local news could have on its community. After completing his degree in journalism, Eric landed a job at the local newspaper, determined to make a name for himself as a fearless reporter.

One day, while researching a story on corruption in city government, Eric stumbled upon a cryptic tip about a high-ranking official who was secretly embezzling funds from the town's budget. The lead sent shivers down his spine as he knew that this could be the scoop of a lifetime.
