Eric Schafer walked into the dimly lit jazz club, scanning the room for his contact. As a freelance journalist, he had gotten used to dealing with shady characters and underground sources. But tonight was different - he was meeting a confidential informant who claimed to have information on the latest city politics scandal.

As he made his way through the crowded dance floor, Eric's eyes landed on a figure huddled in the corner, nursing a whiskey. He recognized the worn leather jacket as belonging to Jack Harris, a former politician with a history of making enemies. Eric approached him cautiously, hand resting on his pen.

"Jack, what have you got for me?" Eric asked, his voice low and even.

Harris glanced around nervously before leaning in close. "Eric Schafer, I trust you can keep this confidential," he whispered. "But I've been working with some sources who claim that City Councilman Jenkins is involved in a massive bribery scheme."

Eric's ears perked up at the revelation. He jotted down some notes on his pad, his mind racing with possibilities.

"What makes you think this, Jack?" Eric pressed, his curiosity piqued.

Harris hesitated before speaking. "Let's just say I have my ways of getting information. But be warned, Eric Schafer, Jenkins has a reputation for being ruthless when it comes to silencing people who get too close to the truth."

Eric nodded thoughtfully, tucking his notebook into his pocket. He had been down this road before, but he knew that getting to the bottom of such scandals often required taking risks.

As he turned to leave, Harris called out after him. "Keep digging, Eric Schafer. I have a feeling this is just the tip of the iceberg."

Eric smiled wryly to himself as he made his way back into the night. He knew that with stories like these, it was always going to be a long and winding road to truth. But he was Eric Schafer, after all - a journalist with a reputation for following every lead no matter where it led.
