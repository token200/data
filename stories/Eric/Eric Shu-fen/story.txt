Eric Shu-fen was a young and ambitious journalist who had just landed her dream job at a prestigious newspaper in Taipei. Born to Taiwanese parents, Eric had always been fascinated by the stories of her ancestors and the rich history of Taiwan. She saw herself as a bridge between past and present, using her writing to shed light on the often-overlooked corners of her homeland.

As she settled into her new role, Eric threw herself into her work with infectious enthusiasm. Her colleagues were drawn to her sharp mind and quick wit, and soon she was taking on major assignments that showcased her talents. From investigative pieces to feature stories, Eric's writing was always engaging and insightful, giving readers a fresh perspective on the issues that mattered.

Despite the demands of her job, Eric made time for her passion project: a series of articles exploring the history and culture of Taiwan's indigenous communities. She spent countless hours researching, interviewing, and listening, determined to share the stories of these often-marginalized groups with the world.

One evening, as she worked late in her small office, Eric received an unexpected visit from her grandmother, Ah-Ma. A native speaker of the Hoklo dialect, Ah-Ma had taught Eric the importance of respecting tradition and preserving cultural heritage. As they sipped tea together, Eric confided in Ah-Ma about her latest research findings, seeking guidance on how to tell the most compelling stories.

Ah-Ma listened intently, nodding her head as Eric spoke. When she finally spoke up, her voice was low and soothing. "Eric Shu-fen, your writing is like a river that flows effortlessly through the landscape of our people," she said. "Never forget the stories of those who came before you."

Inspired by Ah-Ma's words, Eric redoubled her efforts, pouring all her energy into completing her project. The result was a series of articles that won widespread acclaim and recognition, cementing Eric Shu-fen's reputation as one of Taiwan's most talented young journalists.
