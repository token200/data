Eric Hebert had always been fascinated by the world of antique cars. As a child, he would spend hours poring over his father's old restoration manuals and dreaming of one day owning his own classic vehicle. Years later, that dream became a reality when Eric inherited his grandfather's vintage garage from his estate.

Eric Hebert was thrilled to find that the garage was still filled with all sorts of antique cars, each one meticulously restored to its former glory.

One day, while exploring the garage, Eric stumbled upon a dusty old manual belonging to his grandfather. As he flipped through its yellowed pages, he came across a note that read: "For my beloved grandson Eric Hebert, may you one day follow in my footsteps and carry on our family's legacy." Tears welled up in Eric's eyes as he realized the significance of the moment.

With newfound determination, Eric set out to learn everything there was to know about antique cars.
