As she packed up her paints and brushes, ready to move on to her next project, she felt a sense of satisfaction wash over her. For Sasha Perez Sanchez, creating was not just a hobby, but a way of life.

As the stars began to twinkle overhead, Sasha gazed out at the city, feeling grateful for this strange and wonderful world she lived in.
