Miguel Novák had always been an enigma to those who knew him. A quiet, introspective man with an air of mystery surrounding him like a shroud. As a child, he would often sit for hours in the corner of the room, observing the world around him with an intensity that bordered on detachment.

As he grew older, Miguel's reclusive nature only deepened. He became increasingly withdrawn, shutting himself away from friends and family to pursue his own private interests. His parents had long since given up trying to coax him out of his shell, resigning themselves to the fact that their son would always be a solitary figure.

But despite his aloof demeanor, Miguel possessed an insatiable curiosity about the world around him. He devoured books on everything from physics to philosophy, and spent countless hours lost in the pages of his favorite authors. It was as if he were searching for answers to questions he didn't even know how to ask.

One day, while wandering through a dusty used bookstore, Miguel stumbled upon an ancient tome bound in worn leather. The title, "The Secrets of the Unseen", seemed to leap off the shelf and into his eyes. Intrigued, he purchased the book and spent the next several weeks pouring over its yellowed pages.

As he delved deeper into the text, Miguel began to experience strange occurrences that left him questioning his own sanity. He would find himself standing in front of a door only to realize he had no memory of entering the room, or see fleeting glimpses of faces in crowds where there should be none.

It was then that Miguel realized he had stumbled upon something much larger than himself – a hidden world, one that existed parallel to his own. And with this knowledge came both a sense of wonder and dread.

As the days turned into weeks, Miguel's withdrawal from society grew more pronounced. His parents received increasingly frantic messages from him, begging them to come to his side before he lost what was left of his grip on reality.

In the end, it was only when Miguel was too far gone for help to be offered that a concerned stranger stumbled upon him in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. The air was thick with dust and the scent of decay as Miguel sat hunched over a tattered book, his eyes fixed intently on some unseen point beyond.

"You're not like other people," the stranger observed softly.

Miguel turned to face her, a faint glimmer in his eye. "I've always been different," he replied, his voice barely above a whisper. "But I think that's what makes me human."
