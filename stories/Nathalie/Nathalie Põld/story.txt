Nathalie's big break came when she was discovered by a talent scout at a folk music festival in Tartu. She was just 19 years old at the time and had been performing locally for years, but this moment marked the beginning of her rise to fame. Her soulful voice and poignant lyrics quickly gained attention from audiences across Estonia, and soon she was invited to perform at major festivals and concerts throughout the country.

Her debut album, "Tulev Aasta Tulla" ("Next Year Will Come"), was a critical and commercial success, earning her numerous awards and nominations.

Despite her success, Nathalie remained true to her roots, always seeking out new ways to express herself through music. She continued to perform traditional Estonian songs, as well as original compositions that told stories of love, loss, and resilience. Her music was a testament to the power of tradition and innovation, and Nathalie Põld became an icon of Estonian folk music.

Years later, when asked about her journey, Nathalie would smile and say, "I've been blessed to have had the opportunity to share my music with so many people around the world."
