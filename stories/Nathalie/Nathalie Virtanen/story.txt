Nathalie Virtanen was a woman with a passion for photography and a penchant for the unknown. Born in Helsinki, Finland, she grew up surrounded by the majestic beauty of the Baltic Sea and the Nordic forests. Her love for capturing the world's wonders through her lens began at a young age, and soon she became determined to make a name for herself in the art world.

As Nathalie Virtanen wandered through the streets of Helsinki, camera in hand, she felt an insatiable curiosity about the city's hidden corners. She spent countless hours exploring abandoned buildings, interviewing locals, and snapping photos that told stories of their own.

One fateful night, Nathalie Virtanen received an invitation to join a prestigious photography workshop in Iceland. The opportunity was too good to pass up, and she bid farewell to Helsinki, eager to explore the rugged landscapes of her Nordic neighbor. As she trekked through the snow-capped mountains and black sand beaches, her camera clicked away, capturing the surreal beauty of this land.

During the workshop, Nathalie Virtanen met fellow photographers who shared her passion for storytelling through images.
