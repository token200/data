Hélène Ahmed stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar sights of the small town. It had been years since she'd returned to her hometown in Quebec, but the memories still lingered like the scent of freshly baked bagels from the boulangerie on Rue Saint-Jean.

Hélène had always been a restless soul, with a heart full of adventure and a mind that yearned for more. She'd left home at 18 to pursue her dreams in Paris, where she'd studied art and fallen in love with the city's bohemian vibe. But life had other plans. After a painful breakup and a string of low-paying gigs as a freelance artist, Hélène found herself back on the same train platform, this time with a suitcase full of regrets and a determination to start anew.

As she made her way through the streets, Hélène felt like a ghost haunting her own past. Everyone seemed to know her name, but no one knew what had really brought her back. She'd told them that her grandmother had passed away, leaving her the family's old bakery on Rue Saint-Jean, and they believed it. They didn't ask too many questions, but Hélène could sense their curiosity simmering just beneath the surface.

She slipped into the bakery, its interior unchanged since she was a child. The same wooden spoon rests on the counter, alongside her mother's recipe book, worn from years of use. Hélène took a deep breath, inhaling the sweet scent of bread and the faint tang of yeast. It was like coming home.

As she began to clean and organize the bakery, Hélène felt a sense of purpose creeping back in. She'd always loved baking, but it was more than that now. This place needed her, needed the love and care she'd invested over the years. She started with small tasks – kneading dough, piping icing onto croissants – slowly coaxing the old equipment to life.

Word spread quickly about Hélène's return, and soon the bakery was filled with familiar faces from her past. They came bearing gifts of fresh produce and baked goods, eager to reconnect and see if they'd misjudged this talented but troubled young woman all those years ago. Hélène listened patiently, smiling and laughing as she accepted their goodwill.

One person remained noticeably absent – Matthieu, the boy who had once captured her heart with his artistic flair and kind spirit.
