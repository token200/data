Helene Schafer remained humble despite the attention. She continued to write from the heart, pouring her emotions into every note. Her music was her sanctuary – a place where she could express herself freely, without fear or apology.

When asked about her creative process, Helene would simply smile and say that it all started with a single thought – a fleeting image, a haunting melody, or a poignant lyric. The rest flowed from there, guided by an unseen force that drove her to create something beautiful, something true. And in doing so, she found herself, lost in the midst of music that spoke straight to her very soul.
