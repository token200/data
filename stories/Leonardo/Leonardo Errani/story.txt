I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Leonardo Errani. Could you provide more context or details about this character? 

If you're looking for information on Leonardo da Vinci, I'd be happy to write a short story about him instead.

However, if you'd like me to create a new character named Leonardo Errani and write a 400-word story about them, please let me know and I'll do my best to craft an entertaining tale. 

Here's a story about the fictional character Leonardo Errani:

Leonardo Errani was a master of disguise and deception. As a professional thief, he had honed his skills in the dark alleys and seedy bars of the city. With a quick wit and a charming smile, he could talk his way out of (or into) just about any situation.

One night, Leonardo received a message from an old acquaintance, inviting him to meet at a high-stakes poker game on the other side of town. The stakes were said to be astronomical, and the players would stop at nothing to win.

As he entered the luxurious penthouse suite, Leonardo's eyes scanned the room for any signs of trouble. He spotted his opponent, a suave businessman named Victor, shuffling through his cards with an air of confidence.

Leonardo took his seat at the table, flashing a disarming grin as he was dealt his hand. The game was intense, with each player raising the stakes and pushing the tension to its limit.

As the night wore on, Leonardo began to suspect that something wasn't quite right. Victor seemed too perfect, too calculated, and yet...Leonardo couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to this man than met the eye.

With a sudden burst of inspiration, Leonardo made his move, switching hands with Victor in mid-game. The crowd gasped as the tables turned, and for one electrifying moment, it seemed as though the outcome hung in the balance.

In the end, Leonardo emerged victorious, raking in a fortune that would set him up for life. But as he collected his winnings, he caught a glimpse of Victor's smirk - a look that hinted at a deeper game afoot.

With that, Leonardo Errani slipped away into the night, already planning his next move in this high-stakes world of deception and subterfuge. The master thief was on the hunt for more than just wealth â€“ he was on the hunt for the truth.
