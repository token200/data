He spent hours observing the way light danced through the shadows, the colors of the street performers' costumes, and the intricate patterns on the intricate stone carvings that adorned the buildings. These small observations would later become the building blocks of his art.

As he grew older, Leonardo's passion for art only intensified. He began to study with some of the greatest masters in Paris, learning everything from perspective to color theory. His talent was undeniable, and soon he was making a name for himself on the city's artistic scene.
