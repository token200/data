As a child, Pascal would spend hours practicing in front of the mirror, perfecting his pose and fluidity. His parents, Giovanni and Francesca Mastroianni, encouraged his passion, teaching him how to harness his flexibility and strength. By the time he was 12, Pascal had already begun performing with the family circus, wowing audiences with his death-defying acrobatics.

As Pascal grew older, his talent continued to flourish. He began competing in international competitions, where he would compete against the best contortionists from around the world.
