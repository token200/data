Pascal Thomas stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, his eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of life. As a private investigator, he had seen it all – from high-profile scandals to petty crimes that didn't make headlines. But this one case was different.

A wealthy businessman named Richard Langley had hired him to investigate his daughter's disappearance. The police were stumped, and Langley was on the verge of losing everything. Pascal had agreed to take the case, not out of altruism but because it came with a hefty payday.

As he made his way deeper into the alleyway, Pascal noticed a figure watching him from across the street. He quickened his pace, his instincts telling him that this person was trouble. The figure followed him, keeping a safe distance as Pascal ducked into a nearby bar to gather his thoughts.

Over a whiskey, Pascal pored over the few clues he had managed to uncover so far. Langley's daughter, Emma, had been seen arguing with her boyfriend just days before she vanished. But when Pascal spoke to Emma's friends and family, they all seemed genuinely distraught – no one suspected foul play.

Just as Pascal was about to leave, a hand closed around his wrist. He spun around, ready to take on whoever dared to intervene in his investigation. Instead, he found himself face-to-face with the mysterious figure from earlier.

"You're looking for Emma," the woman said, her voice husky and confident.

Pascal nodded warily. "That's right."

The woman smiled. "I can help you find her."

She handed him a small piece of paper with an address on it. "Meet me there tonight at midnight. Come alone."

Pascal hesitated for a moment before tucking the note into his pocket. This could be the break he needed to crack the case wide open.

As he walked out of the bar, Pascal couldn't shake the feeling that he was being led down a rabbit hole. But one thing was certain – he would follow this lead to its conclusion, no matter where it took him.
