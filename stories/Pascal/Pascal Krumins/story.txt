As he lifted it from its pedestal, a shiver ran down his spine - for in that moment, he felt an unsettling connection to the gemstone. Was it merely the thrill of the challenge or something more?

Krumins' escape was flawless, leaving behind only whispers and speculation about the daring theft. Some claimed he had used a temporary portal, while others whispered about a mysterious accomplice.

As Krumins disappeared into the night, his mind whirled with questions. Had he merely pulled off an incredible feat of thievery or had he tapped into something far more sinister? Whatever the truth may be, one thing was certain - Pascal Krumins would forever remain the master of shadows, leaving behind only a trail of intrigue and mystery in his wake.
