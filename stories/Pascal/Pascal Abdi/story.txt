Pascal Abdi stepped out of the sweltering heat and into the cool, dimly lit alleyway. As a private investigator in Cairo, he had grown accustomed to navigating the city's underbelly. The smell of incense and stale cigarettes hung heavy in the air as he made his way through the winding passageways.

Pascal was known for his sharp mind and quicker wit. A French-Egyptian fusion that served him well in his line of work, but also sometimes left him feeling caught between two worlds. His latest case had been a peculiar one - a wealthy businessman with ties to the government had gone missing, leaving behind only a cryptic message on his phone.

As Pascal made his way through the alleys, he noticed a figure watching him from across the street. A young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair, dressed in a flowing white abaya. She vanished into thin air as quickly as she appeared, leaving Pascal with more questions than answers.

He arrived at the businessman's mansion on the outskirts of town, surrounded by high walls and barbed wire. The only sound was the distant hum of the city, a reminder that even in isolation, one could never truly be alone.

 Inside, the mansion was lavish but starkly bare, devoid of any personal touches or sentimental value. A small safe in the study seemed like an obvious place to start looking for clues. Pascal quickly cracked it open and found a single USB drive inside. He inserted it into his laptop and waited as the contents began to unfold.

A series of grainy videos showed the businessman being taken away from his mansion, bundled into a vehicle with tinted windows, and driven off into the night. A faint voice could be heard whispering in the background - Pascal's trained ear picked up on a familiar dialect, an old dialect used by the rebels he had worked with years ago.

It seemed that the businessman was not who he claimed to be. He was, in fact, a key player in an underground revolution against the government. The green-eyed woman, Pascal deduced, might have been a member of the resistance too.

With this new information, Pascal knew his case had just taken on a life of its own.
