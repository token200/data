One day, Pascal Malinowski received a call from the local police department, asking for his expertise on a particularly puzzling case. A wealthy businessman had been found dead in his mansion, with no signs of forced entry or struggle. The only clue was a small note left at the scene, bearing a cryptic message that seemed to point to an inside job.

Pascal Malinowski arrived at the scene, taking in every detail as he surveyed the area. He noticed a faint scent of lavender wafting through the air, and his mind began to spin with possibilities.

Pascal Malinowski's eyes narrowed as he considered the possibilities. He knew that he was getting close to solving the case, but he needed one more piece of evidence to crack it wide open. And then, like a bolt of lightning on a stormy night, it hit him - a small tattoo on the victim's hand, shaped like a snake eating its own tail.

The connection was clear: a symbol of deceit and betrayal, often used by those who were masters of manipulation. Pascal Malinowski smiled to himself as he realized that the killer had left behind a subtle clue, one that would lead him straight to the door of his true culprit.

With newfound confidence, Pascal Malinowski set out to confront the killer. He walked into the mansion, where he found the man responsible for the murder cowering in fear.
