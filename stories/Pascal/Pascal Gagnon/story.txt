Pascal Gagnon was a man with a mysterious past. He had no memory of his childhood, only fragmented images and whispers that lingered in his mind like smoke on a winter's night. His eyes were an unsettling shade of green, a trait he shared with the few people who claimed to have seen him before.

One fateful evening, Pascal walked into a small, dimly lit café in the heart of Montreal's Latin Quarter. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and old books. As he took a seat at the bar, a woman with piercing blue eyes and raven-black hair turned to face him.

"You're Pascal Gagnon," she said, her voice like a gentle breeze on a summer day.

Pascal nodded, his green eyes locking onto hers.

"How did you know?" he asked, his voice low and husky.

The woman smiled, revealing a hint of mischief in her eyes. "I've been watching you, Pascal. I know your story."

Pascal's mind went blank, his memories slipping further into the void.

"Who are you?" he asked, his curiosity piqued.

"My name is Colette," she replied, taking a seat next to him at the bar. "And I'm here to help you uncover your past."

As the night wore on, Colette regaled Pascal with tales of his childhood: of summers spent playing in the woods, of winters spent huddled by the fireplace, of a family that seemed almost mythical. Pascal's green eyes sparkled as he listened, his memories stirring like embers in a long-dormant fire.

With each passing hour, Pascal felt himself drawn back to the past, as if Colette's words had unlocked a door within him. He began to recall snippets of laughter and tears, of faces both familiar and unknown.

As the night drew to a close, Pascal stood up, his movements fluid and purposeful. "Merci, Colette," he said, his voice gruff with emotion.

Colette smiled, her eyes shining like stars in the dark. "We're just beginning, Pascal. There's still so much to uncover."

As Pascal walked out of the café into the Montreal night, he felt a sense of hope he hadn't felt in years. He knew that with Colette by his side, the mysteries of his past would slowly unravel, revealing secrets hidden for far too long.
