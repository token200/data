Pascal Jansons stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the grey, rain-soaked streets of Copenhagen. A young journalist from Belgium, he had arrived in this charming city to uncover the secrets behind a decades-old mystery that had haunted his family for years.

As he collected his suitcase and slung it over his shoulder, Pascal's thoughts turned to his grandmother, who had spent countless hours regaling him with tales of her time in occupied Denmark during World War II. She had whispered hints about a mysterious figure known only as "The Architect," who was said to have been responsible for the disappearance of several Danish Jews during the war.

Pascal had always been fascinated by the stories, and now, at 25 years old, he felt it was time to delve deeper into the past. He had spent months researching and tracking down leads, finally arriving in Copenhagen with a sense of determination and trepidation.

As he made his way through the city streets, Pascal's eyes scanned the buildings, taking in the ornate facades and quaint cafes that seemed to cling to every corner. It was as if the city itself was hiding secrets, waiting for him to uncover them.

He arrived at a small café on the outskirts of town, where he had arranged to meet his contact – an elderly woman who claimed to have known Pascal's grandmother in the war era. Over steaming cups of coffee, she shared with him fragments of her own story, hints of a complicated web of relationships and loyalties that had played out during those dark years.

As the afternoon drew to a close, Pascal's mind was reeling with questions and theories. He thanked his contact for her trust and set off into the rain-soaked streets once more, this time feeling like he was closer to unraveling the mystery of The Architect.
