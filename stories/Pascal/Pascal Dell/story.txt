Pascal Dell was no stranger to the streets of Paris. As a street artist, he had honed his skills on the city's walls and bridges, leaving behind a trail of vibrant murals that seemed to come alive in the flickering light of the Eiffel Tower.

One fateful evening, Pascal Dell found himself standing before a blank canvas, staring at a freshly painted backdrop.
