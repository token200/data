As a child, Kamil would spend hours watching her mother, a skilled seamstress, weave intricate patterns on her loom. This early fascination with texture and design eventually translated to her art, where she experimented with unconventional materials and techniques. Her paintings were like windows into the world of dreams, transporting viewers to fantastical realms both whimsical and profound.
