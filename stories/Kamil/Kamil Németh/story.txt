Kamil Németh sat alone at his small, cluttered desk, staring blankly at the wall as he tried to come up with something, anything, to say. It had been weeks since the last letter from his estranged sister, and the silence was suffocating him.

As a writer, Kamil was no stranger to isolation, but this felt different. This felt like a personal rejection. He thought back to all the times he'd tried to reach out to her, only to be met with radio silence.

Kamil's eyes wandered around his cramped apartment, taking in the scattered notes and crumpled drafts that lined his shelves. He was working on his latest novel, but the words just wouldn't come. The characters were dull, the plot predictable, and he couldn't shake the feeling that he was writing for someone else's ears rather than his own.

Just as Kamil was about to give up, a faint noise caught his attention - the soft knock of wood against metal from the small workshop in the back room. It was his friend and fellow writer, László.

László poked his head around the doorway, a curious expression on his face. "Hey, Kamil, I brought you some coffee."

Kamil smiled weakly as László set down the steaming cup and took a seat beside him. For a moment, they just sat in silence, sipping their coffee and watching the dust motes dance in the faint sunlight that filtered through the grimy window.

Finally, Kamil spoke up. "I feel like I'm writing for no one," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

László's expression turned thoughtful. "Maybe you're trying to write for your sister."

Kamil raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean?"

"I mean that you've always been the creative type, Kamil. You've got a passion for storytelling that can't be taught or learned. But sometimes, we get caught up in trying to please others rather than following our own hearts."

Kamil thought about this for a moment, his eyes narrowing as he stroked his chin. Maybe László was right.

Just then, the doorbell rang - it was the mailman with yet another letter from Kamil's sister. This time, there was an address scribbled on the envelope that made Kamil's heart skip a beat: Budapest.

Kamil felt a spark of hope ignite within him. Maybe, just maybe, his sister wasn't as lost to him as he'd thought.
