Péter Alsbach sat at his desk, staring blankly at the stacks of files and papers in front of him. As a detective with the Budapest police department, he had seen it all - the good, the bad, and the ugly. But nothing could have prepared him for the case that lay before him.

A young woman named Szofi had gone missing three days ago, leaving behind only a cryptic message on her phone: "They're watching me." Péter's gut told him this was no ordinary disappearance, but he couldn't quite put his finger on what it was about. He spent hours poring over the evidence, talking to Szofi's family and friends, but every lead seemed to end in a dead end.

Just as he was about to give up for the day, Péter received a call from an unknown number. A low, gravelly voice spoke on the other end: "Péter Alsbach, I know you're looking for Szofi. But are you ready for what you might find?"

Péter's instincts told him this was the break he needed. He followed the voice to a run-down apartment building on the outskirts of town, where he found himself face-to-face with a hooded figure.

"I'm here for Szofi," Péter demanded, his hand resting on his gun.

The figure pushed back its hood, revealing a shocking sight: it was Péter's own sister, Edit. "I've been watching you too, Péter," she said, her eyes cold and calculating. "I know all about your little secrets. And I'm here to make sure Szofi never talks."

Péter's world went dark as he pieced together the evidence: Szofi had stumbled upon a web of corruption and deceit that reached the highest echelons of Hungarian society. Péter's own sister, Edit, was at the center of it all.

With shaking hands, Péter pulled out his phone and dialed the numbers to alert the rest of the team. They arrived just in time to see Péter wrestling with his sister on the floor. The truth was finally out: Szofi had been silenced, but not before she gave Péter a crucial piece of evidence that would bring Edit down.

As the police took Edit away in handcuffs, Péter couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over him. Justice may be slow, but it was always worth fighting for. And he knew he'd do whatever it took to ensure that Szofi's memory lived on.
