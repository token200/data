Péter Sepp was a man of few words, but his piercing blue eyes told stories of their own. As a detective with the Budapest Police Department, he had seen it all - from the darkest alleys to the most luxurious mansions. His colleagues often joked that Péter could read between the lines like no one else.

On this particular evening, Péter Sepp was sitting at his desk, sipping a cup of black coffee, and staring out the window. The rain poured down on the city, creating a melancholic melody that seemed to match the rhythm of Péter's thoughts. He was still reeling from the latest case - a high-profile murder that had shaken the entire city.

As he delved deeper into the investigation, Péter Sepp couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. The victim's family seemed too eager to shed light on the suspect, and Péter's gut told him otherwise. He decided to pay another visit to the crime scene, hoping to uncover some hidden clue.

As he walked through the abandoned warehouse where the murder took place, Péter Sepp noticed a small piece of paper caught in the rusty gate. He carefully extracted it, noticing that it had been written with a fountain pen - an antique one, judging by the intricate designs on the nib. The words "Meet me at the old oak" were scribbled in a hasty hand.

Péter Sepp's mind began to spin as he connected the dots. Could this be a lead? He tucked the paper into his pocket and made his way back to his office, determined to unravel the mystery. As he sat down at his desk, he couldn't help but wonder - who was behind this message, and what did they want from him?

Just then, his phone rang, shrill in the silence of the rainy night. "Sepp, we have a new lead," his partner's voice crackled over the line. "A witness came forward with information about the suspect's whereabouts last night."

Péter Sepp's eyes narrowed as he listened intently to the details. The pieces were starting to fall into place, and he knew that this was going to be a case for the books. With renewed determination, he grabbed his coat and stepped out into the rain-soaked streets, ready to take on whatever lay ahead.

As he disappeared into the night, the city seemed to whisper secrets in his ear - secrets that only Péter Sepp could hear.
