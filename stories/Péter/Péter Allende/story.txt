I couldn't find any information on a person named Péter Allende. It is possible that you meant to ask me to write a story about a different character.

However, I can suggest an alternative. Is there a famous Chilean author named Pablo Neruda or Isabel Allende who you would like me to write a story about? 

Alternatively, if you'd like, I could create a fictional character named Péter Allende and craft a story around them. Please let me know!
