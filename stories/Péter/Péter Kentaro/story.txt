Péter Kentaro was known for his unassuming nature and sharp mind. A renowned archaeologist, he had spent years studying the ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean region. His colleagues often underestimated him due to his quiet demeanor, but those who knew Péter Kentaro understood that beneath his reserved exterior lay a fierce intellect.
