Péter Straume stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room with a mixture of curiosity and wariness. As an outsider in this small fishing village, he knew that trust was a luxury few people afforded him.

The barista, a stout woman with a kind face, raised an eyebrow as Péter took a seat at the counter. "What can I get you?" she asked gruffly.

"Black coffee," Péter replied, his voice low and even. "And information."

The barista snorted, wiping down the counter with a dirty rag. "Information's hard to come by around here, friend. What makes you think we've got something for sale?"

Péter smiled wryly, his eyes crinkling at the corners. He'd heard rumors of a group operating in these waters, preying on unsuspecting sailors and fishermen. Straume, a former Norwegian naval officer, had been tracking them for months – but every lead ended in a dead-end.

"I'm willing to listen," he said, taking a seat next to an elderly fisherman sipping on a beer.

The old man eyed Péter warily, but nodded when the barista poured him a shot of aquavit. "My name's Lars," he introduced himself. "I've seen some... strange things out there."

Péter leaned in, his eyes locked onto Lars'. "Tell me what you've seen."

Lars hesitated, glancing around the café as if searching for an eavesdropper. But something about Péter's demeanor put him at ease.

"There are these... ships," he whispered. "They come out of nowhere, always during the night. They're fast, and their crew is... not human."

Péter's grip on his cup tightened, his mind racing with possibilities. He'd encountered some strange occurrences in his research, but this sounded like something from a myth.

The barista slid Péter another cup of coffee, as if sensing his interest was piqued. "Be careful around here," she warned, her voice barely above a whisper.

Péter nodded, tucking a few extra coins under the counter. "I'll take my chances."

As he left the café, he couldn't shake the feeling that Péter Straume had just scratched the surface of something much larger – and far more sinister.
