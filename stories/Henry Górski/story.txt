Henry Górski stepped into his small, cluttered office in downtown Warsaw, shedding his worn leather jacket onto the chair beside him. As he straightened his tie and adjusted his glasses, he let out a weary sigh. The city outside seemed to be alive with energy, but Henry felt like a man running on fumes.

It had been five years since he'd left the Polish secret service, leaving behind a life of covert operations and cryptic briefings. Now, as a freelance journalist, Henry used his unique set of skills to dig up stories that others couldn't or wouldn't touch.

He spent most of his days holed up in this cramped office, sipping lukewarm coffee and typing away on his trusty old laptop. His current project was the story of a lifetime – a tale of corruption and deceit at the heart of Poland's ruling elite.

As he scanned through the notes and recordings he'd gathered over the past few months, Henry's mind began to whir with connections and plot threads. He made a mental note to pay a visit to his old acquaintance, a certain Janek from the service, who owed him a favor or two.

With his notebook and pen at the ready, Henry settled in for another long night of research and reporting. The hours ticked by as he listened to recordings of secret meetings, poured over documents with redacted names, and scribbled down notes on the back of receipts.

Just as the sun began to rise outside, casting a pale glow through the grimy office window, Henry finally hit paydirt. A cryptic phrase in an internal document sparked his curiosity – "The Piotrski File" seemed like more than just a bureaucratic red herring. Henry's fingers flew across the keyboard as he typed out a series of questions and demands for more information.

He knew that getting involved with The Piotrski File could be treacherous, but Henry was no stranger to risks. After all, it had gotten him this far – notoriety as a tenacious journalist, or so they thought. There were those who would stop at nothing to keep their secrets buried, and Henry knew he was playing with fire.

The phone on his desk jolted him back to reality, shrill in the morning silence. "Henry?" A low voice answered from the other end of the line – Janek's gravelly tone seemed reassuring, if slightly guarded. "I've got something for you."

With a thrill of excitement running through his veins, Henry scribbled down more notes and questions, already imagining what this could mean. He hung up the phone, took a deep breath, and let out a gruff laugh to himself. It was going to be one long night indeed – but for Henry Górski, there was no such thing as too much information or a deadline too tight.
