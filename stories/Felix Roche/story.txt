Felix Roche was a man on a mission. A former professional thief, he had spent years honing his skills in the shadows of Paris's underbelly. But after a particularly botched job went sour, leaving him with a price on his head and a wounded back, Felix knew it was time to hang up his lockpicks for good.

Or so he thought.

Years later, Felix found himself at the doorstep of an old flame, Colette, who had somehow managed to reinvent herself as a successful businesswoman. She ushered him into her lavish office, where a gleaming skyscraper overlooked the city's iconic landmarks. The once-mousy Colette now radiated confidence and sophistication.

Felix was taken aback by the transformation. He had expected Colette to be cowering in fear, not a high-powered executive who could effortlessly charm clients out of their shirts. As they reminisced about old times, Felix couldn't help but notice the glint in her eye - she knew his secrets better than anyone.

Colette's proposition was simple: she wanted Felix to do one final job for her. A valuable artifact had surfaced on the black market, and Colette believed it held the key to a revolutionary new technology that could change the course of human history. The catch? It was guarded by an impenetrable fortress in the heart of Moscow.

Felix hesitated, his back still throbbing with memory of their last escapade. But something about Colette's persuasive smile and piercing gaze drew him back in. Together, they hatched a plan that would put their years of partnership to the ultimate test.

As Felix crept through the shadows, lockpick in hand, he felt the old rush coursing through his veins. This was it - one last score, and then he'd walk away with the cash and the memories to boot. He slipped into the fortress undetected, a whispered rumor spreading among its heavily armed guards.

Inside, Felix found himself face-to-face with Colette, who revealed herself to be an unwitting pawn in her own game. The artifact was real, but it came with a deadly price - and only those who possessed the specific DNA marker on their fingers could claim it.

Felix knew he had the mark. He retrieved the artifact, and as they made their escape, Colette smiled enigmatically. "You're not done yet, Felix," she whispered, before turning to disappear into the night.
