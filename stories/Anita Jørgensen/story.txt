Anita JÃ¸rgensen stepped out of her small apartment, gazing up at the grey Copenhagen sky. It was a typical winter morning in Denmark's capital city - drizzly and somber. Yet, Anita felt invigorated by the damp air. She took a deep breath, shouldering her worn leather backpack.

As a freelance journalist, Anita had grown accustomed to living on the fringes of society. Her curious nature led her down rabbit holes of investigation, often uncovering dark secrets hidden beneath the city's polished facade. Her latest obsession was a string of seemingly unrelated disappearances in the city's docklands area.

Anita navigated through narrow alleys and bustling markets, her senses heightened as she sought out leads. The scent of freshly baked Danish pastries wafted from a nearby bakery, enticing her to pause for a moment. But Anita knew that time was money; every minute spent on distraction meant hours of research lost in the digital ether.

As she turned a corner onto the canalside promenade, the sound of laughter and music drifted from a small jazz club tucked away between warehouses. Intrigued, Anita pushed open the door, slipping inside just as a young saxophonist launched into an impassioned solo.

A slender woman with bright pink hair introduced herself as Luna, the club's resident musician. Over whiskey and coffee, Luna shared whispers of the missing dockworkers: each case involved a single, cryptic note left behind at the scene. Anita exchanged numbers with Luna, sensing they might be onto something together.

The rain pattered against the glass ceiling above, illuminating fragments of graffiti scrawled on the walls - a faded banner reading "Rise of the Merrow" caught her eye. In Danish folklore, the Merrow were gentle, mythical creatures said to inhabit coastal waters. Intrigued by this possible thread, Anita tucked away the notion for further research.

Luna handed Anita an intricately drawn map with seemingly random coordinates etched into its surface. "This is where we'll start searching," Luna whispered, her eyes locked on the rain-slicked windows.
