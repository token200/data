Lucilia's heart skipped a beat as she accepted the challenge. Under the watchful gaze of the Emperor and his courtiers, she revealed to Domitianus Augustus the hidden meaning behind the ancient scroll. As the news spread throughout the palace, Lucilia's reputation grew, and soon, she was hailed as a hero.
