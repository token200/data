Anne-Marie Lefevre stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any signs of life. She had arrived in Ravenswood just a few hours ago, eager to escape the city and find solace in the quiet countryside. As a writer, Anne-Marie often found herself drawn to places with rich history and atmospheric landscapes - and Ravenswood promised to deliver.

As she made her way through the station, a gust of wind whipped her long brown hair into a frenzy, and Anne-Marie laughed wryly. She had always been one for dramatic entrances, even if they were just a figure in the crowd.

After checking into her small bed-and-breakfast, Anne-Marie set out to explore the town. The streets were lined with old stone buildings, their facades worn but still holding secrets of years past. She wandered down a narrow alleyway, her footsteps echoing off the walls as she followed the scent of freshly baked bread.

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the town square, Anne-Marie stumbled upon a quaint little caf√©. Inside, a fire crackled in the hearth, and the air was thick with the smell of roasting coffee beans. She took a seat at a small table by the window and ordered a cup of black coffee - just what she needed to warm her chilled bones.

As she sipped her coffee, Anne-Marie watched a group of locals huddle around a wooden table in the corner, their faces animated as they spoke of local legends and myths. She felt a thrill of excitement at the prospect of immersing herself in Ravenswood's folklore - Anne-Marie Lefevre was always up for a good story.

As the evening wore on, Anne-Marie found herself drawn to one particular member of the group - a young woman with piercing green eyes and a mischievous grin. They struck up a conversation about everything from the best local walks to the most haunted sites in town. Before long, the two were laughing together like old friends.

As Anne-Marie made her way back to the B&B that night, she felt a sense of belonging wash over her. Ravenswood was already starting to feel like home - and for once, it didn't just feel like a place to hide. It felt like a place to find herself.
