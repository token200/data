I couldn't find any information on a public figure by the name of Anne-Marie Ozoliņš. If you would like to create a fictional character and write a story around them, I'd be happy to help.

However, if you provide more context or clarify who Anne-Marie Ozoliņš is (e.g., a historical figure, an athlete, etc.), I can try to craft a story for you.

Assuming Anne-Marie Ozoliņš is not a well-known public figure, here's a fictional character profile and a 400-word short story:

**Anne-Marie Ozoliņš:**

* Age: 25
* Occupation: Environmental Activist
* Nationality: Latvian
* Background: Born and raised in Riga, Latvia, Anne-Marie grew up surrounded by the beauty of nature. She developed a passion for environmental conservation at a young age and now dedicates her life to protecting the planet.

**Story:**

Anne-Marie Ozoliņš stood at the edge of the lake, her eyes scanning the horizon as the sun dipped below the trees. As an environmental activist, she had dedicated her life to fighting against pollution and climate change. Her latest project aimed to clean up the polluted lakes in Latvia and restore the ecosystem.

She thought back to her childhood days spent exploring the forests and rivers near Riga with her grandparents. They would collect leaves and stones, teaching her about the importance of conservation. Anne-Marie's passion for environmental protection only grew stronger as she grew older.

As she began her project, Anne-Marie encountered resistance from local authorities who prioritized economic development over environmental concerns. Undeterred, she organized rallies, petitions, and educational workshops to raise awareness among the community.

The day finally arrived when the project was ready to launch. Anne-Marie's team had spent months collecting trash and debris from the lake. With a deep breath, she pushed off from the shore and began to kayak towards the polluted area.

As she paddled, the sight of the once-pristine lake now filled with plastic waste broke her heart. But it also fueled her determination to create change. Anne-Marie vowed to continue fighting for the environment, inspired by her grandparents' love for nature and their teachings that "the earth is our home, not ours to own."

With renewed resolve, she steered the kayak towards the shore, ready to take on the next challenge in her quest to protect Latvia's natural wonders.
