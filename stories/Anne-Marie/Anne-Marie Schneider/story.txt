As she grew older, her passion for journalism only intensified, driving her to study politics and sociology at the prestigious Frei Universität Berlin.

After completing her studies, Anne-Marie landed a job as a junior reporter at the esteemed Berliner Zeitung.

One fateful night, while investigating a tip about police brutality in the city's marginalized districts, Anne-Marie received a chilling warning from an anonymous source: "Leave this story alone, or face consequences." Undaunted, she pressed on, eventually publishing her exposé and igniting a wave of protests across Berlin. The government was forced to respond, implementing long-overdue reforms.
