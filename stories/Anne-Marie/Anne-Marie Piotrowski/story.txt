One evening, as Anne-Marie was setting up for the night's photo shoot, she received an unexpected visit from the town mayor. He asked if he could feature one of her photos in the upcoming town calendar. Overwhelmed with excitement, Anne-Marie agreed, and soon found herself featured on the cover of the calendar, looking radiant and confident.

Anne-Marie Piotrowski's photography skills had taken her by surprise, but she was thrilled to have discovered a new talent that brought her joy. As she continued to capture the beauty of Willow Creek through her lens, Anne-Marie knew that she had found her true calling.
