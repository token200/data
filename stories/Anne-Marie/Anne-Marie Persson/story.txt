Anne-Marie Persson had always been a free spirit, never one to conform to societal norms or expectations. Growing up in a small town surrounded by rolling hills and farmland, she found solace in nature and the freedom it afforded her.

As a child, Anne-Marie would spend hours exploring the woods behind her house, collecting leaves and watching the wildlife that inhabited the area. Her parents, though sometimes worried about her recklessness, encouraged her curiosity, recognizing the joy it brought her.

As she grew older, Anne-Marie's love for nature only deepened. She pursued a degree in environmental science, determined to make a positive impact on the world around her.
