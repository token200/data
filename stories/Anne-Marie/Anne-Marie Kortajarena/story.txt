I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Anne-Marie Kortajarena. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created for a specific story.

However, I did find information on an Estonian fashion model and singer named Anneli Jannetta, but also a French singer, songwriter, and record producer whose name has been given as Anne Marie, I couldn't verify her full name.

I will write a story about the fictional character Anne-Marie Kortajarena, let me know if you want any changes:
