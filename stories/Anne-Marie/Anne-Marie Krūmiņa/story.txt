I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Anne-Marie Krūmiņa. It is possible that this character is not well-known or was created recently.

However, I can create a story about a character with a similar name. Here's a 375-word story about Anne-Marie Krūmiņa:

Anne-Marie Krūmiņa was a talented Latvian artist who had always been fascinated by the intersection of nature and technology. Growing up in Riga, she spent hours exploring the city's parks and forests, collecting leaves and observing the way light filtered through the trees.

As she grew older, Anne-Marie's interest in art only deepened. She studied sculpture at the Latvian Academy of Art, where she honed her skills in clay and stone. But it was during her junior year that she stumbled upon a new passion: electronics.

Anne-Marie had always been intrigued by the way technology could be used to create intricate patterns and designs. One day, while experimenting with Arduino boards, she created a series of stunning sculptures that combined natural forms with electronic components. The results were breathtaking – delicate petals made from copper wire, intricate leaves that shimmered like diamonds.

Word of Anne-Marie's talent spread quickly, and soon her work was being exhibited in galleries across Europe. Critics raved about her unique style, which seemed to capture the essence of both nature and technology. As she stood on stage, accepting an award for her latest installation, Anne-Marie felt a sense of pride and accomplishment.

Despite her growing success, Anne-Marie remained true to her artistic vision. She continued to push the boundaries of what was possible with electronics and natural materials, creating pieces that were both beautiful and thought-provoking. And as she looked out at the audience, she knew that she had found her place in the world – where art, technology, and nature converged.

Years later, Anne-Marie Krūmiņa's work would be remembered as a landmark of modern Latvian art, a testament to the power of creativity and innovation. And though she continued to evolve and experiment, one thing remained constant: her passion for the intricate dance between nature and technology.
