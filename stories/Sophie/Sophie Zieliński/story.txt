Sophie Zieliński stared out at the foggy streets of Paris, her eyes tracing the curves of the Seine. As she stood there, lost in thought, she felt a tap on her shoulder.

"Bonjour, Mademoiselle Zieliński," said her friend, Colette, with a bright smile. "I brought you coffee."

Sophie turned to take the cup from Colette's hands, but her mind was still elsewhere. She had just received an invitation to exhibit her paintings in a prestigious gallery in Warsaw - back home.

As an expat living in Paris for nearly five years, Sophie had always tried to blend into the crowd. But now, with her talent finally being recognized by the art world, she couldn't help but wonder what others were thinking about her.

"Colette," she said, handing Colette a small package from her bag, "I have something to show you."

Inside the package was a photograph of Sophie as a child, sitting in front of an easel in her family's living room. She must have been no more than six or seven years old. The faded Polaroid showed a girl with big brown eyes and curly black hair, holding a paintbrush.

Colette gasped as she took the photo from Sophie. "That was taken before you left Poland?" she asked.

Sophie nodded, feeling a lump form in her throat. This photograph had been given to her by her mother when she moved away - a reminder of where she came from and why she started painting in the first place.

As they walked along the Seine, Colette asked Sophie about the exhibition invitation. "Will you really come back to Warsaw for it?" she asked, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.

Sophie hesitated before answering. She had thought that leaving Poland was the right decision, a way to escape the expectations of others and forge her own path in life. But now, as she gazed out at the city where she once called home, she wasn't so sure.

For the first time, Sophie realized that home wasn't just a place - it was also the people you loved, the memories you held dear, and the stories you told yourself to stay true. As the fog began to lift, Sophie knew that she would have to make a choice between Paris and Warsaw, between her past and her present.

But for now, she smiled at Colette and took another sip of coffee. "Maybe," she said, "I'll take them both."
