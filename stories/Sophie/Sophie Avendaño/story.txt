After completing her degree in journalism, Sophie began her career at a local newspaper, where she quickly made a name for herself as a talented and tenacious reporter.

Back at her desk, Sophie spent hours pouring over her notes, searching for the perfect angle to take her story to the next level. As she worked, her thoughts turned to her abuela, who had always encouraged her to follow her dreams. "La vida es un viaje, m'ija," Abuela used to say – life is a journey, my daughter.
