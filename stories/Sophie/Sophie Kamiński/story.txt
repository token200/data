Sophie Kamiński stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any signs of life. She had been traveling for hours, and the solitude was starting to get to her. As she made her way through the empty carriages, a faint hum caught her attention - the sound of an old typewriter clacking away in a nearby café.

Sophie's curiosity got the better of her, and she pushed open the door to reveal a cozy space filled with dusty books and flickering candles. A young woman with a wild mane of curly hair looked up from behind the counter, a look of surprise on her face.

"Can I help you?" she asked, wiping her hands on a worn apron.

Sophie smiled wryly. "I'm looking for someone," she said, taking a seat at the small table by the window. "A writer named Olivia Wells. I was told she might be here."

The woman's expression changed from curiosity to recognition, and she nodded. "That's me," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Sophie's eyes widened as she watched Olivia type away, the words flowing effortlessly onto the page. As she approached the table, Olivia looked up, her eyes locking onto Sophie's with an intensity that made her feel like she was being seen for the first time in years.

"Who are you?" Olivia asked, her voice still low and husky from typing.

Sophie smiled, feeling a sense of relief wash over her. "I'm Sophie Kamiński," she said, taking a seat across from Olivia. "And I think we need to talk."

The two women sat in silence for a moment, the only sound the creaking of the old typewriter and the distant hum of the station. Then, without warning, Olivia spoke up.

"I've been waiting for you, Sophie Kamiński," she said, her eyes shining with a deep understanding. "I think we have something to discuss."
