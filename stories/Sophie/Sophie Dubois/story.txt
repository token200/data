Sophie Dubois stepped into the bustling café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee, and made her way over to join him.

"Hey, Sophie," he said with a smile as she sat down across from him.

"Sophie Dubois," she corrected, "but you can call me Sophie."

He chuckled and shook his head. "I know, I know. You always correct people on your full name."

Sophie raised an eyebrow, a hint of amusement playing on her lips. "Hey, someone's got to keep it straight."

The two friends chatted for a bit, catching up on each other's lives, before Sophie decided to take matters into her own hands.

"I've been thinking," she said, her eyes sparkling with excitement. "We need to plan a trip together. Somewhere exciting, just the two of us."

Her friend's face lit up, and he eagerly agreed to join her on whatever adventure she had in mind.

As they brainstormed ideas, Sophie couldn't help but think back to when they first met in college. She was this shy, reserved girl who never thought she'd be friends with someone as outgoing and charismatic as him. But over the years, they'd grown closer and closer, bonding over their shared love of music, art, and adventure.

"Where should we go?" he asked, his voice full of enthusiasm.

Sophie grinned mischievously. "I was thinking of something a little exotic. Somewhere with beautiful beaches and crystal-clear waters."

He nodded enthusiastically, already imagining the possibilities. "I'm in. When do we leave?"

As they continued to plan their trip, Sophie couldn't help but feel grateful for her friend's unwavering support and enthusiasm. It was moments like these that reminded her why she loved traveling with him – it was never just about the destination; it was about sharing those experiences with someone who truly understood her.

With a smile, Sophie leaned in to hug her friend tightly. "Thanks for being you, Sophie Dubois."

He laughed and hugged her back, his eyes shining with affection. "Anytime, Soph."
