Arend Mägi, also known as the "Ghost of Tartu," was a legendary figure in Estonian folklore. He was said to be a master of magic and deception, feared by the townspeople for his cunning and supernatural abilities.

The story went that Arend had been a humble blacksmith in the town of Tartu, but after a freak accident involving a magical hammer and a bolt of lightning, he became cursed with extraordinary powers. Now, whenever the moon was full, Arend would rise from his grave, using his magic to play tricks on the townspeople.

At first, people were terrified of Arend's antics. He would hide their belongings, make them see and hear things that weren't there, and even cause objects to move on their own. But as time went by, they began to realize that Arend was not a malevolent spirit – he was simply trying to get attention.

One brave soul, a young woman named Maria, decided to take it upon herself to communicate with Arend. She would often leave out food and drink for him in the old graveyard where he lay buried, and she'd spend hours talking to him about her life.

To her surprise, Arend began to reveal his true nature – that of a lonely soul who had been unfairly judged by the townspeople. He told Maria that he was once a kind and gentle person, but his newfound powers had made him outcast. As they talked, Maria discovered that Arend's magic was not about scaring people, but about showing them the truth.

As the years went by, the town of Tartu began to see Arend in a new light. They realized that he wasn't a monster, but a misunderstood figure who just wanted connection and understanding. And so, whenever the moon was full, Maria would join him in the graveyard, where they'd sit together, sharing stories and laughter.

Arend's legend grew, not as a ghostly figure, but as a symbol of acceptance and empathy. The townspeople learned to look beyond their fears and see the world through Arend's eyes – that everyone has a story worth telling, even if it's one of loneliness and longing.

As Maria would often say, "Arend may be the Ghost of Tartu, but he's also our ghostly reminder that we're all more than just our stories. We're all deserving of love, understanding, and connection."
