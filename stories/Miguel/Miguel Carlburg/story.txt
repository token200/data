Miguel Carlburg was known for his peculiar habit of collecting antique door knobs. His friends and family often found it perplexing, but he couldn't help himself – there was something about the intricate designs and subtle craftsmanship that captivated him.

As a child, Miguel had spent hours rummaging through his grandfather's attic, searching for interesting trinkets to add to his collection. Over time, his fascination with door knobs only grew stronger. He began to appreciate the way they told stories of their past owners – the homes they once adorned, the doors they opened and closed.

One day, while on a solo trip to Paris, Miguel stumbled upon an antique shop tucked away in the Latin Quarter. The sign above the door read "Curiosités Anciennes," and it was as if he had finally found his holy grail. Inside, rows of shelves were stacked with peculiar treasures – vintage postcards, taxidermied animals, and, of course, door knobs.

Miguel spent hours browsing the shop, his fingers trailing over the intricate designs on each knob. The owner, an elderly man with a bushy mustache, noticed Miguel's fascination and approached him. "Ah, you have an eye for the finer things, young man," he said. "I see you're admiring my collection of French door knobs."

Miguel Carlburg was taken aback by the old man's perceptiveness. He explained his love of collecting door knobs to the proprietor, who smiled knowingly. As they chatted, Miguel discovered that the shop was owned by a collector himself – one who had spent decades accumulating an impressive array of door knobs from around the world.

Over the next few days, Miguel became fast friends with the proprietor, learning about the history behind each and every door knob in his collection. It was a truly enriching experience, one that solidified Miguel Carlburg's passion for collecting these often-overlooked artifacts. As he prepared to leave Paris, he knew that his collection would never be complete – but with new treasures to discover, he couldn't wait to begin the next chapter of his journey.
