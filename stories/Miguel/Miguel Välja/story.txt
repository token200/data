Miguel Välja was a man shrouded in mystery. His past was a closely guarded secret, known only to a select few. Fewer still knew his true nature – that he was an immortal being, cursed with the weight of centuries.

He stood out in a crowd like a dark thread in a tapestry, drawing attention without intending to. Miguel's features were chiseled and strong, with piercing green eyes that seemed to see right through you. His jet-black hair was flecked with streaks of silver, hinting at the years that had passed him by.

He roamed the world like a ghost, observing humanity from afar. He watched as civilizations rose and fell, as empires expanded and contracted. Through it all, Miguel remained, an unchanging constant in an ever-changing world.

Despite his detached demeanor, Miguel was not immune to emotion. He felt the sting of sorrow and the ache of loneliness, but these feelings were tempered by a deep-seated detachment. He had lost everything he had ever loved, and yet he continued on, driven by some unseen force.

One night, as he walked through the city streets, Miguel caught sight of her – a young woman with piercing blue eyes and long, curly brown hair. There was something about her that drew him in, something that made him feel alive for the first time in centuries.

Miguel watched her from afar, learning everything he could about her. He discovered that she was an artist, a painter who saw beauty in the world where others saw only ugliness. And as he observed her, Miguel felt a spark ignite within him – a sense of connection, of belonging, that he had not felt in centuries.

For the first time in his long and troubled existence, Miguel Välja felt like he was home. He knew that this feeling would be fleeting, that the weight of his immortality would soon reassert itself. But for now, as he stood there watching her paint, he allowed himself to feel alive.
