Miguel Charron stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of saltwater and seaweed enveloping him like a warm hug. He had been away for months, chasing his dreams and trying to shake the ghosts of his past.

As he made his way through the station, he caught sight of her - Maria, his childhood sweetheart who had long since moved on with her life. Her bright smile faltered as she saw Miguel standing there, and for a moment, they just stared at each other.

Miguel took a deep breath and let himself be seen by her again. He hadn't intended to run from the memories of their time together, but after the painful breakup, he had needed space. Now, he was back in the small coastal town where his family had lived for generations, and he knew he couldn't avoid Maria forever.

The two of them walked side by side through the quiet streets, catching up on old stories and sharing new ones. Miguel confided in her about his struggles to find work as a journalist, feeling like an imposter in his own life. Maria listened attentively, offering words of encouragement that reminded him why he had started writing in the first place.

As they walked towards the beach, Miguel couldn't help but notice how much the town had changed - and yet, some things remained the same. The way the sunlight danced across the waves, the sound of seagulls crying overhead. It was all still so beautiful, so full of life.

The wind carried the sweet scent of blooming flowers as they walked along the shoreline. Maria stopped suddenly, staring out at the vast expanse of water. Miguel followed her gaze, feeling a pang of nostalgia wash over him.

For a moment, he thought he saw the ghosts of their past hovering just beyond the horizon - but then, it was gone. The waves rolled in, and the world came back into focus. Maria turned to him, a gentle smile on her face.

"You're home now," she said softly. "It's okay."

Miguel nodded, feeling a weight lift off his shoulders. Maybe, just maybe, he had finally found what he was looking for - not a place to escape, but a life that felt like its own.
