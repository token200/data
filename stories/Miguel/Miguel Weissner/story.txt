Miguel Weissner sat at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of papers in front of him. As the CEO of Atlas Innovations, he was expected to be one step ahead of the competition at all times. But right now, he just felt lost.

He took a deep breath and let his eyes wander around the sleek, modern office. The city skyline outside the window seemed to mock him, its peaks piercing the sky like shards of glass. He had always been driven by a desire to succeed, to prove himself as one of the greatest minds in technology.

But over the past few months, he'd begun to question whether it was all worth it. Long hours, high stakes, and constant pressure from investors had taken its toll on his personal life. His wife, Rachel, had left him six months ago, citing "too much stress" as her reason for departure. Miguel knew that was just a polite way of saying he'd lost himself in the process of building Atlas.

Just then, his assistant, Sofia, poked her head into the room. "Miguel, I have an update on our latest project," she said, trying to sound enthusiastic despite her obvious concern for her boss's well-being.

"Put it off until tomorrow," Miguel said gruffly, not bothering to look up from the stack of papers. Sofia hesitated before backing out of the room, closing the door behind her.

The silence was oppressive, but eventually, Miguel couldn't stand it any longer. He stood up and began pacing around his office, trying to shake off the feeling of despair that had settled over him like a shroud. Where had he gone wrong? He'd always prided himself on being a visionary, a problem-solver.

As he walked, his thoughts drifted back to Rachel. He remembered how she used to smile at him when they talked about their shared dreams for Atlas. Now, the mere mention of the company made her eyes roll in frustration.

Miguel's feet led him to the floor-to-ceiling windows, where the city lights shone like stars in the night sky. Something clicked inside him as he gazed out at the city, its frenetic energy mirroring his own thoughts. Maybe it was time to redefine what success meant to him.

"Get me Rachel on the phone," he said firmly to himself, a new resolve dawning within him. It was time to take back control of his life and rebuild Atlas on his own terms, rather than at the cost of everything that truly mattered.
