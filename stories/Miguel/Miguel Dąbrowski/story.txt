I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Miguel Dąbrowski. It's possible that you may be thinking of a different person or character.

However, I can suggest some notable historical figures with the surname Dąbrowski. 

One example is Maksymilian; however, I couldn't verify if he was a character in any story.
