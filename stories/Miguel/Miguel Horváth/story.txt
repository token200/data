Miguel Horváth stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of his connection. As a freelance journalist, he had grown accustomed to being on his own, but sometimes it was nice to have someone to meet. He pulled out his phone and checked the text from his source: "Meet me at Café Central, 3 pm."

Miguel Horváth made his way through the crowded station, weaving past tourists and commuters. He had been working on a story about corruption in the local government for weeks, and he was convinced that this meeting would lead to the break he needed.

As he walked into Café Central, he spotted his source sitting at a small table by the window. She caught his eye and nodded, beckoning him over. Miguel Horváth slid into the seat across from her, his notebook and pen at the ready.

"So, what do you have for me?" he asked, taking a sip of his coffee.

His source leaned in, lowering her voice. "I've got evidence of embezzlement on a massive scale," she whispered. "It starts with the mayor's office and goes all the way up to city council."

Miguel Horváth's eyes widened as he scribbled furious notes in his notebook. This was exactly what he needed to make his story stick. He asked a few more questions, trying to get every detail just right.

As they talked, Miguel Horváth couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. He had been chasing this story for months, and it finally felt like he was getting close to the truth. He thanked his source profusely and made plans to follow up with her in a few days.

As he left Café Central, Miguel Horváth felt a sense of excitement building inside him. He knew that this story would be big, and he couldn't wait to share it with the world. He pulled out his phone and dialed his editor's number, ready to share the news.

"Yes?" a voice answered on the other end of the line.

"It's Miguel Horváth," he said, barely containing his enthusiasm. "I've got a break in my corruption story, and I think it's going to be huge."

There was a pause on the other end of the line before his editor spoke up. "Tell me more."
