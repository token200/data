Miguel Kalejs stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of life. He had been traveling for days, ever since he'd received a cryptic message from an old acquaintance that read: "Meet me in Ravenswood. Come alone." Miguel's gut told him this was no ordinary reunion.

As he made his way through the crowds, a shiver ran down his spine. Who could have sent him such a mysterious summons? And what did they want with him? He'd always been one to trust his instincts, and right now, that nagging voice was screaming warning bells.

Ravenswood was a place Miguel had never set foot in before. A small town nestled deep in the heart of nowhere, shrouded in mystery and rumor. It was the kind of place where everyone knew each other's names, but no one spoke of outsiders with a warm welcome.

Miguel hailed a taxi and gave the driver an address that seemed to come from nowhere â€“ a decrepit mansion on the outskirts of town, rumored to be abandoned for decades. As the taxi wound its way through deserted streets, Miguel felt a sense of unease growing inside him. What had he gotten himself into?

Finally, they arrived at the mansion's crumbling facade. The driver hesitated before turning off the engine, leaving Miguel to face whatever lay ahead alone. Stepping out onto the cracked driveway, Miguel Kalejs took a deep breath and began to walk toward the door.

The trees seemed to lean in, as if listening to his every step. Every sound echoed through the stillness like a death knell. With an air of resignation, Miguel pushed open the creaking front door and stepped into the unknown, leaving behind the only life he'd ever known. Only time would tell if this move would be a step forward or one too far back...
