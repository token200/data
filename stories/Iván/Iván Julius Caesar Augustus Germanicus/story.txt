In the scorching summer of 12 BCE, the mighty Roman Empire was abuzz with the arrival of a young prince. Iván Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, the son of Germanicus, the famous legate who had earned the adoration of Rome for his unwavering bravery in battle, had finally set foot on sacred soil.

As he grew up under the watchful eyes of his guardians, Iván demonstrated an unyielding passion for justice, driven by the unshakeable conviction that every citizen had the right to freedom and equality.

Upon reaching adulthood, Iván's curiosity led him to immerse himself in the intricate world of Roman politics. He attended symposia with fellow senators, engaged in heated debates about governance, and sought guidance from wise mentors who shaped his vision for a new Rome.

As news of Germanicus' untimely death spread, Iván was catapulted into the center of attention. Some saw him as an heir to his illustrious uncle's legacy, while others viewed him as a mere pawn in a game of imperial politics.
