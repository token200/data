Iván Akiko stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the desolate landscape. It was as if time had stood still in this small town, where everyone knew each other's names and stories. He had come to visit his cousin, Sofia, who had recently lost her husband.

As he made his way through the dusty streets, Iván couldn't help but think of his own life back in the city. A successful businessman with a comfortable life, he had left it all behind for this small town in search of a simpler existence. His family thought he was crazy, that he was running away from his problems.

But Iván knew the truth. He was tired of the noise, the stress, and the constant pressure to succeed. Out here, where the air was fresh and the sun shone bright, he could finally breathe again.

He arrived at Sofia's small cottage on the outskirts of town, the thatched roof a deep brown in the fading light. Sofia greeted him with tears in her eyes, embracing him tightly as if she'd lost an arm. Iván hugged her back, trying to comfort her.

As they sat by the fire, sipping tea and watching the stars come out, Iván told Sofia about his decision to leave it all behind. She listened intently, her eyes wide with a mix of sadness and envy. "Why would you do that, Iván?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Iván took a deep breath, trying to put into words the sense of emptiness he'd felt for so long. "I was lost in my own world," he said finally. "I forgot what it means to truly live."

Sofia nodded, understanding etched on her face. "You're not alone, Iván," she said softly. "We all get lost sometimes. But we can find our way back."

Over the next few days, Iván settled into his new life in the small town. He helped Sofia with her garden, taught her how to fix a broken fence, and even joined the local community group for breakfast every morning.

As he looked around at the familiar faces, smiling and laughing together, Iván knew that he had made the right decision. For the first time in his life, he felt truly alive.
