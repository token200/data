Iván Salemi was a man with an extraordinary gift – the ability to hear the stories of inanimate objects. It started when he was a child, listening to his grandmother's tales of old family heirlooms and furniture. She'd whisper secrets into his ear, telling him about the love and laughter that had once filled their rooms.

As Iván grew older, his gift intensified. He could hear the whispers of antique door handles, the sighs of vintage sofas, and even the soft hum of ancient clocks. The objects would tell him about their lives, from the hands that had held them to the feet that had walked on them.

Iván's friends and family found it strange, but he didn't mind. He loved listening to the stories, often spending hours in museums and antique shops, running his fingers over intricate carvings and polishing the surfaces until they shone like mirrors.

One day, Iván stumbled upon a small, dusty shop tucked away in a forgotten alley. The sign above the door read "Curios and Antiques." As he pushed open the creaky door, a bell above it rang out, and the whispers began. A faded velvet armchair spoke of late-night conversations with literary giants; an old pocket watch complained about being lost for decades.

The shop owner, an elderly man with wispy white hair and spectacles perched on the end of his nose, watched Iván intently. He nodded as if acknowledging a long-forgotten truth.

"You're one of us," he said, offering Iván a delicate glass vial filled with a shimmering liquid. "The essence of old stories, distilled into this."

Iván took the vial and unscrewed the lid, releasing the fragrance into the air. The whispers grew louder, swirling around him like a living entity.

In that moment, Iván knew his journey had just begun. He would collect more stories, learn more secrets, and share them with the world. As he left the shop, vial in hand, the city's silence began to feel less oppressive, filled as it was with the whispers of countless tales waiting to be told.

The owner, with a knowing smile, whispered one final secret into Iván's ear: "Their stories are yours now. Share them well."
