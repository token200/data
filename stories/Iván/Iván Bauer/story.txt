Iván Bauer stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the familiar station in Budapest. It had been five years since he'd last set foot in this city, and yet the memories came flooding back. As a young man, Iván had grown up on these streets, learning to navigate the complexities of Eastern European politics from his father, a former communist activist.

But that life was behind him now. Iván had abandoned his radical views and forged a new path as a journalist, using his skills to expose corruption and bring truth to those who needed it most. His latest investigation had brought him back to Budapest, where he'd uncovered a web of deceit that threatened to upend the city's very fabric.

As he made his way through the station, Iván was struck by the sense of unease in the air. People hurried past him, casting nervous glances over their shoulders. He knew this feeling all too well – it was the same one he'd felt during his father's activism days, when the government's agents were always watching.

Iván ducked into a nearby café and ordered a strong coffee. As he waited for his drink to arrive, he pulled out his notebook and began to scribble down notes on his findings. The more he delved into the case, the more convinced he became that he was onto something big.

Just as he was about to leave, Iván spotted a familiar face across the room – his old friend, Márton. They'd grown up together, sharing stories and dreams of a better world. But after Iván's father was arrested for his activism, their paths had diverged. Márton had gone on to become a successful businessman, while Iván had pursued his journalism career.

Now, as they locked eyes across the room, it was clear that Márton was hiding something. His usual warmth and smile seemed forced, and his eyes darted nervously around the café. "Iván," he said quietly, before turning to leave.

Iván's instincts told him that this was more than just a coincidence. He quickly jotted down Márton's location in his notebook, determined to uncover what secrets his friend might be hiding. This case was about to get a whole lot more complicated – and Iván was ready for whatever came next.
