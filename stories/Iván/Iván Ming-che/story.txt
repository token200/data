Iván Ming-che was known throughout the small town of Tienmu as a master weaver and storyteller. Her full name, which meant "Black Beauty" in Mandarin, suited her perfectly – with her dark hair and piercing green eyes that seemed to sparkle like emeralds in the sunlight.

As a child, Iván would sit for hours at her loom, weaving tales into every thread. She wove stories of ancient legends, myths, and folklores that had been passed down through generations of Taiwanese women in her family. Her full name echoed with pride as she shared these stories with anyone who would listen – strangers, travelers, and even the occasional lost child.

One day, a young boy named Kuan arrived in Tienmu, searching for his missing father. He had heard rumors of a wise and mysterious weaver who lived on the outskirts of town, one who possessed ancient knowledge that could guide him on his quest. Iván Ming-che was rumored to possess this knowledge, and so the young boy made his way to her humble abode.

Iván welcomed Kuan with open arms, offering him tea and a place by the fire. As she listened to the boy's tale of loss and longing, her eyes seemed to hold a deep understanding that sent shivers down Kuan's spine. She nodded sympathetically, her dark hair rustling in the gentle breeze.

"My son," Iván said softly, "the path ahead will be fraught with challenges, but I will share my knowledge with you, as is the tradition of our ancestors. Come, let me show you the threads of fate that weave together to guide us." And so, Kuan spent many moons learning from Iván Ming-che – unraveling the mysteries of the universe and finding the answers he sought.

Years went by, and Kuan grew into a strong and wise young man, thanks in part to Iván's guidance. He never forgot the lessons she taught him and the stories she wove for him at her loom. Whenever he looked up at the night sky, he remembered the words of his mentor: "The threads of fate are woven with every choice we make, Iván Ming-che."

As the seasons passed, Tienmu's residents would catch glimpses of Iván weaving by moonlight – a fleeting shadow of dark hair against the pale silvery light.
