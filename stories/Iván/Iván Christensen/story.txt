Iván Christensen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. It was as if he'd been here before, yet the familiarity felt like a distant memory. He pulled out his wallet and handed over the few coins he had to pay for the ticket, wincing slightly at the sound of the change.

A chill ran down Iván's spine as he stepped out into the crisp evening air. It was autumn in Copenhagen, and the city seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for something to stir. He lit a cigarette, the flame casting an eerie glow on his pale face.

Iván had always been drawn to this place – the melancholy of it all resonated with him like a siren's call. It was as if he could feel the weight of the city's history bearing down upon him, the ghosts of past lives whispering secrets in his ear.

He wandered through the streets, taking in the familiar sights and sounds: the bicycle messengers zipping past, their lights flashing like fireflies; the jazz club on Strøget, its smoke spilling out into the night air like a defiant prayer. Iván felt at home among these shadows, this city's strange beauty seeping into his very pores.

But tonight was different. Tonight, he sensed a presence lurking just beyond the edge of perception, watching him with cold, calculating eyes. Iván spun around, scanning the crowds for any sign of movement – and that's when he saw her: a woman in red, standing by the canal like a statue come to life.

Their gazes locked, and Iván felt the air thicken around them, as if time itself had slowed down. He knew then that his journey was far from over – this was just the beginning of an adventure through Copenhagen's winding streets, where secrets waited around every corner, and danger lurked in every shadow.

With a final drag on his cigarette, Iván nodded at the woman in red, and turned away, disappearing into the night like a ghost. The city swallowed him whole, its mysteries intact, waiting for the next unsuspecting soul to stumble upon its doorstep.
