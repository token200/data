Iván Thomas stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. As he waited in line, he couldn't help but think about the proposal he had been considering for months. His friend, Alex, had convinced him to take a chance and move to Paris for work.

As Iván ordered his coffee, he spotted a figure sitting at a small table by the window. It was Rachel, his ex-girlfriend from college. They had parted ways amicably, but their friendship remained strong. Iván made his way over to her, feeling a mix of emotions as they exchanged warm smiles.

"Long time no see," Rachel said, as Iván sat down across from her.

"I know, it feels like ages," Iván replied, taking a sip of his coffee.

Rachel leaned in, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. "So, what brings you to Paris? I heard rumors about your job at the art gallery."

Iván nodded, feeling a sense of pride wash over him. "Yes, I'm going to be the curator for an upcoming exhibition. It's a dream come true."

Rachel whistled in approval. "Congratulations, Iván Thomas! You've always had a passion for art. I have no doubt you'll excel in this role."

As they chatted, Iván couldn't help but feel grateful for Rachel's unwavering support. Despite their breakup, she remained one of his closest friends.

The conversation flowed easily, and before he knew it, the café was closing down. As they parted ways, Iván felt a sense of excitement about the new chapter in his life. He knew that this move would bring both challenges and opportunities, but with Rachel's encouragement and Alex's support, he was ready to take on Paris head-on.

As Iván walked out into the chilly evening air, he couldn't help but smile at the thought of the adventures awaiting him. Little did he know, this was just the beginning of an incredible journey that would test his limits and push him to grow as a person.
