Iván Petrovich stepped out into the crisp morning air, his eyes scanning the Moscow streets. As a retired detective, he had seen it all – the darkness and the light, the desperation and the triumph. But nothing seemed to have changed him. He still wore the same rugged face, the same weary gaze.

Iván had spent decades solving crimes, uncovering secrets, and bringing justice to those who thought they could escape punishment. His most famous case was the "Red Chamber" affair – a series of high-stakes heists that had shaken the very foundations of Russia's elite. Iván had cracked the case, following a trail of clues and dead ends that had led him from the streets of Moscow to the corridors of power.

But now, at 62, Iván was content to leave the world of detective work behind. He ran a small antique shop on Pokrovsky Boulevard, surrounded by dusty artifacts and faded photographs. His customers were mostly old acquaintances, retired cops and officials who would come to reminisce about the good old days.

As he unlocked his door, a young woman pushed her way into the shop. She was dressed in black, with piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into Iván's very soul. "Iván Petrovich?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Yes," he replied warily, wiping his hands on a dirty apron.

The woman handed him a small package wrapped in brown paper and twine. "This was left for you at my office," she said, without explanation.

Iván unwrapped the package to reveal a faded photograph of an old Moscow street. He knew every corner of that street – the bakery where he used to buy his bread, the park where he had once walked with his daughter who had died in a car accident.

"What is this?" Iván asked, his eyes locked on the image.

The woman smiled faintly. "It's a reminder of your past, detective. A message from someone who wants you back."

Iván raised an eyebrow. He had long since left that world behind – or so he thought. As he looked at the photograph again, something stirred deep within him. The itch to solve, the need to uncover, it was still there.

The woman turned and disappeared into the crowded streets of Moscow, leaving Iván Petrovich with a decision – to dust off his old shoes and hit the road once more, or to let the world move on without him.
