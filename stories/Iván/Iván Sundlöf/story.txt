As the days turned into nights, Iván's apartment became a sea of papers, empty coffee cups, and dog-eared notebooks. His editor at the newspaper began to worry that Iván had lost his edge, but Iván knew better. He was on the cusp of something big.

Finally, after months of hard work, Iván broke the story. The scandal rocked the business community, with several high-profile leaders forced to resign in shame. Iván's article sent shockwaves through the city, and he became an overnight sensation.
