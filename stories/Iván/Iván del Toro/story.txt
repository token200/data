Born into a family of modest means, he had always been driven to succeed, and his determination had taken him far. As Iván del Toro, the son of a humble shopkeeper, he had spent countless hours honing his skills as a painter.

Despite his talent, Iván del Toro's early life was marked by hardship. His family struggled to make ends meet, and Iván was often forced to work multiple jobs just to put food on the table. But he never lost sight of his passion for art. He would spend hours sketching in the margins of his notebooks, experimenting with different techniques and mediums.

He knew that this was where he belonged – in a place where he could let his true self shine, without the weight of expectation or criticism.
