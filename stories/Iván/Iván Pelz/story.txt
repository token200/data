Iván Pelz sat alone at his small, cluttered desk, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and papers. As a renowned cryptologist, he had spent years studying the art of deciphering secret codes, but it was not until now that he received an invitation to unravel one of the most enigmatic puzzles in history.

The mysterious message arrived via a secure channel, claiming to be from a reclusive collector who possessed information about an ancient language thought to be extinct. Intrigued by the prospect of uncovering something entirely new, Iván couldn't resist the challenge. He packed his bags and boarded a flight to a remote location in Eastern Europe.

Upon arrival, he was greeted by an elderly man with piercing green eyes, who introduced himself as the collector. As they walked through the rolling hills and forests, the air thickened with anticipation. The collector led Iván to a secluded cottage, where rows of ancient texts lay scattered across dusty shelves.

"These are the fragments," the collector explained, " pieces of an alphabet that has been lost for centuries. Some believed it was created by the ancient Greeks, while others attributed its origin to Egyptian hieroglyphics."

Iván's eyes scanned the text, his trained mind racing with possibilities. He poured over each symbol, searching for patterns and inconsistencies. Hours turned into days as he worked tirelessly, fueled by coffee and determination.

As the sun set on the final evening of Iván's visit, he held up a small piece of parchment in triumph. "I've found it," he exclaimed, his voice barely above a whisper. The collector nodded, a hint of a smile playing on his lips. Together, they deciphered the code, revealing an intricate system that had defied scholars for centuries.

The message was clear: a hidden chamber beneath the castle walls held secrets worth unearthing. Iván's discovery marked the beginning of a new era in cryptography, and he knew that his name would forever be tied to this puzzle. The collector vanished into the night, leaving Iván with a small note etched onto the parchment – "Your work is just beginning."
