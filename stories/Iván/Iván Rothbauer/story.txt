Iván Rothbauer stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. The air was thick with the smell of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of conversation. He spotted his friend, Sofia, sipping a latte by the window, and made his way over to her.

As he approached, she looked up and smiled, her bright blue eyes sparkling with warmth. "Iván, finally arrived," she said, setting her cup down on the table.

Iván took a seat across from her, running a hand through his dark hair. "Sorry I'm late," he muttered, eyeing the clock on the wall. "Traffic in the city is always a nightmare."

Sofia laughed and leaned back in her chair. "You're not exactly known for your punctuality, Iván," she teased.

Iván chuckled, feeling a familiar sense of comfort with Sofia's teasing. They'd been friends since college, bonding over their shared love of literature and music. Over the years, Iván had become increasingly withdrawn, shutting himself off from the world after a painful breakup. But with Sofia by his side, he felt like he could be himself.

As they sipped their coffee, Iván pulled out his phone and began scrolling through social media. He was a writer, or at least, that's what he claimed to be. In reality, he was still figuring out his passion, struggling to find the courage to share his work with the world.

Sofia noticed him staring at his phone and raised an eyebrow. "What's wrong?" she asked, her voice gentle.

Iván sighed, showing her a snippet of text from a rejection email. Sofia's eyes widened in sympathy as he read out the message, full of hollow praise and empty encouragement.

As they talked about Iván's writing struggles, Sofia offered words of wisdom and support. She reminded him that failure was an inevitable part of success and encouraged him to keep pushing forward. Iván felt a lump form in his throat, but with Sofia by his side, he knew he could face anything.

After finishing their coffee, the friends decided to take a walk through the park. The sun was setting, casting long shadows across the grass. They strolled hand-in-hand, feeling the breeze on their skin and listening to the sounds of nature.

As they walked, Iván confided in Sofia about his deepest fears – about being alone forever, about not being good enough. Sofia listened attentively, her eyes never leaving his face. She didn't offer any easy answers or clichéd advice; instead, she shared a quiet strength that soothed Iván's soul.

Eventually, they found themselves at the park's edge, where the city gave way to darkness. The sky was ablaze with stars, and the air was filled with the scent of blooming flowers. Iván turned to Sofia, his eyes shining with gratitude.

"Thank you," he said softly, his voice barely audible over the hum of the night.

Sofia smiled and wrapped her arms around him in a warm hug. "Anytime, Iván," she whispered back, her words carrying on the wind like a promise.
