Iván Eben was an enigmatic figure in the world of high-stakes magic. Few people knew much about him beyond his extraordinary abilities and unyielding dedication to his craft. As a skilled illusionist and performer, Iván had made a name for himself as one of the most sought-after entertainers among the wealthy elite.

But despite his flashy persona, Iván's true passions lay elsewhere. He was an ardent collector of rare and obscure magical texts, and spent countless hours pouring over ancient tomes in search of new knowledge and insights. It was this side of Iván Eben that few people ever got to see - a quiet, reserved individual who was content to spend his evenings alone, surrounded by dusty books and flickering candlelight.

One night, however, Iván's reputation as a master of magic came calling in the form of an unexpected invitation. He received a cryptic message from an anonymous patron, requesting his presence at a private gathering deep in the heart of the city. Intrigued, Iván accepted the invitation and made his way to the appointed location.

As he arrived at the agreed-upon address, Iván was greeted by a sense of unease that settled over him like a shroud. Something about this evening felt off, as if the very air itself seemed to vibrate with malevolent energy. But Iván Eben, ever the professional, pushed aside his doubts and followed the host through winding corridors and hidden chambers deep beneath the city streets.

What he found at the end of that journey would change him forever. A gathering of powerful sorcerers, each one more extraordinary than the last, all convened to perform a single, perilous ritual. Iván Eben, with his mastery of illusion and stealth, was chosen as the final piece in their puzzle - and for once, he couldn't hide his own excitement at being part of such an historic event.
