Iván Sikora stepped out of the rain-soaked streets and into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of life. As a private investigator, he had grown accustomed to spending long nights alone, waiting for leads to pan out.

The scent of stale coffee and worn leather enveloped him as he slid onto a stool at the counter. The bartender, a gruff but kind-hearted man named Viktor, raised an eyebrow in recognition. "Another one, Iván?"

Iván nodded, his eyes never leaving the figure huddled in the corner, nursing a cup of black coffee. He was an old acquaintance of the café owner's – a woman who had helped him track down a valuable piece of information just last week.

"Who's that?" Iván asked, nodding discreetly towards the stranger.

Viktor leaned in, his voice barely above a whisper. "Don't know. Came in around midnight. Paid in cash and sat down to wait for someone."

Iván raised an eyebrow, intrigued. He signaled Viktor for another cup of coffee and began to make his way over to the stranger, careful not to startle them.

As he approached, the figure slowly stood up, their eyes locking onto Iván's with a mix of caution and curiosity. "Iván Sikora," they said softly, using his first name like an old friend.

"Zuzana," Iván replied, taking a seat across from her. She was a skilled hacker and informant he had worked with in the past.

"What brings you here tonight?" Zuzana asked, eyeing him warily.

Iván smiled wryly. "Same as always – trying to stay one step ahead of those who'd like to do me harm."

Zuzana's expression softened, her eyes sparkling with a hint of amusement. "You know I'm not here to betray you, Iván. At least...not tonight."

The rain-soaked night air seemed to grow lighter as they talked, the shadows in the café receding as their conversation deepened. For a moment, Iván felt like he could trust Zuzana with anything.

But the fleeting connection was shattered by the sound of shattering glass from outside. A hooded figure burst into the café, gun drawn, and began to scan the room for targets.

Without hesitation, Iván sprang into action, his training kicking in as he dispatched the would-be assassin. As the dust settled, Zuzana turned to him with a hint of gratitude in her eyes.

"Thanks for watching my back, Iván."

Iván smiled grimly. "It's what I'm here for."
