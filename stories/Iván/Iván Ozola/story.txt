Iván Ozola stepped into the crowded café, scanning the room for a familiar face. It was a typical Monday morning in Riga, with locals sipping coffee and checking their phones before heading to work. Iván's eyes landed on a small table by the window, where their friend, Artūrs, sat hunched over a laptop.

As she approached, Artūrs looked up, startled, and smiled when he saw Iván Ozola's worn denim jacket poking out from beneath her cardigan. "Hey, Iván! How was your weekend?" he asked, closing his laptop.

Iván slid into the chair across from him, taking a deep breath before launching into a story about her chaotic Saturday morning spent helping her mother prepare for the annual Riga Festival market. The conversation flowed easily, with Artūrs asking questions and Iván Ozola sharing details about her childhood memories of helping her mother sell traditional Latvian crafts.

As they chatted, the café's music changed, shifting from indie folk to a lively mix of traditional folk instruments that made Iván's hips sway slightly. She couldn't help but think of her own heritage, having grown up between Latvia and Mexico, with a complicated family history that she'd only recently begun to unravel.

Artūrs noticed the change in her demeanor and asked if everything was okay. Iván Ozola hesitated for a moment before launching into a fragmented account of her latest research discoveries – bits of data about her Latvian ancestry that seemed too good (or bad) to be true. As she spoke, Artūrs listened intently, asking questions and nodding thoughtfully.

The café's door swung open, admitting a gust of chilly air as more patrons arrived. Iván Ozola leaned back in her chair, feeling grateful for the quiet space they'd carved out together amidst the bustling crowd. She smiled at Artūrs, who winked back, knowing that their friend was on a journey to rediscover herself and her roots.

As the morning wore on, Iván Ozola gathered her things, mentally preparing herself to tackle another week of exploring the intricacies of her identity. With one last glance at Artūrs, she stepped out into the Riga morning, ready to take on whatever came next in this winding path of self-discovery that had become an integral part of her life as Iván Ozola.
