Iván Dupont was a man shrouded in mystery, with an air of quiet confidence that commanded attention without seeking it. As a former member of an elite special forces unit, Iván had seen his fair share of battles and had emerged unscathed, but not unmarked. A jagged scar above his left eyebrow told the story of a particularly grueling mission.

Years after leaving the military, Iván had retired to a quiet life in the French Riviera, where he spent most of his days tending to his vineyard and sipping wine on the sun-kissed terraces. It was here that he found solace, surrounded by the gentle rustle of leaves and the sweet scent of ripening grapes.

Despite his tranquil exterior, Iván's past still lingered in the shadows, waiting to pounce upon anyone who dared to get too close. His eyes seemed to hold a thousand secrets, each one locked behind a veil of introspection that made it impossible to read him. Yet, there was an aura about Iván Dupont that commanded respect – perhaps it was the quiet authority with which he carried himself or the sharp mind that had honed itself through years of military training.

Iván's days were filled with the simple pleasures of wine-making, but his nights were shrouded in mystery. It was whispered among the local residents that on certain evenings, Iván would disappear into the darkness, only to reappear at dawn, refreshed and rejuvenated as if he had never left.

It was one such night when a stranger stumbled upon Iván's hidden world. Lost in the vineyards, the young traveler found himself face-to-face with Iván Dupont, who stood motionless beneath the star-studded sky, his eyes aglow like lanterns in the dark. In that instant, time itself seemed to freeze as the two men locked gazes, each holding a piece of the other's soul.

The encounter left its mark on both parties – the stranger with an unshakeable sense of purpose, while Iván Dupont retreated into his shell, leaving behind only a whisper of what lay hidden beneath.
