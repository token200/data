Iván Puccini was a man shrouded in mystery. Few people knew much about his life before he arrived in the small town of Ravenswood, where he had taken up residence in an old, sprawling mansion on the outskirts of town.

Rumors swirled that Iván Puccini had once been a famous opera singer, known for his powerful voice and captivating stage presence. But after a tragic accident left him mute, he retreated from the spotlight and dedicated himself to studying the art of music composition.

As word of his talents spread, musicians from all over began to seek out Iván Puccini's expertise. He spent his days teaching and writing, pouring his emotions into the works that flowed from his pen like blood from a wound. Despite his reserved nature, those who knew him could not help but be drawn to Iván Puccini's intensity and passion.

One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the town in a warm orange glow, a young composer named Sophia arrived at Iván Puccini's doorstep. She had heard whispers of his genius and hoped to learn from him. As she knocked on the door, a low, raspy voice bid her enter.

Inside, Sophia found herself face to face with Iván Puccini, his eyes burning with an inner fire that seemed almost otherworldly. He listened as she presented her latest piece, offering words of praise and criticism in equal measure. As the night wore on, Sophia felt herself becoming lost in the depths of Iván Puccini's soul, a journey from which there was no return.

As the evening drew to a close, Iván Puccini rose from his chair, his movements slow and deliberate. He handed Sophia a sheet of paper, upon which he had written a few simple notes. "Write this," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "Let it be your guide." And with that, the door closed behind her, leaving Iván Puccini to his thoughts once more.
