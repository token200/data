Iván Nowakowski was a man shrouded in mystery, his life a labyrinth of secrets and half-truths. A Polish-born journalist, he had spent years reporting on the darkest corners of Eastern Europe, uncovering stories that no one else dared to touch.

His eyes were piercing green, like the first spring leaves, and his hair was flecked with grey, giving him an air of gravitas that belied his actual age. He was a man who moved unseen, always staying just out of reach of those he encountered.

Iván's latest assignment had brought him to Prague, where rumors swirled about a long-abandoned asylum on the outskirts of the city. The building stood as a testament to Czechoslovakia's troubled past, its labyrinthine corridors said to be home to some of the most disturbed minds in history.

Determined to uncover the truth behind the asylum's closure, Iván set out to explore the crumbling halls, determined to expose the secrets that lay hidden within. He interviewed former patients and staff members, piecing together a patchwork of memories and half-forgotten tales.

As he delved deeper into his investigation, however, Iván began to realize that he was not alone in his pursuit. A shadowy figure watched him from the fringes, following every step, every movement. The air seemed to vibrate with an unspoken threat, as if the very presence of the asylum was alive and waiting for Iván to uncover its deepest secrets.

One night, as a fierce storm rolled in over Prague, Iván received a cryptic message from his source: "Turn back now." But he refused to be deterred. The words hung in the air like a challenge, taunting him with their ambiguity.

In the darkness of the asylum's corridors, Iván stumbled upon an ancient logbook hidden away in a dusty archive room. Its pages revealed a history of brutal experimentation and medical atrocities, performed on unsuspecting patients by the very doctors who claimed to care for them.

As he closed the logbook, a gust of wind slammed shut the door behind him, plunging the world into darkness. Iván stood there, listening as the silence seemed to swallow everything whole. He knew then that some secrets were better left unspoken – and that his own life was now irreparably entwined with those he had sought to expose.
