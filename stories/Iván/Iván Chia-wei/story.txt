Iván Chia-wei was an enigmatic figure, known only to a select few in the underbelly of Taipei. A master thief and forger, he had earned a reputation as the greatest deception artist in all of Taiwan.

No one knew much about Iván's past, but it was whispered that he had grown up on the streets of old Taipei, surviving by his wits and cunning. He had honed his skills as a young boy, learning to pick locks and create forged documents from his father, a retired army officer.

As an adult, Iván had turned his talents to more lucrative pursuits. He became known for his daring heists, stealing priceless artifacts and selling them on the black market. But it was his ability to create impeccable forgeries that brought him true wealth and fame.

Iván's latest mark was a prominent businessman, who had commissioned him to forge a set of rare and valuable certificates. Iván accepted the job, knowing it would be his ticket to the big leagues. He spent weeks studying the business's financial records, learning its secrets and creating documents that were almost indistinguishable from the real thing.

The night of the forgery, Iván snuck into the businessman's mansion, avoiding security guards with ease. He worked through the night, crafting certificates and accounts, his hands moving with precision and speed. When he finished, he left behind a trail of perfectly executed forgeries, each one more convincing than the last.

The businessman was none the wiser, but Iván knew the risk was high. One misstep could land him in prison, or worse. He waited patiently as the business's accountants examined his handiwork, their faces lighting up with delight at the accuracy and precision of the forged documents.

As the days passed, Iván watched from the shadows as his client reaped the benefits of his forgery. The businessman's bank accounts swelled, and he lived a life of luxury, completely unaware of Iván's role in it all. And Iván smiled to himself, knowing that he had pulled off the ultimate con.

But there was one person who suspected Iván's involvement - a mysterious woman who had watched him from afar, her eyes narrowing with curiosity. She knew his game, and she knew that Iván Chia-wei would stop at nothing to get what he wanted. The stage was set for a thrilling game of cat and mouse, one that would test Iván's skills to the limit.
