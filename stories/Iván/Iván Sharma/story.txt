Iván Sharma stepped off the crowded bus and onto the bustling streets of downtown Lima. As a renowned journalist, he had covered some of the biggest stories in South America, but this one was personal.

Iván's younger brother, Leo, had gone missing six months ago while working on a project in the Peruvian Amazon. The police investigation had stalled, and Iván had finally decided to take matters into his own hands.

He navigated through the crowded market stalls, dodging vendors selling colorful textiles and fresh produce. His eyes scanned the crowd, searching for any sign of life – or death. The streets were narrow and winding, with towering skyscrapers looming above. It was a maze that Iván had walked many times before, but today he felt like a stranger.

As he turned a corner, he spotted a small café tucked away in a quiet alley. He pushed open the door and slid onto a stool at the bar, ordering a strong cup of coffee from the bartender, who recognized him immediately.

"News?" the bartender asked, pouring Iván's coffee with a knowing glint in his eye.

Iván shook his head. "Just trying to stay awake, José."

The café was quiet, save for the hum of the espresso machine and the occasional chime of a phone. Iván pulled out his notebook and began to scribble down notes on Leo's disappearance. He had interviewed dozens of witnesses and contacts in Lima, but so far, no one seemed to know anything.

As he worked, the door swung open and a young woman walked in, her eyes scanning the room with a mix of fear and determination. Iván watched as she spotted him and made a beeline for his table.

"Can I help you?" Iván asked, raising an eyebrow.

"My brother," the woman replied, her voice trembling. "He's been missing for months too."

Iván felt a jolt of adrenaline. Could this be it – the break he had been searching for? He leaned in, his notebook at the ready.

"I'm looking into some cases from last year. Do you remember anything about your brother?"

The woman nodded, her eyes welling up with tears. "We were working together on a project... we stumbled upon something. I don't know if it's relevant, but we tried to leave."

Iván's mind was racing. This could be the key to unlocking Leo's disappearance. He smiled grimly at the young woman.

"Don't worry," he said. "We'll get to the bottom of this."
