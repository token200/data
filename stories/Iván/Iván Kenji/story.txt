Iván Kenji stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the unfamiliar station. It was as if he'd traveled not just through time but to another world entirely. A man in his late twenties with striking features – high cheekbones, sharp jawline, and piercing green eyes that seemed to hold a secret – Iván Kenji had always felt like an outsider.

Born to a Japanese mother and an Irish father, Iván's dual heritage had often left him feeling torn between two worlds. He'd grown up in Dublin, but spent summers in Tokyo with his mother, learning the intricacies of the language and the art of traditional tea ceremonies. Now, as he stood on this foreign platform, Iván felt like a ghost hovering between life and death.

He'd been sent to New York City for work – not exactly, but more of a...complicated arrangement with an old friend from his Tokyo days. The city was alive and pulsating around him, a cacophony of car horns, chatter, and the distant wail of sirens that seemed to reverberate deep within Iván's chest.

As he made his way through the crowded streets, Iván felt like a stranger in a strange land. Every face blurred together – the suits, the jeans, the bright colors that seemed to shout "look at me!" But amidst it all, one figure stood out: a young woman with piercing blue eyes and jet-black hair, her gaze locked onto Iván's like a magnet.

She caught up to him in a small café on 5th Avenue, ordering a coffee with an air of confidence that made Iván's heart skip a beat. "I've been waiting for you," she said, extending a hand that felt warm and gentle against his skin.

"I have no idea what you're talking about," Iván replied, but the words felt hollow even as he spoke them.

The woman smiled, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "Don't worry, Iván Kenji. I know your secrets. And I think it's time we talked."

As they sat down at a small table by the window, Iván felt the weight of his world shifting ever so slightly. Maybe this place, this city, and this woman would be the key to unlocking the mysteries that had haunted him for so long. Perhaps, just perhaps, he'd finally found a home in this strange new world.
