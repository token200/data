She sat down on a bench, watching as children played tag in the distance and couples strolled hand-in-hand along the walking path. The world seemed full of color and life, and Aanya Martin's eyes sparkled with excitement. She quickly pulled out her sketchbook and began to draw, capturing the beauty of the park on paper.

As she worked, Aanya Martin felt a sense of clarity wash over her. Her brushstrokes became confident, her colors bold and vibrant.
