Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was her best friend and fellow journalist, Rohan. "Hey, Aanya! I heard you're working on something big," he said, eyeing the stack of files on her desk.

Aanya smiled slyly. "You have no idea, Rohan. I've got a source who's willing to spill all the beans on the city council's secret dealings."

Aanya Koch felt a surge of determination. She was going to make sure this story broke big time. With Rohan's help, they worked through the night, typing away and formatting their article.

Finally, at 3 am, they finished. Aanya Koch smiled triumphantly as she hit send on the email to her editor. "It's done," she said, yawning. "We're going to make headlines tomorrow."
