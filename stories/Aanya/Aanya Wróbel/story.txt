As Aanya grew older, her interests shifted towards photography. She began taking pictures of everything, from urban landscapes to intimate portraits of friends and family. Her photographs quickly gained recognition at local exhibitions, where she showcased her unique perspective on the world.

Despite her success, Aanya remained true to herself, refusing to conform to traditional norms in the art world.

Among the crowd of admirers were several collectors who offered Aanya lucrative deals for her work.
