As Aanya took a break from the stove to chat with her mother, a group of customers came in, asking for recommendations. Aanya happily obliged, chatting about everything from pasta sauces to spice blends. She was thrilled to share her knowledge and enthusiasm with others.

Throughout the evening, Aanya Lewandowski moved with confidence and ease, juggling orders and chatting with regulars like she'd done a thousand times before.
