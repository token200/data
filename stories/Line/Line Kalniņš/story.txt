In the small town of Riga, Latvia, there lived a young woman named Line Kalniņš. She was known for her exceptional talent in embroidery and textiles. Line's passion for needlework began at a young age, watching her grandmother create intricate designs on traditional Latvian clothing.

One day, a prominent fashion designer from Berlin discovered Line's work online and was immediately impressed by her talent.
