Line Askarov stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. The once-thriving town of Pallasjoki was now a shadow of its former self, its factories long closed and the streets eerily quiet.

As a young journalist, Line had always been drawn to stories about forgotten places like this one. She saw something in the empty streets and crumbling buildings that others didn't – a chance to unmask the truth behind Pallasjoki's downfall.

Line pulled out her notebook and began to scribble down notes as she watched the stationmaster, an elderly man with a thick beard, load crates onto his small cart. He eyed her warily, but Line smiled and approached him, extending a hand in greeting.

"Hello," she said, trying out her high school Finnish. "I'm here to write about Pallasjoki's history."

The stationmaster grunted, but softened as he shook her hand. "You're the one with the questions, eh?" He nodded towards the cart. "Those crates? Coal for the new factory that's supposed to bring life back to this town."

Line's eyes lit up. "A new factory?"

The stationmaster snorted. "That's what they say. But I've lived here all my life, and I know better. That factory is just a myth. The real reason Pallasjoki was abandoned was because of the timber company that bought out the old sawmill."

As Line listened, her mind whirled with questions. She pulled out her recorder and began to ask the stationmaster more about his story, the small town's history, and the motives behind its decline.

The conversation flowed easily, like an old friendship rekindled. And as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over Pallasjoki's streets, Line felt a sense of purpose settle in – she had finally found the truth behind this forgotten town.

With her recorder still rolling, Line set off into the fading light, determined to uncover every last secret and piece together the story of Pallasjoki. As the stationmaster watched her disappear around the corner, he smiled to himself, knowing that one person might just be brave enough to tell his truth.
