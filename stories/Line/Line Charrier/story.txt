Born as Line Marie-Charlotte Charrier, she had grown up surrounded by the world of adventure and exploration.

As she grew older, Line's love for extreme sports only intensified. She began competing in freerunning competitions, effortlessly navigating urban landscapes with her friends.

For weeks, she poured her heart and soul into the project, transforming the drab walls into vibrant tapestries that seemed to pulse with life.
