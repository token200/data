Line Krumins was known for her unconventional approach to magic. As a member of the prestigious Wysteria Academy, she often found herself at odds with the traditional methods of spellcasting. Her classmates would often whisper about her unorthodox techniques, labeling her as "reckless" and "unpredictable." But Line didn't care – she was driven by a burning desire to push the boundaries of magic.

One day, while studying in the academy's ancient library, Line stumbled upon an obscure text that caught her eye. It was an old tome bound in worn leather, adorned with strange symbols that seemed to shimmer and dance in the flickering candlelight. The title page read "The Art of Unconventional Magic" – a phrase that sent shivers down Line's spine.

As she delved deeper into the book, Line began to realize that this was her true calling. She spent every spare moment studying the ancient rituals and incantations within its pages. Her classmates watched in awe as she conjured flames from thin air, summoned storms with a flick of her wrist, and manipulated the very fabric of reality.

But not everyone was impressed by Line's newfound abilities. The academy's headmistress, a stern woman named Lady Harrow, saw Line's methods as nothing short of "dark magic." She warned Line that her reckless abandon would ultimately lead to disaster – but Line refused to listen.

One fateful night, Line decided to put her newfound powers to the test. Under the light of a full moon, she summoned a tempest of unbridled energy and unleashed it upon the academy's courtyard. The winds howled, the rain lashed down, and the very foundations of the building seemed to shudder in response.

As the storm raged on, Lady Harrow stormed into the courtyard, her face twisted with rage. "Line Krumins," she spat, "you have brought shame upon this academy – your methods are nothing short of sorcery!"

But Line just smiled, her eyes blazing with an inner fire. She knew that she had finally found her true calling – and nothing would ever stop her from mastering the art of unconventional magic.
