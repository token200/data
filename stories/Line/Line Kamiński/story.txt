I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Line Kamiński. It is possible that this character does not exist in any notable works or is too obscure to be found in my knowledge database.

However, I can create a new story about a fictional character with the name Line Kamiński. Here it is:

Line Kamiński was a 25-year-old freelance journalist who had always been fascinated by the supernatural. Growing up in rural Poland, she had heard stories of ghosts and curses from her grandfather, a local historian. As soon as she finished school, Line set out to explore these legends further.

She spent years researching and investigating paranormal activity all over Europe. Her latest assignment was to investigate a reportedly haunted castle in Transylvania, Romania. The castle's owner, the wealthy businessman Henryk Żegota, had offered her a hefty sum of money to expose or debunk the rumors surrounding his estate.

As Line arrived at the castle on a stormy night, she felt an eerie atmosphere wash over her. She began setting up her equipment and started interviewing the staff and guests who had stayed in the castle for the past few days. Everyone seemed genuinely spooked by strange noises and unexplained occurrences.

That evening, as she was reviewing her footage and interviews, Line noticed something peculiar. In one of her tapes, a figure appeared to walk through a solid door. She rewound the footage several times, but every time she did, the figure vanished or remained still. Intrigued, Line decided to try and recreate the scene.

She carefully set up her camera equipment in front of the door again and waited for the perfect moment to record something unusual. As soon as the ghostly figure reappeared, Line's heart skipped a beat. But just as quickly, it vanished into thin air. Suddenly, she heard footsteps coming from behind her. Turning around, she saw Henryk Żegota standing there, his eyes wide with an unsettling intensity.

"What do you know about this place?" he asked in hushed tones.

Line's journalistic instincts kicked in, and she began to question him about the castle's dark past and the truth behind the haunting. As they talked, Line realized that sometimes the most inexplicable phenomena can hold the key to uncovering a deeper mystery.
