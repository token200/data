I couldn't find any information on a well-known character named "Line Wiśniewska". It's possible that she is a fictional character from a lesser-known source, or maybe I just missed her. If you could provide more context or clarify who Line Wiśniewska is, I'd be happy to write a story about her.

However, if you're looking for a Polish name, I found a famous Polish soprano singer named Agnieszka Lili Witkiewicz, but also the artist Marika Wiśniewska. She's an author and illustrator of children's books. If you're interested in writing a story about her as an author or illustrator, I'd be happy to help.

Alternatively, if you provide more context or information about Line Wiśniewska, such as what genre she belongs to (e.g., fantasy, sci-fi, historical fiction) or any notable characteristics she may have, I can try to write a story about her.
