The king, taken by Line's intelligence and charm, made him his chief diplomat, sending him on missions to forge alliances with neighboring kingdoms.

One such mission took Line Aelius Hadrianus to the kingdom of Valtoria, a land ravaged by war and famine.

But Line knew that there was still much work to be done. He continued to serve the king, navigating the intricate web of alliances and rivalries that defined Eridoria's politics.

Despite the demands of court life, Line found solace in his private library, where he devoured ancient tomes on strategy and philosophy. It was here that he discovered his true passion – not for power or prestige, but for knowledge itself. And so, while the world of Eridoria spun around him, Line Aelius Hadrianus remained steadfast, guided by his own quiet convictions.

In the end, it was this unique blend of diplomacy and introspection that made Line Aelius Hadrianus the most sought-after advisor in all the realm. His name became synonymous with wisdom, wit, and loyalty – a testament to the boundless potential hidden within the youngest member of the noble family.
