Line Vuorinen's eyes scanned the worn wooden piers, her feet bare on the chilly concrete. She had always found solace in this spot, where the Lake Saimaa waters met the dark forest. The locals called it a cursed place, where the veil between worlds was thin.

As a young girl, Line would sit here with her grandmother, listening to tales of the ancient magic that swirled around the lake. Her grandmother's eyes seemed to hold a thousand secrets, and Line longed to uncover them all. But after her passing, those stories faded away like the mist on the lake's surface.

Years went by, and Line grew into a skilled huntress, tracking wolves across the vast wilderness that surrounded the lake. Yet, she never lost her connection to this spot. In fact, it became an integral part of who she was – a bridge between the worlds her grandmother spoke of.

One autumn evening, as the leaves turned golden and crimson, Line sensed a presence around her. It was as if the forest itself whispered in her ear, drawing her closer to the water's edge. She felt the familiar tug of the magic that lay beneath the surface.

Without warning, Line stepped into the lake, the icy waters enveloping her like a shroud. The world above dissolved, leaving only the whispers and the stars above. It was then that she saw them: shadowy figures gathered at the lake's center, their eyes glowing with an ethereal light.

Line had always suspected these beings existed – the keepers of the ancient magic. Her grandmother had spoken of them in hushed tones, warning Line to stay away from them lest she be consumed by the power that lay beyond human control.

As she watched, a wispy form emerged from the shadows. It coalesced into a woman with eyes that burned like embers. The air vibrated with an expectant energy, as if this meeting had been centuries in the making.

Line knew little of these ancient guardians, but she felt an inexplicable sense of belonging among them. They spoke to her in whispers, sharing secrets about her own destiny and the mysteries hidden beneath the surface of Lake Saimaa.

In that moment, Line realized that she was not just a huntress – she was the key to unlocking the world's deepest magic. As the starlight intensified above, the women at the lake's center reached out with their hands, welcoming her into a realm beyond time and space.
