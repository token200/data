Line Kovalchuk stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. She had just arrived in Portland after a long journey from Montreal, and the cool Pacific air hit her like a slap in the face.

As she made her way through the crowd, Line's mind began to wander back to her childhood in Ukraine. Her parents had brought her to Canada when she was just a teenager, and Line had grown up speaking both English and Ukrainian. She had always been drawn to music, and as a young woman, she had formed a folk band with her friends.

Years of touring had taken its toll on Line's voice, but she refused to give up on her passion for music. Now, at 30, she was determined to make a name for herself in the US indie-folk scene. Her band, The Wanderlust, had just signed a record deal and were set to release their debut album soon.

As Line walked through the city streets, taking in the sights and sounds of Portland's eclectic neighborhoods, she felt a sense of excitement and possibility. She had always been drawn to the idea of starting over, and this city seemed like the perfect place to do so.

Eventually, Line arrived at her new apartment, a cozy loft in the heart of the Alberta Arts District. She spent the afternoon unpacking boxes and setting up her guitar, feeling a sense of homecoming wash over her.

Later that evening, Line met up with some of her new bandmates for a jam session at a local coffee shop. The music flowed easily, as if they had been playing together for years. As they wrapped up their set, Line felt a sense of gratitude and belonging. She knew that she still had a long way to go, but for now, in this moment, everything felt right.

"I'm so glad we're doing this," one of the bandmates said, smiling at her. "You're going to make an amazing record, Line Kovalchuk."

Line smiled back, feeling a surge of confidence. She knew that she had found her tribe here in Portland, and with The Wanderlust by her side, she was ready to take on whatever the music scene threw their way.

As the night drew to a close, Line settled into bed, her guitar still clutched tightly in her arms. She smiled to herself, feeling the familiar thrill of creative possibility coursing through her veins. This was just the beginning for Line Kovalchuk and The Wanderlust â€“ and she couldn't wait to see what the future held.
