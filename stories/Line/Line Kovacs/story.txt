Line Kovacs stood alone in the rain-soaked streets of New Eden, her eyes scanning the crowded sidewalks for any sign of danger. A former enforcer for the powerful Synthetix Corporation, Line had long since abandoned that life, opting instead to forge a new path as a private investigator.

As she watched, a young woman darted across the street, dodging pedestrians and weaving between towering skyscrapers with an ease that belied her years. Line recognized the look in her eyes - desperation, mixed with a spark of defiance. She knew it well, having felt it herself when she first broke free from Synthetix's grasp.

Line's thoughts were interrupted by a comms device on her wrist, buzzing to life as her assistant, Rachel, spoke in hushed tones. "Client is here, Line. Needs to speak with you about a... situation."

Line nodded to herself, making her way through the throngs of people towards the designated meeting spot - an unassuming alleyway between two high-rise buildings. A figure emerged from the shadows, their features obscured by a hood.

"Line Kovacs," they said, their voice low and gravelly. "I need your help."

Line's eyes narrowed as she took in the stranger's appearance. She had seen her before - a Synthetix agent, sent to extract information from one of their former employees. But there was something different about this one... a desperation that seemed genuine.

"I'm listening," Line said, her hand resting on the hilt of her sword.

The agent hesitated, then began to speak in a rush. "My sister's being hunted by Synthetix. They think she knows too much about their latest project."

Line's grip on her sword tightened as memories came flooding back - her own escape from Synthetix's clutches, the feeling of freedom that had haunted her ever since.

"I'll take the case," Line said finally, her voice firm. "But you need to tell me everything."
