Line Hassan sat at her desk, staring blankly at the stack of papers in front of her. As a renowned forensic scientist, she had seen her fair share of gruesome crime scenes, but nothing seemed to prepare her for the latest case.

The victim was a young woman, no more than 25 years old, found dead in an alleyway with no signs of forced entry or struggle. The only clue was a small piece of paper clutched in her hand, bearing a cryptic message: "They'll never find you."

Line's team had been working around the clock to analyze the evidence, but so far, they had turned up nothing. No DNA, no fingerprints, no witnesses. It was as if the killer had vanished into thin air.

As she pored over the case files, Line couldn't shake off the feeling that she was missing something. She had a knack for spotting patterns, and this case seemed to be hiding one beneath its surface.

Suddenly, an idea struck her. What if the message wasn't just a random phrase, but a red herring? What if it was meant to mislead them, rather than reveal the killer's identity?

Line jumped up from her chair and began pacing around the room. She needed to think outside the box, to consider all possibilities. And then, it hit her – the victim's profession.

The young woman had been a social media influencer, known for her beautiful smile and infectious laugh. But Line knew that sometimes, appearances could be deceiving.

She spent the next few hours poring over the victim's online profiles, searching for any clues that might lead them to the killer. And then, she saw it – a post from several months ago, where the victim had mentioned her fears about stalking and harassment.

Line's eyes narrowed as she realized the connection. The killer wasn't just motivated by greed or revenge; they were driven by obsession. They had stalked the victim, watching her every move, studying her online activity.

With newfound determination, Line turned to her team. "We need to focus on identifying our stalker," she said, her voice firm and commanding. "And I think we know exactly where to start."
