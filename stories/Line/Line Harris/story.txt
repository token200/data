Line Harris stepped into the dimly lit bar, scanning the room for familiar faces. She was a woman of few words, but when she spoke, people listened. As the lead singer of the popular rock band "Electric Storm," Line had built a reputation for her enigmatic stage presence and raw talent.

As she made her way to the bar, Line's thoughts turned to her upcoming show tonight. She had been rehearsing tirelessly with her bandmates, perfecting their set list and working on new material. Her manager, Mike, had promised that this tour would be her biggest one yet, and Line was determined to deliver.

The bartender, a gruff but kind-hearted man named Jack, raised an eyebrow as Line slid onto the stool beside him. "The usual?" he asked, knowing better than to ask what she wanted in such a case.

Line nodded, and Jack poured her a whiskey on the rocks. She took a sip, feeling the burn all the way down. It was a familiar comfort, one that helped her shake off the nerves that often plagued her before shows.

Just then, Mike appeared beside her, a look of excitement on his face. "Hey, Line! You ready for tonight?" he asked, his voice low and urgent.

Line raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the sudden interest in her performance. "Ready," she replied, her voice smooth as silk.

Mike nodded, his eyes locked intently on hers. "I've got a surprise for you," he said, a small smile playing on his lips. "The opening act is going to be a special one-night-only collaboration with the legendary guitarist, Axel Steele."

Line's eyes widened in surprise, and she felt a shiver run down her spine. Axel Steele was a god among guitarists, known for his innovative techniques and genre-bending sound. The thought of sharing the stage with him sent a thrill through Line Harris.

As Mike disappeared into the crowd, Line took another sip of her drink, feeling a newfound energy coursing through her veins. Tonight's show was going to be one to remember, and she was ready to give it everything she had. With Axel Steele by her side, the possibilities seemed endless, and Line Harris knew that this tour would be her most unforgettable yet.
