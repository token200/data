Line Roberts stepped out of her small caf√©, surveying the bustling streets of Portland's Old Town. As a private investigator, she had seen it all - from cheating spouses to mysterious murders. But there was something different about this case that had piqued her interest.

A wealthy tech mogul, known for his ruthless business tactics, had gone missing. His family and friends were frantic with worry, but the police seemed stumped. That's when they'd called Line, hoping she could crack the code.

As she walked back to her office, a small, cluttered space above a vintage bookstore, Line's mind was already racing with theories. She had a reputation for being one of the best in the business, and she intended to live up to it.

Over coffee, she pored over the mogul's financial records, looking for any clues that might lead her to his whereabouts. Her eyes scanned the spreadsheets, taking in the intricate web of investments and shell companies. It was like trying to find a needle in a haystack.

Just as she was about to give up, Line spotted something strange - a small transaction that had been made just days before the mogul's disappearance. A single payment to a mysterious recipient, with no explanation or context.

Intrigued, Line pulled out her phone and started digging. She tracked down the recipient, a low-level employee at one of the mogul's companies. Over video call, she pressed for information, but all the employee would say was that they'd been told it was just a "business expense".

Line wasn't convinced. Something didn't add up. She decided to pay a visit to the mogul's office, hoping to find some leads or clues that had been missed.

The office was eerily quiet, with no sign of life. Line moved methodically through the rooms, searching for anything out of place. It was then she stumbled upon an encrypted file on the mogul's computer. With her expertise in hacking, she managed to crack the code, revealing a shocking truth - the mogul had been blackmailing his own employees over some shady business practices.

It seemed the missing tech mogul had been more than just a ruthless businessman. He'd also been involved in something sinister, and Line Roberts was determined to expose him. As she sat at her desk, typing away on her computer, Line couldn't help but feel a thrill of excitement - this case might be the most interesting one yet.
