Line Yan stood at the edge of the city, her eyes scanning the horizon as if searching for something just beyond the reach of the skyscrapers. Her dark hair whipped in the wind, and her bright blue jacket seemed out of place among the urban landscape.

She was a wanderer, a nomad without a fixed address or destination. Line had always felt like she didn't quite fit in anywhere. She was a chameleon, blending into crowds with ease, yet never truly belonging to any group or community.

As she walked, Line's mind wandered back to her childhood. Growing up on the streets of Shanghai, she had learned to rely only on herself. Her parents were dead, and she had been forced to fend for herself from a young age. It was a hard life, but it had also taught her resilience and resourcefulness.

Line's eyes landed on a small park tucked away between two towering buildings. She smiled to herself, remembering the countless hours she had spent there as a child. It was her sanctuary, her place of solace.

She walked into the park, feeling the coolness of the greenery envelop her like a blanket. The sounds of the city receded, and for a moment, Line felt like she was home.

As she sat down on a bench, Line noticed an old man sitting across from her. He was staring intently at her, his eyes piercing behind thick-rimmed glasses. For a moment, they simply looked at each other, a connection forming between them.

"Who are you?" the old man asked finally, his voice low and gravelly.

Line hesitated, unsure of how much to reveal. "Just passing through," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

The old man nodded, as if he understood. "I used to wander too," he said, a hint of sadness in his eyes. "But I found my place here. You might find yours too."

Line looked at the old man, feeling a sense of recognition. Maybe she didn't have to keep moving, maybe she could finally settle down.

For the first time in years, Line felt like she was home. Not because she knew where she was going, but because she knew that for now, this moment was enough. She smiled at the old man, feeling a sense of belonging that she had never known before.
