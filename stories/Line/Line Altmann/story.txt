Line Altmann stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar station. The small town was nestled in the rolling hills of Tuscany, Italy, where she had come to escape the chaos of her past.

As a former CIA operative, Line had seen her fair share of danger and deception. But after a botched mission had left her with PTSD and a deep-seated distrust of everyone around her, she had fled the States and begun anew in Europe.

The train station was quiet, save for the occasional passerby or local who nodded in greeting as they hurried on their way. Line recognized none of them â€“ this was a place where strangers were few and far between.

She made her way to the stationmaster's office, where she had arranged to meet with a contact who claimed to have information about her sister, Emma, who had gone missing years ago. The agency had given up hope of ever finding her, but Line refused to let go of the ghost of their past.

The stationmaster, a stout man with a bushy mustache and a twinkle in his eye, greeted her warmly. "Ah, Line Altmann! I've heard so much about you." He ushered her into the back room, where a young woman sat behind a small desk, fidgeting with a scarf.

"Maria?" Line asked, surprised to see the girl's name matched her own.

The woman nodded hesitantly. "I...I think I have some information about your sister."

Line's heart quickened as Maria handed her a folder filled with cryptic documents and photographs. As she flipped through them, she realized that Maria had stumbled upon something much bigger than just a simple disappearance.

"Who is behind this?" Line demanded, her eyes locked on the woman across from her.

Maria took a deep breath before speaking in a trembling voice. "I...I think it's connected to the same organization your agency thought was dissolved years ago."

Line's mind reeled as she pieced together the fragments of information Maria had shared with her. The game, once again, had begun.
