Line Meyer stepped out of her small café, sipping on the last sip of her morning coffee. The sun was just starting to peek over the sleepy town's rooftops, casting a warm glow over the quaint streets. She took a deep breath, feeling invigorated by the crisp morning air.

As she walked towards her bakery, Line couldn't help but feel a sense of pride. It had been years since she'd opened its doors, and it was now a staple in the community. The smell of freshly baked bread wafted through the air, enticing passersby to come in and try a slice.

Line's eyes twinkled as she thought about the regulars who lined up every morning at 6 am sharp. There was Mrs. Jenkins, who always ordered her signature pastry, the line-of-zebras cake; Jack, who'd been coming for his daily croissant since Line opened the shop; and Emily, a young professional who needed a mid-morning pick-me-up.

The café's cozy atmosphere and Line's warm hospitality made it the perfect spot to catch up with friends or conduct business. She remembered when she first moved to this town from Paris, feeling lost and alone but determined to make a name for herself. The bakery had been her passion project, and now it was more than just a shop – it was a symbol of resilience.

Line pushed open the door, announcing her arrival with a cheerful "Bonjour!" Inside, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the scent of baked goods. Her team of bakers, mostly locals who'd grown up in this town, hummed to themselves as they worked their magic.

As the morning rush subsided, Line took a moment to glance at her reflection in the large windowpane. Her silver hair was tied back in a loose bun, framing her kind face. She wore a faint smudge of flour on her left cheekbone and had a small tattoo of a baking powder canister on her wrist – a memento from her time as an apprentice in Paris.

With a contented sigh, Line began to prep for the day ahead. Orders needed filling, pastries needed decorating, and the café's famous croissants demanded their due attention. She slipped into the rhythm of the bakery once more, ready to face whatever the day had in store.
