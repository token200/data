Line Askarova was a woman of mystery and intrigue, her past shrouded in secrecy. A former KGB agent turned freelance journalist, she had made a name for herself as a fearless and dogged investigator, taking on cases that others deemed too hot to handle.

Her latest assignment had brought her to the gritty streets of Moscow, where whispers of a high-stakes heist had been circulating among the city's underworld. As Line Askarova navigated the crowded marketplaces and dimly lit alleyways, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched.
