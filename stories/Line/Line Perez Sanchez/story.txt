As Line grew older, her passion for music only intensified, leading her to form a band that blended traditional Puerto Rican rhythms with modern styles. The band's popularity soared, and soon they were playing sold-out shows across the island and beyond.

Despite her newfound success, Line remained humble and grounded, crediting her roots and family for inspiring her art. Her abuela, Sofia, had been a major influence on her love of music, teaching her traditional Puerto Rican songs and encouraging her to experiment with new sounds.

In the end, she decided to forge her own path, signing with a local label that allowed her to maintain creative control.

The move paid off in a big way.

Line Perez Sanchez was hailed as a rising star, and her music inspired a new generation of artists from Puerto Rico and beyond.

Through it all, Line remained true to her abuela's words: "La m√∫sica es vida" (Music is life). She continued to write songs that told stories of love, struggle, and resilience, using her platform to amplify the voices of those often overlooked. As La Voz, Line Perez Sanchez had become a beacon of hope and joy, spreading love and unity wherever she went.
