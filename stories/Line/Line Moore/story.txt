Line Moore trudged through the dusty streets of the old town, her boots kicking up clouds of dirt with every step. As a renowned archaeologist, she had spent years searching for the fabled lost city of Zenith, and finally, after decades of searching, she had found it.

Or at least, that's what she thought.

As Line approached the entrance to the ancient city, she felt a shiver run down her spine. Something didn't feel right. The air seemed thick with an almost palpable energy, and the trees surrounding the site seemed to lean in, as if listening to her every move.

She took a deep breath and stepped inside, her eyes adjusting to the dim light within. The city was breathtakingly beautiful, its crumbling spires and temples covered in vines and moss. Line's trained eye picked out the intricate carvings that adorned the walls, telling stories of a long-forgotten civilization.

But as she delved deeper into the city, Line began to feel a creeping sense of unease. She had expected to find artifacts and relics, but instead, she found strange symbols etched into the stone. They seemed to pulse with an otherworldly power, making her skin crawl.

Suddenly, a faint whispering filled her ears, and Line spun around, her heart racing. Where was she? The city seemed to stretch on forever, with no sign of the entrance she had entered by.

She stumbled through the winding streets, desperate to find a way out. But every door she tried led only to more dead ends and twisting corridors. The whispering grew louder, until Line felt like she was being surrounded by unseen voices.

And then, in an instant, everything went silent.

Line found herself standing at the center of the city, face to face with a massive stone statue of the long-lost king of Zenith. Its eyes seemed to bore into her very soul, and for a moment, Line felt like she was staring into the depths of the universe itself.

And then, everything went black.

When Line came to, she was lying in her own bed, back in her office at the museum. The dream had been so vivid, so real, that she couldn't shake the feeling that she had actually been inside Zenith. But as she looked around her familiar surroundings, she knew it was just a dream. Or was it?
