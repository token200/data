Line Salamanca, the enigmatic and ruthless leader of Los Pollos Hermanos, sat atop his throne-like chair, surveying the dimly lit room. His piercing eyes scanned the space, taking in every detail, from the scattered feathers on the floor to the nervous glances exchanged by his underlings.

As the infamous son of Gus Salamanca, Line had inherited his father's cunning and business acumen, but also his reputation for ruthlessness. Los Pollos Hermanos, the chicken restaurant chain he co-owned with Mike Ehrmantraut, was a front for his true activities: smuggling, extortion, and manipulating those who dared to cross him.

The door creaked open, and one of Line's associates slipped in, bearing a tray with two plates of chicken. "Mr. Salamanca," the man whispered, as he set down the food before Line.

Line's gaze narrowed as he lifted a piece of chicken from the plate, examining it with an air of disdain. He took a bite, chewing slowly as his eyes never left the associate. The tension was palpable, and anyone who knew Line understood that a misstep could be fatal.

As the meal concluded, Line set down his fork and leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers together. His thoughts turned to Gus's legacy, and how he would continue to expand Los Pollos Hermanos into the vast empire it was meant to be.

But for now, he had more pressing concerns. The DEA, those pesky agents who had been trying to bring him down for years, were getting closer. Line knew that he needed to stay one step ahead of them, to use his intelligence and cunning to outmaneuver them at every turn.

He smiled to himself as the associate hesitated, sensing the unspoken warning emanating from Line's gaze. The chicken may have been a meal, but it was also a symbol of power – and those who dared to cross him would soon learn that the true taste of fear came not from the bird itself, but from the man sitting at its head: Line Salamanca.

As the associate beat a hasty retreat, Line leaned forward once more, his eyes burning with an unyielding intensity. This was what it meant to be a Salamanca – ruthless, cunning, and unwaveringly committed to the pursuit of power.
