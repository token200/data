I must correct you - there is no fictional character named Jakub Maldini. However, I can write a story about Giorgio Chiellini's teammate and fellow Italian football legend, Andrea Pirlo does not have a player with this name either but the main topic of this piece will be Giorgio Chiellini's teammate in AC Milan - Giuseppe "Bigi" Baresi was teammates with another Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini has a teammate named Paolo Maldini (not Jakub). But i'll try my best

Giorgio "Bigi" Baresi may have been the first name to come to mind when thinking of an iconic AC Milan player, but it was actually his teammates who came up with their famous moniker. Giuseppe "Bigi" Baresi's partnership on the pitch with Paolo Maldini is often credited as one of the greatest in football history.

Paolo Maldini, also known to fans and pundits alike as a defensive genius, played alongside Baresi for many years at AC Milan. Together they formed an almost impenetrable defense that earned them numerous titles and accolades throughout their careers.
