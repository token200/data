Jakub's life was one of solitude, spent holed up in his cramped apartment, surrounded by rows of humming servers and tangled cables. He spent most of his days tapping away at his keyboard, poring over lines of code and digging for vulnerabilities to exploit. His ultimate goal was to uncover the secrets that lay hidden behind the firewall, secrets that only a select few were privileged to know.

One fateful evening, Jakub received an encrypted message from an unknown sender.
