But amidst the excitement, one person caught her eye - a young journalist named Alexei, who was writing a profile on the rising star of Moscow's art world. He was friendly and charming, asking thoughtful questions that showed he had done his research. Jakub Alimbekova found herself opening up to him, sharing stories about her inspirations and struggles as an artist.

As the night drew to a close, Alexei approached Jakub Alimbekova with a smile. "I think I've found my next profile subject," he said, handing her his card.
