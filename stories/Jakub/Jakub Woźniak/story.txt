Jakub Woźniak stepped into the dimly lit café, the sounds of jazz music and gentle chatter filling the air. As a freelance journalist, he had spent countless hours like this one, sipping coffee and listening to sources spill their guts.

A middle-aged man with a bushy beard, Jakub had a reputation for being fiercely impartial and possessing an uncanny ability to get his subjects to open up. His piercing green eyes seemed to bore into those he interviewed, as if daring them to withhold even the smallest detail.

Tonight was no exception. A reclusive businessman, known only by his pseudonym "V" to Jakub, had agreed to meet with him. The article in question revolved around V's alleged involvement in some shady dealings within the city's elite.

As he waited for V to arrive, Jakub sipped on his coffee and surveyed the café. The walls were adorned with eclectic artwork, and a large wooden table dominated one side of the room. It was here that he had spent countless hours interviewing sources, pouring over documents, and scribbling notes.

The door creaked open, and V slid into the chair across from Jakub. His rugged features seemed chiseled out of granite, but his eyes betrayed a hint of nervousness.

"So, V," Jakub began, his voice low and measured, "tell me about this alleged business empire you've been accused of running."

V shifted uncomfortably in his seat, fidgeting with the sleeves of his worn jacket. "I don't know what you're talking about," he muttered.

Jakub leaned forward, his eyes never leaving V's face. "Save it for later, V. We have time. But I need to know: did you ever receive any... gifts from your 'friends' in the city's government?"

V's gaze dropped, and Jakub could almost see the gears turning in his mind as he weighed his options. The silence that followed was heavy with anticipation.

Suddenly, a faint smile crept onto V's face, and he leaned back in his chair. "Alright, alright," he said, his voice tinged with resignation. "Maybe I did receive some... 'incentives.' But I assure you, it was just business as usual."

Jakub nodded thoughtfully, his pen poised over his notebook. The story was unfolding, and he couldn't wait to see where it would lead.

As the night wore on, Jakub extracted more information from V, each revelation shedding a little more light on the city's murky underbelly. When V finally rose to leave, Jakub smiled wryly to himself. Another source had come clean, and another piece of the puzzle was falling into place.
