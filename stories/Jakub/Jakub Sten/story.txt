The other musician listened intently, offering words of encouragement and advice. For a brief moment, Jakub Sten felt like he was back in that small café, where anything seemed possible.

As the night wore on, Jakub Sten finished his coffee and headed out into the chilly Berlin air, feeling invigorated and ready to take on whatever challenges lay ahead.
