Lio Yuji was known for his exceptional eyesight, which had been passed down from her grandmother, a renowned optometrist in their small village. Growing up, Lio Yuji spent countless hours helping her grandmother with patients and learning the intricacies of optometry. As she grew older, Lio Yuji's passion for optics only deepened, and she decided to pursue a career as an eye doctor.

One day, Lio Yuji received an unexpected visit from her grandmother, who had flown all the way from their village to offer her support and guidance. Her grandmother, still known affectionately as Obaachan, was beaming with pride at Lio Yuji's accomplishments. "I always knew you'd follow in my footsteps," she said, as she presented Lio Yuji with a beautifully crafted wooden magnifying glass.

As they sat together in the hospital, Obaachan shared stories of her own experiences as an optometrist and offered words of wisdom to guide Lio Yuji on her journey. "Remember, Lio Yuji, that your eyesight is not just about seeing clearly - it's also about caring for others," she said. Lio Yuji took her grandmother's words to heart, using her exceptional vision to diagnose even the most complex cases.
