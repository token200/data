Lio Koval stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, her eyes scanning the crowded streets for any signs of trouble. As a skilled detective with a sharp mind and quick wit, she had a reputation for solving cases that others deemed unsolvable.

With a flick of her ponytail, Lio pulled out her phone and dialed a number. "Kaito, it's me," she said, her voice low and even. Her partner, Kaito Yamato, answered on the first ring. "What's up?" he asked, his tone relaxed.

"I've got a new lead on the Oniwa case," Lio replied, referring to the string of mysterious robberies that had been plaguing the city for months. "I think I've found a connection between the victims."

Kaito's interest was piqued. "What is it?" he asked, his curiosity getting the better of him.

Lio hesitated, unsure if she should share her theory just yet. But Kaito had a way of knowing when she was on to something big, and she trusted him implicitly. "I think the victims all have one thing in common," she said finally. "A rare tattoo on their wrists."

Kaito whistled low and long. "That's a tough one to crack. Do you have any leads on who might be behind it?"

Lio nodded, even though Kaito couldn't see her. "I've got a few suspects in mind. I'll need your help to track them down."

As they spoke, the alleyway began to clear out, and Lio sensed that she was being watched. She turned to face the shadows, her hand resting on the grip of her gun.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the darkness. "You're looking for answers, Koval," it said, its voice low and menacing.

Lio's eyes narrowed. "Who are you?" she demanded, her gun trained on the stranger.

The figure smiled, revealing sharp teeth. "Someone who knows your secrets, Lio Koval."

With that, the lights went out, and Lio was plunged into darkness. She felt a hand reach out to grab her arm, but it was gone before she could react.

When the lights flickered back on, Lio found herself face to face with an unexpected foe - one who had been hiding in plain sight all along.
