Growing up on the streets of Paris, Lio Moreau had to rely on his cunning and intelligence to survive.

But despite his tough exterior, Lio Moreau's eyes told a different story – they were haunted by memories of abandonment and rejection.

As he made his way up the ranks of professional poker, Lio Moreau had always kept his past private. He preferred to focus on the game, where he could lose himself in the thrill of competition.
