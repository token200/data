One fateful evening, Lio Jian received a visit from the city's wealthy businessman, Richard Lee. His daughter, Sophia, had gone missing, and he suspected foul play. The police were stumped, but Lio Jian was determined to uncover the truth.

As she delved deeper into the case, Lio Jian discovered that Sophia had been involved in a heated dispute with her father over his business dealings.
