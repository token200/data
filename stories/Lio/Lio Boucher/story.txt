Lio Boucher stepped into the crowded café, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a private investigator, he'd grown accustomed to reading people and situations like a book. The faint scent of coffee and stale cigarettes hung in the air, mingling with the hum of hushed conversations.

He spotted her first – a petite woman with long, curly brown hair, sipping on a latte by the window. Her eyes, an unsettling shade of pale blue, locked onto his for a brief moment before darting away. Lio's gut told him she was trouble.

"Lio Boucher," he said, slipping into the booth beside her without permission. She didn't flinch.

"Can I help you?" The woman asked, voice laced with a hint of hostility.

Lio flashed his PI badge. "I'm here about the Wilson case. You're the only witness who's come forward."

The woman snorted. "That was two weeks ago. I've been getting threats ever since."

"I'm listening," Lio said, pulling out his notebook and pen. The curly-haired woman began to recount her story – about a mysterious man who'd approached her outside her apartment building, warning her not to talk.

As she spoke, Lio noticed the faint scratch on her left cheekbone, hidden by her makeup. A hint of fear danced in her eyes when he asked about it. This wasn't just any ordinary witness; this woman was scared – and she was hiding something.

Just then, the café door swung open and a tall, lanky man strode in, his gaze scanning the room until it landed on Lio and the mysterious woman. A flicker of recognition crossed his face before he quickly looked away.

Lio's instincts told him this guy was connected to the Wilson case. He leaned forward, pen poised over his notebook. "Tell me more about this man," he said, eyes locked onto the suspect's retreating back.

The curly-haired woman hesitated before speaking up again – her voice now laced with a quiet determination. "He was tall, around six-four... with piercing green eyes and an accent that sounded like it came from nowhere. But what really caught my attention was when he said his name was... was Lucas."

Lio's ears perked up at the mention of Lucas. He scribbled down some notes, a plan forming in his mind as the café patrons continued to chatter around them. This case just got a lot more interesting – and personal.
