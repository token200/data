Lio Esposito sat at his desk, staring blankly at the computer screen in front of him. As the CEO of NovaTech, he was used to being in control, but lately, it seemed like everything was spiraling out of control.

Just a few months ago, Lio had been on top of the world. His company's new AI-powered marketing platform had revolutionized the industry, and he was hailed as a visionary. But now, with the platform experiencing a series of embarrassing glitches and customer complaints pouring in, Lio couldn't shake off the feeling that he'd made a catastrophic mistake.

As he scrolled through the company's social media feeds, he saw a string of negative reviews and comments from customers who claimed that the AI had failed them. Some had lost business, while others had seen their profits dwindle. The backlash was starting to take its toll on Lio's reputation.

Just then, his assistant walked in with a cup of coffee and a concerned expression. "Lio, I need to talk to you about something," she said.

"What is it?" Lio asked, taking the cup from her hand.

"It's the new product development team," she replied. "They're asking for more resources and funding to fix the AI platform."

Lio groaned inwardly. He knew that this was exactly what he didn't need right now. More money, more personnel... it all just seemed like a drop in the ocean compared to the millions of dollars in damage that the AI had already caused.

But as he looked at his assistant's worried face, something inside Lio shifted. Maybe it was guilt, maybe it was exhaustion, but whatever it was, he knew he couldn't keep running from this anymore.

"Lio?" his assistant asked again, sensing his unease.

"Yeah," he said finally, taking a deep breath. "Tell them I'll talk to the board about allocating more funds. But I want you to tell them that we're also going to be re-evaluating our entire approach to AI development."

His assistant nodded, looking relieved. "I'll take care of it, Lio."

Lio leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes, letting out a weary sigh. Maybe this was the start of something new for him - a chance to fix the mess he'd made and rebuild NovaTech from scratch.

But as he opened his eyes again, a hint of determination flickered to life within him. This time, it wouldn't be just about saving face or maintaining public image; this time, it would be about doing what was right.
