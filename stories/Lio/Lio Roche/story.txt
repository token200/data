Lio Roche stepped out of the misty morning air and into the dimly lit jazz club, his eyes scanning the room for the familiar figure that awaited him. The music pulsed through his veins like lifeblood as he made his way to the bar, where Ruby waited with a knowing smile.

"Lion's Den, huh?" she whispered, handing him a whiskey-frothed glass. "You know the owner's got a proposition for you tonight."

Lio took a sip of the amber liquid, feeling it warm his chest. He was no stranger to Ruby's whispers and hints – she'd been his confidante since he first set foot in this very club.

As he made his way towards the stage, where Django McSweeney's guitar strings seemed to weep with melancholy, Lio's thoughts turned to his latest obsession: unraveling the mystery of the Red Hand. Whispers spoke of a clandestine society that lurked just beneath the city's surface, their symbol hidden in plain sight.

A whispered promise from Ruby had drawn him back to this club tonight – an invitation to meet with McSweeney himself, who claimed he'd stumbled upon something big.

As Lio approached the stage, a figure emerged from the shadows. McSweeney's eyes locked onto his, and for a moment, they were lost in a world of shared secrets.

"Ah, Roche," the old man said, his voice like worn velvet. "I've been waiting for you."

Lio slid onto a stool beside him, feeling the whiskey burn in his gut as he leaned in to hear McSweeney's tale. The Red Hand, it seemed, was more than just a myth – and its existence threatened to upend everything Lio thought he knew about this city.

The music swirled around them like a tempest, but Lio's mind was already racing with the implications. Ruby's whisper had been right; tonight was just the beginning of something big. And as he listened to McSweeney spin his yarn, Lio felt the Red Hand's presence spreading its dark tendrils across his chest – a symbol of intrigue and danger that would soon become his own.

With every note Django played, Lio Roche knew that he'd stepped into something much bigger than himself. The Red Hand was coming for him, and he was ready to follow it down the rabbit hole.
