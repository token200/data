Lio García Márquez, the enigmatic and charismatic lead singer of the Argentine rock band "Los Frenéticos", was known for his electrifying performances on stage. With his wild mane of curly hair and piercing green eyes, he commanded attention like a magnet.

Born in the vibrant streets of Buenos Aires, Lio grew up surrounded by the city's rich musical heritage. His father, a renowned guitarist, taught him how to play from a young age, and it wasn't long before Lio began writing his own songs.

But Lio's most enduring legacy might be the song he wrote for his mother, who had passed away when he was just a teenager. Titled "Alas de Luna", it spoke of love and loss in hauntingly beautiful terms. The song became an anthem for those who had lost their loved ones too soon, and its impact can still be felt today.
