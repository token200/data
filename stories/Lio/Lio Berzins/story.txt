Lio Berzins was no stranger to the bustling streets of Riga, Latvia's capital city. As a freelance journalist, she had spent years honing her craft, reporting on everything from local politics to underground art scenes. Her sharp wit and quick thinking had earned her a reputation as one of the city's most fearless and respected voices.

One drizzly evening, Lio received an anonymous tip about a potential story – a mysterious auction house rumored to be selling off some of Riga's most valuable artifacts at rock-bottom prices. Intrigued, she tracked down the address of the auction house and arrived just as the doors were opening for the final viewing.

As she scanned the room, Lio spotted a peculiar figure lingering near the back – an elderly man with piercing blue eyes that seemed to bore into her very soul. He was dressed in tattered velvet suits and carried himself with an air of quiet confidence. Lio's journalist instincts told her he was worth investigating further.

She sidled up to him, introduced herself as Lio Berzins, and asked about his interest in the auction. The old man smiled enigmatically before revealing that he had once been a curator at Riga's national museum – a post he'd left under mysterious circumstances several years prior. His eyes locked onto hers once more, and for an instant, Lio swore she saw a glimmer of sadness behind them.

"What happened to the artifacts?" she asked, her curiosity piqued.

The old man leaned in closer, his voice barely above a whisper. "Some were stolen, others lost in the chaos. But one piece remains – a fragment of Riga's history, hidden away for safekeeping." His gaze drifted around the room once more before returning to Lio Berzins.

"You have a nose for this sort of thing," he said, his tone tinged with approval. "I think we might need to talk further."
