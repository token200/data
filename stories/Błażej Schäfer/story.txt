Błażej Schäfer sat alone at his kitchen table, sipping a cold beer as he stared out the window. It had been months since the accident, and yet the memories still lingered, like an open wound that refused to heal.

As a former hitman for the Polish mafia, Błażej's life was one of violence and deception. He had been born into the world of crime, with no other options than to follow in his father's footsteps. But after a job went sour, he found himself facing a price on his head, forced to go into hiding.

Now, at 35, Błażej was trying to leave that life behind. He had fled Poland and started fresh in Berlin, working as a freelance writer and translator. It was a far cry from the world he once knew, but it was better than being on the run all the time.

As he gazed out the window, his mind began to wander back to those fateful days. The streets of Warsaw still haunted him, the faces of the men he had killed etched into his memory like scars. He thought about his family, his parents and siblings who had been left behind when he disappeared.

Błażej's phone rang, shattering the silence. It was a number he didn't recognize, but something told him to answer. "Hello?" he said warily.

"Zbigniew," a low voice replied. "It's been a while."

Błażej's heart skipped a beat as he recognized the name of his former handler. What did Zbigniew want? Had he tracked Błażej down after all?

"I've come to offer you a deal, Błażej," Zbigniew said, his voice dripping with menace. "Leave your past life behind and return to us. We can make it worth your while."

Błażej knew better than to trust Zbigniew again. But there was something in the man's tone that made him hesitate. Was it desperation? Or just a cunning calculation?

"I'm not interested," Błażej said finally, trying to sound firmer than he felt.

Zbigniew chuckled, a cold, mirthless sound. "We'll see about that, Błażej. You have something we need. Something that will bring you...recognition."

Błażej's eyes narrowed as the words hung in the air like a challenge. What did Zbigniew want from him? And what was this recognition he spoke of?

The phone call ended abruptly, leaving Błażej feeling more uncertain than ever. He set his beer down and stood up, pacing around the kitchen table as he tried to make sense of it all.

One thing was for sure: Błażej Schäfer would not go back to that life without a fight. Not yet, anyway.
