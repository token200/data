I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Kārlis Kalniņa. It's possible that this character is not well-known or does not exist in literature or popular culture.

However, I can create a story about a fictional character with the name Kārlis Kalniņa. Here it is:

Kārlis Kalniņa was a Latvian folk hero from the small village of Valmiera. He lived during the 19th century, a time of great change and upheaval in Latvia. Kārlis was known for his exceptional bravery and kindness, qualities that earned him the respect and admiration of his community.

As a young man, Kārlis worked as a blacksmith, but he spent most of his free time helping those in need. He would often travel to neighboring villages to lend a hand with harvesting or repair tools, earning himself a reputation as a kind and generous soul.

One winter's evening, disaster struck when a fierce storm hit Valmiera, knocking out the village's only water source. The villagers were in dire need of water, but Kārlis knew that without it, their crops would surely fail. Without hesitation, he set out into the raging storm to find an alternative.

Using his knowledge of the forest and his physical strength, Kārlis discovered a hidden spring deep within the woods. He worked tirelessly through the night to build a makeshift pipe system, bringing fresh water back to the village.

The next morning, the villagers were amazed to see their homes filled with crystal-clear water. Word spread quickly about Kārlis's bravery and ingenuity, earning him the nickname "Water Carrier of Valmiera". From that day on, he was revered as a hero in his community, known for his selflessness and determination.

Years went by, and Kārlis continued to serve his village, always ready to lend a hand whenever needed. As he grew older, he passed down the story of how he saved the water source to his children and grandchildren, ensuring that his legacy would live on forever.

To this day, people in Valmiera still talk about Kārlis Kalniņa, the unsung hero who brought life-giving water to their village during a time of great need.
