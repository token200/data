Kārlis Saldaña was a man with a passion for woodworking. Growing up in a small town nestled in the heart of Latvia, he spent most of his childhood watching his grandfather work on his latest project. The smell of sawdust and wood shavings became synonymous with memories of warm summer afternoons and lazy Sundays spent by the lake.

As Kārlis Saldaña grew older, so did his fascination with woodworking. He would spend hours poring over books and online tutorials, teaching himself new techniques and experimenting with different materials.

Kārlis Saldaña was thrilled at the opportunity. He spent weeks researching different styles and designs before settling on a beautiful, hand-carved letter "K" that would adorn the bakery's storefront.
