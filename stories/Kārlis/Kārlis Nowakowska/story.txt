In the quaint town of Tbilisi, Georgia, there lived a young artist named Kārlis Nowakowska. Her Polish surname and Lithuanian first name were a unique blend that often raised eyebrows among the locals. Yet, Kārlis's vibrant spirit and passion for art had won over the hearts of everyone she met.

As a child, Kārlis would spend hours exploring the winding streets of Tbilisi, collecting paint-splattered canvases from abandoned buildings and converting them into her own masterpieces. Her parents, though confused by their daughter's creative endeavors, encouraged her to pursue her dreams.

Years went by, and Kārlis Nowakowska grew into a talented painter, her works reflecting the stark beauty of Georgia's mountains and valleys. She would often take long walks along the Aragvi River, capturing its tranquil essence on canvas. The villagers would remark on how the river seemed to come alive through her art, as if Kārlis had somehow bottled its soul.

One day, a prominent art critic from Warsaw stumbled upon one of Kārlis's exhibitions in Tbilisi. Enchanted by her bold strokes and vivid colors, he offered her a prestigious residency in Krakow. Overjoyed, Kārlis Nowakowska accepted the opportunity to showcase her talents to a broader audience.

As she prepared for her departure, Kārlis's parents presented her with a small, intricately carved wooden box adorned with traditional Lithuanian patterns. "For your travels and creativity," they said, their eyes shining with pride. Inside the box lay a note with a cryptic message: "Follow your heart, just as you followed the Aragvi."

Kārlis Nowakowska set off for Krakow, her wooden box securely in hand. As she settled into her new studio, she felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude toward her parents and the town that had nurtured her artistry. In the weeks that followed, Kārlis's paintings took on a new depth, as if infused with the spirit of her ancestors and the beauty of the Caucasus region.

Years later, when people asked about Kārlis Nowakowska, they would speak in hushed tones of the enigmatic artist whose works seemed to transcend borders and cultures. They would recall the wooden box that had set her on her journey and the haunting message etched within – a testament to the enduring power of family, tradition, and creativity.
