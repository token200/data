Yves Kortajarena stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station. As he waited for his connection, he checked his watch for what felt like the hundredth time. He was running late, and he knew that his agent would not be pleased.

As a struggling model, Yves Kortajarena had learned to adapt to the unpredictable nature of his career. One day he'd be booked for a high-profile campaign, and the next, he'd be waiting tables to make ends meet. But he never gave up, always believing that his big break was just around the corner.

As he made his way through the crowded station, Yves Kortajarena's mind began to wander. He thought about his childhood in Barcelona, where he first discovered his passion for modeling. His mother had encouraged him to pursue his dreams, even when it seemed like a pipe dream.

The train finally arrived, and Yves Kortajarena quickly boarded the next one, relieved to be on his way to his appointment. As he settled into his seat, he pulled out his phone and texted his agent, apologizing for being late.

"Sorry, sorry," he typed. "I'll be there as soon as I can."

His agent responded immediately, telling him that the client was getting impatient. Yves Kortajarena took a deep breath and focused on the task at hand. He had come too far to let a little setback like this get in his way.

As the train pulled into the station, Yves Kortajarena gathered his things and stepped off onto the platform once again. This time, he was greeted by the familiar face of his agent, who handed him a business card with a stern expression.

"Good luck, Yves," she said. "You're going to need it."

Yves Kortajarena smiled wryly and tucked the card into his pocket. He knew that this could be his big break, and he was determined to make the most of it. With renewed determination, he set off towards the waiting client, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.

As he walked through the door, Yves Kortajarena took a deep breath and introduced himself to the client, his confidence and poise evident in every gesture. This could be it, he thought. This could be the moment that changed everything.
