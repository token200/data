Elli Gupta was a brilliant and feisty astrophysicist who had always been fascinated by the mysteries of the universe. Growing up in Mumbai, India, she would often spend hours gazing up at the stars, wondering what secrets lay beyond the Earth's atmosphere.

As she grew older, Elli's passion for astronomy only intensified, leading her to pursue a career as a researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Her groundbreaking work on exoplanetary atmospheres had earned her numerous accolades, including a prestigious fellowship from the Indian government.

But despite her professional success, Elli's personal life was far from perfect. She had been in a long-term relationship with her colleague, Rohan, who had recently left her for another woman. Elli was heartbroken, and her usual boundless energy had begun to flag.

One day, while working late in the lab, Elli received an unexpected visit from her grandmother, Maaji. The elderly woman had always been a source of comfort and wisdom for Elli, and she knew that Maaji would have some words of encouragement.

"Beta," Maaji said, using the affectionate term for "child," "you are like a shooting star - bright, fiery, and full of potential. But you must remember to shine your light in all directions, not just on one particular path."

Elli was taken aback by her grandmother's words. She had always assumed that she would find love with Rohan, but now it seemed that Maaji was suggesting that she explore other options.

As the days went by, Elli began to reconnect with old friends and colleagues from her hometown in Mumbai. She started volunteering at a local astronomy club, teaching aspiring stargazers about the wonders of the universe.

One evening, while leading a workshop on planetary orbits, Elli met a charming and talented young astronomer named Kunal. He was passionate about space exploration and had a quick wit that made Elli laugh out loud.

As they talked, Elli found herself opening up to Kunal in ways she never thought possible. She shared her research, her fears, and her dreams with him, feeling a sense of connection that went beyond mere conversation.

For the first time since Rohan's departure, Elli felt like she was shining her light again - brighter than ever before. Maaji had been right all along: she didn't need to limit herself to one particular path; the universe was vast and full of possibilities.

As the night drew to a close, Elli and Kunal exchanged numbers, their hearts racing with excitement for what lay ahead. The stars seemed to twinkle in approval as they parted ways, the promise of new beginnings twinkling like diamonds on the horizon.
