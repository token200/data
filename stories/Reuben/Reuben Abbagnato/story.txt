Reuben Abbagnato was a man with a passion for collecting rare and unusual things. He spent most of his days scouring antique shops, flea markets, and online forums in search of that next big find. His friends and family often joked that he had a sixth sense for sniffing out hidden gems.

One day, while browsing through a dusty old vintage shop, Reuben stumbled upon an intriguing item: a vintage pocket watch with intricate engravings on the case. As soon as he held it in his hands, he knew he had to have it. The shop owner, noticing Reuben's excitement, revealed that the watch had once belonged to a prominent explorer who had traveled extensively throughout Africa.

Intrigued by the story behind the watch, Reuben carefully took it home and began researching its history. He spent hours pouring over dusty tomes in the library, speaking with local historians, and scouring online forums for any mention of the explorer or the watch itself. It wasn't long before he discovered that the explorer had been on a ill-fated expedition to find the lost city of Zerzura.

Reuben's curiosity was piqued. He became obsessed with finding out more about the watch, the explorer, and the lost city itself. He spent every waking moment reading, researching, and planning his next move. His friends and family grew concerned for his well-being, but Reuben couldn't help himself – he was on a mission.

Weeks turned into months, and Reuben's obsession only grew stronger. Finally, after months of tireless searching, he received an invitation to join a group of explorers who were leading an expedition to Egypt in search of the lost city itself. With the vintage pocket watch safely tucked away in his pocket, Reuben set off on the adventure of a lifetime.

As he stood at the edge of the Sahara desert, surrounded by sand dunes and dusty tombs, Reuben felt a thrill of excitement course through his veins. He knew that this was it – this was the moment he had been searching for all these years. The lost city of Zerzura beckoned, and with the vintage pocket watch safely in hand, Reuben was ready to face whatever lay ahead.
