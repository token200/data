Reuben Wei-lun was a man shrouded in mystery, with an air of quiet confidence that commanded attention without seeking it. A master of disguise and deception, he had built a reputation as one of the most elusive con artists of his time.

Born to a poor family in a bustling street market, Reuben had learned early on how to survive by wit and cunning. He honed his skills as a child, swindling vendors with clever tricks and charming passersby into buying his wares. As he grew older, his talents attracted the attention of a local gangster, who took Reuben under his wing and taught him the art of manipulation.

Years passed, and Reuben Wei-lun became a master of reinvention. He shed identities like skin, taking on new personas to suit each new opportunity. A wealthy businessman in Paris one day, a charming socialite in New York the next – wherever he went, Reuben was always one step ahead of his marks.

But with great skill comes great vulnerability. Reuben's greatest fear was being discovered, exposed for the charlatan he had become. He knew that if word got out about his true nature, his reputation would be ruined and his life would be forfeit.

One night, in a high-stakes game of poker, Reuben Wei-lun played against a man who seemed to know him better than himself. The stakes were high, but Reuben's confidence never wavered – until he caught the gaze of his opponent, a piercing green that saw right through the layers of deception.

For an instant, Reuben felt exposed. He thought of all the faces he had worn, all the lives he had touched with false sincerity. In that moment, he knew he was living on borrowed time.

But Reuben Wei-lun was no fool. He laughed, a cold, calculated sound, and continued to play. The game was far from over – and only one player would emerge victorious.
