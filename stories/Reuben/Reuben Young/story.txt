Reuben Young stepped into the dimly lit jazz club, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. He spotted Emma, an old friend from college, sitting alone at the bar. She raised her glass in a silent toast as he made his way over.

"Emma, what brings you here?" Reuben asked, taking a seat beside her.

"I'm on a solo trip," Emma replied. "Needed to get out of the city for a bit."

Reuben nodded sympathetically. He knew how hard it was to balance work and personal life. As he sipped his drink, he couldn't help but think about his own recent struggles with anxiety.

Just then, a saxophone wailed through the club's speakers, drawing Reuben in. He closed his eyes, letting the melancholy notes wash over him. Emma noticed his reaction and smiled knowingly.

"Ah, my favorite musician," she said. "Benjamin Harrison, the soul of this city."

Reuben opened his eyes, a hint of a smile on his face. Benjamin was indeed one of the most talented musicians in town, with a voice that could evoke both sorrow and joy.

As they listened to the music together, Reuben felt a sense of peace wash over him. It was as if all his worries had melted away, replaced by the haunting melodies and soulful lyrics.

After the set ended, Emma turned to Reuben and asked, "Want to grab dinner somewhere? I'm buying."

Reuben agreed, grateful for the offer. As they left the club, he felt rejuvenated, thanks to the soothing sounds of Benjamin Harrison's music. Being with Emma made him realize that sometimes, all it takes is a friend – or some great music – to soothe the soul.

Over dinner, they chatted about everything from their jobs to their families. Reuben Young found himself feeling more at ease, his mind no longer racing with anxiety. He was grateful for this small moment of respite, and he knew that the friendship between him and Emma would endure long after this night was over.
