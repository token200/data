Reuben Bektemirova stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the desolate landscape. She had been traveling for days, fleeing the confines of her past life in the city. The small town of Ravenswood was her destination, a place she had heard whispered about in hushed tones by her friends back home.

As she made her way through the station, Reuben's thoughts turned to the letter that had set her on this journey. It was from an old flame, one who had managed to track her down after all these years. The words still lingered in her mind: "I know what you did, Reuben Bektemirova. I know it wasn't your fault."

Reuben shivered, despite the warmth of the summer evening. She had thought she'd left that part of her life behind, but it seemed that no matter how hard she tried to move on, it followed her like a shadow.

She hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of the small boarding house where she was staying. As they drove through the town's main street, Reuben caught glimpses of the locals watching her from their doorsteps. They whispered to each other, their eyes filled with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion.

When the taxi finally dropped her off, Reuben trudged up the path to the boarding house, her suitcase in tow. The owner, a kind-hearted woman named Mrs. Jenkins, welcomed her with a warm smile and a cup of tea.

As Reuben settled into her new room, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. She glanced around the small space, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Still, the sensation lingered, making her skin prickle with unease.

Reuben Bektemirova took a deep breath and tried to focus on the present. She had come to Ravenswood seeking refuge, not drama. She was determined to rebuild her life, free from the ghosts of her past.

But as she lay in bed that night, listening to the creaks and groans of the old house, Reuben couldn't help but wonder if she'd truly left her troubles behind. Or were they just waiting for her, patiently biding their time until she let her guard down once more?
