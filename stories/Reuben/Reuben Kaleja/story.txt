Reuben Kaleja stepped into the dimly lit bar, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. As a renowned journalist, he had heard whispers that a valuable source was going to be present tonight. The bartender, noticing Reuben's interest, subtly nodded towards the back corner of the room.

Reuben made his way over, weaving through the crowded space with ease. He spotted the individual and began to make his way over. It was one of the most influential figures in the city's underworld – Ivan Petrov.

Ivan's reputation as a ruthless businessman had preceded him, but Reuben Kaleja had always been drawn to the truth. He slid into the chair across from Ivan and ordered a whiskey on the rocks.

"I hear you have some information I might be interested in," Reuben said, his voice low and even.

Ivan raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the journalist's forwardness. "What makes you think that?"

Reuben leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers together. "Let's just say I've heard rumors of a major scandal brewing. One that could bring down entire corporations."

Ivan snorted, but Reuben could see the faintest glimmer of interest in his eyes.

"I'll tell you what," Ivan said finally, pulling out a small notebook from his pocket. "I have access to some... sensitive information. But it's not going anywhere unless you agree to one condition: you must promise me absolute discretion."

Reuben hesitated for a moment before nodding. He knew that with this story, he would be sitting on top of the world. And Ivan Petrov was willing to share his secrets – at least for now.

As Reuben Kaleja left the bar with Ivan's notebook clutched tightly in his hand, he couldn't help but feel a thrill of excitement. This could be the biggest story of his career – and he had the inside track.
