Reuben Muti trudged through the dusty streets of Soweto, his eyes scanning the crowded market for anything that might bring him some change. As a young boy from one of Johannesburg's poorer neighborhoods, he had grown accustomed to making do with little.

Reuben Muti's father had always worked tirelessly as a laborer on the local farms, but after a long illness, he was no longer able to provide for his family. Reuben Muti took it upon himself to help support his mother and younger sister by selling his own wares - hand-carved wooden figurines, crafted with precision from scraps of wood he had found in the trash.

As he navigated through the stalls, Reuben Muti's skilled hands moved quickly as he arranged a small display of his figurines. He had sold some to local children for pennies before, but today he was hoping to sell more - at least enough to buy himself a ticket onto a train to Cape Town, where his older brother worked.

Reuben Muti spotted an old acquaintance, Thembi, hawking his own goods on the side of the road. Thembi's vendor stall was adorned with colorful fabrics and glittering trinkets, but Reuben Muti knew that beneath the glitz lay a shrewd business deal waiting to happen. He approached Thembi and asked if he might join him for a day, hoping to learn some new tricks.

Thembi agreed, and soon Reuben Muti found himself immersed in the art of selling everything from shiny keychains to intricately woven baskets. As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the dusty market square, Reuben Muti tallied his earnings - not enough to afford a ticket to Cape Town just yet, but enough to keep his family fed for another day.

As he packed up his meager wares and said goodbye to Thembi, Reuben Muti felt a spark of determination ignite within him. He knew that one day he would rise above the struggles of his past and make a better life for himself - and his mother, and sister. And with each small success, he grew closer to realizing that dream.
