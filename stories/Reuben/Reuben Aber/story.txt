Reuben Aber stepped off the crowded train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the familiar surroundings. It had been five years since he'd last set foot in Ravenswood, and yet the air still carried the same hint of smoke and decay that lingered over the town like a shroud.

Aber's thoughts were elsewhere, though - on the letter that had arrived just a week ago, inviting him back to the place where it all started. He'd been running for years, ever since the accident that had taken his brother's life and left Aber with scars both physical and emotional.

He made his way through the deserted streets, the only sound being the crunch of gravel beneath his feet. As he walked, the shadows seemed to lengthen, casting an eerie glow over everything. It was as if Ravenswood itself was watching him, waiting to see what he'd do next.

Aber stopped outside the old café where he used to work, the same place where his brother had died. The sign creaked in the wind, reading "Sam's Café" in faded letters. Aber smiled wryly - it had been Sam's for years now, a constant reminder of what he'd lost.

He pushed open the door and stepped inside, the bell above it letting out a tired clang. The café was empty, except for one figure sitting at the counter - an old man with a weathered face and eyes that seemed to see right through him.

"Reuben," the old man said, his voice like sandpaper on wood. "Welcome back."

Aber's instincts prickled, but he took a seat next to the old man, ordering a cup of coffee from the worn machine in the corner. The old man didn't speak again, simply watching Aber with an unblinking gaze that made him feel like a specimen under a microscope.

As the minutes ticked by, Aber began to feel a sense of unease creeping over him - as if Ravenswood itself was trying to tell him something, but he couldn't quite hear it. He sipped his coffee, the bitter taste burning its way down his throat, and wondered what secrets the town had in store for him this time around.

It wasn't long before Aber left the café, the old man's words echoing in his mind like a challenge - or a warning. Whatever lay ahead, Aber was ready to face it head-on, to confront the demons that had haunted him for so long. The question was, would Ravenswood itself be willing to let him go?
