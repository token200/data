Despite his tough exterior, Reuben had a soft spot for those in need. He was always willing to lend a helping hand, whether it was volunteering at local charities or visiting families who had lost loved ones to conflict.

As he sat with Amira and her family, listening to their stories and sharing in their joy, Reuben knew that this was what being a journalist was all about.
