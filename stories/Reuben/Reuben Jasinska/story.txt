Reuben Jasinska stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. It was here that he had agreed to meet with an old acquaintance, one who claimed to have information about his past. Reuben, a private investigator by trade, had always been drawn to mysteries and unsolved cases. His full name, Reuben Jasinska, seemed fitting for someone who delved into the unknown.

As he waited, sipping on a black coffee, the door swung open and a woman with piercing green eyes walked in. She was dressed in a long coat, her dark hair pulled back beneath a wide-brimmed hat. Reuben's instincts told him she was hiding something, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it.

"Reuben Jasinska," she said, her voice husky and confident, as she slid into the booth across from him. "It's been too long."

Reuben raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. "And who might you be?" he asked, his tone neutral.

The woman smiled, revealing a small scar above her left lip. "I'm someone who knows your full name, Reuben Jasinska," she said, her eyes glinting in the dim light. "Someone who's been watching you from afar."

Reuben's grip on his coffee cup tightened. He didn't like being watched, especially not by strangers. But there was something about this woman that put him at ease, a sense of calm that he couldn't quite explain.

"I'm listening," he said finally, leaning back in his chair.

The woman pulled out a small folder from her coat pocket and slid it across the table to Reuben. As he opened it, a wave of memories washed over him – memories he had thought were long buried. Memories of his childhood, of his parents, of the life he had left behind.

Reuben's eyes met the woman's, and for a moment, they just stared at each other, the only sound the soft hum of the café's espresso machine. Then, with a nod, Reuben began to read, his full name Reuben Jasinska echoing through his mind like a mantra as he delved into the secrets that lay within the folder.
