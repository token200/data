Reuben James Hughes was a man with a passion for photography that rivaled his love for adventure. As a travel photographer, he had spent years capturing breathtaking landscapes and moments of beauty from all corners of the globe. His latest project, however, would prove to be his most ambitious yet.

Reuben's fascination with the ancient city of Petra began when he stumbled upon an old photograph in a dusty archive room. The faded image showed a majestic temple, surrounded by towering sandstone cliffs, its entrance guarded by two imposing stone statues. Entranced, Reuben had spent years tracking down the original photographer and, eventually, securing permission to recreate the shot.

He arrived in Jordan just as the winter solstice was approaching, and with it, the annual celebration of Al-Karamah. Reuben was determined to capture the perfect moment – the moment when the temple's facade would be bathed in a warm golden light, as if by divine intervention.

As he set up his camera equipment, Reuben couldn't help but think about how far he'd come. From his humble beginnings as a street photographer in Sydney to becoming one of Australia's most respected documentary photographers, it had been a wild ride. His work had taken him from the red deserts of Uluru to the bustling streets of Tokyo, always chasing the next great story.

The day of the solstice arrived, and Reuben was up before dawn, camera at the ready. As the sun slowly rose over the temple, casting its golden light across the sandstone cliffs, he snapped away with precision and patience. The air was electric with anticipation – the Al-Karamah celebration had just begun.

In those fleeting moments, Reuben's skills were stretched to their limits. He navigated treacherous terrain, dodged wayward camels, and captured the moment when a group of children danced into the temple, their footsteps echoing through the stillness. The image he took – a frozen snapshot of joy and wonder – would become one of his most iconic works.

As Reuben packed up his gear, weary but exhilarated, he couldn't help but smile. This was what it meant to be a photographer: chasing the sun, capturing the beauty of the world, and leaving behind a piece of yourself with every frame. And for Reuben James Hughes, that was a feeling unlike any other.
