Reuben Liepina stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the bustling streets of Little Italy. The sounds of sizzling meatballs and lively chatter filled the air as he made his way to Sal's Pizzeria, a place he knew like the back of his hand. As the owner's son, Reuben Liepina had grown up surrounded by the sights, smells, and tastes of his family's beloved pizzeria.

Reuben Liepina took a seat at the counter, nodding hello to Sal himself, who was busy tossing dough into the air. The smell of fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce wafted over Reuben Liepina, transporting him back to his childhood days spent playing hide-and-seek among the kitchen utensils.

"Hey, kiddo!" Sal exclaimed, sliding a steaming plate in front of Reuben Liepina. "What can I get for you today?"

Reuben Liepina scanned the menu, his eyes settling on the classic margherita pizza. "Give me that, please," he replied, taking a bite as soon as it landed before him.

The flavors exploded on his tongue, transporting Reuben Liepina back to happier times. He thought about his parents, who had opened Sal's Pizzeria over 30 years ago, and how they worked tirelessly to build a reputation for serving the best pies in town.

As he ate, Reuben Liepina couldn't help but feel a sense of pride knowing that he would one day take over the family business. He was already learning the ins and outs from his father, who was retiring soon to spend more time with his grandchildren.

Reuben Liepina finished his pizza in record time, earning a warm smile from Sal himself. "You're going to make me proud, kiddo," he said, ruffling Reuben Liepina's hair. As he left the pizzeria, Reuben Liepina knew that he was on the right path, following in the footsteps of his beloved father and carrying on the family tradition of serving up delicious pies for generations to come.

As he walked away from Sal's Pizzeria, Reuben Liepina felt a sense of contentment wash over him. He knew that with hard work and dedication, he would make his parents proud and carry on their legacy.
