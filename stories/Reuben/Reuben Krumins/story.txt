One sunny afternoon, Reuben received a visit from the mayor's office. They were stumped by a string of high-profile burglaries, with each thief leaving behind no discernible evidence. The police department was at a loss, and it fell to Reuben Krumins to crack the case.

With his trusty magnifying glass in hand, Reuben set out to survey the scene of the latest burglary. He examined every inch of the crime scene, taking meticulous notes and photographs. As he worked, he muttered to himself, "Ah-ha! Now, let's see how this fits into the overall puzzle..."
