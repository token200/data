Siegbert Esquivel was a man with an uncommon passion - collecting antique door knobs. He spent most of his days scouring flea markets, antique shops, and dusty attics for the perfect addition to his collection.

Born in the heart of Mexico City, Siegbert's love affair with door knobs began when he stumbled upon an intricately carved Victorian-era handle at a family gathering. The delicate design and weight of the metal sparked something within him, setting off a lifelong pursuit to gather every style, shape, and material he could find.

As his collection grew, so did his reputation. People from all over Mexico would seek out Siegbert's expertise on antique door hardware, often trading in their own dusty finds for a glimpse into his vast library of doors. His obsession was contagious, drawing in collectors who appreciated the simple beauty of an expertly crafted handle.

Despite his passion, Siegbert's life remained humble. He lived in a modest apartment above his family's small shop in the historic center of Mexico City, where he spent most mornings examining door knobs with his father, learning about their history and craftsmanship. The old man would point out intricate details, such as the maker's mark or the subtle signs of wear that revealed an item's age.

On weekends, Siegbert ventured into the city's bustling markets to search for rare finds. He'd lose hours haggling with vendors, each trying to convince him that their door knob was worth more than it seemed. His wit and charm won over many an opponent, earning him a reputation as the go-to expert on all things door-related.

One rainy afternoon, Siegbert received an urgent call from an old friend, boasting about his latest find - a set of exquisite, Art Nouveau-inspired door handles hidden away in the dusty recesses of a remote hacienda. With the rain pounding outside, Siegbert and his father rushed to join the hunt, driven by the promise of adding to their collection and solving another piece of Mexico's history.

As they arrived at the hacienda, Siegbert felt a rush of excitement coursing through him - the thrill of discovery was about to come true. And as he reached out to grasp the first handle, it clicked: this was more than just a door knob; it was a window into the past, telling stories of those who had used them before.

In that moment, Siegbert knew that his life's work wasn't just about collecting door knobs - it was about uncovering secrets hidden in plain sight.
