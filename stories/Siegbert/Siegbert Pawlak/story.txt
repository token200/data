As he grew older, Siegbert's fascination with the world around him only deepened, driving him to explore every nook and cranny of Ravensburg. He spent countless hours pouring over dusty tomes in the town library, devouring tales of ancient civilizations and forgotten lore.

Despite his passion for learning, Siegbert's life took an unexpected turn when he stumbled upon a cryptic message etched into the walls of an abandoned windmill on the outskirts of town.

As the sun began to set on a particularly grueling day, Siegbert stumbled upon an ancient clearing, its center dominated by a massive stone monolith. Etched into the surface of the rock was a single word: "Keystone." Siegbert's heart racing with excitement, he reached out a trembling hand and touched the ancient symbol.
