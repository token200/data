Siegbert Korhonen was a man with an unusual occupation. As a professional mourner, he made a living by attending funerals and feigning grief. His services were in high demand, as people sought to hire individuals who could convincingly express the emotions of the deceased's family.

Siegbert took his job very seriously. He had honed his skills over the years, studying the art of dramatic wailing and bereaved behavior. He could cry on cue, clutch a handkerchief like a pro, and even mimic the mannerisms of the departed.

One day, Siegbert received an offer from a wealthy businessman who needed someone to mourn the passing of his late wife. The catch was that she wasn't actually deceased – just faking her own death for tax purposes. Siegbert's instincts told him something was off, but he couldn't pass up the lucrative offer.

As he stood at the gravesite, dressed in black and clutching a bouquet of wilted flowers, Siegbert felt his resolve weakening. The businessman had assured him that this was an "honorable" arrangement, one that would allow him to avoid paying taxes on his wife's ill-gotten gains. Still, something didn't sit right.

Just as Siegbert was about to start wailing, a figure emerged from the crowd – the real Mrs. Korhonen, Siegbert's own wife of ten years. She looked like she'd been put through a wringer: dark circles under her eyes, her hair disheveled, and a look of utter despair etched on her face.

The businessman turned to Mrs. Korhonen and whispered something in her ear. To Siegbert's horror, she nodded and began to sob just as pitifully as he had rehearsed earlier that morning.

Siegbert realized he had been outsmarted – by his own wife. As the funeral procession made its way to the cemetery gates, Siegbert felt a mix of relief and shame. He joined the mournful dirge, but deep down, he was laughing at himself.

The businessman later sent him a check with a note that read: "Thanks for the laughs, Korhonen. You're hired." From then on, Siegbert devoted his talents to more reputable clients – ones who didn't require such subterfuge to get what they wanted. And though he never forgot the day Mrs. Korhonen outwitted him, he couldn't help but smile at the absurdity of it all.
