Sarah Salonen stepped into the crowded coffee shop, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting by the window, his back to her, sipping on a cup of black coffee. Her heart skipped a beat as she made her way towards him.

As she approached, he sensed her presence and turned around, revealing piercing blue eyes that crinkled at the corners when he smiled. "Hey, Sarah," he said, his deep voice sending shivers down her spine.

Their hands touched briefly as they exchanged hugs, and Sarah felt a jolt of electricity run through her body. It had been six months since they'd parted ways, and she couldn't help but wonder what could have been if they hadn't gone their separate ways.

"Come on in," he said, gesturing to an empty table by the window. They sat down, ordering a round of lattes as they caught up on each other's lives. He told her about his new job at a publishing house, and Sarah shared stories about her latest freelance writing gigs.

As they chatted, Sarah couldn't help but notice the way he listened intently to her words, his eyes lighting up with interest whenever she spoke about something that sparked her passion. It was moments like these that made her realize how much she had missed him.

Their conversation meandered through topics ranging from their favorite books to their childhood memories. The more they talked, the more Sarah felt like no time had passed at all. It was as if they'd never been apart, and the connection between them still pulsed strong.

As the afternoon wore on, they began to reminisce about their past together. They shared stories of their travels, their laughter-filled nights, and the quiet moments when it was just the two of them.

Sarah's phone buzzed in her pocket, breaking the spell. She hesitated before answering it, unsure if she wanted to reveal her location to him. But something about his gentle smile reassured her that he wouldn't judge. As they talked on the phone with her sister, Sarah couldn't help but steal glances at him, feeling a deep sense of gratitude for this chance reunion.

As they finished their drinks and prepared to leave, Sarah knew that she wasn't ready to let go of this connection just yet. She asked if he'd like to meet up again soon, and he agreed, his eyes sparkling with excitement.

As they parted ways, Sarah felt a renewed sense of hope. Maybe, just maybe, they could rekindle the spark that had once burned so brightly between them.
