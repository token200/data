Andrii Vargas Llosa stepped off the train and onto the platform, his worn leather boots scuffling against the worn concrete. He looked out at the drizzly Seattle evening, a haze of grey mist curling around the city's iconic spires. It was a far cry from Lima, Peru, where he'd grown up amidst the vibrant streets and markets of his native city.

As he made his way through the bustling station, Andrii's eyes scanned the crowd, searching for a familiar face. He spotted her – Natalia, a journalist friend who'd promised to meet him here. She was already waiting at the platform's edge, sipping from a paper cup and watching him with an amused smile.

"What took you so long?" she asked, falling into step beside him as they made their way out of the station.

Andrii shrugged, tossing his backpack onto his shoulder. "Traffic," he said, his eyes squinting against the drizzle. "Always traffic."

They walked side by side, their footsteps echoing off the wet pavement. Natalia knew Andrii's story – how he'd left Peru to chase a fresh start in the States. How he'd landed a job as an interpreter at the State Department, and had spent years building up his English skills.

"What are you doing here tonight?" she asked, glancing up at him with curiosity.

Andrii hesitated, collecting his thoughts before answering. He'd gotten a message from an old contact – a guy he used to work for back in Lima – who was looking for someone to translate some top-secret documents. The pay was good, and Andrii knew it would be a chance to use his language skills on a bigger stage.

As they turned onto Pike Street, the neon lights of the bars and clubs flickered like fireflies along the pavement. Andrii spotted a small jazz club – one that Natalia swore still served decent mojitos.

They ducked inside, the sounds of saxophone drifting into the night air. Over whiskey and salsa music, Andrii filled in Natalia on his latest lead. She listened intently, nodding along as he spoke. When he finished, she leaned forward, a smile breaking across her face.

"You should take it," she said, her voice low and persuasive. "It's too good to pass up."

Andrii raised an eyebrow, his mind racing with the possibilities.
