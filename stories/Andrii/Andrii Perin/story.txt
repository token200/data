Andrii Perin was a man of mystery, with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair that fell to his shoulders. As a skilled thief and scoundrel, he had made a name for himself on the streets of 19th century Paris.

Born into poverty, Andrii had grown up on the rough side of town, surrounded by the city's underbelly. He had learned how to survive, how to fight, and how to steal with ease. His natural talent and cunning had earned him a reputation as one of the best in the business.

One night, Andrii received an offer he couldn't refuse: to steal a valuable gemstone from the wealthy collector, Monsieur LeFleur. The catch was that the gemstone was on display at his estate in the countryside, surrounded by heavily guarded guards and traps.

Andrii accepted the challenge without hesitation. He spent weeks casing the estate, studying the guards' routines and waiting for the perfect moment to strike. And then, one moonless night, he put his plan into action.

He slipped it into his pocket and turned to leave, but not before casting a quick glance at his reflection in a nearby mirror.

As he emerged from the estate, Andrii felt a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over him. It was just another night on the job for Andrii Perin, the greatest thief Paris had ever known.
