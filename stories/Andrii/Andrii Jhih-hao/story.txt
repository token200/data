Andrii had spent many hours haggling over prices and sampling dishes at food stalls, all while scribbling notes in his worn notebook.

Tonight was no different. Andrii set off into the market, weaving past vendors selling everything from roasted chestnuts to handmade paper fans. He stopped at a stall piled high with steaming baskets of braised pork belly, inhaling the savory aroma and ordering a few pieces to go.

As he ate, Andrii Jhih-hao observed the bustling crowd around him, taking mental notes on the sights and sounds that made this market so unique.
