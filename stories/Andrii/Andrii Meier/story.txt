Andrii Meier stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the misty dawn air clung to his leather jacket like a damp shroud. He had been on the move for weeks, ever since leaving behind the familiar streets of Munich. The memories of his past lingered in every corner, haunting him like the ghosts he used to run from.

As he made his way through the deserted station, Andrii's thoughts drifted to the small café where it all began – the place where his mother had died, and where he'd found solace in the whiskey-soaked pages of a worn novel. He knew every inch of that café, every creaky chair and flickering fluorescent light.

He walked into the first pub on Main Street, ordering a cold beer with a nod to the bartender, who recognized him from his travels. The patrons eyed Andrii warily, sensing the shadows that clung to him like a coat. They whispered among themselves as he took a seat at the bar, nursing his drink in silence.

Outside, a gray sky wept over the city, casting a somber hue on everything it touched. It was as if the world itself was mourning, echoing the quiet grief that had been Andrii's constant companion since losing his mother. His father, a retired mechanic, had long given up trying to fill the void left by her passing. The silence that surrounded him now seemed deafening.

Andrii's gaze drifted toward the faded photograph on the counter – an image of himself and his mother standing at the same train station where he'd just arrived. He remembered the way she smiled, her eyes crinkled at the corners as if holding a secret. He recalled the countless times she'd read to him, transporting him to worlds beyond this one.

In those moments, Andrii had felt truly alive. Her love was his anchor, the rock upon which he balanced through life's turbulent waves. Without it, he felt adrift, an isolated figure lost in a city of strangers.

He finished his drink and pushed off from the bar, taking a deep breath into the damp morning air. There were places to find work, new faces to meet – but Andrii knew that no matter where life took him next, the shadows would follow.
