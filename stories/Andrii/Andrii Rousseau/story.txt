Andrii Rousseau stepped off the train and onto the platform, his worn leather boots making barely a sound on the worn stone. He had been away for so long, it was hard to believe he was back in Ravensburg, the small town where his family had lived for generations.

As he made his way through the quiet streets, Andrii felt like a stranger in his own home. His piercing green eyes scanned the familiar buildings, searching for any sign of life. The streets were empty, save for the sound of children playing in the distance.

Andrii's mind was filled with memories of his past, of the losses he had suffered and the scars that still lingered on his skin. He thought of his mother, who had died when he was just a child, leaving him to be raised by his father and sister. He remembered the pain of watching his friends grow up without their own fathers, the struggle to find purpose in a world that seemed determined to crush him.

As he walked, Andrii noticed something that made his heart skip a beat - a small, weathered wooden door tucked away in an alleyway. It was the same door where he had once locked himself inside as a child, seeking refuge from the pain and the darkness that seemed to follow him everywhere.

Without thinking, Andrii pushed open the creaky door and slipped inside. The air was musty and stale, but it felt like home. He sat down on the worn wooden bench, letting out a deep sigh as he closed his eyes.

Andrii's sister, Natalia, found him there soon after, her face etched with concern. "Brother, what are you doing?" she asked, sitting down beside him. "You're supposed to be helping Mama and Papa with the festival preparations."

Andrii opened his eyes, a small smile on his lips. "I'll help, I promise," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "But first, I need some time to myself."

Natalia nodded understandingly, wrapping her arms around Andrii's shoulders. "You can do that for yourself, brother," she said softly. "Mama and Papa won't let you suffer in silence anymore."

As they hugged, Andrii felt a sense of peace wash over him, like the first snows of winter had finally arrived. He knew he still had a long way to go, but with Natalia by his side, he felt like he could face anything that came his way.
