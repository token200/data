After leaving the military, Andrii Kamiński found himself without direction, drifting from one job to another until he stumbled upon an opportunity to work as a freelance security consultant.

It wasn't long before Andrii Kamiński's exceptional abilities caught the attention of a wealthy businessman with connections to the Russian underworld. The man, known only as "The Patron," offered Andrii Kamiński a substantial sum of money to retrieve a valuable piece of intel from a rival corporation.

As he delved deeper into the world of espionage, Andrii Kamiński found himself drawn to the thrill of the job, the rush of adrenaline that came with taking on impossible missions.
