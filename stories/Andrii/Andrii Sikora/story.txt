Andrii Sikora stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the crowded station. He had been in Poland for weeks, searching for any lead on his brother's disappearance. The local police had given up, but Andrii refused to surrender.

As he made his way through the throngs of people, Andrii's thoughts turned to his brother, Oleksandr. They had grown up together, exploring the woods and playing pranks on their friends. But when they were teenagers, Oleksandr had become increasingly obsessed with politics, and Andrii had tried to distance himself from him.

But as the years went by, Oleksandr's activism only grew more intense. He had joined a radical left-wing group, and his letters home had become increasingly erratic. And then, one day, he was gone.

Andrii had searched for him everywhere – in Ukraine, in Russia, even in the United States. But every lead seemed to end in a dead end. Until now, that is. A cryptic message from an anonymous source had led him to this small station in southern Poland.

As Andrii waited for his luggage to be collected, he noticed a woman sitting on a bench nearby. She was dressed in a long coat, and her hair was pulled back into a tight bun. There was something about her that seemed familiar – but Andrii couldn't quite place it.

"Excuse me," the woman said, as Andrii approached her. "Are you waiting for someone?"

Andrii hesitated, unsure of how much to reveal. But there was something about this woman that made him trust her. "My brother," he said finally. "I've been searching for him everywhere."

The woman nodded sympathetically. "I think I can help you," she said. "But first, let's get out of here. This station is not safe."

Andrii followed the woman as she led him through the winding streets of Krakow. They talked little, but Andrii sensed a deep understanding between them.

Eventually, they stopped in front of a small café. The woman pushed open the door and gestured for Andrii to enter.

 Inside, Andrii saw a figure he recognized – his brother, Oleksandr. He was sitting at a table, sipping a cup of coffee. But there was something different about him – a weariness that seemed to have aged years off his face.

Andrii felt a rush of emotion as he approached the table. His brother looked up, and their eyes met for the first time in months.

"Oleksandr," Andrii said, his voice barely above a whisper.

His brother's face softened, and he smiled weakly. "Andrii," he replied. "I'm glad you're here."
