As Andrii grew older, his love for art only deepened. He began to study painting at a local academy, where he honed his skills under the guidance of experienced instructors.

As Andrii's reputation grew, so did his musical endeavors. He released several albums, each one exploring new themes and sounds, from classical Ukrainian folk songs to modern rock anthems. Critics praised his talent, likening him to a fusion of Bob Dylan and Frida Kahlo.
