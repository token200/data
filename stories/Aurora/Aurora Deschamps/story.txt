One day, a string of high-profile burglaries hit the city, leaving the police baffled and stumped. The thief seemed to have an uncanny ability to evade capture, leaving behind no clues or evidence of any kind. It was as if they had vanished into thin air.

Aurora Deschamps took on the case with renewed fervor, pouring over every shred of evidence and conducting her own investigation. She spent countless hours poring over security footage, interviewing witnesses, and analyzing the smallest details that might have been missed by the authorities.
