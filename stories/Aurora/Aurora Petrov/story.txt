Growing up in a small town in Eastern Europe, Aurora had always been fascinated by the stories of her ancestors, who had fought against oppressive regimes and sought justice in the face of adversity.

One day, while researching a story on police brutality, Aurora received a tip about a young man who had been arrested and tortured by the authorities. Determined to expose the truth, she traveled to the small town where the incident had occurred, determined to meet with the young man and his family.
