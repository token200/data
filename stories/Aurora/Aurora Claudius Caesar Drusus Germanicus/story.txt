Aurora Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus was known to her friends and family as Rory, but she preferred to be addressed by her formal title: Imperatrix Aurora Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus. As the daughter of a powerful Roman general, she had grown up with a sense of duty and responsibility that weighed heavily on her shoulders.

Despite her noble upbringing, Rory was not content to simply follow in her father's footsteps. She had always been drawn to the world of art and music, and spent many hours practicing the lyre and composing poems in her spare time. Her talents were undeniable, but she knew that a woman from her social class could not pursue such interests without the backing of a powerful patron.

That was when she met him - a young and charming poet named Lucius, who saw something in Rory beyond her title or social status. He offered to be her patron, supporting her artistic endeavors in exchange for her companionship and affection. It was a tantalizing offer, and one that Rory found impossible to resist.

As the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, Rory found herself falling deeply in love with Lucius. She had never felt this way before, and it both thrilled and terrified her. How could she balance her duty to her family and her desire for independence, when all she wanted was to be with the man who made her feel alive?

For now, at least, Rory was content to let Lucius guide her. Together, they explored the city, attending concerts and recitals, and spending long hours by the river discussing poetry and philosophy. It was a life unlike anything she had ever known, and one that filled her with joy and wonder.

As Imperatrix Aurora Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus, Rory knew that she would always be bound to certain expectations and responsibilities. But as the love of her life, Lucius made her feel free in ways she never thought possible.
