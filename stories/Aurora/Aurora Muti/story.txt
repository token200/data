As Rory's investigation gained momentum, she received threatening messages and warnings from unknown sources. But she refused to back down, convinced that the public had a right to know about the corruption that was plaguing their city.

One night, as she was leaving her office building, Rory was approached by a mysterious figure who handed her a cryptic note with a single sentence: "Trust no one." She knew then that she was in over her head, but she couldn't bring herself to drop the story.

Aurora "Rory" Muti took a deep breath and steered herself towards her office, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.
