Aurora "Rory" Totti was known for her quick wit and sharp tongue, but few people knew that beneath her tough exterior lay a heart of gold. As a successful businesswoman in her late twenties, Rory had built a reputation as one of the most ruthless negotiators on Wall Street.

But despite her success, Rory's personal life was a different story altogether. She had given up on love after a string of failed relationships and bad breakups, convinced that she would never find someone who could handle her sharp edges.

That all changed when Rory met her new coworker, Luca Bianchi. A software engineer with a warm smile and an easy laugh, Luca was immediately drawn to Rory's firecracker personality and quick intelligence. Despite their instant attraction, Rory was hesitant to let her guard down around Luca, fearing that he would see the vulnerable side of herself.

As they worked together on a high-stakes project, Rory found herself growing more and more dependent on Luca's calm and rational approach to problem-solving. She began to see him as the perfect counterbalance to her own impulsiveness, and her feelings for him deepened with each passing day.

But when the stakes were raised and Rory's project hit a snag, she felt her anxiety spiking out of control. In a moment of panic, she lashed out at Luca, telling him that he didn't understand the pressure she was under.

Luca took the blow hard, but instead of walking away, he simply looked at Rory with a deep understanding in his eyes and said, "I get it. I really do." And then, without another word, he reached out and gently took her hand.

In that moment, Rory felt like she had been punched in the gut â€“ in the best possible way. For the first time in her life, she saw a glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, she could learn to let someone else love her for who she truly was.

As they left the office together that evening, Rory turned to Luca and whispered, "I'm sorry about earlier. I didn't mean to snap at you." Luca smiled and replied, "You didn't snap. You just needed a reminder of how much stronger we can be when we work together."

Rory's heart swelled with emotion as she realized that maybe, just maybe, she had finally found someone who could handle her sharp edges after all.
