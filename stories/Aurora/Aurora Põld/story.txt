Aurora Põld was known for her striking beauty and her ability to make even the most skeptical of souls believe in the magic of Estonian folklore. She had grown up in a small village nestled between the rolling hills of rural Estonia, where stories of mythical creatures and ancient gods were woven into everyday life.

As a child, Aurora would spend hours listening to her grandmother's tales of the Vili and Taara spirits, and the great hero, Kalevipoeg. Her grandmother, a wise and fierce woman named Helgi, had taught Aurora how to weave traditional Estonian baskets and how to make the most delicious of mulgikapsad (mashed potato dishes).

As she grew older, Aurora's fascination with Estonian mythology only deepened. She spent her days exploring the forests and fields around her village, searching for signs of the elusive supernatural beings that were said to roam the land. Her parents, worried for her safety, urged her to focus on more practical pursuits, but Aurora was drawn to the world of myth and legend.

One night, as she sat by a crackling fire in her grandmother's cottage, Helgi Põld told Aurora the story of how the Vili and Taara spirits had once been at war with the mortal world. The spirits, Aurora listened, entranced, as her grandmother revealed secrets that had been hidden for centuries.

From that day on, Aurora felt a deep connection to the stories of her ancestors. She began to see herself as a part of a long line of storytellers and keepers of tradition, and she vowed to carry on Helgi's legacy. As she grew into womanhood, Aurora's passion for Estonian mythology only intensified, and she set out to share its magic with others.

Years later, when the villagers would gather 'round to hear tales of their hero Kalevipoeg, they would whisper a name - Aurora Põld, weaver of stories and keeper of the old ways. And as she spoke, her eyes would sparkle like the stars on a clear Estonian night, and her voice would carry on the wind, spreading the magic of the Vili and Taara spirits to all who would listen.
