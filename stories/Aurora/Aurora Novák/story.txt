Aurora "Rory" Novák stepped into the dimly lit room, the soft glow of candles casting eerie shadows on her pale skin. Her dark hair was tied back in a ponytail, and her bright green eyes sparkled with curiosity as she surveyed the space.

This was her sanctuary – a secret room hidden deep within the walls of her family's old mansion. She had spent countless hours within these walls, lost in thought, scribbling stories and poetry on scraps of paper.

As she made her way to her desk, Rory noticed a piece of paper caught in the window latch. She gently pried it loose, smoothing out the wrinkles. It was an invitation – handwritten on yellowed paper – from a mysterious sender.

The words danced before her eyes: "Meet me at the old oak at midnight. Come alone."

Rory's heart skipped a beat as she folded the note and tucked it into her pocket. Who could have sent this? And what did they want from her?

She had always been drawn to the unknown, the unexplained. As a child, she would spend hours poring over dusty old books in the mansion's library, devouring tales of ghostly apparitions and supernatural occurrences.

As she settled into her chair, Rory's fingers began to flutter across the keyboard of her laptop. The words flowed from her like blood from a wounded vein – a tale of mystery and adventure that seemed to take on a life of its own.

Hours passed, the room growing darker as the sun dipped below the horizon. Finally, she saved the document and closed her eyes, letting the silence wash over her. She knew what she had to do.

The clock struck midnight, and Rory slipped out into the cool night air. The old oak loomed before her, its branches like skeletal fingers reaching for the moon. She approached cautiously, the rustle of leaves beneath her feet the only sound.

A figure emerged from the shadows – tall, with piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through her. "Welcome, Rory," they said, their voice low and mysterious. "I've been waiting for you."

And with that, everything went black.

When Rory came to, she was back in her room, the candles lit once more. But as she looked around, a small note on her desk caught her eye – scrawled with the same cryptic words: "The story has just begun."
