Roman Lundgren stepped out of his worn leather jacket, the one with the frayed cuffs and faded sleeves that had been with him through thick and thin. He looked like a man who'd seen it all - the rough-around-the-edges kind. The dim light of the dive bar cast long shadows across the room, but Roman's eyes seemed to see right through them.

As he made his way to the bar, the bartender, a gruff old-timer named Joe, raised an eyebrow at the sight of the towering figure in front of him. "What can I get you, Roman?" he asked, his voice like gravel.

Roman slid onto a stool and gave Joe a lazy grin. "Whiskey. Neat."

Joe poured the amber liquid into a glass, handing it over with a snort. Roman tossed back the shot, feeling the burn all the way down. He was a man who'd earned every ounce of his rugged exterior.

The door swung open, and a young woman slipped in, her eyes scanning the room as if searching for someone. Roman watched her out of the corner of his eye, noticing the look of desperation etched on her face. It was a look he knew all too well.

As the night wore on, the woman made her way over to Roman's table, her hips swaying in time with the music. He raised an eyebrow at her audacity, but there was something about her that caught his attention. Maybe it was the spark of determination in her eyes, or maybe it was just a hunch.

"What's your story?" Roman asked, his voice low and gravelly.

The woman hesitated for a moment before launching into a tale of woe - a bad job, a worse breakup, and a dwindling bank account. Roman listened intently, his expression softening ever so slightly. He'd been there too.

When she finished, he reached out and handed her his glass, the one with the remaining whiskey. "Drink up," he said, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "You look like you could use it."

The woman hesitated for a moment before taking a sip of the fiery liquid. As the burn coursed through her veins, Roman smiled to himself. He knew that taste all too well.

In that moment, something shifted between them. It wasn't a connection, exactly - more like a nod of understanding. They were two people who'd been battered and bruised, but still standing.

As the night wore on, Roman Lundgren transformed from rough-around-the-edges drifter to gentle giant, sharing stories and laughter with the young woman. And though he never revealed his own scars, those hidden deep beneath his gruff exterior, she knew that Roman was someone who'd been through hell and come out the other side - scarred, maybe, but still standing tall.

And in a dive bar like this one, where the walls seemed to hold every secret and every story, even that was enough.
