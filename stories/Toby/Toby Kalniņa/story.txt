His photographs were more than just images – they were messages of hope and inspiration, reminding viewers of the beauty and complexity of the world we live in.

As Toby looked back on his remarkable career, he couldn't help but smile at the memory of that serendipitous encounter with the silver vendor in Marrakech. It was a moment that had changed the course of his life, leading him down a path of discovery and creativity that would take him to places unknown.
