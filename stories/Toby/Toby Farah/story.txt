Toby Farah stepped out of his small flat and into the chill of the morning air. He lived in a world where magic was real, but only to those who knew how to see it. As a skilled "sensitizer," Toby could feel the hidden energies that swirled around him like a living thing.

He took a deep breath, feeling the familiar tug of the city's magical undercurrents. New Haven was a place where magic and mundane coexisted in an uneasy balance. Some people saw it as a blessing, while others viewed it with suspicion or even fear.

Toby had always been drawn to the edges of this world. He worked as a private investigator, using his unique abilities to help those who couldn't see the invisible forces that shaped their lives. It was a lonely job, but one he took pride in.

As he walked through the streets, Toby felt the familiar hum of magic. Some buildings seemed to lean inwards, as if drawn by an unseen force. Others appeared to repel him, emitting a faint aura of hostility. He navigated this world with ease, his senses heightened to pick up on even the slightest distortions.

His phone buzzed, and he answered it to hear the anxious voice of Emily Wilson, a local business owner. Her store had been vandalized, and she suspected foul play. Toby agreed to investigate, sensing that there was more to the case than met the eye.

He arrived at the store to find Emily in tears, her usually tidy shop in disarray. Toby took note of every detail, his senses on high alert as he scanned the scene for any signs of magic gone wrong. He knew that if there was an element of sorcery involved, it would be hidden - but not from him.

With a nod, Toby set to work, following the trail of clues through the city's undercurrents. As he delved deeper into the mystery, he began to uncover hints of a far more sinister plot than mere vandalism. The magic in this world was complex and deadly, and Toby knew that solving the case would require all his skill and cunning.

As the sun climbed higher in the sky, Toby felt himself being drawn into the heart of the city's magical underbelly. He had a feeling that he was getting close to uncovering something big - but at what cost?
