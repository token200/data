Toby Eglite was an enigmatic figure in the small town of Ravenswood, where everyone knew his face but few truly understood him. As a child, he had been known for his mischievous grin and quick wit, often getting into trouble with his best friend, Emily.

Years went by, and Toby's demeanor changed. He grew taller, his eyes lost their sparkle, and his smile became a rare sight. Yet, the town still whispered about his exploits in school, how he had once convinced the entire class to skip lunch for an impromptu game of tag. Even now, Emily would chuckle when talking about those carefree days with Toby Eglite.

One stormy evening, the local library was hosting a reading night, and Emily invited Toby to join her as a guest reader. As he stood up, adjusting his worn leather jacket, a collective hush fell over the audience. Toby's eyes scanned the room, lingering on familiar faces – some of whom he had grown apart from.

With an unnerving calmness, Toby began reading aloud from a collection of Edgar Allan Poe's works. His voice wove a hypnotic spell, transporting the listeners to dark alleys and crumbling mansions. As he spoke, his face took on an otherworldly quality, as if the shadows themselves had seeped into his pores.

After finishing the final poem, Toby Eglite walked back to his seat, leaving behind an expectant silence that was both unnerving and captivating. Emily watched him with a mixture of fascination and concern – she still saw glimpses of the boy he once was in those piercing eyes.

When the reading came to a close, the audience applauded, their expressions a blend of awe and unease. Toby smiled faintly, a hint of his old mischief creeping back into his demeanor. As Emily approached him, she asked if he knew why people were so drawn to the macabre tales he had read from.

Toby's response was an enigmatic shrug: "I think it's because, in those stories, we find a way to make sense of our own darkness." And with that, the lights dimmed, and the room disappeared into the shadows.
