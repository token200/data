Toby Singh was known for his electrifying performances on stage, captivating audiences with his unique blend of Indian classical and Western rock music. Born as Rohan Kapoor, in a small town in India, Toby's love for music was sparked by his mother's traditional ragas. As he grew older, however, he became increasingly drawn to the raw energy of rock music, which led him to form his band, "Thunderbolt."

With his signature dreadlocks and vibrant stage presence, Toby Singh took the Indian music scene by storm. His soulful voice and genre-bending sound drew comparisons to legendary artists like Jimi Hendrix and Freddie Mercury. But despite the accolades, Toby remained humble, crediting his mother's teachings on the importance of simplicity and authenticity.

As Thunderbolt gained popularity, Toby began to tour internationally, performing at iconic venues such as Madison Square Garden in New York and Wembley Stadium in London. He was hailed as a rising star, one who was carrying the torch for Indian music in the global arena.

Despite his success, Toby remained true to his roots. In his spare time, he would often return to his hometown, where he would perform at local festivals and weddings, sharing his music with the community that had first inspired him. It was a way for him to stay connected to his heritage, while also exploring new sounds and collaborating with fellow musicians.

One evening, after a particularly raucous performance in London, Toby found himself reflecting on his journey. Born Rohan Kapoor, but now known as Toby Singh, he felt grateful for the path that had led him to where he was today – on stage, with a microphone in hand, ready to electrify the crowd once more.

As he looked out at the sea of expectant faces, Toby's heart swelled with pride. He knew that he owed it all to his mother, who had first introduced him to the power of music, and to the people who had supported him every step of the way. With a nod to his bandmates, Toby launched into the next song, his voice soaring as Thunderbolt thundered on. In this moment, nothing else mattered – just the music, and the connection it shared with those who listened.
