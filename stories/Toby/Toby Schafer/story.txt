Toby Schafer walked into the small café on campus, scanning the room for familiar faces. As the star quarterback of the university's football team, he was used to being surrounded by fans and admirers, but tonight was different. Tonight, Toby Schafer was just another student trying to blend in.

He slid onto a stool at the counter, catching the eye of the barista, a perky junior named Emily. "Hey, Toby!" she chirped, recognizing the football legend. Toby Schafer smiled politely, feeling a pang of embarrassment for not being able to shake off his celebrity status.

As he waited for his coffee, Toby Schafer surveyed the café, taking in the lively chatter and clinking cups. He spotted a group of students laughing and joking together, their eyes fixed on him with a mixture of awe and admiration. It was a strange feeling, being seen as someone else's hero rather than his own.

Toby Schafer's thoughts were interrupted by Emily, who handed him a steaming cup of coffee. "On the house," she said with a wink. "You're the most eligible bachelor on campus, after all." Toby Schafer chuckled, feeling a flush rise to his cheeks as he took a sip of the hot liquid.

As he sat at the counter, sipping his coffee and watching the world go by, Toby Schafer felt a sense of normalcy wash over him. For one night, he could forget about the cheers and chants, the crowds of fans and reporters clamoring for an interview. Tonight, he was just another student, enjoying a quiet evening out.

Toby Schafer leaned back in his stool, feeling a small sense of freedom. It was nice to be invisible, if only for a little while. As he finished his coffee and prepared to leave, Emily called out after him, "Hey, Toby! Good luck with the game on Friday!" Toby Schafer smiled and waved, knowing that soon, the spotlight would be back on him, shining bright as always.
