As he stood before one of his latest masterpieces, Toby couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. He had stayed true to himself and his art, and it had taken him to places he never thought possible.

In the end, Toby Lane's decision to trust his instincts and take a chance on himself had paid off in spectacular fashion.
