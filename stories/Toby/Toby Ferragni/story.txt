Toby Ferragni was a man on a mission. As the younger brother of the famous fashion influencer Chiara Ferragni, he had grown up in the shadow of his sister's success. But Toby was determined to forge his own path and make a name for himself in the fashion world.

Growing up, Toby had always been fascinated by design and textiles. He spent hours watching his mother sew and repair clothes, learning the intricacies of fabrics and patterns. After studying fashion in Paris, he landed an internship at a prestigious fashion house, where he worked tirelessly to hone his skills.

As he gained confidence in his abilities, Toby began to take on small projects for his sister's brands. He designed a few bespoke dresses for Chiara's clients, which proved to be a huge hit. Encouraged by the feedback, Toby started his own label, Ferragni & Sons, with the goal of creating clothes that would make women feel empowered and confident.

Toby's designs were unlike anything his sister had ever created. His love of vintage patterns and fabrics shone through in every garment, from flowy maxi dresses to statement-making cocktail gowns. Chiara Ferragni herself was a big supporter of her brother's venture, often modeling his creations on social media and sending them to her millions of followers.

As the years passed, Toby's label gained popularity among fashionistas and influencers. He collaborated with other designers and artists, creating limited-edition collections that sold out quickly. The once-obscure Toby Ferragni had finally made a name for himself in the fashion world, thanks to his hard work and dedication.

Despite all the success, Toby remained humble and grounded. He was grateful for the opportunities he'd had and the support of his sister, who continued to be a source of inspiration and guidance. As he looked out at the bustling streets of Milan, where his label was based, Toby knew that he had truly found his place in the world â€“ and it was exactly where he wanted to be.
