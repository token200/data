Toby D'Annunzio was a man with a reputation for being unbreakable. A former CIA operative, he had seen his fair share of battles and had come out on top every time. His rugged good looks and quick wit had won over the hearts of many, but few knew about the scars that lay beneath.

As he walked into the dimly lit bar, Toby's eyes scanned the room, taking in the familiar faces of his old colleagues. He spotted his friend, Rachel, sipping on a whiskey at the end of the bar and made his way over to her.

"What brings you here tonight?" she asked, as Toby slid onto the stool beside her.

"Just enjoying some drinks and catching up," he replied, his eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble.

Just then, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was Marcus, an old adversary of Toby's, with a smirk plastered on his face.

"Well well well, look what we have here," Marcus sneered, sauntering over to their table. "The legendary Toby D'Annunzio, living in the past."

Toby's expression remained neutral, but Rachel could see the fire burning beneath his surface.

"What do you want, Marcus?" Toby asked, his voice low and even.

"I'm here for information," Marcus replied, his eyes glinting with malice. "I've heard that you're hiding something big, something that could bring down the entire government."

Toby raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself.

"And what makes you think I'd be stupid enough to hide it?" he asked, his voice dripping with sarcasm.

Marcus chuckled, a cold, mirthless sound.

"Oh, I know all about you, Toby," he said. "I know that you're still carrying around that old wound, the one that drove you out of the CIA."

Toby's expression never wavered, but Rachel could see the tension in his body, the way his knuckles were clenched into fists.

"What are you talking about?" he growled.

Marcus leaned in, his voice barely above a whisper.

"I'm talking about Sophia," he said. "I know what happened to her. And I know that you're still carrying around a torch for her."

Toby's eyes flashed with anger, but Marcus just laughed and turned on his heel, disappearing into the night.

As soon as he was gone, Toby let out a deep breath, feeling the tension in his body dissipate.

"What happened to Sophia?" Rachel asked, concern etched on her face.

Toby's expression softened, just for a moment.

"Sophia was my partner," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "We were both in the CIA, working undercover. And then...and then she got killed."

Rachel reached out and took Toby's hand, offering him a comforting touch.

"We'll get to the bottom of this," she promised.
