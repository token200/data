Toby Bach stepped out of his small apartment, taking a deep breath of the crisp morning air. As he walked down the street, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The city seemed to be watching him, its inhabitants huddled in their apartments, waiting for the day's events to unfold.

Toby was different from the rest. He had a sixth sense that told him when someone was lying or hiding something. It wasn't just his intuition; he could see it - a faint glow around people who were deceitful. The problem was, he couldn't turn it off, and it made everyday interactions almost impossible.

As he walked to his job as a private investigator, Toby's thoughts drifted back to the case that had started it all: the missing sister. Her parents had hired him, desperate for answers, but every lead ended in a dead-end. Now, Toby couldn't shake the feeling that he was close to something big, just out of sight.

He arrived at the office and began sipping his coffee, scanning the room for anyone who might be hiding something. That's when he saw her - a young woman with piercing green eyes, fidgeting in the corner. The glow around her was unmistakable.

"Toby," she said, approaching him hesitantly. "I need to talk to you."

Toby raised an eyebrow. "What is it?"

The woman handed him a photograph. It was an image of his sister's family home - the one he had been investigating for months. But what caught his attention was the figure in the background: a man with a familiar face.

"That's my brother-in-law," Toby said, his voice low. "He's been telling me that he's not involved."

The woman leaned in, her eyes locked on his. "I think it is more than just a family secret. I think it's connected to the sister's disappearance."

Toby felt a spark of hope ignite within him. This could be it - the break he needed to solve the case. But as he looked at the photograph again, he saw something that made his heart sink: a small tattoo on the man's wrist.

It was a mark from a gang Toby had been tracking for months. He knew what this meant - danger was lurking around every corner.

"Let's go," he said to himself, determination etched on his face. The game was on, and Toby Bach was ready to play.
