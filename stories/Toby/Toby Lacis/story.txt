Toby Lacis sat alone in his dimly lit apartment, staring at the wall as he struggled to come to terms with her recent departure. The city outside was alive and bustling, but for him, it seemed like a distant hum.

It had been three months since Sofia, Toby's partner of five years, left without explanation. He still found himself checking his phone every hour, half-expecting to see her name pop up on the screen. But it never did.

Toby Lacis was a writer, and words were his solace. He spent most of his days holed up in his apartment, typing away at his latest novel. The story was a reflection of his own heartache, and he poured every emotion into its pages.

As he wrote, Toby's mind wandered back to the memories they had shared. The laughter, the adventures, the quiet nights spent cuddled up together on the couch. He remembered the way Sofia smiled at him, the way her eyes sparkled when she laughed.

But most of all, he remembered the silence. The awkward silences that had grown thicker and more oppressive with each passing day. It was as if they both knew what needed to be said, but neither of them had the courage to say it out loud.

Toby Lacis sighed, rubbing his tired eyes. He had given up trying to reach Sofia, stopped hoping for a reconciliation. Now, he simply existed in a state of suspended animation, waiting for the numbness to wear off.

The phone on his desk rang, shrill and piercing. Toby hesitated before answering it, wondering who could be calling him now. It was an unknown number, but he answered anyway, his heart racing with anticipation.

For a moment, there was silence. Then, a faint voice spoke up on the other end of the line. "Hey, Toby...I just wanted to say hi."

Toby's eyes welled up with tears as he recognized Sofia's voice. She had returned. He smiled weakly into the phone, his heart full of hope and despair.
