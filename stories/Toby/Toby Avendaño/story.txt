As a child, Toby had always been fascinated by the way light danced through the air, casting shadows and highlights on everything it touched. His parents, both artists in their own right, encouraged his creativity and nurtured his talent for photography. They gifted him with his first camera when he was just 10 years old, and from that moment on, Toby was hooked.

Together, Toby and Sarah began collaborating on projects, pushing each other to new heights and exploring new ways of capturing the world around them. Their partnership flourished, and soon, their work was in high demand. Clients clamored for their unique perspective, and Toby Avendaño's name became synonymous with quality and creativity.

Years went by, and Toby's love for photography only deepened. He continued to explore new mediums and techniques, always striving to improve and push the boundaries of his art. And through it all, Sarah remained by his side, supporting him every step of the way.
