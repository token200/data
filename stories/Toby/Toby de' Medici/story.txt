Toby de' Medici was a young woman with a passion for art and music. She had grown up in Florence, Italy, surrounded by the city's rich history and culture. Her family, who were prominent bankers and merchants, had encouraged her to pursue her creative interests, much to the dismay of her parents.

Despite their disapproval, Toby de' Medici had found solace in the local music scene. She spent most nights playing her lute at the city's taverns and courtyards, mesmerizing audiences with her soulful melodies. Her talent had not gone unnoticed, and soon she was approached by the famous poet, Lorenzo de' Medici.

The two quickly became fast friends, bonding over their shared love of art and literature. Lorenzo, also known as "Lorenzo the Magnificent," would often attend Toby de' Medici's performances, and even join in on her singing. Their friendship blossomed into a romance, much to the surprise of Toby's family.

As Toby de' Medici's fame grew, so did her influence. She began to use her music as a platform for social commentary, speaking out against the injustices faced by women and the poor. Her message resonated with the people of Florence, who began to see her as a beacon of hope.

One night, after a particularly rousing performance, Toby de' Medici was approached by Lorenzo himself. He presented her with an offer: to become the court musician for the city's ruling family. The catch? She would have to leave her family and start anew in the city of Siena.

Toby de' Medici was torn. On one hand, the opportunity was a dream come true. On the other, she couldn't bear the thought of leaving her family behind. In the end, she decided to accept the offer, knowing that it would give her the freedom to pursue her art without constraint.

As she set off for Siena, Toby de' Medici felt a sense of excitement and trepidation. She knew that this new chapter in her life would be filled with challenges, but she was ready to face them head-on. With Lorenzo by her side, she was determined to make a name for herself as one of Florence's most talented musicians.
