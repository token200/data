Andrea Morgan stepped off the stage, her voice hoarse from hours of singing and performing for the packed audience. As lead singer of the popular indie band, Whiskey Wanderers, she was no stranger to crowds, but this particular show had left her feeling drained.

As she made her way through the throng of well-wishers and fans, Andrea's gaze wandered to the empty bottle of whiskey sitting on the edge of her dressing room table. It was a habit she'd developed over years of touring, a small comfort that helped her unwind after each show. She picked it up, feeling the weight of it in her hand, and took a sip.

Backstage, Andrea's bandmates were already dispersing, each member heading off to their own destinations. There was Jake on guitar, who had plans to meet up with his family for dinner; Emily on drums, who was scheduled for a hair appointment; and Mike on bass, who had to catch an early flight to Los Angeles.

Andrea watched them go, feeling a pang of envy. She had no one waiting for her, no family or friends to attend to. Her parents were long gone, passing away when she was just a teenager. She'd never had a steady relationship or a family of her own. The whiskey bottle seemed like the only constant in her life.

As the night wore on and the last of her bandmates departed, Andrea settled into her chair, feeling the exhaustion wash over her once more. She thought about the music that had brought her so much joy over the years – the thrill of performing, the rush of adrenaline when the crowd began to sing along – but it was a fleeting thing, something that could disappear at any moment.

She raised the whiskey bottle again, this time taking a longer swig before setting it down. The liquor burned its way down her throat, warming her from the inside out. Andrea closed her eyes, letting the heat spread through her body, and let herself drift away into the familiar comfort of sleep. In that moment, she knew that she was exactly where she needed to be – alone, on stage, with only her music for company.
