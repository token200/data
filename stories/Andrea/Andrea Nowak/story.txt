Andrea Nowak stepped into the small, dimly lit café on the outskirts of town. The scent of stale coffee and worn leather wafted through the air as she made her way to the counter. She slid onto a stool beside the door, surveying the handful of patrons huddled over cups of black liquid.

The waitress, a woman with a nose ring and a faded denim jacket, looked up from her phone. "Coffee?" she asked gruffly.

Andrea nodded, taking a seat on the worn vinyl stool beside her. As she waited for her coffee to arrive, her eyes roamed the room. There was a musician strumming a melancholy tune on his guitar in the corner, and a pair of young men huddled over a chessboard.

The waitress returned with Andrea's coffee and dropped a napkin on the counter beside it. "Free," she said, with a flick of her wrist.

Andrea raised an eyebrow but took the napkin without comment. She unfolded it to reveal a scribbled note – a poem in uneven handwriting:

"We're all just passing strangers
Lost souls adrift on a sea
Our names etched in the sand like sandcastles

In time, they'll be worn away by waves of sorrow
Leaving nothing but memories to hold onto"

Andrea smiled wryly as she read the words. This was her own handwriting – the stuff that usually stayed locked away behind a mask of calm composure.

The waitress glanced over at her, concern flickering across her face. "You okay?" she asked softly.

Andrea hesitated for a moment before responding, her voice low and measured. "I'm fine."

She took another sip of coffee, letting the bitter taste linger on her tongue as she watched the patrons huddled around their drinks. There was an air of quiet desperation in this place – an understanding that they were all just trying to hold on for a little while longer.

As she finished her coffee and prepared to leave, the musician caught her eye with a gentle nod from his guitar corner. Andrea felt a small jolt of recognition run through her chest, like someone had called out her name in a crowded room.

In that moment, she realized that maybe – just maybe – she wasn't alone after all.
