I think there may be some confusion here.

Andrea Bocelli is not a female character, but rather an Italian tenor. He was born on February 22, 1958, in Lucca, Italy. Andrea Bocelli rose to fame with his powerful voice and iconic songs like "Con Te Partir√≤" and "Ave Maria".

However, I can write a story about a fictional character named Andrea Pausini. Please note that this character is not based on the Italian singer Andrea Pausini.
