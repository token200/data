Andrea Angert stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the crowded station for any sign of familiarity. As she made her way through the throngs of people, she couldn't help but feel a sense of unease wash over her. She had been on the run for weeks, ever since she'd discovered the truth about her family's dark past.

Andrea Angert, whose real name was Andrea Elizabeth Angert, had always known that something was off about her family's history. Her parents had always been tight-lipped about their past, and Andrea had grown up feeling like there was a part of her that she couldn't quite access.

As she emerged from the station, the cool breeze hit her like a slap in the face, clearing her head for the first time in days. She took a deep breath, letting the familiar scent of blooming flowers fill her lungs. This was it, the place where she would finally find answers.

Andrea Angert made her way through the winding streets, dodging pedestrians and market stalls as she searched for any sign of life that might lead her to the truth. She had heard whispers of a hidden archive, buried deep within the city's ancient walls, where secrets were kept safe from prying eyes.

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the cobblestone streets, Andrea Angert spotted a small café tucked away in a quiet alley. The sign above the door read "Elías' Brews", and Andrea felt an inexplicable pull towards it. She pushed open the door, and stepped inside.

The air was thick with smoke and the smell of freshly ground coffee, and Andrea's heart skipped a beat as she scanned the room for any sign of the old man she had heard was its proprietor. And then, she saw him - Elías, with eyes that seemed to see right through her. "Welcome, Andrea Angert," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "I've been expecting you."
