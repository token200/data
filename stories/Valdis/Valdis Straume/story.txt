Valdis Straume stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the mist-shrouded fjord. She had been away for months, chasing rumors of her sister's involvement with the Norwegian resistance. The truth was far more complicated.

As a child, Valdis had grown up in this small coastal town with her older sister, Astrid. Their mother had died young, and their father had sent them to live with relatives in the city. But when they returned home as teenagers, everything had changed. Astrid had become increasingly involved with the resistance, using her intelligence and charm to gather information for the group.

Valdis's own interests lay elsewhere - in music and art. She spent hours sketching the rugged coastline and playing her violin by the firelight. Her father disapproved of her pursuits, deeming them "frivolous" and unworthy of a Straume woman.

But when Astrid went missing during an operation gone wrong, Valdis had set out to find her. She followed a trail of cryptic messages and hidden codes, leading her from Oslo to the fjord's wild edge. And now, finally, she stood before the place where Astrid was last seen - a small cabin nestled among the rocks.

Valdis took a deep breath, steeling herself for what lay ahead. As she entered the cabin, she spotted a note on the table: "Meet me at the lighthouse at midnight. Come alone." Valdis's heart skipped a beat as she realized that this was her sister's handwriting - or someone who knew Astrid's unique cipher.

As she climbed the winding path to the lighthouse, Valdis felt a mix of emotions swirling inside her. Anger, sadness, and hope. What would she find at the top? Would Astrid be alive? And if not, what had become of her?

The moon rose high above the fjord as Valdis reached the lighthouse. She pushed open the door, calling out into the darkness. A figure emerged from the shadows - a woman with piercing blue eyes and hair the color of the night sky.

"Astrid?" Valdis whispered, her heart pounding in her chest.

The woman nodded, a hint of a smile playing on her lips. "Valdis. Welcome home."
