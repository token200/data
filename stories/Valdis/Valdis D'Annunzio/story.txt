Valdis D'Annunzio stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the cool evening air enveloping her like a familiar shroud. As she made her way through the deserted station, the flickering streetlights cast long shadows behind her, like dark specters following in her wake.

A native of this small town on the Mediterranean coast, Valdis had spent most of her life watching the sea roll in and out with relentless pace. She'd grown up listening to her Nonna's tales of the old country, where myth and legend roamed free under the watchful eye of the ancient gods.

As she walked towards the village, the sound of laughter carried on the breeze, drawing her towards a small taverna perched on the edge of the sea. Valdis smiled to herself, knowing that the locals would be gathering there tonight to swap stories and share what little news there was.

Inside, the fire crackled and spat in the hearth, casting a warm glow over the crowded room. Valdis spotted a familiar face – her old friend, Leo – sitting at a table near the window, nursing a glass of red wine. She wove through the crowd, exchanging nods and smiles with the other patrons.

As she reached the table, Leo looked up and smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "Valdis D'Annunzio, my dear," he said, standing to greet her. "It's been too long."

Valdis settled into her seat, feeling a sense of belonging wash over her. This was where she belonged – in this small, sun-kissed world, surrounded by people who knew and loved her as well as they knew themselves.

For tonight, at least, Valdis D'Annunzio could forget the troubles that weighed on her mind and lose herself in the simple pleasures of life: good food, fine wine, and the sound of laughter carried on the wind. She raised her glass to Leo's in a silent toast, savoring the taste of freedom and belonging in this tiny corner of the world.
