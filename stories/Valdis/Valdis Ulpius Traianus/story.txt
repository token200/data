Valdis Ulpius Traianus was not an actual historical figure, so I will create a fictional backstory for him. Here's a 400-word short story:

In the heart of Rome, there existed a legend about a man named Valdis Ulpius Traianus, known to his friends and family as "The Unyielding". Born into a poor but proud merchant family, Valdis was raised on the streets and in the markets, where he honed his skills as an entrepreneur and strategist.

As a young adult, Valdis caught the eye of Emperor Marcus Aurelius himself. Impressed by the young man's intelligence and cunning, the emperor took Valdis under his wing and offered him a place at court. There, Valdis proved himself to be a valuable advisor, using his knowledge of trade and commerce to help the empire prosper.

However, as Valdis rose through the ranks, he began to chafe against the strict codes of conduct expected of imperial advisors. He was a man of action, not words, and preferred to let his own reputation speak for itself rather than relying on official titles and protocol.

Eventually, Valdis's differences with Emperor Marcus Aurelius came to a head. Accused by some of treason and hubris, Valdis was banished from Rome and forced to live in exile. There, he spent years rebuilding himself as a warrior and leader, training with the Roman legions and earning their respect through his bravery and martial prowess.

Years later, when Emperor Hadrian rose to power, he sought out Valdis as a potential successor. Recognizing the man's unique skills and character, Hadrian offered him a place at court once more, this time with the explicit title of "Legatus Proconsularis" - a powerful governorship that gave Valdis control over entire provinces.

With his newfound authority, Valdis Ulpius Traianus set about implementing reforms and expanding the empire's borders. His unyielding spirit and unwavering commitment to justice earned him the love and admiration of the people, who referred to him as "The Unyielding" in reverence.

As a testament to his legacy, a grand statue of Valdis was erected in the heart of Rome, standing tall for centuries as a symbol of power, integrity, and unshakeable resolve.
