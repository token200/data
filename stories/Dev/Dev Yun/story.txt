Devlin "Dev" Yun, a former special forces operative, stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the glittering city lights. It had been five years since he'd left the military, and yet the memories still lingered. The adrenaline rush, the camaraderie with his fellow soldiers, the sense of purpose - all lost now.

Dev's thoughts drifted to his wife, Maria. She was the reason he'd walked away from it all, leaving behind the thrill of combat for a quieter life. But even that hadn't brought him peace. He couldn't shake the feeling that he'd left a part of himself on those battlefields.

A faint buzzing noise caught Dev's attention - his comms device, hidden in his jacket pocket. He pulled it out and answered, his eyes narrowing as he listened to the voice on the other end.

"Dev, we need you," a gravelly voice said. "We've got a situation downtown. High-clearance target. You're the only one who can handle this."

Dev's grip on the comms device tightened. It was old habits that died hard.

"What's the scenario?" he asked, already moving towards the stairs.

There was a pause before the voice responded. "Intel suggests it's a high-stakes op. Possible mole within the agency. We need you to extract the target and get out."

Dev snorted - as if extracting a target from an enemy's lair wasn't exactly his problem anymore. But something about this felt off. The urgency, the secrecy... it all whispered of more than just a simple extraction mission.

He took the stairs three at a time, his mind racing with possibilities. Five years since he'd last walked into a firefight, and now he was being pulled back in like a rusty gear.

When he reached the lobby, Dev's instincts were screaming at him to turn around, to walk away from this mess once more. But something about Maria's smile had left an open door in his heart - even if it meant walking through fire one last time.

With a nod, Dev activated his comms device. "I'm in."

The game was on again.
