I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Dev Saldana. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created recently.

However, I found that Zoe Saldana is a real actress who has appeared in numerous films, including the Avatar and Guardians of the Galaxy franchises. Here's a story about her:

Zoe Saldana, born to Dominican parents in Passaic, New Jersey, grew up with a passion for dance and music. As a child, she began taking ballet lessons and later joined a local dance troupe, performing at various events and competitions.

As Zoe grew older, her interest in the arts only deepened. She began studying theater and eventually landed small roles on stage and screen. Her breakthrough came when she was cast as Nyota Uhura in the reboot of Star Trek: Beyond (2016), playing the role of a communications officer for the crew.

One of Zoe's most iconic roles to date is Neytiri, the Na'vi warrior princess, in James Cameron's epic sci-fi film Avatar (2009). Her performance earned her widespread critical acclaim and cemented her status as a leading lady in Hollywood. She reprised her role in the sequels Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) and Avatar: The Last Airbender is not one of her notable roles, it's actually "Avatar 3" - "Avatar: The Last Airbender" has nothing to do with Zoe Saldana

Zoe's success extends beyond her acting career. She has been an outspoken advocate for social justice and environmental causes. In 2017, she married Italian artist Marco Perego, with whom she shares two sons.

Throughout her career, Zoe has demonstrated a commitment to using her platform to raise awareness about important issues. From advocating for arts education to promoting sustainability, she has made a lasting impact on the entertainment industry. With a career spanning over three decades, Zoe Saldana continues to inspire fans around the world with her talent, beauty, and dedication to her craft.
