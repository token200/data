As they lifted the championship trophy aloft, Dev couldn't help but think of her father, who had always believed in her abilities. She knew that this win was not just for herself, but for him and all the people who had supported her along the way. Devon "Dev" Piotrowski had truly earned her place as a champion.

The team celebrated long into the night, basking in the glory of their hard-won victory. And Dev, beaming with pride, knew that she was exactly where she was meant to be - on top of the basketball world.
