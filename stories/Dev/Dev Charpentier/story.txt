Dev Charpentier stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station as if searching for something - or someone. She had arrived in Ravenswood, a sleepy town nestled deep in the heart of the bayou, with little more than a whispered rumor to her name.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Dev couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. The air was heavy with the scent of magnolias and decay, and the sounds of the night - frogs croaking, birds chirping - seemed to be closing in around her.

Dev had grown up on the wrong side of the tracks, raised by her grandmother, a feisty Cajun woman who taught her how to hunt, fish, and survive in a world that didn't always treat people like they were worth living. She had left Ravenswood after high school, seeking a fresh start, but the pull of home was strong.

Now, at 25, Dev Charpentier was back, driven by more than just curiosity about what her hometown looked like from the outside in. There had been whispers of a mysterious illness sweeping through the bayou, one that seemed to be targeting young women - and Dev's own sister, Nadine, had fallen ill before she could make it here.

As she walked, the streets grew narrower and more overgrown, until Dev was walking down a dirt path that led her straight into the heart of the swamp. The air thickened with mist, and she felt the weight of history bearing down upon her.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the trees - a young man, his face chiseled in the same granite-hard lines as Dev's own reflection stared back at her from the window of her childhood bedroom. It was Étienne LaFleur, a boy from a neighboring parish who had been like a brother to Dev growing up.

"What are you doing here?" he asked, his voice low and urgent.

Dev smiled wryly, her eyes never leaving his face. "I'm looking for answers," she said finally. "For Nadine."

Étienne's gaze softened, and for an instant, Dev saw the young boy again, rather than the man who had been her confidant all these years.
