Devon "Dev" Walker was a man on a mission. A former Army Ranger turned private investigator, he had seen his fair share of battles and bad guys. But nothing could have prepared him for the case that walked in off the street one rainy afternoon.

Lily Greenleaf, a young and beautiful socialite, stood outside Dev's office, her eyes red-rimmed from crying. She explained that her sister, Sarah, had gone missing three days prior, leaving behind only a cryptic message on her phone: "They're watching me." Dev's instincts kicked in, and he knew he was in.

As he listened to Lily's story, Dev's mind began to piece together the clues. He started by reviewing the security footage from Sarah's apartment building, searching for any sign of suspicious activity. But every lead seemed to end in a dead-end.

Undeterred, Dev decided to pay a visit to Sarah's ex-boyfriend, Alex Harris. A smooth-talking entrepreneur with a shady past, Alex had a reputation for being ruthless when it came to getting what he wanted. Dev arrived at Alex's office, his eyes scanning the room for any signs of discomfort. Alex seemed nervous, but Dev wasn't convinced.

Over a cup of coffee, Dev grilled Alex about Sarah's disappearance. The ex-boyfriend claimed innocence, but Dev noticed a faint tremble in his hands as he spoke. It was all the evidence Dev needed to know that Alex was hiding something.

As the sun began to set, Dev left Alex's office with more questions than answers. He knew he had to dig deeper, to uncover the truth behind Sarah's disappearance. With his trusty notebook and a fierce determination, Devon "Dev" Walker was ready to take on whatever lay ahead. The game was on, and Dev was determined to find out who was watching Lily Greenleaf â€“ or her sister, for that matter.
