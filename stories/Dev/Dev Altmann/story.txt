As a young reporter at a small newspaper in the Midwest, Dev had already made a name for himself with his exposés on corruption and abuse of power. But it wasn't until he landed a job at a major metropolitan paper that his talents truly began to shine.

One evening, while researching a story on corporate tax avoidance, Dev stumbled upon an intriguing tip: a prominent businessman was hiding assets in a small offshore island nation.
