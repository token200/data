Born in Helsinki, Finland, to a family of musicians, Jonas grew up surrounded by the sounds of guitars, drums, and keyboards. His parents, both classically trained musicians, encouraged him to explore his own creative voice from an early age. As Jonas Nieminen wandered through his teenage years, he discovered the world of punk rock and indie music, finding solace in its raw energy and rebellion.
