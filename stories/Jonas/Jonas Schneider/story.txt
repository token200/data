Born in Berlin, Germany, Jonas grew up surrounded by the city's vibrant music scene, where he honed his craft and developed his distinctive sound.

As a young man, Jonas Schneider spent countless hours jamming with fellow musicians, experimenting with different styles and collaborating on songs that reflected his eclectic tastes. He was particularly drawn to the works of Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, and Nick Drake, whose poetic lyrics and soaring melodies had a profound impact on his own songwriting.

After years of touring and recording, Jonas Schneider finally released his debut album, "Whispers in the Dark," to critical acclaim. The record's hauntingly beautiful ballads and driving rock tracks showcased Jonas' impressive range and emotional depth, earning him comparisons to some of music's greatest songwriters.
