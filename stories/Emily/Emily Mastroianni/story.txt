Emily Mastroianni had always been drawn to the world of art, and as she grew older, her passion only intensified. She spent countless hours honing her craft, experimenting with different mediums, and pushing herself to new creative heights.

As a senior in college, Emily was determined to make a name for herself in the competitive world of fine art. She poured her heart and soul into each piece, pouring colors and textures onto canvas that seemed to come alive under her brushstrokes.
