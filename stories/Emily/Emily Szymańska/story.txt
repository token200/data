Emily Szymańska had always been drawn to the world of art. Growing up in a small town surrounded by rolling hills and farmland, she found solace in the creativity and self-expression that painting provided. As a child, Emily would spend hours with her grandmother, learning the intricacies of color theory and technique.

As she grew older, Emily's passion for art only intensified. She went on to study fine art at college, where she honed her skills and developed her own unique style.
