I couldn't find any information on a historical figure named Emily Ulpius Traianus. It's possible that this person is fictional or not well-known.

However, I can create a fictional story about a person with this name. Here it is:

In the 3rd century AD, in the Roman Empire, there lived a young woman named Emily Ulpius Traianus. She was born into a family of modest means, but her father, Marcus Ulpius, had served as a loyal administrator to Emperor Trajan himself. This connection had earned them a certain level of respect and influence within their community.

Emily's early life was marked by hardship and loss. Her mother had passed away when she was just a child, leaving her and her father alone in the world. Despite this, Emily proved to be a resourceful and determined young woman, using her intelligence and wit to navigate the challenges of growing up in a society dominated by men.

As she grew older, Emily began to develop a passion for learning, which was encouraged by her father and mentors. She studied law, medicine, and philosophy, becoming one of the first women of her time to pursue these traditional male-dominated fields.

Emily's talents eventually caught the attention of Emperor Trajan himself, who saw great potential in this young woman. He offered her a place at his court as a tutor to his own daughter, Julia Domna. Under Emily's guidance, Julia flourished, and soon she too became an accomplished scholar and leader.

As the years passed, Emily's reputation grew, earning her the nickname "the wise woman of Rome." Her advice was sought by emperors, senators, and nobles from all over the empire, and her insights were highly valued for their wisdom and insight.

Despite her many accomplishments, Emily remained humble and kind, always putting the needs of others before her own. She continued to serve as a trusted advisor to Julia Domna and later to other emperors, earning a place in history as one of Rome's most remarkable women.

Though I created this story for entertainment purposes, it is based on the historical context of the time period, when women like Trajan's daughter Julia Domna held significant power and influence within Roman society.
