Emily Svensson stood at the edge of the frozen lake, her eyes fixed on the distant figure of her sister, Lena. The cold wind whipped through her dark hair, but she didn't flinch, lost in thought as she had been for weeks.

Lena and Emily had always been close, despite their vastly different personalities. Lena was a free spirit, always chasing adventure and living in the moment. Emily, on the other hand, was more cautious, preferring to plan and analyze before acting. After their parents' death in a tragic accident when they were teenagers, the siblings had drifted apart, each trying to find their own way in the world.

As she watched Lena's figure grow smaller as she walked away from her, Emily felt a pang of regret. She had been so caught up in her own grief and guilt that she had pushed Lena away, not realizing how much her sister needed her.

Lena was struggling to come to terms with their new reality without their parents. She felt lost and adrift, like a boat without anchor or rudder. Emily knew that she couldn't fix everything for her sister, but she wanted to try.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the frozen landscape, Lena turned back towards Emily. Her eyes were red from crying, and her face was etched with worry. "Hey, sis," she said softly, as if afraid of being overheard.

"I'm sorry, Lena," Emily replied, feeling a lump form in her throat. "I've been so caught up in my own stuff that I forgot how much you need me."

Lena took a step closer, and Emily could see the exhaustion etched on her face. "You don't have to do anything, Em," she said, using the nickname only Lena used when they were kids. "Just being here for me means everything right now."

Emily smiled weakly, feeling a weight lift off her shoulders. She knew that she had a long way to go to make up for lost time, but with Lena by her side, she felt like she could face anything.

As the stars began to twinkle in the night sky, Emily and Lena stood together on the frozen lake, their arms around each other's shoulders. They didn't need words to understand what they were feeling â€“ just the quiet companionship of two people who had found their way back to each other, after all these years apart.
