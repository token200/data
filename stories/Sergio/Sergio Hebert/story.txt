A brilliant detective, he had spent years honing his skills in the city's darkest alleys and seedy underbelly.

One fateful evening, Sergio Alberto Hebert received a cryptic message from an unknown sender, summoning him to meet at the old clock tower on the outskirts of town. The note was simple: "Come alone, Sergio Alberto Hebert." Intrigued, he made his way to the appointed hour, his eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of danger.

In this treacherous world, only the most skilled and cunning detectives could succeed. And Sergio Alberto Hebert was determined to be one of them. With his sharp mind and quick reflexes, he would stop at nothing to unravel the tangled threads of The Phoenix's scheme, no matter how dark or complex it may become.
