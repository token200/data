Alaric Jones sat alone at the small café, nursing a lukewarm coffee. His mind was a thousand miles away, replaying the argument he'd had with his best friend, Alex, just hours before.

The two had been inseparable since childhood, but over the past year, Alaric had started to feel suffocated by Alex's constant need for validation and reassurance. It didn't help that Alex was also Alaric's only source of income as a struggling artist – every critique or rejection letter from publishers and galleries made Alex more anxious.

"Come on, Aric, you're better than this," Alex had said, his voice laced with desperation. "You've got talent pouring out of every pore. We need to get you into the right galleries."

Alaric couldn't help but feel frustrated – didn't Alex trust him enough? He'd always tried to support his friend's dreams, even when it meant giving up his own aspirations.

As he sat at the café, Alaric's thoughts turned to his childhood. Growing up, his parents had encouraged his love of art, providing him with a small studio space in their attic. But as he entered adulthood, reality set in – his family couldn't support him financially, and he was forced to take on odd jobs to make ends meet.

Alex, on the other hand, had always been driven by a desire for success. Their friendship had been built on a foundation of mutual support, but lately, Alaric felt like Alex was using him as a safety net rather than valuing their partnership as an equal.

Just then, the café door swung open and Alex walked in, his eyes scanning the room until they landed on Alaric's table. He slid into the chair across from him, his smile faltering for a moment before he forced it back onto his face.

"Hey, sorry about earlier," he said, trying to sound casual. "I just got caught up in my own anxiety."

Alaric sighed, rubbing his temples. Maybe they could have this conversation later when emotions weren't running so high. For now, all he wanted was some space and time to figure out who he was outside of Alex's expectations.

"I need some air," Alaric said finally, pushing back from the table. "Meet me at my place in an hour? We'll talk about this then."

Alex nodded, his expression softening slightly as he watched Alaric stand up and walk away from the table. For a moment, Alaric wondered if their friendship could survive its latest crisis – or if it was time to forge a new path, one that didn't rely on Alex's approval for validation.
