Alaric Neumann, a man with a reputation for being one step ahead of the law, sat in his dimly lit office, puffing on a cigarette. His piercing green eyes scanned the room, as if daring anyone to make a move against him.

As a former art thief, Alaric had always been drawn to the finer things in life - and he was more than willing to take risks to get them. His latest mark, a priceless artifact from an ancient civilization, now sat safely on his mantlepiece, surrounded by other ill-gotten gains.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. Alaric's instincts kicked in, and he reached for the gun hidden beneath his desk. "Who is it?" he growled.

Alaric watched with interest as Lena flashed her famous smile at whatever was on the other side of the door. Ah, perfect - another plaything for him to swoop in and snatch away.

Lena slipped back into the room, a smug look on her face. "It's our new partner," she said, dropping onto the couch beside Alaric.

Alaric raised an eyebrow at the newcomer - but what he saw took his breath away. A young and ambitious thief, with eyes that matched his own green intensity...
