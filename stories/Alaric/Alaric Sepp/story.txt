Alaric Sebastian Sepp was not your average artist. Born in a small village surrounded by rolling hills and verdant forests, he grew up with a passion for music that rivaled his love for the natural world. As a child, Alaric would often sneak away from his chores to play his violin under the starry night sky.

As he matured, Alaric's talent became increasingly evident, and people began to take notice of the young musician. He started performing in local taverns and festivals, earning coins for his music while spreading joy wherever he went.

One evening, a wealthy patron approached Alaric with an offer: he wanted the musician to create a commissioned piece for his grand ball. The catch was that the music had to be perfect – no room for error or imperfection.
