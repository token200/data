Alaric Leblanc trudged through the crowded streets of New Orleans, her eyes scanning the scene before her with a practiced air of detachment. As a private investigator, she'd seen it all - from high-stakes heists to low-down lies and deceitful schemes.

Born Alaric Louise Leblanc, Alaric had always been drawn to the darker side of life. Growing up in the city's rougher neighborhoods, she'd learned early on how to rely only on herself. Her parents had been killed in a brutal gang war when she was just a teenager, leaving her with no other option but to forge her own path.

Now, as a skilled investigator, Alaric had made a name for herself in the city's underworld. She took on cases that others wouldn't touch - the ones that involved secrets, corruption, and betrayal. Her reputation was built on one thing: getting results, no matter what it took.

As she walked, her gaze landed on a small café tucked away on a side street. She had an appointment with a mysterious client who claimed to have information about a high-profile case. Alaric pushed open the door, and the bell above it let out a soft jingle. The air inside was thick with smoke and the scent of coffee.

The client, a young woman with piercing green eyes, sat at a small table in the corner. She beckoned to Alaric, who slid into the seat across from her. "So, Miss Leblanc," she said, her voice low and husky, "I think I might have some information that could help you crack this case."

Alaric leaned forward, her eyes locked on the woman's. She pulled out a notebook and pen, ready to take notes. "What is it?" she asked, her voice sharp with anticipation.

The woman hesitated, glancing around the café before leaning in close. "I think someone close to you, Alaric Leblanc, might be hiding something," she said, her eyes never leaving Alaric's face. Alaric felt a jolt of surprise run through her - how did this woman know her name? She leaned forward, intrigued, as the woman continued to speak.

And with that, the game was on.
