Alaric Ruiz García sat at his desk, sipping his lukewarm coffee, staring blankly at the spreadsheet in front of him. As the CEO of Ruiz Enterprises, one would think he had it all - wealth, power, and a successful company to boot. But beneath the surface, Alaric was suffocating under the weight of expectation.

Growing up, Alaric's parents had always pushed him to excel. His father, a hardworking man who had built their business from scratch, expected nothing but success from his son. And so, Alaric had devoted himself to the family business, often at the cost of his own happiness. He had sacrificed relationships, hobbies, and even friendships for the sake of his career.

As he poured over the numbers, Alaric couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. Sales were down, profits were dwindling, and yet, the company's stock prices remained steady. It was as if the world was blind to the rot at the heart of Ruiz Enterprises.

Just then, his phone rang. It was his mother, calling to check in on him. Alaric hesitated, feeling a pang of guilt for not having called her himself. He knew she would be disappointed if he didn't meet the sales targets she had set for him. "Mamá, I'm working as hard as I can," he said, trying to sound confident.

His mother's voice was laced with concern on the other end of the line. "Alaric, you need to take care of yourself too. You can't just push through like this forever."

For a moment, Alaric felt a crack in his facade. He had always been so careful, so controlled, but hearing his mother's words made him realize that he couldn't keep living like this.

That night, Alaric closed the office and took a long walk down by the river. The cool breeze off the water was a welcome respite from the tension building inside him. As he walked, he felt the weight of expectation slowly lifting. He realized that success wasn't just about money or power; it was about being true to himself.

When he returned home, Alaric made a decision. He would take a step back from the company, re-evaluate his priorities, and start over. It wouldn't be easy, but for the first time in years, he felt like he could breathe again. The spreadsheet on his desk would have to wait; it was time for Alaric Ruiz García to rediscover himself.
