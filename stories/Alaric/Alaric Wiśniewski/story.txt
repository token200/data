Alaric Wiśniewski stepped off the crowded bus and onto the crumbling sidewalk, the smell of stale cigarettes and yesterday's trash clinging to his trench coat like a damp shroud. He lit a cigarette, feeling the familiar sting of nicotine as he scanned the rundown diner across the street.

It was a haven for misfits and outcasts, a place where the city's invisible castaways could gather to swap stories and share secrets. Alaric had been coming here for years, ever since his days as a struggling artist in Poland had finally run dry. He'd left with nothing but a suitcase full of dreams and a burning desire to make it big in America.

Now, at 30, he was still waiting.

The diner's neon sign flickered like a firefly as Alaric pushed open the door, a bell above it ringing out like a tired laugh. The waitress, a gruff woman with a face like worn leather, looked up from her phone and raised an eyebrow.

"Alaric, what brings you back?"

"Just grabbing a coffee," he said, sliding onto a stool at the counter. "I needed a break from the city."

The waitress snorted. "You're one of those guys who thinks they can escape it all, huh?"

Alaric smiled wryly. "Maybe. But sometimes it feels like I'm just running in place."

As he waited for his coffee to arrive, Alaric's eyes wandered around the diner, taking in the familiar faces and the faint scent of desperation that clung to them like a bad habit. There was Miko, the pianist with fingers that could coax beauty from the most discordant notes; Rachel, the poet with a voice that could freeze your blood; and Jack, the old sailor who still told tales of the sea as if it were yesterday.

They all came here for the same reason Alaric did – to escape the weight of their own expectations. To find solace in the anonymity of strangers who understood what it was like to be lost in the void.

As he sipped his coffee, a young woman with a bright pink mohawk and a sleeve of tattoos slid onto the stool beside him. "Mind if I join you?" she asked, flashing a gap-toothed grin.

Alaric smiled back. "Not at all."

For the first time in months, he felt like he was exactly where he was meant to be – among people who saw the world for what it was: messy, beautiful, and forever incomplete.
