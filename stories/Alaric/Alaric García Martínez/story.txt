"Alaric García Martínez," Javier said, his voice low and gravelly. "I see you're still sniffing around for leads on the art thefts."

Alaric nodded, his eyes locked onto Javier's. "Yeah, I've been investigating for weeks. But I need something concrete to take back to my editor."

Javier leaned in, his breath hot against Alaric's ear. "I may have something," he whispered. "A source close to one of the thieves has come forward with some information."

As Javier handed over a small USB drive, Alaric's eyes widened with excitement. He plugged it into his laptop and began to scroll through the files.
