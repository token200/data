One day, Alaric Ming-che received a cryptic message from an anonymous source, hinting at a high-stakes heist in progress. The note read: "Meet me at 10 PM on Victoria Peak. Come alone." Intrigued, Alaric Ming-che arrived at the designated location, his eyes scanning the crowded rooftop for any signs of trouble.

As he made his way to the edge, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was a woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair, dressed in a sleek black jumpsuit. She introduced herself as Lena, the mastermind behind the heist. Alaric Ming-che listened intently as she revealed her plan: stealing a priceless artifact from the Hong Kong Museum of History.

Lena proposed an unusual partnership to Alaric Ming-che: work together to foil her own plans and collect the reward money.
