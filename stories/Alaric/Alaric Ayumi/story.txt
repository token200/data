Alaric Ayumi trudged through the mist-shrouded streets, his eyes scanning the deserted alleys for any sign of movement. As a former member of the prestigious organization, The Division, he had grown disillusioned with their tactics and motives. Now, he wandered the city alone, taking on small-time jobs to survive.

Tonight was no different. His latest gig was to retrieve a rare artifact from an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. Alaric's earpiece crackled to life as his handler, Maya, briefed him on the job.

"Be careful, Alaric," she warned. "We've had reports of rival gangs and possibly some rogue agents lurking around that area."

Alaric nodded silently, even though he knew Maya couldn't see him. He arrived at the warehouse, a dilapidated building that seemed to lean precariously against its neighbors.

With a deep breath, Alaric crept inside, his eyes adjusting to the darkness. The air was thick with dust and the stench of rotting garbage. He moved swiftly through the maze-like corridors, avoiding broken glass and twisted metal as he navigated towards his target.

Suddenly, a noise echoed from deeper in the warehouse. Alaric froze, listening intently. It sounded like footsteps, but they were light and stealthy – not the heavy tread of security patrols.

Without hesitation, Alaric crept forward, gun drawn. He burst into a room filled with stacks of crates and boxes, where he spotted his target: an ornate box adorned with strange symbols and hieroglyphs.

But what caught Alaric's attention wasn't the artifact itself – it was the figure standing beside it, cloaked in shadows. For a moment, they locked eyes, and Alaric felt a jolt of recognition.

"Who are you?" he demanded, his voice firm but controlled.

The figure hesitated before stepping forward, revealing an uncanny resemblance to Alaric himself – or at least, the person he used to be.

"I'm someone who knows what it means to walk away from The Division," the doppelganger replied, a sly smile spreading across their face. "And I'm here to offer you a choice: join me, and we can take down The Division together – or watch each other burn."

Alaric hesitated for a moment before the artifact slipped from his grasp, lost in the shadows as he made up his mind.
