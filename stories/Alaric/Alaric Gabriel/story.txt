The streets were always alive with energy when Alaric Gabriel walked through them. As the leader of the supernatural hunters known as The Vampire Hunters Inc., he exuded confidence and authority. His piercing green eyes seemed to bore into those he met, sizing them up for any sign of weakness.

Alaric's thoughts were interrupted by a sudden snap from his earpiece. "We have a situation at the old warehouse on 5th and Main," his second-in-command, Sebastian, said. "Reports are coming in that a vampire has been spotted lurking around the area."

Without hesitation, Alaric set off towards the warehouse, his hand resting on the grip of his trusty crossbow. He had dealt with vampires for years, but he never got complacent. The creatures were relentless and always adapting.

As he approached the warehouse, Alaric could feel a chill run down his spine. This one seemed different - there was an aura of menace about it that made his skin crawl. He entered the dimly lit building cautiously, scanning the shadows for any sign of movement.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the darkness. It was a tall, imposing figure with piercing eyes and razor-sharp fangs. Alaric's grip on his crossbow tightened as he prepared to strike. But as he looked into the vampire's eyes, he saw something unexpected - recognition.

This was no ordinary vampire. In fact, it was none other than Valois, a vampire from the 16th century who had crossed paths with Alaric in the past. The two had a long history of battles, and this one promised to be no exception.

"Valois," Alaric said, his voice low and even. "I didn't think you'd ever show your face again."

The vampire smiled, revealing sharp teeth. "You'll never stop me, Gabriel," it hissed, before launching itself at Alaric with a ferocity that sent him flying across the room.

With his quick reflexes, Alaric managed to get back to his feet and prepare for the battle ahead. He knew this would be one fight he wouldn't forget anytime soon.
