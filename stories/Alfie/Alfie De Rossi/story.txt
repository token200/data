Alfie De Rossi stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the crowded station for any sign of his contact. As a private investigator, he'd been hired by a wealthy businessman to find a missing person - and Alfie had a reputation for being one of the best in the business.

He spotted a figure waiting by the exit, a tall, imposing man with a scruffy beard and a baseball cap pulled low over his eyes. "Alfie?" he said, as Alfie approached him.

"That's me," Alfie replied, extending a hand. The man shook it firmly. "I'm Vinnie. My boss sent me to pick you up."

Vinnie led Alfie to a sleek black sedan parked in the station's lot. As they drove through the city, Alfie pulled out his phone and dialed a number.

"Hey, Sal," he said, when his friend answered on the first ring. "I'm with Vinnie now. What've you got for me?"

Sal's voice was low and gravelly. "We found something, Alfie. A cryptic message that suggests our guy might be alive."

Alfie's eyes narrowed. "What does it say?"

"The sender claims to have seen him in a small town just outside the city limits," Sal replied. "But there's something strange - the message is signed with an initials 'A.D.' We think it might be Alfie De Rossi himself."

Alfie raised an eyebrow. "Me? What are you talking about, Sal?"

"That's what we're trying to figure out," Sal said dryly. "It's possible that our guy has been playing a long game all along - using your name to throw us off his trail."

As the sedan pulled up to a small town just outside the city limits, Alfie felt a thrill of excitement. This could be it - the break he'd been waiting for.

He and Vinnie got out of the car, and Alfie's eyes scanned the streets as they walked towards the local police station. "Sal, I need that message on my phone," he said, pulling up his phone to scroll through emails.

As he read the cryptic message, a shiver ran down Alfie's spine. Was it possible that this was indeed him? He looked around at the sleepy town, wondering what lay ahead.

Vinnie nudged him with an elbow. "Hey, you okay?"

Alfie hesitated for a moment before answering. "I think we've got some answers coming our way," he said, his eyes never leaving the message on his phone.
