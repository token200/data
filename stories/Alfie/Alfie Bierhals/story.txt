Alfie Bierhals was known for his quick wit and sharp tongue in the small town of Willow Creek. As the owner of the local pub, The Red Lion, he had a reputation for being able to talk his way out of (or into) just about any situation.

Despite his charming exterior, Alfie's personal life was a bit of a mess. His latest relationship had ended in a messy breakup, and he found himself alone on Valentine's Day once again. As he poured a pint for the evening's first customer, he couldn't help but feel like the luckiest man alive – or so he told himself.

Just then, the door swung open and his best friend, Emily, walked in, looking lovelier than ever. "Happy Valentine's Day, Alfie!" she called out, her eyes sparkling with mischief. Alfie groaned inwardly, knowing that Emily was always up to something.

Over a plate of fish and chips, Emily filled Alfie in on the latest gossip from around town – including the news that their old friend, Jack, had finally mustered up the courage to ask his coworker out on a date. As Alfie listened, he couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy; why did everyone else seem to have love in their lives, while he was still flying solo?

But as the night wore on and the pub began to fill with laughter and chatter, Alfie's thoughts turned to his own prospects for finding love. And then, just as he was starting to lose hope, Emily dropped a bombshell: "I heard that Tom from the bakery is looking for someone special... want me to set you two up?"

Alfie's eyes widened in surprise, but before he could say anything, Emily had already swooped off to make a few discreet inquiries. As he watched her go, Alfie couldn't help but smile – maybe, just maybe, this was the start of something new for him and his trusty sidekick, Alfie Bierhals, after all.
