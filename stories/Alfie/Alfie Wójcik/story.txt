Just as Alfie was finishing up the final touches on the campaign, his phone rang. It was his best friend, Mateusz, calling to invite him out for a night on the town. Alfie hesitated for a moment before agreeing, knowing that he needed a break from screens and creative stimulation. He closed his laptop and met Mateusz at a trendy bar in the city center.

The fresh air and exercise invigorated Alfie W贸jcik, readying him for another productive day ahead.
