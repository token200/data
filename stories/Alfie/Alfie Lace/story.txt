Alfie Lace sat alone in his dimly lit flat, surrounded by memories of better days. The worn armchair creaked beneath him as he let out a heavy sigh, the sound echoing through the empty rooms. His eyes drifted towards the old photograph on the mantlepiece - a picture of himself and his late wife, Alice.

It was hard to believe it had been five years since she passed away. Alfie Lace couldn't shake off the feeling of loneliness that had settled in his chest like a thick fog. He remembered the way Alice used to laugh at his jokes, the way her eyes sparkled when he told her a good story. It was as if she was still with him, watching over him from wherever she was.

As he gazed around the flat, Alfie Lace's mind began to wander back to their life together. They had met in the pub where he worked, and it was love at first sight - or so he thought. Over the years, they built a life filled with laughter, arguments, and late-night conversations about nothing in particular. But now, it all seemed like a distant memory.

Alfie Lace's eyes landed on the old guitar leaning against the wall. He hadn't picked it up since Alice passed away. The strings were dull and rusty from disuse, but something compelled him to plug it in and strum a few chords. The music that flowed from his fingers was melancholic and haunting, a reflection of his sorrow.

As the notes faded away, Alfie Lace felt a lump form in his throat. He thought about all the things he would never get to do with Alice - travel, have children, grow old together. The pain was overwhelming, but it was also a reminder of the life they had built and the love that remained even after she was gone.

In the silence, Alfie Lace felt Alice's presence around him, as if she was whispering words of comfort in his ear. He smiled wistfully, knowing that she would always be with him, watching over him from beyond. The memory of their life together filled his heart with a mix of sadness and gratitude, and for the first time in months, Alfie Lace felt a glimmer of hope.
