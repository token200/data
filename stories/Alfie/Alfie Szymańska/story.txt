Alfie Szymańska sat at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of invoices in front of him. As the owner of Szymańska's Auto Repair, he had always prided himself on being a hands-on business owner, but lately, the books had been weighing heavily on his mind.

As he tallied up the day's earnings, Alfie couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The shop had seen a steady stream of customers all week, and yet, he couldn't seem to make ends meet. His wife, Barbara, would have a fit if she knew how worried he was about the shop's finances.

Just then, his best friend and mechanic, Leo, poked his head into the office. "Hey, boss, you look like you've lost your last dollar," he said with a chuckle.

Alfie sighed, rubbing his temples. "I don't know how we're going to make it through the end of the month, Leo."

Leo leaned against the desk, eyeing the stack of invoices. "Maybe we should take a closer look at these numbers. What's eating into our profits?"

Together, they pored over the books, searching for any hidden expenses or areas where they could cut costs. It wasn't long before they discovered that one of their most loyal customers had been taking advantage of them, consistently asking for special deals and discounts.

With Leo's help, Alfie was able to renegotiate the terms of their contract and start making some much-needed changes. By the end of the month, Szymańska's Auto Repair was in the black, thanks in large part to Leo's sharp business sense.

As they sat back down at the desk, sipping cold beers and celebrating their small victory, Alfie turned to Leo with a grin. "You're not just a mechanic, my friend – you're a financial wizard."

Leo chuckled, shaking his head. "It's all about keeping our customers happy and our books balanced, Alfie. Now let's get back to work and keep the shop running smoothly."

As they high-fived, Alfie felt a weight lift off his shoulders. With Leo by his side, he knew that Szymańska's Auto Repair would be just fine – as long as he kept his eyes on the bottom line.
