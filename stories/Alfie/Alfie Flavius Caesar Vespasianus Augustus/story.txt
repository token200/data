With his quick wit and sharp tongue, he quickly won over many of the high-ranking officials who had once doubted him. As he walked through the halls, he would often catch a glimpse of himself in mirrors and smile, knowing that one day, he would be remembered as Alfie Flavius Caesar Vespasianus Augustus, the greatest leader Rome had ever known.

Years went by, and Alfie's reputation grew. He became known for his wisdom and fairness, earning the respect of his peers and the admiration of the people.
