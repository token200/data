Alfie Sarniano was an enigmatic figure, known only by his striking features and razor-sharp wit. He walked into the dimly lit bar, weaving past the patrons with ease, as if he owned the place. The bartender, a gruff but affable man named Gus, raised an eyebrow as Alfie slid onto the stool.

"What can I get you, Alfie?" Gus asked, his tone dripping with familiarity.

"Just the usual," Alfie replied, flashing a disarming smile. "A whiskey, neat."

Gus nodded and slid a glass down the counter, expertly pouring a generous measure of fine scotch into a crystal glass.

As Alfie sipped his drink, he observed the bar patrons with an air of detachment, as if studying specimens in a taxidermy lab. There was something unnerving about him, yet, at the same time, you couldn't help but be drawn to him like a moth to flame.

The door swung open, and a young woman stumbled into the bar, her eyes wild and disheveled. Gus immediately sprang into action, ushering her onto the stool next to Alfie. She introduced herself as Sophie, and Alfie's gaze flickered toward her, his expression softening ever so slightly.

"I'm fine," Sophie said, collapsing onto her chair like a deflated balloon. "Just...I need a drink."

Alfie reached for the bottle of scotch, pouring her a generous measure. As she sipped it, her eyes began to clear, and she looked up at Alfie with an unsettling intensity.

"You're not like anyone I've ever met," Sophie said, her voice low and husky. "There's something...hidden beneath the surface."

Alfie raised an eyebrow, intrigued by her words. For a moment, their gazes locked, and you could almost see the invisible threads connecting them.

Gus cleared his throat, reminding himself that he was there for the tips, not to indulge in the bar's patrons' personal dramas. "Time to go," Sophie said abruptly, tossing a few bills on the counter.

As she stumbled out of the bar, Alfie called after her, his voice carrying into the night air. "Sophie?"

She turned back, her eyes flashing with unease. "What is it?"

"Meet me tomorrow at midnight," Alfie replied, his expression glinting in the dim light. "I have something to show you."

With that, Sophie vanished into the darkness, leaving Alfie to nurse his drink and ponder the enigma of his latest obsession.

As Gus watched him, he couldn't shake the feeling that Alfie was a storm brewing on the horizon, with no clear warning signs or safe harbor in sight.
