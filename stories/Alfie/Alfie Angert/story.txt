Alfie Angert was a man shrouded in mystery. Few people knew much about him, except that he had a reputation for being one of the most cunning and resourceful jewel thieves in London's underworld.

Rumors swirled around his exploits, with some claiming he had once stolen the Crown Jewels themselves. Others whispered that he was working for the government, using his skills to pull off high-stakes heists while leaving a trail of fake clues behind him.

But one thing was certain: Alfie Angert always seemed to be one step ahead of the law. His exploits were always meticulously planned, with every detail calculated to perfection. He had an uncanny ability to blend in and read people like a book, making it impossible for anyone to catch him off guard.

Despite his tough exterior, there was something almost vulnerable about Alfie. A look into his piercing green eyes would reveal a flicker of emotion, a hint that he wasn't as heartless as the rest of the world thought.

One night, Alfie received a mysterious message from an old flame, inviting him to meet at an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. She claimed she had information about his latest mark - a priceless diamond necklace worth millions.

As Alfie arrived at the warehouse, he spotted her waiting in the shadows, her eyes gleaming with a mixture of mischief and desperation. "Alfie," she purred, "I'm glad you came. I have something to tell you."

She handed him a small note, scribbled on a piece of paper in bold red ink: "The necklace is already gone. But I know where it's hidden. And if you want it back, meet me at the old clock tower at midnight."

Alfie's eyes narrowed as he folded the note and tucked it into his pocket. He had an inkling that this was more than just a simple trap set by his former lover. Something much bigger was at play here.

He turned to leave, but his ex-lover's voice stopped him cold: "Wait, Alfie. I have one condition: you must promise me you'll take care of someone for me."

Alfie spun back around, his eyes glinting with a mixture of curiosity and warning: "Who?"

His ex-lover just smiled enigmatically before vanishing into the night, leaving Alfie with more questions than answers.
