Alfie Rivera stepped onto the sun-kissed streets of Santa Monica, California, feeling the warm rays dance across her face. As a freelance journalist, she had grown accustomed to the eclectic rhythm of this coastal town, where artists and entrepreneurs mingled with surfers and beachgoers.

A self-proclaimed free spirit, Alfie Rivera was always on the lookout for the next great story. With her wild mane of curly hair and expressive green eyes, she had a way of drawing people in, coaxing confidences from even the most reclusive sources. Her latest assignment had led her to a small, family-owned bakery on Main Street, where the sweet scent of freshly baked bread wafted out into the air.
