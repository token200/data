Amalia Renault stood at the edge of the rooftop, her dark hair whipping in the wind as she gazed out at the city below. The lights of the skyscrapers twinkled like diamonds scattered across the night sky, a reminder that even in the darkness, there was always something to be seen.

As a detective with the NYPD's Special Investigations Unit, Amalia Renault had spent countless nights like this one, staring down into the abyss and wondering what secrets lay hidden beneath the surface.

As the sun began to rise over the towering skyscrapers, casting a golden glow over the city, Amalia Renault smiled grimly to herself.
