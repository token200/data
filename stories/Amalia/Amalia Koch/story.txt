Despite her success, Amalia Koch remained humble and grounded. She continued to draw inspiration from the world around her, often incorporating personal symbols and motifs into her work. Her fans began to notice a recurring theme – the recurring use of birds in her art. Some speculated that these were more than just figurative representations; they might be messages from the artist's own subconscious.

One day, a prominent collector approached Amalia Koch with an offer to purchase one of her most prized pieces.
