Amalia Martínez López woke up to the sound of her abuela's voice, calling out from the kitchen. "Buenos días, m'ija!" she said, as if it was still morning and not already mid-afternoon in late August. Amalia groggily opened one eye, then the other, to find that the old woman was standing at the door of her room, a steaming cup of coffee in hand.

"Mmm, gracias, Abuela," Amalia mumbled, taking the cup from her grandmother's hands and inhaling the aromatic scent. She sat up, rubbing the sleep from her eyes, and swung her legs over the side of the bed.

Abuela Sofia smiled and patted Amalia's shoulder. "You're going to be late for your shift at the shop, m'ija. Your mother is getting anxious."

Amalia groaned, throwing off the covers and standing up to begin her morning routine. She lived in a small apartment with her mother, who was a seamstress, and her grandmother, who had moved in after her husband passed away. Amalia loved living with them, but sometimes she felt like she was trapped in a world of tradition and expectation.

She brushed her long dark hair, which fell down her back like a waterfall, and got dressed in the worn jeans and plain white shirt that were her uniform at the local boutique where she worked as a sales associate. Abuela Sofia handed her a small bag with a sandwich and some fruit for lunch.

"Vaya con Dios, m'ija," Abuela said, placing a gentle kiss on Amalia's forehead. "I'll see you tonight."

Amalia waved goodbye to her grandmother and headed out the door to catch the bus that would take her to work. As she rode through the city, she watched the crowded streets come alive with people rushing to get where they needed to go. She loved this time of day, when the world seemed full of possibilities.

At the shop, Amalia's mother, María Elena, was already working on a new design for a wedding dress. "Hola, m'ija," she said, smiling at her daughter as she hung up the keys and headed to change out of her uniform apron. "I'm almost done with this one – it's going to be stunning."

Amalia admired the intricate embroidery that covered every inch of the bodice. Her mother was an artist, and Amalia felt a pang of jealousy whenever she saw her creations. Why couldn't she be as talented?

As she began work on the cash register, a customer came in asking for help finding the perfect outfit for a summer wedding. Amalia listened attentively as they described their vision – something simple yet elegant, preferably with a floral pattern.

She scanned the racks of dresses and tops, her eyes scanning the designs until she spotted it: a beautiful pale blue sundress with white florals that seemed to dance across the fabric. "This one!" she exclaimed, holding up the dress for the customer's approval.

The woman gasped in delight, trying on the dress and turning in front of the mirror to admire herself. "It's perfect," she declared. "Thank you so much!"

Amalia beamed with pride as she rang up the sale and wrapped the dress in tissue paper. She loved making people happy like this – it was why she worked at the shop, after all.

When her shift ended, Amalia caught the bus back home, lost in thought as she rode through the city. Abuela Sofia had left a note on the kitchen table with a recipe for a traditional Cuban dish that Amalia's abuelo used to make for special occasions – ropa vieja, a tender beef stew cooked in tomato sauce.

She decided to surprise her mother by cooking dinner tonight instead of ordering takeout like they usually did. As she chopped onions and garlic at the kitchen counter, Abuela Sofia came over and began seasoning the meat.

"Mmm, you're making rópaa vieyaaa?" Abuela's eyes sparkled with delight as she sniffed the sizzling beef. "Your abuelo would be so proud."

Amalia smiled, feeling a connection to her roots that she often felt was lacking in her own life. Her parents had moved to Miami from Cuba when she was a child, but Amalia still held on to the stories and traditions of their ancestors.

The three of them sat down to eat together at six o'clock – María Elena, Abuela Sofia, and Amalia – enjoying the rich flavors of rópaa vieyaaa over steaming rice. For a moment, Amalia forgot about her doubts and fears, surrounded by the love and warmth of her family.

As they finished dinner and began cleaning up, María Elena put a hand on Amalia's shoulder. "M'ija, you're an amazing person – talented, smart, kind. Why do you always doubt yourself?"

Amalia looked down at her plate, feeling the sting of tears in her eyes. "Because I feel like I'm not good enough sometimes," she admitted.

Abuela Sofia leaned over and wrapped a gentle arm around Amalia's waist. "You are enough, m'ija. And if there's one thing your abuelo taught me before he left us, it was to never stop believing in yourself."

Amalia looked up at her grandmother, feeling the weight of their love and support wash over her like a wave. For tonight, at least, she felt seen – and enough.
