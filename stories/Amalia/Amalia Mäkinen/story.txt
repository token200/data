Enthralled by their skill and creativity, Amalia Mäkinen spent hours watching them weave their magic.

With a shiver of excitement, Amalia Mäkinen took to the stage, her shadow puppets dancing across the screen in perfect harmony with the beating of her heart. In that moment, she knew she had found her calling – and that nothing would ever be able to hold her back from pursuing her dreams.
