Despite her groundbreaking research and numerous accolades, Amalia remained a loner, preferring the company of stars to that of people. Her colleagues would often joke that she was as elusive as a comet, appearing briefly before vanishing into the shadows.

One fateful night, a catastrophic event struck Kazakhstan, threatening to destroy the fragile balance of the environment. The government scrambled to respond, but it was Amalia who possessed the knowledge and expertise to mitigate the damage.
