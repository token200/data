I couldn't find any information on a person named Tanaka Kortajarena. It's possible that this is a fictional or non-existent character.

However, I did find information on an actor named Tanaka K≈çji, but also known by his stage name, Tadanobu Asano (not Kortajarena), and also the Japanese singer and model Tanaka Junko  and also the Japanese idol and member of the boy band Arashi, Kazunari Tanaka.
