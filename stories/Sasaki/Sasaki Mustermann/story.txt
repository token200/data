Sasaki Mustermann agreed to help, and soon found himself surrounded by a flurry of activity as he got to work on creating an impressive array of ceramic flowers, lanterns, and other ornaments. Yumi proved to be a talented apprentice, quickly picking up Sasaki Mustermann's techniques and contributing her own unique flair to the designs.
