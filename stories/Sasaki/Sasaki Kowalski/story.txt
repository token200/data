I must inform you that I couldn't find any information on a historical or well-known figure named Sasaki Kowalski. It's possible that this person is fictional or not widely recognized.

However, I can create a story around a character with a unique name like Sasaki Kowalski. Here's a 400-word tale:

In the bustling streets of Tokyo, few people knew about the enigmatic Sasaki Kowalski. A master thief and forger, he had built a reputation as one of the most elusive con artists in the city. With an uncanny ability to create fake identities, forge documents, and pilfer priceless artifacts, Kowalski's exploits were the stuff of urban legend.

Kowalski's real name was never revealed, and his face remained hidden behind a silver mask with an intricately designed silver K. He wore it everywhere, from high-stakes poker games to exclusive art auctions, where he would effortlessly swipe masterpieces from under the noses of the wealthy collectors.

One fateful evening, Kowalski received a cryptic message from a mysterious client, requesting his presence at the Tokyo Museum of Antiquities. The message read: "The Phoenix is rising; claim your due." Intrigued, Kowalski accepted the challenge and made his way to the museum.

Upon arrival, he discovered a stunning ancient statue, adorned with symbols of fire and rebirth. As he examined it, the curator approached him with an unexpected proposal. "Sasaki Kowalski," she said, her voice barely above a whisper, "we've been searching for someone like you for years. The statue is a rare relic from the Shinto era; however, its true value lies not in its monetary worth but in its symbolic significance."

Kowalski's eyes narrowed as he pondered the curator's words. Was this another scheme to swindle him, or was there something more at play? He decided to take a chance and accept the artifact, knowing that his reputation would be forever linked to it.

As Kowalski vanished into the night, clutching the Phoenix statue in his hand, whispers began circulating among Tokyo's underworld. Some claimed he had finally been caught; others speculated about the secrets hidden within the relic's intricate designs. The enigmatic Sasaki Kowalski remained elusive, always one step ahead of his pursuers.

And so, the legend grew, with the silver-masked thief and his mythical Phoenix statue becoming a byword for mystery and deception in Tokyo's streets.
