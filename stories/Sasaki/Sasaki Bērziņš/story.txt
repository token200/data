One day, while wandering through the streets, Sasaki Bērziņš stumbled upon a small art gallery tucked away in a quiet alley. The owner, an elderly woman named Yumi, took notice of his sketchbook and was immediately impressed by his talent. She offered him a spot to showcase his work, and soon Sasaki Bērziņš's paintings were on display for all to see.

As word of his art spread, people began to flock to the gallery to catch a glimpse of the Latvian artist's vibrant creations.
