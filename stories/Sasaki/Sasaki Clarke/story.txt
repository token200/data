Sasaki Clarke stepped into the dimly lit tavern, her eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As a skilled mercenary, she had seen it all – from the bloodiest battles to the most cunning heists. But tonight, Sasaki Clarke was on a mission to gather information about a mysterious organization rumored to be hiding in the shadows.

She made her way to the bar, ordering a whiskey as she struck up a conversation with the bartender. "Rumor has it, there's a new player in town," she said, her voice low and even. "Something big."

The bartender nodded, wiping down the counter with a dirty rag. "You mean the Phoenix Order? I've heard whispers about them too."

Sasaki Clarke's ears perked up – this was exactly what she had been looking for. She pulled out a small pouch of coins from her pocket and tossed it onto the bar. "Tell me more," she said, her eyes locked on the bartender.

The man hesitated, glancing around the room nervously before leaning in close. "I've heard they're led by a powerful sorceress, one who wields magic like no other."

Sasaki Clarke's eyes narrowed – this was too good to be true. She had always been skeptical of magical abilities, but if there was even a chance that the Phoenix Order was real... she needed to know more.

She spent the next hour gathering information from various sources, each one confirming the existence of the sorceress and her order. It wasn't until late at night, when she finally stumbled upon a lead about a secret meeting place, that Sasaki Clarke knew she had found what she was looking for.

As she approached the abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town, her senses went on high alert – she could feel it in her bones that this was where the Phoenix Order would make its move. She crept inside, her eyes adjusting to the darkness as she scanned the room for any signs of movement.

And then, just as she thought she had found nothing but empty space, Sasaki Clarke saw her – a figure shrouded in shadows, standing at the center of the room with an air of confidence that commanded attention. "Who are you?" Sasaki Clarke demanded, her hand resting on the hilt of her sword.

The sorceress smiled, her eyes glinting like gold in the dim light. "I am Eriol, leader of the Phoenix Order," she said, her voice dripping with power and authority.
