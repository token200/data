Sasaki Schneider stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the cool mist of the mountain air enveloping her like a damp shroud. She had been away for so long, and now she was finally back in the place where it all began.

As she made her way through the quiet station, Sasaki couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her. This was where she had grown up, where she had learned to surf and ride the waves that crashed against the rugged coast. But most importantly, this was where she had met him - the boy who would change her life forever.

Sasaki's thoughts drifted back to Kaito, the love of her life. They had been inseparable as children, exploring the hidden coves and secret waterfalls of the island together. As they grew older, their feelings for each other only deepened. But fate had other plans, and they were torn apart by circumstance.

Sasaki's eyes wandered to a small shop across from the station, its windows filled with an assortment of sea shells and driftwood. It was her mother's place - a tiny beachside stall where she sold handmade crafts to tourists. Sasaki smiled to herself as she remembered helping her mother as a child, learning the intricacies of shell-carving and weaving.

As she walked towards the shop, a figure emerged from the doorway. It was Ryota, her childhood friend and confidant. "Sasaki-chan!" he exclaimed, embracing her warmly. "Welcome back!"

Sasaki laughed and hugged him in return. "Ryota-kun! It's been too long."

The two spent the rest of the afternoon catching up and reminiscing about old times. But beneath the surface, Sasaki could sense a change in Ryota - a newfound confidence that bordered on arrogance.

"Ryota," she said finally, as they walked along the beach. "What's going on? You seem different."

Ryota looked at her with a serious expression. "I've got news, Sasaki-chan. I'm leaving soon. I've been accepted into university, and I need to leave in two weeks."

Sasaki felt a pang of sadness, mixed with pride for Ryota's accomplishments. But as she gazed out at the sea, she knew that this was only the beginning of her own journey - one that would take her farther away from Kaito than she ever could have imagined.

"Go to university," Sasaki said softly. "Make something of yourself."

Ryota nodded, his eyes locked on hers. And in that moment, Sasaki knew that their bond was stronger than ever, a connection forged in the sand and sea that would stay with her forever.
