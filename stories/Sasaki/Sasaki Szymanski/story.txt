Sasaki Szymanski was an enigmatic figure in the small town of Willow Creek. By day, she worked as a librarian, surrounded by dusty tomes and whispered conversations. Few knew that beneath her reserved exterior lay a mind bursting with curiosity and creativity.

The listeners listened, entranced by the stories woven around a traditional tea ceremony, with delicate cups and saucers adorned with delicate patterns.

The meeting ended as it had begun – beneath a quiet moonlit sky. Szymanski packed up her easel, leaving behind a few finished canvases for those who'd been privileged to witness her art.
