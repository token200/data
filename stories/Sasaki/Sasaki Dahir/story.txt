I couldn't find any information on a historical or well-known figure named Sasaki Dahir. However, I believe you might be referring to Sayyid Muhammad Sadiq al-Sasani (also known as Sasa or Sadiq) - however, there is another possible person that may be more accurate. 

Sasaki Dahir was not widely documented in history books.
