Sasaki Lefevre stepped off the crowded train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the dimly lit station. The city outside was alive, but in this forgotten corner, time had slowed to a crawl. As he made his way through the deserted hallways, the only sound was the soft hum of fluorescent lights overhead.

He paused, studying the flickering signs above each door. Which one would it be? His latest lead had promised success, but so many others had turned out false. Lefevre let out a slow breath and began to pace, his mind racing with possibilities.

A lifetime ago, he'd been an ambitious young man, driven by the promise of adventure. He'd followed every trail, no matter how tenuous, only to find disappointment waiting around each corner. Yet, still he persisted. There was something about this game that drew him in – a morbid fascination with the unknown.

He stopped at a door marked "Rental Office". The phone on his desk crackled to life as soon as he touched it, and a low voice answered, its words slurred but unmistakable. Lefevre listened intently, his grip tightening around the receiver.

"Okay," he said finally, into the receiver's darkness. "I'll be right there." He hung up, pocketing the phone, and pushed open the creaky door to a room that smelled of stale coffee and dust.

The figure slumped in a chair, eyes heavy-lidded and worn down by years of waiting. They knew him; Lefevre had been here before, only once – but what a visit it had been. This one would be different. The promise of something was all that kept him going – the whispered rumors, the faded photographs, the half-forgotten names etched into the walls.

Lefevre dropped onto the worn couch beside them, his eyes never leaving the stranger's face. For a moment, they simply sat there, two lost souls adrift in this crumbling city. Then, with an air of resignation, he spoke – and their world would expand just a little further.

The words flowed from him like smoke on a winter breeze, a stream of half-remembered stories and scraps of truth that had been buried deep within the walls of this forgotten place.
