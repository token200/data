I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Sasaki Kortajarena. It's possible that this character does not exist in any notable stories, books, or media.

However, I can suggest some alternatives:

1. If you'd like, I can create a short story about a fictional character with a similar name (e.g., Sasaki Kaito). Please let me know if you have any specific preferences for the character's background, personality, or plot.
2. Alternatively, I can help you come up with a backstory and characteristics for a new character named Sasaki Kortajarena. Would you like to provide some hints about what kind of story you'd like this character to be part of?

Please let me know which option you prefer, and I'll do my best to create an engaging story for you!
