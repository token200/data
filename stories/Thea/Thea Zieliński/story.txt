Thea Zieliński had always been fascinated by the world of music. Growing up in a small town in Poland, she was surrounded by the sounds of traditional folk music and the rhythms of the city's vibrant nightlife. As a child, Thea would often sneak into her older brother's room to listen to his vinyl records, mesmerized by the way the needle would glide across the grooves.

As she grew older, Thea's love for music only deepened. She began playing the piano at the age of six and soon became hooked on the instrument. Her parents, noticing her passion, encouraged her to pursue a career in music. Thea Zieliński spent hours practicing, pouring her heart and soul into every piece she played.

After completing her studies at the prestigious Krakow Academy of Music, Thea set out to make a name for herself in the Polish music scene. She formed a band with some like-minded friends and soon found themselves playing sold-out shows across the country. Their unique blend of traditional folk and modern rock earned them a loyal following, and Thea Zieliński became known as one of Poland's most exciting young musicians.

But Thea's success wasn't without its challenges. She struggled to balance her music career with her personal life, often finding herself torn between her passion for performing and the pressures of fame. There were times when she felt like giving up, when the constant touring and promotion took a toll on her mental health.

Despite these struggles, Thea Zieliński persevered. She drew strength from her roots, using traditional Polish music to inspire her own creative vision. Her music became a reflection of her experiences as a young woman in Poland, tackling topics such as identity, culture, and social justice.
