Thea Järvinen stood alone on the frozen lake, her breath visible in the chilly air. She was a woman consumed by grief and anger, still trying to come to terms with the tragic loss of her sister, Linnéa. It had been three years since the accident, but the pain felt no less raw.

As she gazed out at the serene winter landscape, Thea's thoughts turned to the memories they had shared – the laughter, the adventures, and the quiet moments spent together in their childhood home. Her sister's smile was etched into her mind like a faded photograph, and Thea couldn't shake the feeling that Linnéa was still with her, watching over her from beyond.

Thea's eyes welled up as she remembered the letter she had found after Linnéa's passing – a heartfelt apology for not being more present in their sisterly bond. Tears streamed down her face as she recalled the words: "I'm sorry I wasn't there more often, Thea. I was so caught up in my own world."

As if summoned by her emotions, a gust of wind swept across the lake, disturbing the delicate balance of ice and water. Thea's eyes widened as a figure emerged from the fog – a woman with piercing blue eyes and a mischievous grin.

Linnéa?

Thea's heart skipped a beat as she took a step forward, her hand extended in a tentative gesture. Was this really her sister, or was it just her own grief playing tricks on her? The apparition smiled, its eyes sparkling with warmth, and began to walk towards Thea.

"You're still here," Linnéa whispered, her voice barely audible over the wind. "You're still holding onto me."

Thea's tears subsided as she reached out and wrapped her arms around Linnéa. In this fleeting moment, they were together again – reunited in a world of memories, love, and loss.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Thea felt a weight lift from her shoulders. She knew that even though Linnéa was no longer physically present, their bond remained strong, forged by the shared experiences and love they had for each other.

In this frozen landscape, Thea found solace in the memories of her sister – a reminder that even in death, love can be as powerful as life itself.
