Through her work, Thea López Rodríguez aimed to challenge the status quo and inspire change.

One of her most iconic pieces, "La Lucha Continúa," a sprawling installation featuring hundreds of handmade masks, was met with widespread acclaim. The piece told the story of the struggles faced by Latinx communities in the United States, from deportation to displacement. It was a powerful testament to Thea's ability to harness her own experiences and emotions into art that resonated deeply with audiences.
