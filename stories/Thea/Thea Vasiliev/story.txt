Thea Vasiliev stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. She had been traveling for days, fleeing the shadows that haunted her past. As she made her way through the empty streets, the silence was a welcome respite from the constant din of whispers and speculation that followed her wherever she went.

As a member of the infamous Vasiliev family, Thea had always been aware of the weight of expectation on her shoulders. Her father, Yuri, had been a master thief and assassin, while her mother, Katerina, had been a skilled forger and con artist. But after her parents' mysterious deaths, Thea had vowed to leave their legacy behind and forge her own path.

She made her way to the small café on the corner, where she knew she could find some semblance of normalcy. Inside, the owner, Maria, looked up from behind the counter and smiled. "Thea! It's been too long!"

Thea slid onto a stool, running a hand through her dark hair. "Maria, it's good to see you. I've got some news. I've received a message from an old acquaintance – they want to meet with me about a job."

Maria raised an eyebrow. "What kind of job?"

Thea shrugged. "I'm not sure yet. But I have a feeling it could be the start of something big."

As she waited for Maria to pour her coffee, Thea's mind began to wander back to her past. She thought about her parents, and the secrets they had kept hidden from her all these years. She wondered if she would ever be able to uncover the truth about their deaths, or if it was truly buried forever.

The door swung open and a figure slipped inside, scanning the room before locking eyes with Thea. "You're looking for me, I presume?" The stranger's voice was low and smooth, sending a shiver down Thea's spine. She nodded, her heart pounding in anticipation. It seemed that some secrets were better left unburied after all.
