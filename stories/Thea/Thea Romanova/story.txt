The streets of Star City were always bustling with activity, but none as much as they did on nights when Team Arrow was in town. And tonight was no exception. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the city, Thea Romanova (née Queen) was perched atop a rooftop, her eyes scanning the rooftops for any sign of trouble.

Thea, also known to her friends as Speedy, had been training with her mentor, Diggle, all day. She was determined to prove herself as a valuable member of Team Arrow, just like her mother, Queen Silvana Romanova, and her cousin, the Green Arrow himself, Oliver Queen.

As she scanned the rooftops, Thea's superhuman hearing picked up the sound of scuttling footsteps coming from a nearby alleyway. She leapt off the rooftop, using her agility to navigate the narrow spaces between buildings with ease. Her eyes adjusted quickly to the darkness, and soon she spotted a group of thugs huddled around a makeshift crime scene.

Thea swooped down, her cape fluttering behind her like a dark cloud. "Looks like I'm just in time for dessert," she quipped, charging into battle.

With a series of swift kicks and punches, Thea took down the thugs with ease, showcasing her impressive fighting skills. It was clear that she had come a long way since her days as a rebellious teenager, honing her combat skills under the watchful eye of her mentor, Diggle.

As the last thug fell to the ground, Thea stood victorious, her chest heaving with exertion. She couldn't help but feel a sense of pride, knowing that she was carrying on her family's legacy as a hero. And when she returned to Team Arrow's headquarters, Oliver himself gave her a nod of approval. "Good job, Speedy," he said, with a smile. Thea smiled back, feeling like she had finally found her place in the world – alongside her heroes and mentors, fighting for justice and protecting those she cared about.

The night was young, but Thea Romanova (née Queen) was ready to take on whatever came next.
