Thea Zariņš stepped onto the worn stone steps of the university's art history department, her eyes scanning the bustling hallway for any sign of her professor, Dr. Petrov. As a graduate student in Thea Zariņš' own right, she had spent countless hours poring over the works of the masters, but today's meeting with Dr. Petrov was about something different.

Thea Zariņš had been working on her master's thesis, a comprehensive analysis of Latvian folk art from the 19th century. She had made significant progress, but was struggling to find the right angle to present her research. As she waited for Dr. Petrov, Thea Zariņš' mind wandered back to her childhood in Riga, where her grandmother used to tell stories of their ancestors' crafts and traditions.

Dr. Petrov appeared at her side, a warm smile spreading across his face. "Ah, Thea Zariņš! I see you've made it. Come, let's take a walk around the gallery." As they strolled through the galleries, Dr. Petrov pointed out various pieces of art, asking Thea Zariņš to share her thoughts on their significance.

The conversation flowed easily, and Thea Zariņš found herself opening up about her research in ways she hadn't before. Dr. Petrov listened intently, nodding along as she spoke. "I think I see where you're going with this," he said finally. "But have you considered exploring the intersection of folk art and national identity? That could be a rich area of study."

Thea Zariņš' eyes widened in excitement. She had been on the verge of exploring that very idea, but hadn't quite put it together yet. With Dr. Petrov's guidance, she felt like she was finally on the right track.

As they left the gallery, Thea Zariņš turned to Dr. Petrov with a grateful smile. "Thank you so much for your help today," she said. "I feel like I've found a new direction for my research." Dr. Petrov smiled back, his eyes twinkling with approval. "You're going to do great things, Thea Zariņš. I have no doubt of it."
