Born Thea Ming-che on a drizzly autumn evening in 1985, she had always been drawn to the world of politics and power. Growing up, her parents, both activists themselves, instilled in her a strong sense of justice and a desire to expose the truth.

As she began her career as a journalist, Thea's talent for getting sources to open up to her quickly became apparent. She had an uncanny ability to put people at ease, often using her empathetic ear and genuine curiosity to draw out stories that others might have missed.

One fateful night, while working on a particularly juicy tip, Thea found herself face-to-face with the infamous businessman, Marcus Wellington. Well-known for his shady dealings and ruthless tactics, Marcus had built an empire through underhanded means.
