Thea Oja stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station with a mixture of nostalgia and trepidation. She had been back in her hometown of Ravenshire for only a few hours, but it already felt like an eternity since she'd left. Thea's thoughts were consumed by the memories of her past life as a skilled healer, and the weight of her responsibilities as the leader of the Order of the White Rose.

As she made her way through the station, Thea was approached by a young woman who introduced herself as Elara. "Thea Oja, I've heard so much about you," Elara said with a curious expression. "I'm here to ask for your help with my sister's illness. She's been suffering from a strange curse that seems to be worsening by the day."

Thea's instincts immediately went on high alert as she listened to Elara's story. She knew that the Order of the White Rose was the only organization equipped to handle such cases, and it was her duty to assist those in need. "Tell me more about your sister's symptoms," Thea said firmly, pulling out a small notebook and pen from her pocket.

As they walked through the station, Elara explained that her sister had been plagued by vivid nightmares and unexplained rashes. Thea listened intently, her mind racing with possibilities. She knew that she couldn't just wave a magic spell and cure the curse; she needed to understand its source and its motivations.

The two women eventually arrived at the Oja estate, where Thea's family had lived for generations. As they sat by the fireplace, sipping tea and discussing the sister's case, Thea felt a sense of calm wash over her. She was determined to help Elara's sister, no matter what lay ahead.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Thea Oja set out on a journey to unravel the mysteries of the curse, armed with her knowledge, skills, and unwavering commitment to justice.
