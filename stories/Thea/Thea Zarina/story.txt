Her latest client, a young woman named Sophia, had sought out Thea Zarina's expertise in uncovering the truth about her family's cursed past. As they sat across from each other in the dimly lit parlor, Thea Zarina listened intently to Sophia's tale of woe and heartache. With a gentle smile, she reached for a small, ornate box on the table, adorned with symbols of protection and ancient wisdom.

"This box has been passed down through generations of my family," Sophia explained, her voice trembling with emotion. "It's said to hold the key to breaking our curse, but I've never been able to decipher its secrets."
