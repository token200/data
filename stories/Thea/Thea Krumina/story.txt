Thea Krumina stood at the edge of the rooftop garden, her long, raven-black hair whipping in the gentle breeze. She gazed out over the city skyline, her eyes lost in thought. As a private investigator, she had seen her fair share of darkness and despair, but tonight was different. Tonight, she was searching for answers.

Thea's mind wandered back to her childhood, growing up on the wrong side of the tracks with her single mother, who had always pushed her to be more than what the world expected of a girl from her background. Thea's determination to succeed had only grown stronger as she got older, and now, at 30, she was one of the best private investigators in the city.

A faint hum caught her attention, and she turned to see a sleek black sedan pulling up alongside the rooftop garden's entrance. The driver, a young woman with piercing green eyes, smiled at Thea as she stepped out of the car.

"Hey, Theo," the woman said, using Thea's nickname. "I'm here for our meeting."

Thea raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the unusual greeting. It was Rachel, her trusted friend and colleague from the past. They had worked together on several cases before, but this one felt different – a new case that required both their unique skills.

As they sat down at a small table amidst the lush greenery, Thea pulled out a folder filled with information on the target of their investigation. A wealthy businessman had been accused of embezzling funds from his company, and it was up to them to uncover the truth.

Together, Thea Krumina and Rachel dove headfirst into the world of high-stakes finance, navigating a complex web of deceit and corruption. The night air swirled around them as they worked tirelessly, determined to bring justice to those who had been wronged.

In this moment, Thea felt most alive – driven by her passion for justice and her unyielding commitment to uncovering the truth.
