I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named "Thea Corberó". It's possible that you may be thinking of a different character or person.

However, I did find information on a Spanish actress named Thea Gilford, and a Dutch model and singer named Thea Corberó is not well known. 

It seems like there might be some confusion.
