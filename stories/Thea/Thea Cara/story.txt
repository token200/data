Thea Cara stepped out onto the dimly lit stage, her fingers drumming an impatient rhythm on the metal railing. She was supposed to be waiting for her cue, but instead she felt like she'd been forgotten in the shuffle.

As the lead singer of the up-and-coming rock band "Velvet Requiem", Thea had always prided herself on being a consummate professional. But tonight was different. Tonight, the show was going off without her, and she couldn't shake the feeling that something was very wrong.

She glanced out into the crowded room, her eyes scanning for any sign of her bandmates or the rest of the crew. The crowd was rowdy and rowdier than usual, but Thea's attention wasn't on them - it was on the person standing in the shadows at the back of the venue.

A figure in a black leather jacket had slipped into the bar earlier that night, ordering a drink at the counter with an air of quiet confidence. But now, as Thea watched, they raised their head and locked eyes with her.

The figure pushed open the door to the stage, slipping onto the worn velvet couch like it was their own personal throne. And then, in a voice that sent shivers down Thea's spine, they spoke: "Sorry you had to wait so long, sweetheart."

Thea felt a chill run down her spine as she realized who this mysterious figure must be - Lucas Blackwood, the infamous lead singer of rival band 'Midnight Sun'. He was known for his cunning and his ability to sabotage other bands on stage. Thea's heart sank as she wondered if this was some kind of twisted joke.

But then something unexpected happened. The music started, and Lucas Blackwood stood up, a sly grin spreading across his face. "Let's get one thing straight," he declared into the microphone. "This is Velvet Requiem's night to shine."

With that, Lucas turned and raised the other musicians on stage, who nodded back at him with a look of reluctant submission. Thea was left standing alone in the shadows, her anger and frustration boiling over.

And then it happened - Lucas dropped the mic, striding confidently towards her, his eyes flashing with triumph. The lights went dark, and for a moment, Thea wondered if she'd been completely forgotten. But as the show launched into its final chord, she realized that this was only the beginning of the real fight.
