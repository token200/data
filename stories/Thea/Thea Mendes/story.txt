Thea Mendes walked into the dimly lit jazz club, her eyes scanning the crowded room for a familiar face. She had been friends with the owner, Max, since college, and he always made sure to reserve a table for her whenever she came in.

As she made her way through the crowd, Thea's eyes landed on a familiar figure sitting at the bar - her ex-boyfriend, Ryan. They had broken up six months ago, but still ran into each other occasionally. The tension between them was palpable, and Thea couldn't help but feel a pang of discomfort as she approached him.

"Ryan," she said softly, taking a seat next to him. "What brings you here tonight?"

"Just grabbing a drink before work," Ryan replied, his eyes avoiding hers. "You know how it is."

Thea nodded, ordering her own drink and sitting back to observe the conversation between them. Max had told her that Ryan was having some financial troubles, and she couldn't help but feel a twinge of guilt for not being more supportive during their relationship.

As they chatted, Thea's mind wandered back to her current life - working as a freelance writer and spending most of her free time reading and exploring the city. She had always been drawn to creative pursuits, and was grateful to have found a career that allowed her to express herself in so many different ways.

Just then, Max appeared at their table, a smile on his face. "Thea, darling! I'm so glad you're here. I've got some news - I'm opening up the club to live music for the first time ever next weekend."

Thea's eyes lit up with excitement as she turned to Ryan. "That sounds amazing! Can we come?"

Ryan nodded, and Thea could see a glimmer of interest in his eyes that she hadn't seen in months. Maybe this was the start of something new - or at least, the beginning of a renewed connection between them.

As they finished their drinks and prepared to leave, Thea smiled to herself, feeling a sense of possibility that she hadn't felt in a long time. Little did she know what the future held for her, but one thing was certain - she was ready to take on whatever came next, with Max's jazz club at the heart of it all.
