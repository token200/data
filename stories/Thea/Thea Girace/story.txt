Thea Girace sat alone in her dimly lit room, staring blankly at the wall as she replayed the events of that fateful night. It had been three years since she'd last seen her sister, Maria, and yet the wound still felt fresh. Thea's mind wandered back to their childhood, playing hide-and-seek among the rows of colorful fabrics in their family's small boutique.

As a child, Thea had always looked up to Maria, admiring her big sister's carefree spirit and infectious laugh. But as they grew older, their paths began to diverge. Maria became increasingly involved with a local gang, while Thea chose to pursue her passion for fashion design.

Thea Girace's latest collection was due to be showcased at the annual Fashion Week, but she couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that had been plaguing her for weeks. She'd received an anonymous letter threatening to expose her darkest secrets unless she dropped out of the competition.

Determined to prove herself, Thea poured every ounce of energy into perfecting her designs. But as the day of the fashion show approached, she couldn't help but feel like she was walking on eggshells, waiting for the other shoe to drop.

On the night of the show, Thea's nerves were on edge. As she took the stage to present her collection, a gust of wind swept through the room, extinguishing the lights and plunging the audience into darkness. When the lights flickered back to life, Thea Girace stood frozen, her heart racing with anticipation.

But instead of revealing her secrets, the stranger on stage began to speak â€“ a voice that sent shivers down Thea's spine. "You think you're alone, Thea?" it said, as the room erupted into chaos. "You think you can hide from your past?"

Thea's eyes scanned the crowd, searching for answers, but they were met with blank faces and empty eyes. And in that moment, she knew that her life would never be the same again.
