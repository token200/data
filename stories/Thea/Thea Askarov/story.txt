Thea Askarov stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the sleepy town with a mix of curiosity and unease. It had been five years since she'd last set foot in Ravenswood, the hometown she'd fled as a teenager in search of answers about her family's past.

As a child, Thea had always felt like an outsider in Ravenswood - her parents' mysterious deaths had left her with more questions than answers, and she'd never been able to shake the feeling that there was something she wasn't being told. But when she'd received a cryptic letter from an old friend, inviting her back to town for her 25th birthday, Thea had felt a sudden pang of curiosity.

The friend, Rachel, had promised to reveal some long-hidden secrets about Ravenswood's history - and Thea couldn't wait to hear them. She took a deep breath, shouldering her bag and making her way through the deserted streets, where the only sound was the creaking of old wooden signs and the distant hum of the river.

As she walked, Thea felt a strange sense of disconnection from the place - as if she were a ghost haunting her own memories. She thought back to her childhood, to the afternoons spent exploring the woods and playing in the creek with Rachel and their other friends. It had all seemed so carefree then.

But now, as she approached Rachel's small cottage on the outskirts of town, Thea felt a growing sense of trepidation. What would Rachel reveal? Would it confirm her worst fears about Ravenswood - or would it bring some long-dormant peace?

The door opened with a creak, and Rachel stood in the doorway, a knowing smile on her face. "Hey, kiddo," she said, stepping aside to let Thea in.

Inside, the cottage was cozy and warm, filled with old family photographs and dusty trinkets. Rachel poured them each a cup of tea, and sat down beside Thea on the worn couch. "It's time you knew the truth about Ravenswood," she said, her voice low and serious.

Thea took a sip of her tea, feeling the warmth spread through her veins as she leaned forward, ready to listen.
