Thea Abdykadyrov stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It had been months since she'd last set foot in her hometown of Krasnoyarsk, and she wasn't sure what to expect.

As a child, Thea had always felt like an outsider in this Siberian city. Her mother, a nomadic musician, had moved from place to place, leaving behind a trail of broken relationships and unfinished dreams. But it was here that Thea's father, a quiet but fiercely proud engineer, had built a life for himself.

After his passing, Thea had returned to Krasnoyarsk to settle the estate and say goodbye to the only home she'd ever known. It was a bittersweet experience, filled with memories of laughter and tears, of late-night conversations and long silences.

As she made her way through the station, Thea spotted a familiar face - her childhood friend, Sergey. They'd lost touch after high school, but now he was standing before her, his eyes warm with recognition.

"Thea Abdykadyrov," he said, using her full name as if it were still a part of everyday conversation. "It's been too long."

The two spent the evening catching up on lost years, reminiscing about old times and sharing stories of their lives since leaving Krasnoyarsk. Thea told Sergey about her latest adventures - traveling to Europe with a group of artists, working as a freelance writer in Berlin.

Sergey listened intently, asking questions and offering words of encouragement. As they talked, Thea felt a sense of belonging she hadn't experienced in years. Maybe it was the familiarity of this place, or maybe it was just her own growth - but for the first time in a long time, she felt like she belonged.

As the night drew to a close, Sergey walked Thea back to her small apartment on the outskirts of town. They stood outside her door, hesitating over what to do next.

"I should get going," Sergey said finally, using his full name as he did before - "Sergey Petrovich."

Thea smiled and nodded. "Thanks for being here, Sergey. It means a lot."

And with that, she stepped inside, feeling the weight of her journey slowly lift off her shoulders. The city was quiet around her now, but she knew it would be waiting when she needed it to be again - ready to hold her, support her, and tell her story anew.
