Thea Claudius stood in front of the mirror, adjusting her toga and smoothing out her hair. She was a woman of great intelligence and cunning, but few people knew of her true nature. In the eyes of Rome, she was nothing more than a spoiled princess, the daughter of Emperor Tiberius.

But Thea was different. Behind closed doors, she was a woman of action, plotting and scheming to overthrow her father and claim the throne for herself. She had been taught by her mother, Livia, how to navigate the treacherous waters of Roman politics, and she had proven herself to be a worthy student.

As she made her way through the palace, Thea's thoughts turned to her half-brother, Caligula. He was a monster, a cruel and capricious tyrant who ruled with an iron fist. But he was also the one person in Rome who understood Thea's ambition. She had seen the way he looked at her, with a mixture of admiration and desire.

Thea's heart skipped a beat as she thought about Drusus, Caligula's loyal companion and friend. He was a man of great bravery and loyalty, and Thea knew that if she could win him over to her side, she would have the key to unlocking the throne.

She found herself in the gardens, strolling through the beautiful flowers and statues. It was there that she spotted Drusus, standing guard beside Caligula's favorite gladiator. Their eyes met for a moment, and Thea felt a jolt of electricity run through her body. She knew then that this was a moment she would have to seize.

"Drusus," she said, her voice low and husky. "I've been looking for you."

He turned, his eyes narrowing as he took in her appearance. "What do you want, Thea?" he asked, his tone cold but not unfriendly.

"I want to talk," Thea replied, taking a step closer. "About the future of Rome. About the throne."

Drusus raised an eyebrow, his gaze never leaving hers. "And what makes you think I'm interested in discussing it with you?"

Thea smiled, her eyes glinting with challenge. "Because, Drusus, I know that you and Caligula will both fall. And when they do, I want to be the one standing beside you."

For a moment, Drusus looked at her, and Thea thought she saw something there - a flicker of hope, perhaps. But then it was gone, replaced by his usual mask of indifference.

"I'll think on it," he said finally, turning back to Caligula's gladiator.

Thea smiled again, this time with a sense of determination. She knew that this was just the beginning, and she was ready for whatever lay ahead.
