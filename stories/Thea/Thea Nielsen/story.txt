Thea Nielsen sat alone in her small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and scattered papers. As a former detective with the NYPD, she had seen her fair share of dark alleys and crime-ridden streets, but nothing could have prepared her for what she was facing now.

It had been two years since Thea retired from the force, haunted by the memories of a case gone wrong. She had tried to move on, taking up painting as a hobby, but it seemed like the ghosts of her past were closing in once again.

The phone rang, shrill and insistent, and Thea hesitated before picking it up. It was an old colleague from the NYPD, calling with news about an unsolved case that had been bugging him for months.

"It's the Smithson case," he said, his voice tight with urgency. "We've got a new lead, but we need someone on the inside to get us into the safe house where they're being held."

Thea's heart sank. The Smithson case was one of her toughest, most personal cases from her time as a detective. She had thought she'd left it all behind, but now it seemed like fate had other plans.

"What makes you think I can help?" she asked warily.

"I know what this means to you," her colleague replied gently. "You're the only one who can do this right. We need your expertise."

Thea felt a shiver run down her spine as she nodded, even though no one was there to see it. She knew that this case would be different from all the others. It would require everything she had left in her.

With newfound determination, Thea gathered her belongings and headed out into the night, determined to solve the Smithson case once and for all.
