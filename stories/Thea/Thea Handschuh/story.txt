One day, a prominent art critic stumbled upon one of Thea's paintings in a small gallery in Berlin. The critic was taken aback by the beauty and complexity of the piece, and soon found himself writing about it extensively in his reviews. The article catapulted Thea to international attention, and she found herself fielding offers from museums and collectors around the world.
