Thea Lefevre's eyes fluttered open, her gaze drifting across the dimly lit room. She lay in a narrow bed, tucked away in a small apartment on the outskirts of Paris. Her mind was foggy, memories fragmented like shattered glass. She tried to recall how she got there, but the details were lost.

A faint knock at the door broke the silence. Thea groaned, rubbing her temples. Who could it be? She didn't have any friends here, not really. Only acquaintances, people she'd met through a series of art openings and gallery events.

She threw off the covers and stumbled out of bed, padding barefoot across the room to answer the door. It was Monsieur LaFleur, her landlord. His face was etched with concern as he handed her a small package.

"Your mother sent this," he said softly.

Thea's heart skipped a beat. She hadn't spoken to her mother in years, not since they'd last parted ways over the art world. But now, the package seemed like an unexpected lifeline.

As she unwrapped the paper, a watercolor sketch of Eiffel Tower rose into view. It was one of hers, bold and expressive, just as her mother had always described it. Tears pricked at Thea's eyes as she turned to Monsieur LaFleur.

"Merci," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

He nodded sympathetically before disappearing back into the night.

Thea felt lost without direction, but this sketch seemed to spark something within her. She took it to her easel and began to paint, letting colors bleed across the canvas as memories slowly resurfaced. The face of her mother reappeared – strong jawline, piercing green eyes, a mischievous grin.

As she worked, a narrative unfolded. Her mother had sent for her because the art dealer who'd bought one of her pieces was interested in representing her fully. He wanted to showcase her talent to the world, and he knew Thea's mother would have some say in how that happened.

With renewed determination, Thea set out into Parisian nightscapes once more – this time as a confident artist on a mission.
