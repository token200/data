As the judges made their way from table to table, Thea Lopez Rodriguez anxiously awaited their verdict. Would her hard work pay off, or would she be eliminated in the early rounds? Finally, the head judge announced the top three finalists: Thea Lopez Rodriguez, Maria Rodriguez (her closest competitor), and a surprise dark horse named Alex Chen.
