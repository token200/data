Marzell Hussein was a man shrouded in mystery. His past was a labyrinth of unanswered questions, and his present was marked by an air of quiet determination. A former soldier, Marzell had seen his fair share of battles, but it was the wars he fought within himself that left the most scars.

After leaving the military, Marzell found himself lost and adrift. He drifted from job to job, never quite finding his place in the world. His friends and family tried to reach out, but Marzell pushed them away, afraid of being tied down or exposed.
