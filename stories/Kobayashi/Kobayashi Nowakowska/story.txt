As a curator at the Tokyo Museum of Antiquities, she spent most of her days uncovering relics from bygone eras that few people had ever laid eyes on. Her colleagues often joked about her ability to find treasures in the most unlikely places.

One day, while rummaging through a dusty old archive room, Kobayashi Nowakowska stumbled upon an ancient scroll with strange symbols etched into its surface.

A rival curator at the British Museum began to spread rumors that she had fabricated the scroll's origins, claiming it was nothing more than a clever forgery.

Despite the controversy, Kobayashi Nowakowska remained steadfast in her pursuit of knowledge.
