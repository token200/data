In the bustling streets of Tokyo, a young and ambitious journalist named Kobayashi Rosén was making a name for himself in the competitive world of investigative reporting. With a keen mind and an insatiable curiosity, he had already landed several high-profile scoops that had left his peers in awe.

One fateful evening, as he was working late on his latest story, Kobayashi Rosén received a cryptic message from a mysterious source claiming to have information about a corrupt government official. Intrigued, he decided to meet the source at an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of the city.
