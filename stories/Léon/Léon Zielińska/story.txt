Léon Zielińska stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. She had been traveling for hours, fleeing the memories that haunted her small town in Poland. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a stark contrast to the sterile air conditioning of the train.

As she made her way through the station, Léon Zielińska's gaze landed on a small café tucked away in a corner. She pushed open the door and slipped inside, the warm light enveloping her like a hug. The barista, a young man with pierced ears, looked up from his phone and smiled.

"Welcome to Kaffeehaus," he said, his voice smooth as honey. "What can I get you?"

Léon Zielińska hesitated, unsure of what she wanted. She had always been a creature of habit, but the past few days had shaken her to her core. She ordered a coffee and took a seat at the small table by the window.

As she sipped her coffee, Léon Zielińska felt the tension in her shoulders begin to ease. She closed her eyes and let the warmth seep into her bones, feeling the weight of her secrets slowly lifting. It had been years since she'd left home, but some wounds still lingered.

A figure caught her eye - a woman with long, dark hair and piercing green eyes, sitting across from her at the next table over. There was something about the woman's presence that made Léon Zielińska feel seen, like someone finally understood her.

Without thinking, she got up and walked over to the woman's table. "Mind if I join you?" she asked, trying to sound nonchalant.

The woman smiled and shook her head, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "Not at all," she said, extending a hand. Léon Zielińska took it, feeling a spark of connection that went beyond words.

For the first time in years, Léon Zielińska felt like she was home.
