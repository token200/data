Léon Schillaci stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his piercing green eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a skilled bounty hunter, he had faced his fair share of unsavory characters, but there was something about this place that didn't sit right with him.

Léon Schillaci took a seat at the bar, ordering a whiskey as he surveyed the patrons. The air was thick with tension, and Léon Schillaci could feel it radiating off the sweat-drenched brows of the regulars.

A hooded figure caught his attention, sitting in the corner and nursing a mug of ale. There was something about the way they seemed to be waiting for someone that made Léon Schillaci's instincts twitch. He signaled the bartender for another round and made his way over to the mysterious stranger.

As he approached, the hooded figure slowly raised their head, revealing a face Léon Schillaci knew all too well - a woman with piercing blue eyes and raven-black hair, known only as "The Viper". Theirs was a history of mutual respect and admiration, but also one of bitter rivalry.

"Well, well, well," The Viper purred, her voice like honey dripping in venom. "If it isn't Léon Schillaci. I see you're still peddling your wares as the greatest bounty hunter this side of the equator."

Léon Schillaci smiled, unfazed by her jibe. "Just doing my job, Viper," he said, taking a sip of his whiskey.

The air was charged with tension as The Viper leaned in, her voice dropping to a whisper. "I have a proposition for you, Léon Schillaci. One that requires your... particular set of skills."

Léon Schillaci's ears perked up, intrigued despite himself. He knew better than to get involved with The Viper's schemes, but something about this one felt different.

"What is it?" he asked, his eyes locked on hers.

The Viper smiled, a sly smile that sent shivers down Léon Schillaci's spine. "That, my friend," she said, "is the best part."
