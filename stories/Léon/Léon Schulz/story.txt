Léon Schulz, a man with an air of mystery, walked into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room as if searching for someone. His dark hair was slicked back, revealing a sharp jawline and piercing blue eyes that seemed to bore into those he met. Few people knew much about Léon, but whispers of his past hinted at a complex individual with a troubled history.

As he ordered a whiskey at the bar, the bartender raised an eyebrow, asking if he was meeting someone. Léon nodded curtly, his expression unreadable. He sipped his drink, lost in thought, as patrons laughed and chatted nearby.

The door swung open, and a petite woman with bright pink hair slipped into the café. Her eyes locked onto Léon's, and she made her way to him, a small smile playing on her lips. "Léon Schulz," she said, her voice husky. "I've been looking for you."

Léon didn't flinch, but a flicker of interest danced in his eyes. He nodded at the bartender, finished his drink, and followed the woman to a corner table. She introduced herself as Lena, an old friend from Léon's past.

As they spoke, the air around them grew thick with unspoken tension. Lena pushed a small box across the table, containing a photo of two people: Léon Schulz and his sister, who had disappeared years ago under mysterious circumstances. "I've been searching for answers," she said, her eyes pleading.

Léon's gaze fell on the photo, his expression unreadable. He took a slow drag on his cigarette, exhaling a stream of smoke as he processed the memories that came flooding back. For a moment, Lena saw glimpses of Léon Schulz – vulnerable, scared, and searching for a way out.

The silence between them was heavy with unresolved questions, but in that instant, it felt like Léon had finally found someone who understood him. As Lena left the café, Léon Schulz watched her go, his eyes lingering on the pink-haired woman who had reappeared in his life like a ghost from his past.

In the darkness of the café, Léon's thoughts swirled with questions and half-remembered dreams. The night air held secrets, but for now, he knew one thing: he wasn't alone, and that was all that mattered.
