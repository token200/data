Léon Moreau stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the sleepy town of Ashwood. It was a place he had never been before, but one that held a certain allure to him. The faded sign above the station read "Welcome to Ashwood" in crooked letters, and Léon couldn't help but feel a thrill of excitement.

As a photographer, Léon was drawn to places like this – where the light was soft and the people were genuine. He had heard whispers of a young woman living on the outskirts of town, a girl with eyes as blue as the morning sky and hair as wild as the night wind. Some said she was a ghost, others claimed she was cursed.

Léon's curiosity was piqued. He set up his camera and began to walk towards the edge of town, following the winding road that led to what he hoped was her doorstep. The air grew thick with mist as he climbed higher, and Léon felt a shiver run down his spine.

When he finally reached the small cottage at the top of the hill, Léon knocked on the door – three times, then twice, once and thrice. There was no answer. He tried again, this time louder, but the only response was the howling of the wind through the trees.

Just as he was about to leave, a figure emerged from behind the curtain in the window – her eyes locked onto Léon's, and for an instant they held a world of emotion between them. Without a word, she opened the door and invited him inside.

The room was dimly lit, with candles casting shadows on the walls. The woman moved to a corner, beckoning him over. "Come," she said softly, her voice carrying on the silence. Léon felt his heart thud as he took a seat beside her – their hands touched briefly before she pulled away.

"I am Aurore," she whispered. "And you?"

Léon's eyes never left hers. "I'm just a photographer," he replied, "trying to capture the beauty in the world."

Aurore smiled faintly, and for an instant Léon saw something of herself reflected back at him – something otherworldly. Then she leaned forward and vanished into the night.

The darkness swallowed them whole.
