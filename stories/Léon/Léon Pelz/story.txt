Léon Pelz stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of his quarry. A former circus performer turned private investigator, he had been hired by the enigmatic Madame Dupont to track down a missing fortune teller.

As he made his way to the bar, Léon's gaze caught on a striking young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She was sipping a cup of coffee, her slender fingers drumming an impatient rhythm on the saucer.

"Léon Pelz," she said, her voice husky as silk. "I've been expecting you."

He slid onto the stool beside her, his eyes never leaving hers. "And who are you?"

"Colette LaRue," she replied, extending a manicured hand. "Madame Dupont's niece."

Léon took the hand, feeling an unexpected jolt of electricity as their palms touched. He pulled back, his face expressionless.

"What do you know about Madame Dupont?" he asked, his tone gruff.

Colette leaned in close, her voice barely audible over the hum of the café's jazz music. "She was supposed to be a recluse, but I've been searching for information on her past life. The circus, the fortune telling – she left it all behind years ago."

Léon's eyes narrowed. This could be more than just a simple case of lost persons.

"Tell me about Madame Dupont," he said, his interest piqued.

Colette hesitated before speaking in hushed tones. "She was obsessed with the occult, and her abilities as a fortune teller were... remarkable. But there's something else – a dark secret that she kept hidden from everyone."

Léon leaned back in his chair, his mind racing with possibilities. This case was starting to take an unexpected turn.

"I think we should talk more about Madame Dupont's past," he said, pulling out his notebook and flipping through the pages.

As they delved deeper into the mystery, Léon couldn't shake off the feeling that Colette LaRue was hiding something – or someone. He decided to keep a close eye on her, sensing that she might be more involved in Madame Dupont's disappearance than he initially thought.

The game was afoot, and Léon Pelz was ready to follow the threads of the mystery wherever they led.
