Gaius Laurent stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the city below. The sun had long since set, casting a dark blue hue over the concrete jungle. He lit a cigarette and took a long drag, feeling the nicotine coursing through his veins.

As he puffed on his cigarette, Gaius's mind wandered back to his past. Growing up in Rome, he had always felt like an outsider - never quite fitting in with his aristocratic family or his fellow soldiers. But when he joined the Roman Legion, something clicked into place. He found a sense of belonging among the rough and tumble ranks of the legions.

Gaius had seen his fair share of battles - the hills of Britain, the deserts of Egypt, the ruins of Gaul. And yet, despite all that he had been through, he still felt a deep sense of disconnection from the world around him.

As he looked out over the city, Gaius spotted a figure standing in the shadows below. It was Marcus, his old comrade and friend. They exchanged nods as Marcus climbed up to join Gaius on the rooftop.

"What brings you here tonight?" Gaius asked, offering Marcus a cigarette.

Marcus took it gratefully and leaned against the wall, blowing out a stream of smoke. "I've been thinking about leaving the army," he said quietly.

Gaius raised an eyebrow. "Leaving? What's wrong?"

Marcus hesitated before speaking. "It's just... I don't know if I want to keep running from my past, Gaius. I feel like I'm stuck in a never-ending cycle of violence and bloodshed."

Gaius nodded sympathetically. He knew exactly what Marcus was going through. It had taken him years to come to terms with his own demons - the ghosts that haunted him still lingered, but he had learned to face them head-on.

"You don't have to do it alone," Gaius said softly. "We all have our own struggles, our own battles to fight. But sometimes, we just need someone to stand beside us and watch our backs."

As the night wore on, Gaius and Marcus sat together in silence, watching over the city they had both sworn to protect. In that moment, Gaius knew that he wasn't alone - not really. For in his own way, Marcus was home.
