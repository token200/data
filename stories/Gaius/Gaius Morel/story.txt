Gaius Morel was a man shrouded in mystery. Few knew much about his past, and even fewer had ever laid eyes on him. He was a recluse, a ghostly figure who haunted the streets of the city at night, searching for something. Some said he was a vampire, others claimed he was a demon. But Morel knew the truth.

He was cursed.

As a young man, Morel had been part of a secret society dedicated to unlocking the secrets of the supernatural. He had delved deep into the world of magic and mythology, seeking answers to his own mortality. And then, one fateful night, he stumbled upon a forbidden ritual that would change his life forever.

The words of the incantation still echoed in his mind: "Mors mea, veni." My death, come. The power was intoxicating, but it came at a terrible cost. Morel's body began to undergo a transformation, his cells shifting and contorting until he became what he was today.

A creature of the night.

Morel wandered the streets, searching for a cure that never seemed to appear. He had tried everything: potions, incantations, even human sacrifices. But nothing worked. And so, he continued on, driven by a burning desire to reclaim his humanity.

As he walked, the city lights reflected off his skin like a shimmering aura. People whispered about him, crossed themselves in fear. Morel knew they saw the monster that lurked beneath the surface, but he refused to acknowledge it. Not yet.

For Gaius Morel was still trapped in this prison of flesh and blood, tormented by the knowledge that he would never be free. The darkness within him stirred, its power growing with every passing night. And when the moon was full, it threatened to break free.

One night, as he prowled the streets, Morel caught a glimpse of himself in a mirror-smooth windowpane. He saw the eyes, cold and calculating, the skin pale and waxy. The reflection spoke to him, its voice a whisper in his mind: "You will never be human again." And with that realization, the weight of his curse crushed him.

Morel stumbled away from the glass, vanishing into the shadows. He was a monster now, forever doomed to walk the night, searching for an escape that would never come.
