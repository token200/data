Gaius Karlovich Kovacs stood on the rooftop, gazing out over the cityscape of New Chicago. A former soldier, detective, and mercenary, he had seen his fair share of battles and bloodshed. But as he looked out at the glittering lights below, he couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him.

It had been years since Kovacs had left the streets of New Eden, the city where he grew up and honed his skills as a soldier. He had taken on countless missions, from infiltrating high-security facilities to taking down corrupt corporate executives. But no matter where his work took him, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was meant for something more.

As he stood there, lost in thought, Kovacs's comms device beeped, signaling an incoming message. He squinted at the screen, and his eyes narrowed as he read the words: "Meet me on the roof of the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone."

Kovacs's instincts told him to ignore the message, but something about it resonated with him. He made a mental note to investigate further, and then turned to leave.

As he descended back into the city, Kovacs couldn't help but think about his past. Who was this mysterious person who wanted to meet him on the roof of an abandoned clock tower? And what did they want from him?

He arrived at the clock tower just after midnight, and scanned the area for any signs of danger. That's when he saw her - a figure shrouded in shadows, standing just beyond the reach of the dim moonlight.

"Who are you?" Kovacs demanded, his hand on the grip of his pistol.

The figure stepped forward, revealing a woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. "I'm someone who knows your true identity, Gaius Karlovich Kovacs," she said, her voice low and husky. "And I have information that could change everything you thought you knew about yourself."

Kovacs's eyes narrowed, his mind racing with possibilities. Who was this woman, and what did she want from him? He knew he had to listen, no matter where it led him.
