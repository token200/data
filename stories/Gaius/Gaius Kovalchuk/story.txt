The rival company was found guilty of multiple counts of corporate espionage, and they were ordered to pay a hefty fine. Gaius Kovalchuk had won a major victory for justice, and his reputation as a fierce advocate for what was right had been cemented. As he left the courtroom, he couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction - it had been a long time coming, but Gaius Kovalchuk had finally found his place in the world.
