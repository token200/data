Gaius Viljanen sat at his cluttered desk, sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee as he stared out the rain-soaked window. His eyes, sunken and weary from years of late nights and endless cups of coffee, reflected the turmoil brewing within him.

As a retired detective, Gaius had spent his fair share of time in the dark alleys and seedy bars of Oslo. He had seen it all - the worst of humanity, the best of kindness, and everything in between. But nothing could have prepared him for the case that still haunted him to this day.

Twenty years ago, a young woman named Sarah went missing while working as a nurse at the hospital where Gaius used to work. Her disappearance was shrouded in mystery, and despite his best efforts, Gaius couldn't crack the case. Theories abounded, but no one ever found her body or knew what had happened to her.

As he sat at his desk, lost in thought, a knock on the door broke the silence. It was his friend and colleague, Inspector Kari Jensen. "Gaius, I've got something that might interest you," she said with a hint of mischief in her voice.

She handed him an old file, dusty and worn from years of neglect. Gaius's eyes widened as he scanned through the pages, his heart racing with excitement. It was a new lead, one that had been unearthed by a diligent journalist who refused to rest until justice was served.

With newfound purpose, Gaius spent the next few days pouring over the evidence, re-examining every shred of information, and following every lead no matter how tenuous. And then, it happened - a name that had been mentioned in passing all those years ago suddenly became relevant again.

Gaius's eyes locked onto a photograph on his desk, one that he thought he would never look at again. It was Sarah, the missing nurse, smiling brightly with her colleagues from the hospital where she used to work. The smile had become a haunting memory for him, and now it seemed like fate had finally intervened.

With renewed energy, Gaius picked up his phone and dialed a number that had been on hold for years. The game was afoot once more. The rain outside may have been pouring down, but in this small Oslo apartment, the storm of justice had just begun.
