Gaius Dufresne stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his piercing green eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As the renowned mercenary and treasure hunter, he had a reputation for being able to get out of even the most precarious situations unscathed.

The patrons fell silent as Gaius Dufresne made his way to the bar, their whispers and glances following him like a shadow. The bartender, a gruff old man with a thick beard, looked up at him with a mixture of curiosity and hostility. "What can I get you, merc?" he growled.

Gaius smiled lazily, running a hand through his dark hair. "Just a whiskey, please. And information," he added, his eyes narrowing as he scanned the room again.

The bartender snorted, pouring Gaius Dufresne a generous measure of liquid fire. "You're looking for something to do, I reckon?" he said, winking at him. "There's rumors of a treasure hidden deep within the nearby ruins. But be warned, merc, it's said to be cursed."

Gaius raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. He had always been drawn to the unknown, the unexplained, and this sounded like just the thing to get his blood pumping. He tossed a few coins on the bar and stood up, towering over the patrons as he made his way out into the night air.

The moon was full overhead, casting long shadows across the deserted streets. Gaius Dufresne felt alive, his senses heightened as he made his way towards the ruins. He had always been driven by a sense of adventure, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity to indulge in it.

As he approached the ancient structure, a shiver ran down his spine. Something didn't feel right. But Gaius Dufresne was not one to back down from a challenge. With a deep breath, he steeled himself for what lay ahead and stepped forward into the darkness, ready to face whatever secrets the ruins held.
