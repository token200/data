Born into a family of modest means, Gaius' natural charisma and quick wit had always set him apart. He grew up on the streets, learning the art of deception and survival from an early age. His full name, Gaius Pei-ling, was whispered in awe by those who knew him, as if the mere utterance of his surname could conjure a sense of mystique around him.

Gaius Pei-ling's latest mark was a high-stakes heist at the exclusive Bellvue Manor. The target was the priceless Starlight Diamond, rumored to grant its owner unimaginable wealth and power.
