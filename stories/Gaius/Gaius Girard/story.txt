Gaius Girard, a man with an imposing figure and piercing green eyes, walked into the dimly lit tavern, his presence commanding attention. His rugged features seemed chiseled from the stone walls of the ancient city he called home, Gaia. The air was thick with smoke and laughter, but Gaius's gaze sliced through it like a hot knife through butter.

As the proprietor, Lucius, recognized him, he nodded in respect. "Gaius Girard, back for another ale?" He slid a foamy mug across the bar, its contents emitting a heady aroma that wafted up to Gaius's nostrils, enticing him.

Gaius took a swig, his eyes scanning the room as if searching for someone – or something. The fire crackled in the hearth, casting flickering shadows on the walls as patrons huddled around their own conversations. The clinking of glasses and laughter faded into the background as he homed in on a lone figure at the far end of the tavern.

A woman with porcelain skin and raven-black hair sat sipping a cup of wine, her gaze fixed intently on Gaius. Her eyes were like two glinting stars in the night sky, drawing him in with an otherworldly allure. He felt a shiver run down his spine as their gazes met, the air around them growing charged.

As the woman finished her drink and rose from her seat, Lucius called out, "Tonight's special, Gaius – meet our guest, Eira of Argen!" The room erupted into a chorus of curiosity and interest, but Gaius merely raised an eyebrow and gestured for Eira to follow him.

The two left the tavern together, walking through the moonlit streets as if bound by some unseen force. They strolled past towering spires that reached toward the stars, their architecture twisted in a maddening dance of curves and angles. The air vibrated with ancient power, like the reverberations of a harp string plucked by an unseen hand.

As they reached the city gate, Gaius turned to Eira, his voice low and husky. "You've been sent for. The Oracle awaits." His words were barely audible over the pounding of Eira's heart, but she nodded in determination, her eyes flashing like diamonds in the night sky.

Together, they vanished into the darkness, leaving behind a room full of whispers and speculation. Gaius Girard had summoned another soul to his mysterious world, where fate waited like an unfurled scroll, ready to be inscribed by those brave enough to take the leap.
