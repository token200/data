Born in Taipei, Taiwan, to a family of modest means, Gabriela had always been driven to succeed. She pursued a degree in journalism from the National Taiwan University, where she honed her skills as a writer and researcher.

After graduating, Gabriela landed an internship at a major Taiwanese newspaper, where she quickly made a name for herself by uncovering some of the country's most pressing social issues.

Her ability to balance tough investigative journalism with nuanced storytelling earned her a spot on the prestigious Golden Pen Award shortlist.

One day, while working on a story about the struggles faced by migrant workers in Taiwan's booming tech industry, Gabriela received an email from an anonymous source claiming to have evidence of a major corporate scandal.
