Gabriela Wiśniewski stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee and staring out the window. Her ex-boyfriend, Janek, had been living here for months after their messy breakup.

As she approached him, Janek looked up, his expression unchanged. "Gabriela," he said curtly, not inviting her to join him.

She took a seat across from him, ordering a cup of tea and waiting for the barista to arrive. The silence between them was palpable, each one lost in their own thoughts.

"You've been living here for months, Janek," Gabriela said finally, breaking the silence. "What brings you back?"

Janek shrugged, his shoulders barely moving. "I needed a break from everything. We were toxic, Gabriela. I couldn't take it anymore."

Gabriela nodded, feeling a pang of guilt. She had been just as much to blame for their relationship's demise. They had both been so caught up in their own desires and needs that they had neglected each other.

The barista arrived with her tea, and Gabriela took a sip, savoring the flavor. Janek watched her, his eyes narrowing slightly.

"You're still beautiful, even when you're being stubborn," he said gruffly.

Gabriela smiled wryly, feeling a flutter in her chest. "Thanks, Janek. But I'm not the same person I was when we were together."

Janek snorted, taking a sip of his coffee. "I can see that. You're more confident now. More...you."

Gabriela leaned back in her chair, studying him. She could see the remnants of their past relationship still lingering around him – the faint lines etched into his forehead, the way he smiled when he thought she wasn't looking.

As they sat there in silence, Gabriela realized that some things never truly went away. Janek and she might have broken up for good, but a part of her would always be tied to him, forever bound by their complicated history as Gabriela Wiśniewski.
