Gabriela Ozola stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. The once-thriving town had seen better days, its main street lined with abandoned shops and faded signs that seemed to whisper secrets to the wind.

As she made her way through the deserted streets, Gabriela Ozola couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her. She had returned to her hometown after years away, seeking solace in the familiar rhythms of her childhood. Her parents, though estranged, had sent her a letter, inviting her back for the funeral of her beloved grandmother.

Gabriela Ozola's thoughts drifted back to the summer days spent playing with her cousins and exploring the nearby woods. It was there that she met Ivan, her first love, who had left town as soon as he turned 18 to chase his dreams in the city. She had stayed behind, completing high school and then leaving for college.

Now, as she walked through the streets of her childhood, Gabriela Ozola felt a pang of regret. Had she made a mistake by staying? Would Ivan have even noticed if she had left with him?

As she turned a corner, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was Sofia, Ivan's sister, who had stayed behind to care for their mother after her father's passing. The two women had grown up together, sharing secrets and laughter.

"Sofia," Gabriela Ozola said, embracing her friend tightly. "It's been so long."

Sofia smiled, her eyes red-rimmed from crying. "I'm glad you're here, Gabi. We need to talk about Ivan."

Gabriela Ozola's heart skipped a beat as she followed Sofia into the old family bakery, where their grandmother used to bake the most delicious pastries in town. It was there that they sat down, surrounded by memories and unfinished business.

As they sipped coffee and shared stories, Gabriela Ozola felt a sense of closure wash over her. She knew that no matter what lay ahead, she would face it with Ivan's memory as a guiding light.
