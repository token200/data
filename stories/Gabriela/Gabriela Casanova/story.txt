One day, a wealthy businessman approached Gabriela Casanova with a peculiar request. He claimed that his company's most valuable asset - a priceless artifact - had been stolen by a master thief known only as "The Fox."

However, they couldn't deny the impressive display of detective work she had showcased throughout the investigation.
