Gabriela Nagy stepped out onto the crowded streets of Budapest, her eyes scanning the bustling sidewalks as she navigated through the throngs of people. A Hungarian journalist by trade, Gabriela was no stranger to chaos, but there was something about this particular morning that had her senses on high alert.

As she made her way through the narrow alleys of the historic district, the scent of freshly baked pogácsa wafted through the air, mingling with the sound of accordion music drifting from a nearby café. Gabriela's stomach growled in response, and she quickened her pace, hoping to find a momentary distraction from the story that had been plaguing her.

The murders in the city's sewers had been making headlines for weeks now, and as a journalist on the case, Gabriela was no closer to catching a lead. The police department seemed stumped, and she was starting to lose hope. That was when she spotted him – a tall, dark-haired man with piercing blue eyes who seemed out of place among the throngs of tourists.

Gabriela's instincts told her that this stranger was connected to the murders, but she couldn't quite put her finger on why. As she watched, he slipped into a small café and disappeared from view. She followed, pushing aside the cobwebs in the doorway as she slipped inside.

The café was dimly lit, with only a few patrons scattered at tables near the back. The stranger sat alone at a table by the window, nursing a cup of black coffee. Gabriela spotted him first when he stood up to leave, his eyes locking onto hers for a fleeting moment before he vanished into the crowd.

This time, she followed him more closely, weaving through the café patrons as she made her way out into the streets once again. The stranger led her on a wild goose chase through the city, finally ending at an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town.

As Gabriela pushed open the creaky door, the stranger turned to face her – and for the first time in weeks, she saw a glimmer of recognition in his eyes. "I've been waiting for you," he said, a small smile playing on his lips.

Gabriela's heart pounded in her chest as she took in the sight before her – a young woman, bound and gagged, with an eerie glow surrounding her like a halo. The stranger's eyes locked onto hers once more, and this time, Gabriela knew she was looking into the face of the killer.
