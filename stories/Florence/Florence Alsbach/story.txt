She spent years honing her craft, studying at prestigious music conservatories in Vienna and Paris before finally making a name for herself in Berlin's vibrant music scene.

Despite her success, Florence never forgot where she came from.

One evening, as she stood backstage before a sold-out performance at the Berlin Philharmonie, Florence's thoughts turned to her family and upbringing.
