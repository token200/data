Determined to follow her dreams, Florence moved to the city and enrolled in an art school where she honed her skills and built a community of like-minded artists. She spent long hours practicing, experimenting with new materials and techniques until she developed a signature style that was all her own.

Years went by, and Florence's talent and dedication paid off. Her work began to gain recognition, and she started receiving commissions from galleries and collectors alike. People would whisper about the "Florence Pérez Sánchez" who had managed to capture the very essence of light and color on canvas.
