Florence Lin stepped off the stage, her violin case slung over her shoulder. The small jazz club was quieting down, patrons lingering over their drinks or collecting tips from the bartender. Florence smiled wearily, her eyes scanning the room for familiar faces.

She spotted her best friend, Lily, sitting at a table near the back of the room, nursing a whiskey on the rocks. "Hey, Flo!" Lily called out, waving her hand in greeting. "You kill it tonight!"

Florence walked over, setting down her case and collapsing onto an empty chair beside Lily. "Just barely," she replied, running a hand through her curly hair.

It had been a tough night – the music had flowed from her like water, but at a cost: she was drained. The gig had paid decently, but it hadn't felt right. Florence wasn't one to play just for the money; she played because she loved it, and tonight it had felt forced.

Lily squeezed her hand reassuringly. "You did great," she said. "You always do."

Florence snorted. "You're biased, Lil. You've been my biggest fan since freshman year of high school."

Their conversation was interrupted by the club owner, a gruff but lovable man named Marcus, who came over to chat with Florence about potential gigs for the upcoming month. She listened patiently, exchanging stories and suggestions, but her mind kept wandering back to the performance.

As they chatted, a young musician wandered onto the stage, guitar slung over his shoulder, eyes scanning the room as if searching for something – or someone. He spotted Florence and Lily and made a beeline, introducing himself with an enthusiastic grin.

Florence recognized him from around town; he was Emily's little brother, who'd been taking piano lessons at the local music school since he was five. The kid had talent pouring out of every pore, but his nerves were still raw.

Over the next hour, Florence found herself watching him play – mesmerized by the way his fingers danced over the strings, coaxing beauty from the instrument. She knew that feeling – it was like coming home.

The night drew to a close with Emily's brother taking the stage for an impromptu encore. Florence felt her exhaustion fade away as she listened, caught up in the music and the energy of the room.
