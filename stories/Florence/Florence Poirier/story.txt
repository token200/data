She attended salons at the Palais des Congrès, where she debated politics and philosophy with ease. Her sharp tongue and quick wit earned her a reputation as a formidable opponent in intellectual debates.

Despite her success, Florence remained true to her roots. She continued to write about life in Saint-Pierre, weaving tales that celebrated the town's resilience and resourcefulness. Her stories became a staple of local literature, offering readers a glimpse into the lives of people they might have otherwise overlooked.
