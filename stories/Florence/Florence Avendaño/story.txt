Florence Avendaño was known for her sharp wit and quick tongue in the small town of San Miguel. As a local journalist, she had a knack for asking the tough questions and getting to the heart of the matter.

One sunny afternoon, Florence decided to pay a visit to the town's mayor, Mr. Hernandez, at his office. She had been investigating rumors of corruption within the town's government, and she was determined to get to the bottom of it.

As she entered the mayor's office, Florence noticed that it was cluttered with stacks of papers and files. Mr. Hernandez looked up from his desk, a hint of annoyance in his eyes.

"What can I do for you, Miss Avendaño?" he asked gruffly.

"I'm here to ask some questions, Mr. Mayor," Florence replied, her eyes scanning the room. "I've been hearing rumors that the town's budget has been embezzled, and I'd like to know if there's any truth to them."

Mr. Hernandez shifted uncomfortably in his seat. "I don't know what you're talking about, Miss Avendaño," he said.

Florence raised an eyebrow. "Really? Because my sources say that a large sum of money has been missing from the town's coffers. I think it's time we had a little chat about it."

The mayor sighed and rubbed his temples. "Fine, Miss Avendaño. But you have to promise not to sensationalize this story. We're just trying to make ends meet here."

Florence smiled sweetly. "I promise, Mr. Mayor. But I also need to remind you that as a public official, you have a duty to be transparent and accountable. The people of San Miguel deserve to know what's going on in their town hall."

As Florence left the mayor's office, she couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. She had gotten under his skin, and she knew that she would be able to dig up more information about the corruption.

Back at her newsroom, Florence began typing away on her computer, pouring over notes and sources. Her full name, Florence Avendaño, was already becoming synonymous with investigative journalism in San Miguel. And she was just getting started.
