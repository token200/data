Kondan "Ko" Sharma was a name that struck fear into the hearts of those who knew him. A former hitman and mercenary, Ko had spent his entire life on the wrong side of the law. With a reputation for being merciless and efficient, he had earned a small fortune by taking out targets for the highest bidder.

But after a fateful mission went sour, Ko found himself in prison, serving a sentence for attempted murder. As he sat in his cell, he couldn't help but think about the life he had left behind. He missed the rush of adrenaline that came with each job, the thrill of outsmarting his enemies and emerging victorious.

As Ko's thoughts drifted back to his past, he began to realize that there was more to life than just violence and destruction. He started taking classes in martial arts and philosophy, seeking a new path forward one that didn't involve harming others.

Despite his newfound passion for self-improvement, Ko's past continued to catch up with him. A former client, now a powerful businessman, had been released from prison and was determined to make amends for the debt he owed Ko.

The man, identified only as "Vikram," showed up at Ko's doorstep one day, bearing a gift of money and a proposal: meet him at a remote location, where Vikram would explain why he wanted to repay Ko in such a way. Ko was wary at first, but something about the offer resonated with him. He agreed to meet Vikram, curious about what the man had planned.

As Ko arrived at the designated spot, he saw Vikram waiting for him, a look of remorse on his face. "Kondan 'Ko' Sharma," Vikram said, as if reading Ko's mind. "I never thought I'd see you again." And with that, Ko knew that this meeting would be different from all the others.
