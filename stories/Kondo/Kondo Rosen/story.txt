Kondo Rosen was known for his enigmatic smile and piercing green eyes that seemed to see right through you. As a renowned detective in Tokyo, he had earned a reputation for being one of the best in the business. His sharp mind and keen instincts made him a formidable opponent in the world of crime-solving.

One fateful evening, Kondo Rosen received a visit from the police commissioner, who requested his expertise on a particularly puzzling case. A string of high-end jewelry stores had been burglarized in the past week, with no signs of forced entry or exit. The only clue was a small note left at each scene, bearing an eerie message: "The eyes that see are not the ones that look."

Intrigued by the challenge, Kondo Rosen accepted the case and set to work deciphering the cryptic clues. He spent hours poring over security footage, interviewing witnesses, and studying the notes themselves. As he delved deeper into the mystery, his intuition began to guide him.

Kondo Rosen's remarkable detective skills eventually led him to a breakthrough. By carefully analyzing the writing style on the notes, he discovered that the handwriting belonged to an unusual font commonly used by writers with a rare neurological condition. This revelation sparked a new line of investigation, and soon Kondo Rosen was hot on the trail.

As the sun set over Tokyo, Kondo Rosen finally tracked down his suspect â€“ a quiet, unassuming individual with a striking resemblance to him. With his eyes locked onto the culprit's gaze, he revealed the shocking truth: "You're looking at me through my own eyes, aren't you?" The perpetrator was stunned, and Kondo Rosen couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction at having unraveled the puzzle.

With the case closed, the police commissioner praised Kondo Rosen for his exceptional detective work. As he walked out of the station, Kondo Rosen smiled to himself, knowing that his reputation as one of Tokyo's greatest detectives had been solidified once again.
