Kondo Salvini stepped off the worn stone street and onto the cobbled docks, the salty sea air filling her lungs as she gazed out at the waves crashing against the shore. As a member of the esteemed Salvini family, Kondo had always felt a sense of duty to protect their legacy, but lately, she'd been feeling suffocated by the weight of tradition.

Growing up, Kondo Salvini had always been fascinated by the ancient art of sea magic, and her parents had encouraged her to hone her skills. But as she grew older, she began to realize that there was more to being a Salvini than just mastering spells and incantations. There were expectations, obligations, and responsibilities that came with bearing the family name.

Kondo Salvini sighed, running a hand through her curly brown hair as she pondered her next move. She had always dreamed of exploring the world beyond their small island community, to learn more about the magic that lay beyond the familiar rhythms of home. But her parents would never approve – they wanted her to focus on preserving the family's reputation and upholding their sacred duties.

As she stood there, lost in thought, a figure emerged from the crowd of sailors and fishermen haggling over the day's catch. It was Jax, a young sailor with a quick wit and a mischievous grin – someone Kondo Salvini had known since childhood. They exchanged warm smiles as Jax slid onto the dock beside her.

"What brings you out today?" he asked, eyeing the stack of scrolls slung over her shoulder.

Kondo Salvini smiled wryly, running a hand through the scrolls to reveal the intricate drawings within. "Just studying up on some new spells," she said quietly.

Jax raised an eyebrow. "You know your family's history pretty well, Kondo Salvini – we both do. Maybe it's time you took a break from all that. There's a world out there waiting for you."

For the first time in months, Kondo Salvini felt a spark of excitement ignite within her chest. Maybe Jax was right – maybe she didn't have to conform to everyone else's expectations after all.
