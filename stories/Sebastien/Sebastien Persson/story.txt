"Excuse me," Sebastien said, approaching the stranger, "can I help you with something?"

The figure stepped forward, revealing a young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She introduced herself as Sophia Patel, an insider who had been feeding information to the corporation's CEO.

"I want to tell you the truth," Sophia whispered, glancing nervously over her shoulder. "This corporation is rotten to the core. They're embezzling millions and bribing officials left and right."
