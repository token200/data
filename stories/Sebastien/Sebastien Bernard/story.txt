Sebastien Bernard was known for his charming smile and quick wit, earning him a reputation as one of the most eligible bachelors in Paris. By day, he worked as a freelance writer, penning articles for various fashion magazines, but by night, he transformed into a bon vivant, entertaining the city's elite with his razor-sharp humor.

One evening, while sipping a glass of fine wine at a posh restaurant, Sebastien Bernard caught the eye of a stunning woman named Sophie. She was a photographer, captivated by the way Sebastien's eyes crinkled at the corners when he laughed.
