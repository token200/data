Sofia Abbagnato was a woman with a past shrouded in mystery. Her piercing green eyes seemed to hold a thousand secrets, and her raven-black hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall of night. She was a master thief, known only by her alias: "La Serpente" (The Snake).

Born in the streets of Rome, Sofia had grown up on the fringes of society. Her parents had been con artists, swindling the wealthy elite with their charm and charisma. But when Sofia was just a teenager, she discovered that her family's games were not so harmless after all. She had stumbled upon one of their most lucrative scams, and in a fit of rage, her mother had left her for dead.

Miraculously, Sofia had survived. With no other options, she had taken to the streets, using her wit and cunning to survive. As she grew older, she turned her talents to a life of thievery, learning how to pick locks, crack safes, and slip in and out of the shadows unnoticed.

Years went by, and Sofia's reputation as La Serpente spread far and wide. She targeted the most secure locations – museums, jewelry stores, and wealthy collectors' mansions. Her methods were always impeccable, her timing precise. No one had ever seen her come or go without leaving a trail of confusion in her wake.

But there was one case that still lingered in Sofia's mind: the heist at the Galleria Borghese. She had spent months planning it, studying the security cameras and layout of the museum with an obsessive attention to detail. And then, on the night of the exhibition opening, she had slipped in, dodged the guards, and made off with a priceless Raphael painting.

Or so she thought.

The next morning, Sofia received a message from the thief who called himself "Il Faraone" (The Pharaoh). He claimed to have been watching her for years, studying her methods and admiring her skill. And now, he wanted a piece of the action.

Sofia was intrigued. She had always operated alone, but something about Il Faraone's words resonated with her. Maybe it was the thrill of the chase, or maybe it was the promise of collaboration – but whatever it was, Sofia found herself agreeing to meet Il Faraone in secret.

As she walked into the abandoned warehouse, Sofia felt a shiver run down her spine. Who was this man, and what did he really want? But as their eyes met, she knew that she had entered a game where the stakes were higher than ever before – and La Serpente was ready to play.
