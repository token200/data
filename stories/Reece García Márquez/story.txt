Reece García Márquez was known for his unorthodox approach to life. As a direct descendant of Gabriel García Márquez, the famous Colombian author, he often found himself living in the shadow of his illustrious relative's legacy.

Growing up in Bogotá, Reece struggled to find his own place within the family narrative. His parents, both writers themselves, urged him to follow in his uncle's footsteps and become a renowned novelist. However, Reece had other plans.

He spent most of his youth working as a mechanic, tinkering with engines and fixing old cars. There was something therapeutic about getting his hands dirty, he found.
