Maxime Grabowska stepped into the small, cluttered café, the bell above the door jingling as she made her way to the counter. The familiar scent of stale coffee and worn upholstery enveloped her, transporting her back to countless afternoons spent sipping tea with her old friend, Émile.

As she waited for her usual cappuccino, Maxime's eyes scanned the café, taking in the eclectic assortment of patrons: a group of rowdy students, their backpacks stacked haphazardly beside them; an elderly couple, hands intertwined as they nibbled on petit fours; and a lone figure, shrouded in shadows, nursing a cup of black coffee.

The barista, Pierre, raised an eyebrow as he handed Maxime her drink. "Still here, ma chère?" he asked, his voice low and conspiratorial.

Maxime smiled wryly, taking a sip of the lukewarm coffee. "Some things never change, Pierre."

As she sat down at a small table by the window, Maxime's gaze drifted back to the mysterious figure in the corner. Their eyes met, if only for a moment, and Maxime felt an inexplicable jolt of recognition.

It had been years since she'd last seen them, not since her mother's passing, but something about this stranger seemed... familiar. A flicker of uncertainty danced at the edges of her mind, but it was quickly extinguished as she turned back to her drink.

The afternoon wore on, with Maxime lost in thought, the sounds of the café fading into the background. The stranger remained seated, their face hidden behind a veil of shadows, until finally, they vanished into the crowded streets outside.

As the café began to clear, Pierre leaned in close, his voice barely above a whisper. "You know who that was, n'est-ce pas?"

Maxime raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "I don't know what you're talking about, Pierre."

But Pierre merely smiled knowingly, wiping down the counter with a dirty rag. "Don't play coy, Maxime. I've seen your eyes light up when someone mentions their name. You know it's Émile, after all these years."

Maxime's gaze drifted back to the spot where her friend had vanished. The connection was clear now – an unspoken understanding between them, a bond forged in the shared memories of their past.

She smiled softly, feeling the corners of her eyes crinkle at the edges. "I suppose I do."
