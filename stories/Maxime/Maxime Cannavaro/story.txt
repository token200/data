Maxime Cannavaro stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway, his piercing green eyes scanning the crowded streets of Montmartre. The Eiffel Tower rose majestically in the distance, its iron latticework glinting in the late afternoon sun.

As a former thief turned art dealer, Maxime had seen it all. He had spent years casing museums, galleries, and private collections, always staying one step ahead of the law. But after a close call with the Parisian authorities, he had decided to leave his life of crime behind.

Now, at the age of 35, Maxime owned his own art gallery on the Rue des Abbesse. He spent his days selling works by lesser-known artists and mentoring up-and-coming talent. It was a far cry from his old life, but one that brought him a sense of purpose he had never known before.

As he walked through the winding streets, Maxime couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia for his past. He had always been drawn to the underworld of art forgery and smuggling, fascinated by the intricate web of lies and deception that surrounded it.

But as he passed by the Mus√©e d'Orsay, he caught sight of a familiar figure - a young woman with piercing blue eyes and raven-black hair, who was rummaging through the museum's storage rooms. Maxime's instincts kicked in, and he quickened his pace, his mind racing with possibilities.

It was then that he saw her - a small, exquisite painting, tucked away in a hidden compartment of the museum's ancient stone walls. It was an original work by Claude Monet, one of the greatest masters of Impressionism. And yet, it seemed...different. The colors were more vibrant, the brushstrokes more confident.

Maxime's eyes locked onto the painting, his mind racing with questions. Who had created this masterpiece? Why had it been hidden away for so long? He knew that he had to have it, no matter what the cost. And as he turned back towards his gallery, he felt a thrill of excitement - Maxime Cannavaro was back in business.

But little did Maxime know, the young woman with piercing blue eyes was watching him from across the street. She was a forger, and this painting was her masterpiece. The game was on.
