Maxime Chun-yi was a man shrouded in mystery. A former spy and assassin, he had spent years honing his skills in the shadows, taking on missions that few dared to undertake. His past was a labyrinth of secrets and lies, with each step carefully calculated to leave no trail.

One day, Maxime received a message from an unknown sender, summoning him to Hong Kong. He arrived at the airport, dressed impeccably as always, his eyes scanning the crowd for any sign of trouble. As he boarded a taxi, the driver asked if he was heading to the Star Ferry. "Yes," Maxime replied, his voice low and smooth.

The ferry ride across Victoria Harbour offered a breathtaking view of the city skyline. But Maxime's attention was focused on the woman sitting beside him – an enigmatic figure with piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into his soul. She handed him a small package containing a note with only two words: "Run."

As they disembarked, the woman vanished into thin air, leaving Maxime stunned and confused. But he didn't hesitate. With every fiber of his being, he turned tail and sprinted through the crowded streets, weaving past pedestrians and dodging umbrellas.

Panic set in as he realized he had no idea where to go or what to do next. His phone was dead, and his earpiece crackled with static. The woman's warning echoed in his mind: "Run."

Suddenly, a sleek black sedan appeared out of nowhere, its tires screeching as it swooped in beside him. Maxime didn't flinch – he had anticipated this move. He jumped into the backseat just as the doors slammed shut behind him.

The driver, a woman with short black hair and piercing blue eyes, smiled wickedly at Maxime. "Time to catch your breath," she said, producing a cigarette from her purse.

Maxime took one drag before answering her unspoken question: Who were they? The wheels of the car hummed as they sped away into the night, leaving the chaos of the city behind. For the first time in years, Maxime felt vulnerable – and intrigued. What lay ahead, only time would tell.
