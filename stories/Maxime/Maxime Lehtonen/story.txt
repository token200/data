Maxime Lehtonen stepped into the old, dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of his contact. The Helsinki native had spent years building a network of informants and sources within the city's underworld, but this meeting was different.

He spotted her sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee. Her name was Sofia, an ex-CFSP agent turned freelance journalist. Maxime had heard rumors that she possessed information on a high-profile hacking ring operating in the city.

As he approached, Sofia looked up and locked eyes with him. The air seemed to thicken around them as they exchanged a nod. Maxime slid into the chair across from her and took out his notebook.

"So, what do you have?" Maxime asked, pulling out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket.

Sofia leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. "I've been investigating a group calling themselves 'Eclipse.' They're rumored to be planning something big."

Maxime's eyes narrowed as he scribbled down notes. "What makes you think that?"

"They've been sniffing around high-security government facilities," Sofia replied. "And from what I've managed to dig up, they have some serious resources at their disposal."

As the hours passed, Maxime and Sofia exchanged information and speculation. The hacking ring was thought to be linked to a powerful tech mogul, rumored to have connections with Russian oligarchs.

Suddenly, Maxime's phone buzzed with an incoming text from his encrypted channel. His contact had received intel on Eclipse's planned operation: they were targeting the city's central data hub. It would be the ultimate prize for a group like this.

Maxime turned back to Sofia. "Do you know who's behind it?"

Sofia shook her head, her eyes scanning the room nervously. "I don't. But I do know one thing – if Eclipse pulls this off, we could see some serious fallout."

As they wrapped up their meeting and parted ways, Maxime couldn't shake off the feeling that he was getting close to something much bigger than himself. The stakes were high, but one thing was certain: Maxime Lehtonen wouldn't back down from a challenge.

He lit a cigarette, taking a long drag as he stepped out of the café into the chilly Helsinki night air. The game had just gotten personal – and the clock was ticking.
