Maxime Zariņš stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station with a mix of familiarity and disconnection. He had been back in Riga for a few days now, but it still felt like a temporary visit to this city he once called home.

As he made his way through the quiet streets, Maxime Zariņš couldn't help but think about how far he'd come since leaving Latvia all those years ago. He had built a new life in Berlin, one filled with art and music, but it wasn't the same as being back among the familiar hills and buildings of his childhood.

He arrived at the small café where he had agreed to meet his old friend, Kristaps, and was greeted by the warm smile of the owner. "Maxime Zariņš! It's been too long!" she exclaimed, as she handed him a steaming cup of coffee.

Kristaps walked in a few minutes later, his eyes lighting up with recognition as he spotted Maxime Zariņš across the room. They spent the next few hours catching up on old times, reminiscing about their days at university and sharing stories of their adventures since graduating.

As they talked, Maxime Zariņš found himself feeling more at home than he had in weeks. Maybe it was the familiar rhythms of the café, or maybe it was just Kristaps' infectious energy, but for a few hours at least, he felt like himself again.

Eventually, the conversation turned to art, and Maxime Zariņš pulled out his sketchbook, showing off some of his latest pieces. Kristaps oohed and ahhed over each one, offering constructive feedback and words of encouragement. For a moment, they forgot about their pasts and their uncertain futures, lost in the simple joy of creation.

As the sun began to set outside, casting a golden glow over the city, Maxime Zariņš knew it was time to leave. He thanked Kristaps for the afternoon, promising to stay in touch this time. As he walked back to his flat, he felt a sense of peace settle over him, like he had finally found his way home – not to Riga specifically, but to himself.
