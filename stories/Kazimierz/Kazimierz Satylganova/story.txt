Kazimierz Satylganova, a former KGB agent turned rogue, sat in his cluttered Moscow flat, sipping on a glass of whiskey. The flickering fluorescent light above his desk cast an eerie glow over the scattered papers, broken pens, and tattered photographs that covered every available surface.

As he gazed out the grimy window, Kazimierz's mind wandered back to his years of espionage. He had been trained to be a chameleon, to blend in seamlessly with his surroundings, to extract information without being detected. But after the fall of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the KGB, Kazimierz found himself lost and disillusioned.

He had tried to rebrand himself as a freelance journalist, but the truth about his past eventually caught up with him. The CIA and MI6 had reached out, offering him deals he couldn't refuse – protection in exchange for his services. But Kazimierz was no longer interested in serving anyone's interests but his own.

Over the years, he had built a network of contacts, whispers of information that only he possessed. He knew where to find the most valuable secrets, how to get his hands on classified documents. It made him rich, but it also made him isolated. No one could truly trust him.

Kazimierz's eyes locked onto a photograph on his desk – a young couple, smiling and happy, with a caption that read: "Our Wedding Day, 1987". He hadn't seen them in years, not since the war broke out between East and West. The world had changed so much, and Kazimierz was left behind.

He poured another drink into his glass, feeling the burn all the way down. As he looked around the flat, Kazimierz realized that he was running out of time. He needed to find a new mark, someone who would be desperate enough to trust him with their secrets. The phone rang, shrill and insistent.

With a wry smile, Kazimierz picked up the receiver, his voice dripping with sincerity as he asked: "Who is this?"
