His village, once a quiet retreat from the world, was now a hub of activity, with visitors arriving daily to seek his counsel and wisdom.

Despite the fame that came with it, Kazimierz remained humble, knowing that his gift was not just about him, but about the animals and the land that he loved. With Dr. Kim's guidance, he continued to work tirelessly, using his extraordinary abilities to protect the natural world and all its creatures – a true champion of the animal kingdom.
