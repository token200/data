Growing up in a low-income neighborhood, Marc had witnessed firsthand the struggles faced by those around him.

People from all walks of life would stop in front of his work, mesmerized by the swirling colors and powerful messages. They saw themselves reflected back, a reminder that their struggles were valid, that their stories mattered.

Marc's art was more than just self-expression; it was activism. He used his platform to bring attention to social injustices and advocate for change. His full name, Marc López Rodríguez, became a symbol of hope in a world often shrouded in darkness.
