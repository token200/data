Marc Salamanca was a force to be reckoned with in the world of organized crime. His real name, born as Marco "The Lizzard" Lammle Jr., may have been unassuming, but his reputation as a ruthless and cunning leader knew no bounds.

As the right-hand man to Gus Fring's empire, Marc had established himself as one of the most feared and respected figures in the cartel. His calm demeanor and calculating gaze sent shivers down the spines of even the toughest adversaries.

One sunny afternoon, Marc received a visit from his old friend, Tuco Salamanca. Yes, it was ironic that their names shared the same last name - a coincidence that Marc found peculiar at times. As Tuco arrived at the designated meeting point, a mixture of excitement and nervousness emanated from him. He had news to share about a potential new business venture.

"Gus wants us to join forces with some new players," Tuco blurted out, not exactly knowing what he was getting himself into. Marc listened intently as Tuco outlined the plan, his eyes never leaving the man opposite him.

Marc's expression remained stoic, but inside, a warning bell started ringing in his mind. Something about this didn't feel right. The proposed partnership seemed too good to be true - and indeed it was. These new players were nothing but common thugs looking to exploit others for their own gain.

As Marc listened on, he realized that Tuco had fallen prey to the promise of easy money and blinded himself to the potential risks. A plan was formed, one that would ensure Marc's continued success while keeping him safe from any unnecessary entanglements.

Marc made his move swiftly, sidestepping Tuco's attempts at camaraderie and steering the conversation towards more practical matters. When the dust settled, it became clear that Tuco would be leaving the business - and for good reason.

Despite their complicated history, Marc knew he couldn't let anything or anyone bring him down from his position of power. As a seasoned veteran like himself put it: 'Survival in this world requires wit, cunning and an endless supply of caution.'
