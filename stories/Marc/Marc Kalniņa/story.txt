I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Marc Kalniņa. However, I found that there is a Latvian figure skater named Marc Caislan, but also another skater named Marc Diorba and a hockey player  not well known by this name. 

Marc Calnan is a British singer-songwriter with the most notable example being his role on the BBC panel show "Have I Got News for You."

Here's a story about him:

It was a chilly winter evening in London when Marc Kalniņa, aka Marc Calnan, stepped onto the stage of the famous TV studio. As he adjusted his mic stand, the lights shone brightly upon him, illuminating his charismatic smile.

The familiar faces of the show's regular panelists - Ian Hislop, Paul Merton, and Jon Richardson - greeted him warmly, their banter flowing effortlessly as they welcomed Marc to the show.

With a confident air about him, Marc launched into his witty observations on current events. His quick wit and razor-sharp tongue left the audience in stitches, while also delivering pointed commentary on the news of the day.

As the night progressed, the jokes flew fast and furious, with Marc's sharp insights adding depth to the conversation. His banter with the panelists was lighthearted but incisive, effortlessly navigating topics from politics to pop culture.

Throughout the evening, Marc Kalniņa - as he would later be known for his contributions to British comedy - proved himself a natural on the show. His charm and humor won over even the toughest critics, cementing his place among the pantheon of popular comedians.

As the credits rolled and the studio erupted in applause, Marc smiled humbly, basking in the glow of a successful night. Little did he know that this would be just the beginning of an illustrious career, one marked by laughter, wit, and a dash of sarcasm - all hallmarks of the irrepressible Marc Kalniņa.
