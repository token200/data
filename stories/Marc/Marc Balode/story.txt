Marc Balode was a man with a mysterious past. He had been born to an unknown mother and abandoned as a child in a small town on the outskirts of Latvia. The townsfolk took him in and raised him as one of their own, teaching him the ways of traditional Latvian crafts and folklore.

As Marc grew older, he became increasingly restless, feeling an insatiable hunger for knowledge about his true identity. He spent years searching for any clue that might lead him to his long-lost mother, but to no avail. His search was met with skepticism by the townsfolk, who had grown fond of their adopted son.

One day, while rummaging through the attic of the old wooden house where he lived, Marc stumbled upon a dusty old book. The cover was adorned with strange symbols that seemed to shimmer in the dim light. As he opened the book, he discovered it was filled with handwritten notes and sketches of ancient Latvian gods.

The writing was cryptic, but one passage stood out: "Baldājs laiks ir šīs laika" - " Bald is the time of this season." Marc felt a shiver run down his spine as he realized that "Baldājs" was actually his given name at birth. Suddenly, everything fell into place.

He remembered snippets of conversations with an elderly woman who claimed to have known his mother before she vanished. She spoke of a prophecy foretelling the arrival of a young man named Baldājs laiks. It seemed that Marc Balode was not just any ordinary Latvian craftsman but a descendant of a powerful lineage.

The news sent Marc's life into a whirlwind of excitement and discovery. He became obsessed with unraveling the mysteries of his past, convinced that he held the key to understanding an ancient culture on the cusp of collapse. With every new revelation, his name seemed more and more like a calling card - "Marc Balode" was no longer just a name but a testament to his true heritage.
