The sun had just set over the bustling streets of Paris, casting a warm orange glow over the city. In a small café on the Rue de Rivoli, Marc Hao sat alone at a table by the window, nursing a cup of black coffee. It was a typical Wednesday evening for him – quiet and uneventful.

Marc was a man of few words, with piercing blue eyes that seemed to hold a thousand secrets within them. He had been a detective in his youth, but after a particularly brutal case had left him shaken, he had retired from the force. Now, at the age of 50, he spent most of his days lost in thought, replaying memories and trying to make sense of the world.

As he sat in the café, Marc's mind wandered back to the night that had changed everything for him – the night his partner had been killed on the job. The case still haunted him, a constant reminder of what could have been if only he had seen it coming.

The door to the café swung open and a young woman walked in, her eyes scanning the room as if searching for someone. Marc watched her with interest, noting the way she moved with a quiet confidence that belied the vulnerability etched on her face.

As fate would have it, the young woman slid into the empty chair across from Marc, her eyes locking onto his with an intensity that made him feel like he was being stripped bare. "Mind if I join you?" she asked, her voice husky and seductive.

Marc raised an eyebrow, surprised by her boldness. "Not at all," he replied, gesturing to the chair across from him.

The woman smiled and slid into the seat, sending a flutter through Marc's chest that he hadn't experienced in years. As they introduced themselves – she was Sophie, a journalist on a mission to uncover a dark conspiracy – Marc found himself drawn back into the world of detection.

For the first time in years, Marc felt like he had a purpose again. Maybe it was time for him to trade his retirement card for a new one, one that read "Undercover Journalist".
