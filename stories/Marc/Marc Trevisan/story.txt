As he sat at his desk, sipping his coffee and staring at the stack of files in front of him, Marc Trevisan couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

Marc Trevisan's eyes narrowed as he pored over the evidence. He was determined to uncover the truth behind Sarah's death, and he knew that it would require all of his skills and experience.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. "Ah, good timing," Marc Trevisan said with a smile. It was his partner, Detective James. "I've got some new leads on the case," he said, holding up a piece of paper. "Looks like Sarah's boyfriend had an alibi for the time she died."

Marc Trevisan's eyes lit up as he took the paper from James. He scanned it quickly, his mind racing with possibilities. This could be the break they needed to crack the case.

As the day wore on, Marc Trevisan and James followed a trail of clues that led them deeper into the mystery. They interviewed witnesses, searched for physical evidence, and pieced together the events leading up to Sarah's death.

Marc Trevisan felt a sense of satisfaction as he closed the case file. It had been a tough one, but with his sharp mind and quick thinking, he had solved it.

As he packed up his things to head home, Marc Trevisan couldn't help but feel proud of himself. He was, after all, Detective Marc Trevisan, the man who had cracked the toughest case in the city.
