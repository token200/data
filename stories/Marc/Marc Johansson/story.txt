Marc Johansson wiped the sweat from his brow as he surveyed the city below. A private investigator, he had seen it all - the desperation in a woman's eyes, the calculating gaze of a corporate executive, and the haunted expressions of those who'd lost loved ones to the streets.

He leaned against the railing of the rooftop bar, sipping on a whiskey that tasted like old regrets. The view of the city was one he knew well - a sprawl of steel and concrete that seemed to stretch on forever. It was a place where dreams were made, but also broken.

Marc's own past was marked by both. Growing up in the wrong side of town had taught him how to navigate the shadows, how to find the hidden paths that only revealed themselves after dark. But it had also left its scars - the ones on his body, and the ones on his heart.

He thought about Emily, a young woman he'd taken under his wing a few years ago. She'd been running from her own demons, and Marc had promised to help her find her way out of the darkness. He still kept an ear to the ground for news of her whereabouts - knew she was safe somewhere out there.

A group of revelers stumbled onto the rooftop, laughing and shouting as they passed by him. Marc watched them go with a detached curiosity - these were people who thought they owned the night, but he knew better. He'd seen too many broken dreams to believe in fairy tales.

Just then, his phone buzzed on the table beside him. It was an unknown number, and Marc's instincts told him it wasn't good news. But before he could even think twice, a low, gravelly voice spoke on the other end of the line.

"You're looking for something, Johansson," the voice said. "Maybe you should focus on what you already have."

Marc raised an eyebrow as he took another sip of his drink. This was no prank call - whoever this was, they knew him too well. He leaned in, voice low.

"Who is it? And what do you know?"

The line went dead before the other man could respond, leaving Marc to wonder if this was a test or a warning. Either way, he knew one thing for sure: his night had just gotten interesting - and potentially deadly.
