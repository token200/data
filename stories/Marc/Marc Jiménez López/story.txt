Marc Jiménez López was a man with a passion for photography. He spent most of his days capturing the beauty of the world around him through his lens. His friends and family often joked that he had a "third eye" because he could see things that others couldn't.

One day, Marc decided to take a trip to the beach to capture some shots of the sunset. He arrived early, eager to set up his equipment and get into position before the crowds arrived. As he waited for the perfect shot, he noticed an old woman sitting on a bench nearby, watching him with a keen eye.

"Excuse me," Marc said, approaching the woman. "I couldn't help but notice your beautiful scarf. Where did you get it?"

The woman smiled and began to tell Marc the story of how she had made the scarf herself, using traditional techniques passed down from her grandmother. As they talked, Marc took note of the intricate patterns and colors, knowing that he would capture them perfectly in his photos.

As the sun began to set, Marc snapped away, trying to get the perfect shot. The old woman sat quietly beside him, watching as the light danced across the waves. Finally, after what felt like hours, Marc got the photo he had been waiting for - a stunning shot of the sunset over the ocean.

The old woman turned to Marc and said, "You have a good eye, young man. I think you might be a photographer."

Marc grinned, feeling proud of himself. He thanked the old woman for her kind words and promised to share his photos with her.

As he packed up his equipment, Marc couldn't help but feel grateful for the unexpected encounter. It had reminded him why he loved photography so much - the connection it allowed him to make with others, even if only for a brief moment in time.

From that day on, Marc continued to capture the beauty of the world around him, always remembering the old woman and her beautiful scarf. And whenever he looked at his photos, he knew that he had been given a special gift - the ability to see the world through someone else's eyes.
