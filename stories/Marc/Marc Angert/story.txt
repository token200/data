Marc Angert stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the cityscape. The sun was setting, casting a golden glow over the towering skyscrapers and bustling streets below. He took a deep breath, feeling the cool evening air fill his lungs.

As a photographer, Marc had spent countless nights like this one, capturing the beauty of the city from its many vantage points. But tonight was different. Tonight, he was on assignment to shoot a wedding at the iconic Empire State Building.

Marc's mind wandered back to the happy couple he would soon be photographing. Emma and Ryan had met in college and had been inseparable ever since. They shared the same sense of adventure and love for life that Marc did, and he couldn't wait to capture their special day.

As he began to set up his camera equipment, Marc's thoughts turned to his own life. He had always been a bit of a loner, content to spend his time behind the lens capturing the world around him. But lately, he'd started to feel a sense of restlessness. Maybe it was the age of 35 and feeling like he still had so much to explore.

Just then, Emma emerged from the building's elevator, beaming with happiness as she made her way towards Marc. "Hey, photographer extraordinaire!" she exclaimed, laughing as she spotted him.

Marc couldn't help but smile as he took her hand, leading her to the edge of the rooftop where they would begin their formal portraits. As the camera snapped and clicked away, capturing the magic of the moment, Marc felt a sense of contentment wash over him.

For the first time in years, he felt like he was exactly where he was meant to be – capturing life's precious moments for others to cherish.

As the night wore on and the sun dipped below the horizon, Marc snapped one final shot before packing up his gear. He watched as Emma and Ryan exchanged their first kiss as husband and wife, feeling grateful to have been a part of their special day.

In that moment, Marc knew he had found something far more meaningful than just capturing images – he had discovered purpose in sharing the love and joy of others with the world.
