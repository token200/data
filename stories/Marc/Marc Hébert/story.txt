As he delved deeper into the world of politics, Marc discovered that corruption was everywhere – in government offices, backroom deals, and even within the newsrooms themselves.

Marc Hébert's unwavering commitment to justice made him a target for many powerful people. But he refused to be silenced or intimidated. Instead, he continued to write, to speak out, and to demand accountability from those who had lost sight of what was right.
