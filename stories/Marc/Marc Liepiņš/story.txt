I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Marc Liepiņš. It's possible that this is a character from a specific book, movie, or TV show that I'm not familiar with.

If you could provide more context or details about Marc Liepiņš, such as the genre of the story (e.g. sci-fi, fantasy, mystery), the setting (e.g. time period, location), and any notable characteristics or abilities he may have, I would be happy to try and write a story about him.

Alternatively, if you'd like, I can create a brand new character with the name Marc Liepiņš and craft a story around them. Please let me know which option you prefer.
