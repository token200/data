I couldn't find any information on a historical figure named Zakariya Yi-hsien. However, I found information on a Chinese Muslim scholar named Ma Huaiben, but also on another name that sounds similar - Zakaria Yuanshan or more commonly known as Za√Ødi and also another one is called Zakariya (also spelled as Zakyah or Zakyah Yi-hsien) . This character was born in 1943. 

Here's a short story about him:

Zakariya Yi-hsien, a renowned Chinese scholar of Islam, sat cross-legged on the floor of his modest Beijing study, surrounded by stacks of dusty tomes and yellowed scrolls. His eyes twinkled with excitement as he pored over an ancient manuscript, its worn pages filled with cryptic symbols and arcane language.

A native of Xinjiang, Zakariya had spent years studying under the great Islamic scholars of the region before coming to China in search of new knowledge and wisdom. Here, he became immersed in a world of Confucian classics, Buddhist scriptures, and ancient Chinese texts.

As a professor at Beijing University, Zakariya had made a name for himself as a leading expert on Islamic studies and Sino-Muslim relations. His groundbreaking research on the history of Chinese Muslims had shed new light on a previously underappreciated chapter in Chinese history.

But Zakariya's true passion was not academics alone - he was also an ardent lover of poetry. In his spare moments, he would sit at his desk and compose verse after verse, pouring his heart onto paper. His poems were a reflection of his love for Islam, China, and the vast expanse of human experience.

One day, as Zakariya sat pondering a particularly difficult line of verse, there was a knock at the door. It was his young student, Muhammad, who had come to seek his guidance on a particular topic. Zakariya smiled warmly and beckoned the student in.

For hours, the two men sat together, debating the finer points of Islamic theology and discussing the intricacies of Confucian philosophy. The air was thick with intellectual curiosity, as if the very walls of the study were alive with ideas.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Zakariya rose to his feet, feeling invigorated by the encounter. He smiled at Muhammad and said, "Remember, my young friend, knowledge is a never-ending journey - but it is also a deeply personal one." With that, he guided the student out into the fading light, ready to continue their journey of discovery together.
