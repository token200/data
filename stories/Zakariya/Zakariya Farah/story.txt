Zakariya Farah had always been drawn to the unknown, his restless spirit yearning for adventure beyond the dusty streets of Mogadishu. Growing up in a war-torn Somalia, he'd lost loved ones to conflict and violence, but that only fueled his determination to explore the world beyond.

After completing his education, Zakariya decided to leave Somalia behind, seeking a fresh start in Europe. He settled in Berlin, where he immersed himself in languages and cultures, determined to learn as much as he could about the diverse world around him.

It was during this time that Zakariya discovered a passion for photography. With a camera in hand, he roamed the streets of Berlin, capturing the city's vibrant street art scene and the faces of its eclectic inhabitants. His lens became an extension of himself, revealing stories and emotions to those who viewed his work.

One evening, while exhibiting his photographs at a local gallery, Zakariya met an Ethiopian woman named Amina. She was a writer, her words weaving tales of displacement and resilience in a voice both fierce and gentle. As they talked, the connection between them grew stronger with each passing moment.

Together, Zakariya and Amina began to create something new – a collaborative project that blended his photography with her writing. The resulting book, "Beneath the Surface," became an instant hit, attracting attention from across the continent.

Their work took them on a journey through North Africa and the Middle East, capturing stories of hope and struggle in lands ravaged by conflict. Zakariya's camera lens revealed hidden histories, while Amina's words brought the faces and voices to life.

As their bond grew stronger, Zakariya realized that his restless spirit had finally found its purpose – to tell the untold stories of a world in flux. With each frame and every word, he and Amina aimed to humanize the invisible, to give voice to those who'd been silenced by war and displacement.

Their collaboration transcended borders, speaking to hearts across the globe. Zakariya's camera and Amina's words became beacons of hope, illuminating the darkest corners of a world that often seemed too big and too scary for one person to face alone.
