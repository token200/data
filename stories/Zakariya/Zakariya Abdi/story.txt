Zakariya Abdi was a young refugee from Somalia, who had fled his war-torn homeland in search of safety and peace. With a determined look on his face, he stood outside the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) office, clutching a tattered copy of his passport. His full name, Zakariya Abdi, echoed in his mind as he waited for what felt like an eternity to be processed.

As a child, Zakariya had witnessed firsthand the horrors of war - the sound of gunfire, the smell of smoke, and the cries of his family members still haunted him. But he refused to let it define him. Instead, he held onto the hope of rebuilding his life in a new country. The thought of starting anew was both exhilarating and terrifying.

After what felt like an eternity, Zakariya's number was finally called. He walked into the office, nervously clutching his documents, and began the arduous process of applying for asylum. The waiting room was filled with people just like him - desperate for a chance at a better life.

As he waited, Zakariya couldn't help but think of his full name, Zakariya Abdi, and all that it represented. It was more than just a name - it was a connection to his past, a reminder of the struggles he had endured, and a symbol of hope for his future.

Finally, after hours of waiting, Zakariya's application was approved. He let out a sigh of relief as he received his visa, feeling like a weight had been lifted off his shoulders. With his new documents in hand, Zakariya felt a sense of determination wash over him - he would rebuild his life, and make the most of this second chance.

As he left the office, Zakariya couldn't help but think of his full name once again, feeling a sense of pride and purpose. He knew that there was still much work to be done, but for the first time in years, Zakariya Abdi felt like he could finally see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel.
