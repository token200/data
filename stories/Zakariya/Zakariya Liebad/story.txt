In the scorching desert city of Zahran, a young man named Zakariya Liebad was known for his extraordinary abilities as a thief. With eyes that shone like polished onyx and hair as black as the night sky, he moved undetected through the crowded souks, snatching valuables from unsuspecting merchants.

But Zakariya Liebad's exploits were not without their costs. He had lost count of how many times he had been caught and freed by his childhood friend, Amira, who worked at the city's famous marketplace. Despite the risks, Zakariya Liebad couldn't resist the thrill of the chase, the rush of adrenaline that came with outsmarting his prey.

One day, Zakariya Liebad set his sights on the most prized possession of the Sultan himself: a golden amulet adorned with precious gems. The task was perilous, but Zakariya Liebad was undaunted. He spent days studying the Sultan's guards, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

The night of the full moon, Zakariya Liebad put his plan into action. Under the silvery light, he slipped past the guards and into the palace, avoiding deadly traps and laser beams as he made his way to the amulet. Just as he reached out to claim it, however, he was confronted by the Sultan himself.

To Zakariya Liebad's surprise, the Sultan spoke not of punishment or betrayal, but of admiration for the young thief's cunning and skill. The Sultan proposed a deal: in exchange for the amulet, Zakariya Liebad would become his personal bodyguard, using his talents to protect the royal family from threats within and without.

Zakariya Liebad hesitated, weighing his options. But as he looked into the Sultan's eyes, he saw something there that gave him pause â€“ a glimmer of respect, perhaps, or even admiration for this young thief who had outwitted him so spectacularly. In the end, Zakariya Liebad accepted the offer, and with it, a new path was forged for this most unlikely of heroes.
