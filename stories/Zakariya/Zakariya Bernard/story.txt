Zakariya Bernard stepped off the plane, his worn leather boots sinking into the scorching hot sand. He had been on the move for weeks, evading the authorities and searching for answers. As a former member of an elite government task force, he knew that in his line of work, loyalty was a luxury few could afford.

Zakariya's thoughts drifted back to his past, to the team he used to lead - codename "Nightshade". They were the best of the best, handpicked for their skills and ruthlessness. But when a mission went sour, Zakariya began to question the true motives behind their operations. He knew that if he spoke out, he would be silenced forever.

As he navigated the crowded airport, Zakariya's eyes scanned the crowd, searching for any sign of danger. His instincts told him that someone was following him, watching his every move. He quickened his pace, dodging tourists and businessmen alike.

Finally, he emerged onto the streets of Marrakech, the cacophony of sounds and smells overwhelming him. The vibrant colors and ornate architecture seemed like a welcome respite from the darkness of his past. Zakariya spotted a small caf√© tucked away in a quiet alleyway and made his way towards it.

He took a seat at a corner table, ordering a strong black coffee as he pulled out his phone to check for messages. A text from an unknown number flashed on the screen - "Meet me at the old windmill on the outskirts of town if you want answers". The message was cryptic, but Zakariya's curiosity got the better of him.

He downed the rest of his coffee and set off towards the windmill, his senses on high alert. As he approached the abandoned structure, a figure emerged from the shadows - a young woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair.

"I've been watching you, Zakariya," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I know about Nightshade. I know what happened to your team."

Zakariya's instincts told him that this was no ordinary informant. He eyed the woman warily, but something in her gaze hinted at a deeper truth - one that might just bring closure to his troubled past.

Without a word, Zakariya nodded, and together they stepped into the darkness of the windmill, ready to face whatever secrets lay within.
