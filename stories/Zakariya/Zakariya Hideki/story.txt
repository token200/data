In the scorching desert city of Zahran, where the sun dipped into the dunes like a burning ember, Zakariya Hideki was known for his unwavering resolve. His full name, Zakariya Hideki, echoed through the streets as he traversed the markets, searching for any hint of information about his missing sister.

Aza, her bright smile and laughter had vanished without warning, leaving behind only whispers of a mysterious figure seen lurking around the city's ancient ruins. Zakariya Hideki's heart burned with every rumor, every fragment of news that seemed to lead him further away from finding Aza.

One sweltering evening, as the stars began to twinkle above the dunes, Zakariya Hideki stumbled upon a hooded figure huddled in a corner of the city's largest marketplace. The air was thick with incense and secrets. Without hesitation, Zakariya approached the figure, his eyes locked onto theirs.

"I've been searching for you," he said, his voice low and steady. "I need to know what happened to my sister."

The hooded figure slowly raised its head, revealing piercing green eyes that seemed to hold a world of knowledge. "Aza was taken by one who sought to harness her gift," the figure replied, their voice like a soft breeze.

"A gift?" Zakariya Hideki repeated, his grip on the stranger's wrist tightening. "What are you talking about?"

The figure pulled back its hood, revealing a shocking truth: Zakariya Hideki himself was Aza's guardian, sworn to protect her from those who would misuse her abilities. The revelation sent shockwaves through Zakariya Hideki's mind as he grappled with the weight of his responsibilities.

With newfound determination, Zakariya Hideki vowed to track down the person responsible for his sister's disappearance and restore balance to their world. As the night air grew colder, the stars shining brighter above, Zakariya Hideki stood resolute, ready to face whatever dangers lay ahead, armed with nothing but his unwavering resolve and an unshakeable determination to protect those he loved.
