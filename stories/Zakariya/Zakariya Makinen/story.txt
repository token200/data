I couldn't find any information on a person named Zakariya Makinen. It's possible that they are a fictional character or not a public figure. 

However, I can generate a story about a character with this name. Here it is:

Zakariya Makinen was a 25-year-old graphic novelist from Helsinki, Finland. He had always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and art, which led him to create his own webcomic series, "Cybro." The show followed the adventures of a young hacker named Zephyr, who used his skills to fight against corporate espionage and cybercrime.

Despite facing financial struggles and self-doubt, Zakariya remained committed to his craft. He spent every waking moment honing his drawing skills, writing engaging storylines, and promoting his work on social media. His dedication paid off when "Cybro" gained a small but dedicated following among comic book enthusiasts.

One day, Zakariya received an email from a prominent publisher offering him a deal to turn "Cybro" into a full-fledged animated series. Overjoyed, Zakariya accepted the offer and began working with a team of writers, animators, and voice actors to bring Zephyr's world to life.

As production progressed, Zakariya found himself at the forefront of a growing movement of independent creators who were using digital media to tell stories that mattered. His passion project had become a symbol of resistance against the homogenization of art in the digital age.

When "Cybro" premiered on Finnish television, it received rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. Zakariya Makinen, the man behind the webcomic series, was hailed as a rising star in the world of animation. His perseverance and creativity had paid off, and he knew that this was just the beginning of an exciting new chapter in his life.

As Zakariya looked out at the crowd of fans who had gathered to celebrate the show's success, he couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. He had created something truly special, and it was all thanks to his unwavering dedication to his art.
