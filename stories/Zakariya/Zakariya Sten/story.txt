Zakariya Sten sat in the dimly lit café, nursing a cup of bitter coffee. He stared out the window, watching as people scurried by on the bustling street below. As a private investigator, he'd seen his fair share of desperation and despair, but there was something about this case that had gotten under his skin.

It started with a phone call from an old acquaintance, asking for help finding her missing sister. The sister, Sofia, had been working as a journalist in the city's seedy underbelly. Her last article had hinted at some kind of dark conspiracy, and now she was gone.

Zakariya had taken the case on a whim, but something about it had resonated with him. Maybe it was the desperation in his acquaintance's voice, or maybe it was the fact that he'd once known Sofia as a fellow journalist himself.

As he sipped his coffee, Zakariya pulled out his notebook and began to review the notes he'd taken on Sofia's last article. The words blurred together on the page, but one phrase stood out: "The Devil's in the Details."

He muttered it under his breath, wondering what kind of devil was at work here.

Zakariya set his coffee cup down and began to walk through the crowded café, eyes scanning the patrons for any sign of recognition. He knew Sofia's sister would be nervous and jumpy, so he kept a close eye on anyone who seemed out of place.

That's when he saw her – a petite woman with a look of desperation in her eyes. She was sitting alone at a table near the back, nursing a cup of tea. Zakariya made his way over to her, flashing a warm smile as he took a seat across from her.

"I'm Zakariya Sten," he said, holding out a hand. "I've been looking for you."

The woman's eyes welled up with tears as she shook his hand. "Thank God you're here," she whispered. "I think I know what happened to Sofia."

Zakariya leaned in, intrigued. "Tell me more."
