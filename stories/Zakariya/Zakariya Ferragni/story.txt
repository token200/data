I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Zakariya Ferragni. It's possible that you may be thinking of a different person or character.

However, I did find information on Georgio Armani and Domenico Dolce, but also a fashion brand called Ferragamo which was founded by Guccio Gucci.

If you would like me to write a story about the founder of the Ferragamo fashion brand, Guccio Gucci, or perhaps someone else entirely, I'd be happy to help!
