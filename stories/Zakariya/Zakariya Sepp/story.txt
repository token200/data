Zakariya Sepp's journey as an artist began in the souks of Marrakech, where he would spend hours observing the intricate patterns and colors of traditional Berber textiles. Inspired by the rich cultural heritage of his homeland, Zakariya Sepp had honed his skills in painting and craftsmanship.

One fateful evening, a prominent art collector stumbled upon Zakariya Sepp's work at a local gallery. Enchanted by the young artist's unique style and energy, she decided to feature his pieces in her upcoming exhibition. News of the exhibit spread quickly, drawing in crowds from all over the city.
