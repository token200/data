I couldn't find any information on a person named Zakariya Pei-ling. It is possible that this person is fictional or not well-known. 

However, I can generate a story about a character with this name.

Zakariya Pei-ling was a young and ambitious botanist who had always been fascinated by the unique flora of his native China. Growing up in the misty mountains of Sichuan Province, Zakariya spent most of his childhood exploring the forest, collecting seeds, and studying the medicinal properties of plants.

As he grew older, Zakariya's passion for botany only intensified. He pursued a degree in horticulture at the prestigious University of Beijing, where he excelled in his studies and quickly became known among his peers as a brilliant researcher.

After completing his undergraduate degree, Zakariya traveled to Europe to study under renowned botanists at some of the world's top universities. For several years, he worked tirelessly in laboratories, conducting experiments and gathering data on the properties of rare plant species.

Upon returning to China, Zakariya was appointed as a leading researcher at the prestigious Institute of Botany, where he continued his work on plant classification and discovery. His findings were met with international acclaim, and soon he was being approached by pharmaceutical companies, government agencies, and conservation organizations seeking his expertise.

Zakariya's groundbreaking research on medicinal plants had far-reaching implications for human health and the environment. He worked closely with his colleagues to develop new treatments for diseases and to conserve threatened plant species. Through his tireless efforts, Zakariya became a respected figure in the scientific community, known for his unwavering dedication to his work.

Despite his success, Zakariya remained humble and grounded, always mindful of the natural world that had inspired him as a child. He continued to explore the forests of Sichuan Province, searching for new species to study and protect. And whenever he looked up at the stars, Zakariya felt a deep connection to the universe, knowing that his work was a small but vital part of the grand tapestry of life.

Years later, as Zakariya looked back on his accomplishments, he knew that he had made a difference in the world, not just through his scientific discoveries, but through the countless lives he had touched and the plants he had helped to preserve. His legacy would live on, inspiring future generations of botanists, conservationists, and scientists to follow in his footsteps.
