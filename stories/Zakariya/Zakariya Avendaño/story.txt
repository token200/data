Zakariya Avendaño was a name that struck fear into the hearts of those who knew him. A former member of a notorious cartel, he had spent years honing his skills as a hitman and enforcer. But after a botched job left him with a price on his head, Zakariya Avendaño knew it was time to lay low for a while.

He traded in his tailored suits and gold chains for a pair of worn jeans and a faded t-shirt, blending in seamlessly with the crowds of tourists that flooded the streets of Puerto Vallarta. It wasn't an easy task, but Zakariya Avendaño had always been good at adapting.

As he sipped on a cold beer at the local cantina, Zakariya Avendaño couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. He knew that his past would eventually catch up with him, and when it did, he wouldn't be able to hide forever. The memories of the blood-soaked streets and the countless lives he had lost still haunted him, echoing in the darkest recesses of his mind.

Just then, a familiar face walked into the cantina, scanning the room as if searching for someone. Zakariya Avendaño's instincts kicked in, and he immediately went on high alert. The man was none other than his former boss, Victor Martinez, who had been presumed dead years ago.

Victor Martinez made his way over to Zakariya Avendaño's table, a sly grin spreading across his face. "Zakariya Avendaño, it's been far too long," he said, his voice dripping with malice. "I see you're still trying to keep a low profile."

Zakariya Avendaño smiled grimly, knowing that this was his chance to make a break for it. He downed the rest of his beer and stood up, his eyes locked on Victor Martinez's. "You'll never take me alive, Martinez," he growled, before turning and disappearing into the crowd.

As Zakariya Avendaño vanished into the chaos of Puerto Vallarta, he knew that this was far from over. The game was afoot once again, and he was ready to play. But for now, he just kept walking, his footsteps echoing through the streets as he disappeared into the night, leaving Victor Martinez to wonder if he had finally found himself another ghost to chase.

For Zakariya Avendaño, it was all about survival – a constant reminder that no matter how far he ran, his past would always be one step behind him.
