Zarina Sundlöf stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar station. She had been living abroad for what felt like an eternity, but this small town in Sweden still made her feel like a stranger. As she collected her suitcase from the luggage rack, a gust of wind whipped through the station, carrying with it the faint scent of wood smoke and pine.

Zarina's thoughts were consumed by the letter she had received earlier that day. It was from an old friend, Linnéa, who had moved back to Stockholm after years abroad. The message had been brief – "Come visit me in the summer" – but it had stirred something deep within Zarina. She had spent so much time wandering alone, lost in her own thoughts, that the idea of reconnecting with someone who knew her was both exhilarating and terrifying.

As she made her way through the station, Zarina felt a sense of disconnection from this place. The buildings seemed to lean in towards her, their wooden facades worn smooth by years of wind and snow. She wondered if anyone would even recognize her – the girl with the wild hair and piercing green eyes that had once been so full of life.

Zarina's suitcase was heavy with clothes she had picked up on her travels – scarves from Marrakech, a leather jacket from Tokyo, and a hand-woven shawl from a small village in Nepal. She felt like a collection of stories, each item telling a tale of its own. As she walked towards the town square, she spotted a group of children playing in the snow, their laughter carrying on the wind.

For a moment, Zarina felt a pang of loneliness. This wasn't her life – not anymore. But as she watched the children, their joy infectious, she began to feel a spark of hope. Maybe this summer, with Linnéa by her side, was exactly what she needed. Maybe it would be a chance to rediscover herself, to let go of the shadows that had followed her for so long.

Zarina smiled, feeling the weight of her suitcase lift ever so slightly. She knew that when she arrived at Linnéa's doorstep, there would be stories to tell and secrets to share. And as she walked towards the warmth of the summer sun, she felt a sense of belonging that she hadn't felt in years – not even in her own home.
