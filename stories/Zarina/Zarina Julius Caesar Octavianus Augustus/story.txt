Despite her family's expectations that she marry well and manage a household, Zarina had other ambitions. She was determined to make a name for herself in the world of politics, using her wit and intelligence to influence decisions and shape policies.

One day, while attending a gathering of Roman senators, Zarina caught the eye of Emperor Augustus himself. He was taken aback by her confidence and poise, and soon, she found herself invited to private meetings with him.

Under Augustus' guidance, Zarina honed her skills as a politician and advisor, quickly rising through the ranks to become one of his most trusted confidantes. Together, they worked tirelessly to promote reforms, strengthen the empire's economy, and expand its borders.
