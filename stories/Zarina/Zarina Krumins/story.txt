As the critics left, Zarina felt a sense of satisfaction wash over her. She knew that she had proven herself as a talented baker and entrepreneur, and that her business was in good hands. And as she locked up the bakery at the end of the day, she couldn't help but smile - after all, it had been a truly sweet day.

Zarina Krumins went home that evening feeling like the luckiest person alive, knowing that she had found her true calling and was living her dream in the small town of Willow Creek.
