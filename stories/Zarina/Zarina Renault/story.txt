Zarina Renault stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of her family. It had been months since she'd received a letter from them, and she was starting to lose hope. Her parents had always been a bit distant, but this felt different. This felt like they were trying to escape.

As she made her way through the crowded platform, Zarina's mind wandered back to the argument that had led to this moment. She'd tried to be patient, to give them space, but it seemed like no matter what she did, they just kept pushing her away.

She spotted a familiar figure waiting for her by the exit - her friend and confidant, Kaelin. They'd been inseparable since childhood, and Zarina felt a surge of gratitude as he wrapped her in a tight hug. "Hey, Zee," he said, using the nickname she'd given him all those years ago. "I'm so glad you made it."

Zarina pulled back and smiled weakly. "Me too," she said, trying to sound more confident than she felt. Kaelin knew better than to push her for details - they'd talked about this before, and Zarina wasn't ready to relive the pain.

As they walked through the station, Kaelin filled her in on what had been happening back home. Her parents were involved in some kind of trouble, something to do with a business deal that had gone sour. The local authorities were looking into it, but so far, nothing was being said about Zarina's family.

Zarina felt a mix of emotions - guilt, anger, and a dash of excitement. Maybe this was exactly what she needed - an opportunity to escape the past and start anew. She took a deep breath, feeling a sense of determination wash over her. Whatever lay ahead, she was ready to face it head-on.

For the first time in months, Zarina felt a glimmer of hope that things might actually be okay. As they walked out into the bright sunlight, Kaelin by her side, she smiled up at him and said, "You know, I think we're going to be just fine."
