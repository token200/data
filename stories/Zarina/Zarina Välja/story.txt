Zarina Välja stood at the edge of the frozen lake, her eyes fixed on the vast expanse of white stretching out before her. She had always found solace in this place, where the world seemed to slow down and the only sound was the soft crunch of snow beneath her feet.

As a child, Zarina had spent countless hours playing here with her siblings, making snowmen and having snowball fights that would last long into the night. But as she grew older, the winters began to change. The cold didn't bite as sharply, and the ice began to melt earlier than it used to.

Now, at 30 years old, Zarina found herself a stranger in her own backyard. She had tried to adapt, but nothing seemed to fill the void left by the loss of her winter wonderland. She had moved away, tried new hobbies, but nothing seemed to bring her the same sense of peace that she had always found on this frozen lake.

As she stood there, lost in thought, a figure emerged from the trees. It was an old man, his face creased with age and experience. He nodded at Zarina as he approached, and she felt a sense of familiarity wash over her.

"You're back," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "I knew you'd return to this place eventually."

Zarina nodded, feeling a lump form in her throat. "How did you know?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

The old man smiled, his eyes twinkling with knowledge. "This lake has a way of calling to those who have lost their way," he said. "It's a place of solace, where the world slows down and the past comes back to visit."

Zarina felt a weight lift off her shoulders as she listened to the old man's words. Maybe, just maybe, this frozen lake was exactly what she needed to find her way again. She took a deep breath, feeling the cold air fill her lungs, and nodded.

"Thank you," she said, smiling at the old man. "I'm back now."

The old man smiled back, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "I knew it was only a matter of time," he said. And with that, Zarina Välja began her journey to rediscover herself, one snowflake at a time.
