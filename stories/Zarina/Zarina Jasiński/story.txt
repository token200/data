Zarina Jasiński was a young and talented painter who had always been fascinated by the intersection of art and technology. Growing up in a small town in Poland, she spent most of her childhood experimenting with different mediums and techniques, often using old electronics and machinery as canvases for her creativity.

As Zarina Jasiński grew older, her passion for combining art and technology only intensified. She went on to study fine arts in Warsaw, where she honed her skills and developed a unique style that blended traditional painting methods with digital manipulation.
