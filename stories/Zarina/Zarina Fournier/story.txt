Zarina Fournier stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. The sun was setting over the nearby hills, casting a warm orange glow over the deserted streets. Zarina, or Zee as she preferred to be called, had always been drawn to this place – the quaint town where her mother grew up.

As a child, Zarina had spent countless summers here, exploring the winding streets and playing in the fields of golden wheat that seemed to stretch on forever. Her mother, Colette Fournier, would take her on long walks through the countryside, pointing out the different wildflowers and teaching her about the ancient history of the town.

Years went by, and Zarina grew up to be a skilled botanist in her own right, traveling the world to study the rarest plants. But despite her success, she had never quite left this place behind. The memories of her childhood here still lingered, and whenever she returned, she felt a sense of peace that eluded her elsewhere.

As she made her way through the town, Zarina noticed something was off. The streets were empty, and the windows of the old shops seemed to stare out like vacant eyes. She stopped in front of the local bakery, where Colette used to buy her treats every summer. The sign above the door creaked in the breeze, reading "Boulangerie Fournier" – a name that brought back memories of laughter and warmth.

Zarina pushed open the door, and was enveloped by the scent of fresh bread and pastries. She smiled, feeling a sense of belonging that she hadn't experienced in years. The baker, a kind-eyed woman named Sophie, looked up from her work and smiled. "Ah, Zarina Fournier! It's been too long. We've missed you around here."

Zee smiled back, feeling like she had finally come home. For a moment, the world outside receded, and all that mattered was this small town, and the memories it held for her – memories of Colette, and summers spent exploring its winding streets.
