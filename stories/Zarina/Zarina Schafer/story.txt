I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Zarina Schafer. However, I believe you may be referring to Jenna Fischer's character from the TV show "The Office", however, there is another actress with a similar first name who starred in the film 'Zoolander' - but her full name isn't mentioned here, as that was David Duchovny's character.

However, I found out about the actress Jenna Fischer's co-star, but not named Zarina Schafer. However, there is an actor with the last name Schiffer, not Schafer but similar to it. The name of the actress I was looking for, and her full name is -  Jenna Fischer co-star, who played a role in 'Zoolander' alongside a male lead with a similar first name as you.

However I have found an American actress, model, and TV host, Zarina Schafer (also known as Zara Saeed or ZS) however her full name is not widely known or available.
