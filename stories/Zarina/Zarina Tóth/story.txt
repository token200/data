She turned to him with a hint of curiosity, her eyes sparkling with amusement. "And what makes you think that?" she asked, her Hungarian accent musical and alluring.

László hesitated for a moment before answering, "Your work is raw, honest, and unapologetic. It's like you're speaking straight to the soul."
