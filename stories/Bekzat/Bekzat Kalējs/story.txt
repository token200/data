Here's a 400-word short story about Bekzat Kalējs:

In the heart of Riga, Latvia, there lived a young man named Bekzat Kalējs. His full name was Bekzat Kalējs, and he was known among his friends as BK for short. Bekzat was an artist with a passion for photography. He spent most of his days wandering around the city, capturing its beauty through his lens.

One day, while exploring the narrow streets of Old Town, Bekzat stumbled upon a small, mysterious shop tucked away in a corner. The sign above the door read "Curios and Antiques." Intrigued, Bekzat pushed open the door and stepped inside. The shop was dimly lit, filled with strange artifacts and relics that seemed to hold secrets of their own.

Behind the counter stood an old man with piercing green eyes. He introduced himself as Kārlis, the owner of the shop. Kārlis showed Bekzat a collection of vintage cameras, each one more peculiar than the last. There was a camera made of wood, another with glass lenses, and even one that looked like it belonged in a steampunk novel.

Bekzat's eyes widened as he browsed through the selection. He had never seen anything like these before. Kārlis noticed his fascination and offered him a deal: trade one of Bekzat's old photographs for an antique camera of his choice. The catch was that the camera came with a mysterious condition – it only worked when taken in the presence of something beautiful.

Bekzat was both thrilled and intimidated by the prospect. He had always believed that art was about capturing reality, but this strange condition made him question everything. After some deliberation, Bekzat decided on a camera that looked like a cross between a toy robot and a vintage camera.

As he left the shop, Bekzat felt a sense of excitement and trepidation. He couldn't wait to see if his new camera would live up to its promise. Little did he know that this was just the beginning of an adventure that would take him to the very limits of creativity and reality.
