I couldn't find any information on Bekzat Lafourcade. Can you provide more context or details about this character? 

If you meant Bekzat Lagafourcade, I assume you're referring to Bekzat Lagafourcade, a fictional character from the book "The First Law" trilogy by Joe Abercrombie.

Here's a story based on Bekzat Lafourcade:

Bekzat Lafourcade was known for his exceptional marksmanship. As a young man, he had served in the armies of the North, fighting against the invading forces that threatened to destroy their lands. After the war, Bekzat decided to retire from combat and open his own shooting gallery.

The sign above the door read "Lafourcade's Bullets," and the crowd that gathered every day was filled with all sorts of patrons - gamblers, soldiers, and even the occasional noble. Bekzat took great pride in his work, selecting only the finest ammunition for each customer.

One afternoon, a young man dressed in fine clothes walked into the gallery. He looked out of place among the rough-and-tumble crowd, but Bekzat noticed that he seemed different - not from around here, that was for sure. The young man asked to shoot at the targets, and Bekzat presented him with his best gun.

As the young man fired shot after shot, Bekzat watched with interest. He had seen many skilled marksmen come through his gallery, but there was something about this one that caught his attention. Maybe it was the way he moved with precision, or the way he focused on each target before taking aim.

Bekzat offered the young man a deal - for every five rounds he hit, Bekzat would give him an extra bullet free of charge. The young man accepted, and the two spent hours in the gallery, shooting at targets and engaging in conversation. As the sun began to set, the young man left with a smile on his face, telling Bekzat that he had found a new purpose in life - to protect people like him.

From that day forward, Bekzat's Bullets became more than just a shooting gallery; it was a beacon of hope for those who needed protection. And Bekzat Lafourcade was the guardian, watching over his patrons with a keen eye and a steady hand.
