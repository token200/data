I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Bekzat Zawisza. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created after my knowledge cutoff date.

However, I can create a story based on your request. Here's a 400-word short story about Bekzat Zawisza:

Bekzat Zawisza was a young Kazakhstani archer who lived in the rolling steppes of Central Asia during the 13th century. Born into a family of nomadic herders, Bekzat had grown up surrounded by the vast expanse of the steppes and the sound of horses' hooves on the dusty ground.

Bekzat's love affair with archery began when he was just a boy, watching his father expertly string his bow and shoot down rabbits for dinner. From that moment on, Bekzat spent every spare moment practicing his aim and perfecting his technique. He became known among his tribe as the most skilled young archer in the region.

One fateful day, Bekzat's village was threatened by a rival tribe led by a ruthless warlord named Temir. The rival tribe had been raiding villages along the steppes for months, leaving destruction and death in their wake. Bekzat's father, the village elder, called upon Bekzat to lead the defense of their village.

Bekzat accepted the challenge, armed with his trusty bow and quiver full of arrows. He rode out with a small group of warriors, ready to face whatever lay ahead. As they approached the rival tribe's camp, Bekzat could see that Temir's men were far more numerous than their own.

Undaunted, Bekzat drew his bow and began firing arrow after arrow at the enemy lines. His accuracy was uncanny, striking down warrior after warrior with deadly precision. The rival tribe's men were taken aback by Bekzat's skill, but they refused to yield.

Just when it seemed that all hope was lost, Bekzat spotted Temir himself charging towards their position on horseback. With a deep breath, Bekzat took aim and fired his final arrow straight at the warlord's heart. It struck true, sending Temir crashing to the ground.

The rival tribe fled in disarray, and Bekzat's village was saved. From that day forward, Bekzat Zawisza was hailed as a hero by his people, and his name became synonymous with bravery and skill on the steppes of Central Asia.
