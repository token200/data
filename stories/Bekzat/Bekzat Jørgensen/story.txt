Bekzat Jørgensen sat alone in his small apartment, staring blankly at the wall as he struggled to come to terms with the latest blow to his already fragile mental health. A recent diagnosis of anxiety had left him feeling lost and disconnected from the world around him.

As a former professional cage fighter, Bekzat had always defined himself by his prowess in the ring. He had been a rising star in the underground fighting circuit, known for his lightning-quick reflexes and devastating punching power. But after a particularly brutal defeat, Bekzat had announced his retirement from the sport, citing burnout and a desire to focus on his mental well-being.

Now, as he sat amidst the dusty remnants of his former life, Bekzat couldn't help but wonder if he had made a mistake. Had he traded one hell for another? The anxiety that had been building in the background had finally burst forth, threatening to consume him whole.

Bekzat's mind wandered back to his childhood, growing up in a small village on the outskirts of Copenhagen. His parents had always encouraged his love of sports, and Bekzat had quickly proven himself to be a prodigy on the wrestling mat. But it was the cage fighting that truly set him apart – the rush of adrenaline, the sense of power and control that came with being behind the mask.

As he drifted in and out of consciousness, Bekzat's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of his phone buzzing on the coffee table. He groaned, knowing that it would probably be a text from his ex-manager, begging him to come back to the sport. But Bekzat knew better. He wasn't ready to face the demons he had been running from for so long.

With a heavy sigh, Bekzat slowly picked up the phone and began to type out a response. "Sorry, mate," he typed. "I'm good. I need to focus on myself right now." The words felt hollow even as he hit send, but Bekzat knew it was the only way to take care of himself. For once, he put his own needs above those of others, and that small act of self-care gave him the strength to carry on.
