In the quaint town of Tartu, Estonia, lived Bekzat Põld, a young and ambitious artist with a passion for traditional Estonian folk music. Bekzat Põld spent most of their days exploring the town's charming streets, taking in the sights and sounds of the local culture.

Bekzat Põld was particularly fascinated by the region's rich history and mythology, often finding inspiration in the ancient stories and legends that had been passed down through generations.
