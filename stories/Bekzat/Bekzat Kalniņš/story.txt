I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Bekzat Kalniņš. It's possible that this person is not well-known or does not exist in popular culture.

However, I can create a story about a character with the name Bekzat Kalniņš for you. Here it is:

Bekzat Kalniņš was a mysterious figure who roamed the streets of Riga, Latvia. Few people knew much about him, but those who did spoke of his incredible skills as a pickpocket and thief. With eyes that seemed to see right through you, Bekzat could snatch your wallet or pocket without ever touching you.

One evening, as the sun set over the Daugavpils River, Bekzat Kalniņš found himself face to face with a young woman named Līga. She had been robbed just minutes before by an identical doppelganger of Bekzat, and was determined to catch him in the act.

Bekzat, sensing that Līga was onto him, quickened his pace, weaving through the crowds of tourists on Brīvības bulvāris. But Līga was no ordinary pedestrian; she had been following Bekzat for weeks, studying his every move and anticipating his next step.

As they darted in and out of cafes and shops, their footsteps echoed off the buildings. It seemed that neither of them could gain the upper hand, each trying to outmaneuver the other. But as the chase continued, a new player entered the scene: a gruff but fair-minded bouncer named Kārlis, who had been watching Bekzat from afar.

Kārlis intervened just in time, pinning Bekzat against the wall and ordering him to stop his thieving ways once and for all. As the crowd gathered around, Bekzat Kalniņš looked up at Līga with a mixture of admiration and respect, finally acknowledged by someone who saw beyond his tricks.

For the first time in months, Bekzat felt like he had met his match – and it wasn't just because of Kārlis' brawn.
