Callum Alsbach stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar smell of saltwater and seaweed filling his lungs. He had been away for months, working in a small café in the city, but now he was back home on the coast where his family's beachside cottage awaited.

As he walked towards the cottage, the sound of seagulls filled the air and Callum couldn't help but smile. This was his happy place – where the only worry was what tide was coming in next and whether the fish were biting for the day's catch. His full name was an afterthought to most people; they called him Cal for short, or just 'the lad' if they needed to remind themselves who he was.

Callum pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside, calling out into the empty room for his mother to come and greet him as usual. She poked her head around the corner of the sofa, a warm smile spreading across her face as she took in Callum's tired but happy eyes. 'Welcome home, Callum Alsbach,' she said, using his full name with affection.

After a long summer spent working for his uncle's café, Callum had been itching to get back to the sea and his own little cottage by the coast. He set about unpacking the few belongings he'd brought with him and began planning out his days – fishing trips, beachcombing excursions, perhaps even a trip into town to visit the old lighthouse.

As the sun began to set over the water, Callum sat down on the porch steps to watch it fade, feeling the cool breeze wash away any tension or worry he might have been carrying with him. He was home now and everything felt right again. The sound of his mother's laughter drifted from inside the cottage, mingling with the gulls' cries as Callum let out a deep sigh of contentment.

In that moment, being Cal, or just the lad on the beachside, seemed like the best version of himself – carefree and at peace with the world. The tide may be coming in soon enough, but for now, it was just Callum Alsbach, sitting on his porch steps, feeling very much alive.
