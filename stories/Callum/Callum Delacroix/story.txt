Callum Delacroix stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the bustling streets of New Orleans. The city was alive with music and laughter, but Callum's eyes were fixed on the small café across the street. He knew she would be there, waiting for him.

As a private investigator, Callum had seen his fair share of shady characters, but he never expected to stumble upon one that would leave him breathless. Her name was Colette, and she was as mysterious as she was beautiful. Callum Delacroix had been hired by her wealthy father to find out what had happened to his daughter.

Callum pushed open the door and slid onto a stool at the bar. The bartender, a gruff but kind-hearted man named Jacques, raised an eyebrow as Callum ordered a whiskey on the rocks. "You're here for Colette, I presume?" he asked, knowing exactly who Callum was looking for.

Callum nodded, his eyes scanning the room until they landed on her. She sat at a table in the corner, sipping a cup of coffee and watching him with an intensity that made his skin prickle. When their eyes met, she smiled, and Callum felt his heart stumble.

"Callum Delacroix," he said, standing up to approach her. "I'm afraid I've got some bad news."

Colette's smile faltered, but she didn't look away. "Tell me," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

As Callum sat down across from her, he explained what his investigation had revealed. Colette listened intently, her expression unreadable. When he finished, she took a deep breath and reached out to touch his hand.

"It's okay," she said. "I knew it was only a matter of time before you found me."

Callum felt a jolt of surprise at the admission, but as he looked into Colette's eyes, he saw something there that made him believe her. It was a spark of hope, a glimmer of light in the darkness.

For the first time since she disappeared, Callum felt like he had finally found what he was looking for – not just answers, but a reason to keep going. And as he leaned in to kiss Colette's lips, he knew that their journey together was only just beginning.
