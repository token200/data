Callum Mendes walked into the dimly lit coffee shop, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. He spotted her sitting in the corner, sipping on a latte and lost in thought. It was Emma, an old friend from school, who had been a constant presence in Callum's life since childhood.

As he approached her table, Emma looked up and smiled, her bright blue eyes sparkling with warmth. "Callum Mendes, it's been ages!" she exclaimed, extending her hand for a handshake.

Callum grinned, taking a seat across from her. "Emma, long time no see! What brings you here?"

They chatted for a bit, catching up on each other's lives. Callum learned that Emma had just moved to the city for work and was enjoying the new energy of the place. He shared stories of his own adventures in music, having just finished touring with his band.

As they sipped their drinks, the conversation flowed effortlessly, like no time had passed at all. It was as if Callum Mendes and Emma were still those wide-eyed kids, sitting on a bench watching the sunset after school. The memories came flooding back â€“ laughter-filled sleepovers, silly jokes, and impromptu road trips.

As they talked, the world outside seemed to melt away, leaving only the two of them, suspended in a bubble of friendship and shared experiences. Emma asked about Callum Mendes's music, and he launched into stories of songwriting sessions, recording studios, and sweaty concert nights.

Their conversation meandered through topics and emotions, touching on everything from family drama to personal growth. It was as if they were speaking directly to each other's souls. The hours slipped by unnoticed, the coffee cups refilled, and the room grew quieter, as if the very air had been charged with their connection.

As Callum Mendes finished his drink, Emma reached across the table and took his hand. "It's so good to have you back in my life," she said softly. "You're just like you were all those years ago."
