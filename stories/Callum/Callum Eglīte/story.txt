Callum Eglīte was no stranger to the darker corners of Edinburgh's Old Town. As a historian and amateur sleuth, he had spent countless nights wandering these narrow alleys, uncovering secrets that lay hidden beneath the city's cobblestone streets.

A tall, lean figure with piercing green eyes, Callum Eglīte had an uncanny ability to sense when something was amiss. His friends often joked that he could smell a rat from a mile away – and they were usually right.

Tonight was no exception. As he turned a corner onto the Royal Mile, Callum Eglīte noticed a faint scent of smoke wafting through the air. He quickened his pace, his eyes scanning the crowded streets for any sign of trouble.

Suddenly, a small fire erupted from the doorway of a nearby pub, sending patrons scrambling to escape. Without hesitation, Callum Eglīte sprinted towards the inferno, his long coat billowing behind him like a dark wing.

As he entered the pub, he was met with a scene of chaos and destruction. Pots and pans were shattered on the floor, and the once-sturdy wooden beams now hung precariously from the ceiling. But it was what lay amidst the ruins that caught Callum Eglīte's attention: a small, leather-bound book, partially burned but still intact.

With trembling hands, he picked up the book and examined its cover. The title – "The Whispering Walls" – was etched in elegant script, sending a shiver down his spine. This was no ordinary pub fire; this was a deliberate act of vandalism, designed to conceal something sinister.

As Callum Eglīte delved deeper into the mystery, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He glanced around the pub, but saw only frightened faces and worried glances. Yet, one figure seemed out of place – a hooded figure lurking in the shadows, their eyes fixed intently on Callum Eglīte.

The historian's instincts told him to trust his gut; tonight was going to be an evening he would never forget. With the fire extinguished and the pub returning to its former bustle, Callum Eglīte tucked the mysterious book into his coat pocket, ready to unravel the tangled threads of "The Whispering Walls" and uncover the secrets that lay hidden within Edinburgh's ancient stones.
