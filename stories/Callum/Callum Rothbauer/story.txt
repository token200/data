Callum Rothbauer stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station. It was a scene he'd grown familiar with during his countless visits to this sleepy town in the Scottish Highlands. The air was crisp, carrying the scent of peat and earthy undertones.

He hailed a taxi, one that looked like it had seen its fair share of adventures, before driving up the winding road that led to Rothbauer's family estate. The manor house loomed above him, a relic of times past with grandeur etched into every stone façade. He'd inherited the land from his estranged father, a decision Callum still grappled with.

Upon arrival, he was greeted by Agnes, his stern but loving grandmother. She ushered him into the manor's opulent sitting room where an old photograph lay on the sideboard. It depicted Callum and his late mother as children, standing before the very same estate.

'How's the painting coming along?' she inquired, referring to the canvas of landscapes Callum had been working on since he left university. 'Any progress?'

'This time of year can be challenging,' he replied, running a hand through his unruly brown hair. 'I'll get it done.'

Agnes nodded and handed him a cup of freshly brewed tea. The two sat in silence for a while as the rain drummed against the windows, gradually breaking the spell that had settled over them both.

That evening, Callum retreated to the study to begin his research into the estate's history. He delved deep into dusty archives, pouring over ancient documents that spoke of wars fought and lands won. There was no mention of a Rothbauer ancestor being part of any significant events. The silence began to bother him as he sifted through pages upon pages of nothing.

In frustration, Callum hurled the papers onto his desk and got up from his chair. He moved towards the window where, for the first time that day, the rain showed a sign of letting up – the sky gradually clearing to reveal a sliver of moonlight peeking through between the clouds.
