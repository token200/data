Callum D'Annunzio stepped onto the bustling streets of Rome, the Eternal City's ancient energy pulsing through his veins like the Trevi Fountain's famous waters. A British photographer, Callum D'Annunzio had always been drawn to the rich history and vibrant culture of Italy, and he spent most of his time capturing its beauty through his lens.

Suddenly, a young woman with a paint-splattered smock appeared beside him, a look of curiosity on her face. "You're the one taking pictures of our work?" she asked, eyeing Callum D'Annunzio's camera. He nodded, and she introduced herself as Alessia. As they chatted, Callum D'Annunzio learned that Alessia was not only a talented artist but also a passionate advocate for Rome's street art scene.
