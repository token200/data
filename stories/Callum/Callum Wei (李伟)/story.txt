Callum Wei (李伟) was a 25-year-old freelance photographer with a passion for capturing the beauty of everyday life. Born and raised in Vancouver, Canada, to Taiwanese parents, Callum's eyes had grown accustomed to the vibrant colors of his heritage. His full name, Lee Wei, carried the weight of his family's history and cultural traditions.

Callum's love affair with photography began when he was a teenager, experimenting with old cameras and developing film in his makeshift darkroom. As he honed his craft, he developed an uncanny eye for detail and composition. He spent hours wandering the streets, capturing the textures, patterns, and stories of the city.

One fateful day, Callum received a call from his aunt, who had recently returned to Taiwan after years in the United States. She was getting married, and she asked Callum to capture her special day. Excited by the opportunity, Callum booked a ticket to Taiwan and immersed himself in the country's rich culture.

The day of the wedding arrived, and Callum set up his camera near the ancient temple where the ceremony would take place. As the sun dipped into the horizon, casting a warm glow over the gathering, Callum snapped away, freezing moments in time. The laughter, tears, and joy that filled the air became his subjects, and he rendered them with precision and emotion.

The wedding party was delighted with Callum's work, and word of his talent spread quickly through the community. Soon, he received commissions from other families and events, solidifying his reputation as a skilled photographer. As Callum's business flourished, he found himself balancing his creative pursuits with the demands of running a freelance studio.

Years later, when asked about his most memorable shoot, Callum would smile wistfully and recall that fateful day in Taiwan, where his full name, Lee Wei, had become synonymous with artistry and storytelling.
