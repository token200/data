Callum Saldaña stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the city skyline. The sun had just set, casting a warm orange glow over the towering skyscrapers and bustling streets below. He took a deep breath, feeling the cool breeze fill his lungs as he surveyed the world from this newfound height.

As a freelance journalist, Callum was always on the lookout for the next big story. He had a knack for sniffing out hidden truths and unearthing secrets that others didn't dare to touch. But tonight, he wasn't working. Tonight, he was escaping.

Callum's thoughts drifted back to his latest assignment – investigating a string of mysterious occurrences at an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. Rumors had been circulating about strange noises, flickering lights, and disembodied voices emanating from within its crumbling walls. Some claimed it was haunted by the ghosts of former factory workers, while others believed it was a hotbed for paranormal activity.

Callum's curiosity was piqued. He had a feeling that there was more to this story than met the eye. As he pondered his next move, a faint hum began to vibrate through the air, growing louder by the second. The lights on the rooftop flickered and dimmed, casting eerie shadows across the walls.

Suddenly, a low-pitched whisper seemed to caress Callum's ear – "Get out while you still can." He spun around, but there was no one in sight. His skin prickled with gooseflesh as he realized that the voice wasn't coming from any direction at all – it was coming from inside his own head.

Callum's grip on his notebook tightened as he felt a shiver run down his spine. Was this really just his imagination playing tricks on him? Or was there something more sinister lurking in the shadows?

Without hesitation, Callum turned and sprinted back towards the stairwell, eager to get back to the safety of his flat below. As he descended into the darkness, he couldn't shake the feeling that he had narrowly escaped something – or someone.

As he reached the ground floor, he fumbled for his phone to text a cryptic message to his editor: "Abandoned warehouse? Forget it. Never going back." But as he hit send, a chill ran down his spine once more – this time, from within.
