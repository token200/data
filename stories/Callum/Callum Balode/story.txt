Callum Balode stepped out into the cold winter air, his eyes scanning the dimly lit streets of Riga. The snow crunched beneath his boots as he made his way to the small café on the outskirts of town. It was a place he'd grown accustomed to in recent months, where the owner, Milda, would save him a warm cup of coffee and listen to his tales.

As he pushed open the door, a bell above it rang out, and Milda looked up from her book, a hint of a smile on her face. "Ah, Callum, you're here," she said, waving him over.

Callum slid into the worn chair opposite Milda, and she handed him a steaming mug of coffee. He took a sip, feeling the warmth spread through his chest as he settled in for the long night ahead.

The tales of Riga's underworld often found their way to Callum's ears, whispers of powerful figures and hidden agendas that only he seemed to be privy to. It was a weight he carried with ease, one that came from years of walking these streets and knowing where the shadows lurked.

But tonight was different. Tonight, Callum had received a message, one that hinted at something bigger than his usual dealings. He took another sip of his coffee, letting the flavors wash over him as he considered the implications.

As he sat there, lost in thought, Milda began to speak, her voice barely above a whisper. "I heard rumors, Callum, about something happening tonight. Something big." She glanced around the café nervously before leaning in closer.

Callum's eyes narrowed, his grip on his coffee cup tightening. "What is it?"

Milda's voice dropped even lower, and he could see her face illuminated by the faint moonlight filtering through the grimy windows. "They're talking about a ritual, Callum. One that'll change everything."

The air seemed to vibrate with an unseen energy as Milda spoke, and for a moment, it was as if the very fabric of Riga's underworld hung in the balance. Callum knew then that tonight would be different, that he had a role to play in something far greater than himself.

He finished his coffee, set the mug down, and rose from his seat, his eyes locked on the darkness beyond the café's door. It was time to step out into the unknown, and face whatever lay ahead with the strength of those who walked the shadows.
