Callum Hughes stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. It had been five years since he'd left the small town of Willow Creek, chasing after a dreams that seemed to mock him with every step. But now, as he stood on the edge of something new, he felt a sense of restlessness wash over him.

He took a deep breath, feeling the familiar ache in his chest as the cool night air filled his lungs. His parents had passed away when he was just 16, leaving him to fend for himself and pursue his passion for photography. It wasn't easy, but Callum had always been driven by a need to capture the beauty in the world.

As he made his way through the quiet streets of Willow Creek's sister town, Ashwood, Callum felt a sense of nostalgia creeping over him. He'd left this place with a suitcase full of memories and a heart full of hope. The townspeople had whispered about his departure, speculating about the reasons behind it – was he running from something or chasing after someone? But Callum knew that the truth lay somewhere in between.

He stopped in front of the old diner where he'd spent countless nights pouring over his cameras and scribbling notes in his notebook. The sign creaked in the breeze, beckoning him to come inside. As he pushed open the door, the bell above it jangled out a welcome melody.

Inside, the diner was warm and familiar, like stepping back into time itself. The owner, Midge, looked up from behind the counter and smiled at Callum with her signature warmth. "Hey, boy! Long time no see!"

Callum slid onto a stool, feeling the soft vinyl beneath him. He unwrapped his scarf and let out a deep sigh as he began to scan the room, taking in every detail – the dusty decorations, the faded photographs on the walls.

For a moment, the past seemed to fade away, replaced by a sense of possibility that only grew stronger with each passing day. Callum's eyes locked onto Midge, and she raised an eyebrow in understanding. She knew better than to push for details when he was feeling restless.

"I'm here for the photo exhibition," Callum said finally, his voice barely above a whisper.

Midge nodded, her smile widening. "We've been expecting you, Callum."
