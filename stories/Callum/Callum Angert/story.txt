Callum Angert sat alone in his small, cluttered apartment, staring blankly at the wall as the rain poured down outside. He was lost, just like he had been for what felt like an eternity. His mind was a jumbled mess of emotions and thoughts, making it impossible to focus on anything.

Just as he was starting to drift off into a fitful sleep, his phone buzzed with an incoming text from his best friend, Alex. "Hey, Callum Angert, I'm coming over," the message read. "We need to talk."

Callum groaned inwardly, not wanting to face whatever was on Alex's mind. He had been avoiding him for weeks, ever since he'd gotten into a fight with his girlfriend and decided it would be best to take some time for himself.

As he waited for Alex to arrive, Callum couldn't help but think about how far his life had taken a turn. From the bright-eyed optimist he once was to the jaded, restless person he now felt like, it was hard to remember what happiness even looked like.

The door opened and Alex walked in, holding a cup of steaming hot coffee. "Hey, buddy," he said, plopping down beside Callum on the couch. "I know I shouldn't be here, but I need your help."

Callum raised an eyebrow, taking the coffee from Alex without a word. He knew that look - his friend was in trouble.

As they sipped their coffee and talked through the night, Callum began to see things in a new light. Maybe getting lost wasn't the end of the world; maybe it was just the beginning. With Alex by his side, he felt like he could face anything.

"Thanks, man," Callum said finally, feeling a weight lift off his shoulders. "I needed that."

Alex smiled and clapped him on the back. "Anytime, Callum Angert. We're in this together now."
