Endo Bernard was a man shrouded in mystery. His past was a blank slate, with no known family or friends to speak of. He had shown up one day at the local diner, ordering a cup of coffee and sitting alone at the counter. No one knew where he came from or what brought him there.

As the days turned into weeks, Endo became a regular at the diner. The owner, Sarah, grew fond of him, always saving him his favorite booth by the window. She'd often catch him staring out at the rain-soaked streets, lost in thought.

One rainy evening, as Endo sipped his coffee, he noticed a young woman walking down the street outside. Her eyes were red-rimmed, and her footsteps quickened with each step. He watched as she ducked into the diner, shaking the rain from her coat.

Sarah greeted her warmly, offering her a cup of tea. The young woman introduced herself as Lily, who had just moved to town from out of state. Endo listened intently as Lily shared her struggles adjusting to a new life in an unfamiliar place.

Something about Lily's words struck a chord within Endo. He couldn't quite explain it, but he felt an inexplicable connection to this stranger. As the night wore on, they discovered common ground – a love of old books and a passion for jazz music.

As the rain continued to fall outside, Endo and Lily talked long into the night. They laughed together, sharing stories of their pasts, or rather, their lack thereof. With each passing minute, their connection grew stronger.

Sarah looked on with interest, sensing that something special was brewing between these two strangers. She smiled knowingly, aware that sometimes the most unlikely of friendships could bloom from the simplest of encounters.

As the night drew to a close, Endo walked Lily home under the rainy sky. They stood outside her apartment building, reluctant to part ways. The silence between them was filled with an unspoken understanding – they had found something in each other, and it felt like coming home.

From that day forward, Endo and Lily became inseparable. They explored the town together, attending concerts and visiting bookstores. Their friendship deepened, as did their trust in one another.

Endo's enigmatic past remained a mystery to all but Lily, who had unwittingly become his closest confidant. As they sat together on rainy evenings, Endo would smile softly, feeling for the first time in years that he wasn't alone.
