Iris Yi-hsien sat on the worn wooden floor of her small apartment, surrounded by scattered papers and half-empty tea cups. As a freelance journalist in Taipei, she had grown accustomed to the quiet solitude that came with writing for herself.

The soft glow of the evening sun streaming through the window cast an otherworldly light on the room, illuminating the faint scar above Iris's left eyebrow – a souvenir from her latest investigation into a high-profile corruption scandal. She rubbed the fatigue from her eyes, wondering how she had become so good at sniffing out secrets.

Iris's mind wandered back to her childhood in Hong Kong, where her father, a successful businessman, would regale her with tales of his travels and adventures. His stories sparked an insatiable curiosity in Iris, driving her to pursue a career in journalism. However, as she grew older, her desire for the truth became increasingly entwined with her sense of justice.

One particular case, involving a corrupt government official who had embezzled millions from the city's infrastructure fund, had left a lasting impression on Iris. Her exposé, published in an alternative newspaper, had sparked widespread outrage and led to the official's resignation.

As she sipped her cold tea, Iris's thoughts turned to her next story – a mysterious whistleblower who had approached her with allegations of environmental pollution in Taipei's industrial zones. Intrigued by the potential for corruption and human rights abuses, Iris made a mental note to start digging deeper.

The doorbell interrupted her reverie, signaling the arrival of her friend, Kaito Chen. A fellow journalist and editor at an independent online magazine, Kaito had arrived bearing a box of freshly baked dim sum.

Over steamed buns and jasmine tea, Kaito filled Iris in on the latest developments from the whistleblower's claims. The information was tantalizing – hints of government cover-ups, corporate complicity, and the silent suffering of affected communities. Together, they began to outline a plan for her next exposé.

As the night wore on, Iris's determination grew. She knew that she had stumbled upon something significant, something that could shake the foundations of Taipei's power structures. With Kaito by her side, she vowed to keep pushing forward, no matter how dark or treacherous the journey might become.

In this small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by the detritus of a busy life, Iris Yi-hsien felt at home – a place where stories unfolded like lotus petals in a quiet, moonlit pond.
