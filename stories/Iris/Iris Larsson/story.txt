Iris Larsson stepped into the dimly lit coffee shop, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him in the corner, nursing a cup of black coffee and staring intently at his laptop screen. It had been months since she'd last seen Finn, her old friend and confidant.

As she approached him, he looked up, their eyes locking in a warm smile. "Iris," he said, using her full name as if it was a privilege to say it aloud. She slid into the chair across from him, feeling a sense of comfort wash over her.

Finn, whose real name was actually Lucas, but he'd always gone by Finn, asked Iris what brought her to the city. She explained that she'd just received an offer for a job at a prestigious design firm, and she was considering taking it.

"I'm so proud of you, Iris Larsson," Finn said, his voice filled with genuine enthusiasm. "You've worked so hard for this."

Iris smiled, feeling a surge of gratitude towards her friend. She'd always known that Finn had a way of making her feel seen and heard. Over the next hour, they discussed everything from her job prospects to their shared love of indie music.

As they talked, Iris couldn't help but notice the way Finn's eyes crinkled at the corners when he smiled. It was a trait she'd always found endearing about him. She reached out and gently brushed a strand of hair out of his face, feeling a spark of electricity as their skin touched.

"You're still just as quirky and charming as ever, Iris Larsson," Finn said, his voice low and husky. "I'm glad I get to be around you."

As the night wore on, Iris knew that she'd made the right decision in taking this job offer. Not just for her career, but for the chance to spend more time with her dear friend Finn.
