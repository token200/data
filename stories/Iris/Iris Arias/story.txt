Iris Arias stood at the edge of the rooftop, the cityscape stretching out before her like a canvas of steel and stone. She took a deep breath, feeling the cool evening air fill her lungs, and gazed out at the twinkling lights below.

As a photographer, Iris was no stranger to capturing beauty in unexpected places. But tonight, she wasn't here to take pictures – she was on a mission to escape. For weeks, she'd been feeling suffocated by the expectations of those around her: her parents, who wanted her to follow in their footsteps and become a successful lawyer; her friends, who expected her to be more outgoing, more social.

Iris felt like a square peg trying to fit into a round hole. She loved art, not law; she loved the quiet of the night, not the chaos of parties and gatherings. But no one seemed to listen to her, to see the fire that burned within her.

As she gazed out at the city, Iris's mind began to wander back to her latest project – a series of photographs capturing the lives of strangers in urban landscapes. She had always been drawn to the beauty in everyday moments, the way a glance or a gesture could tell a story of its own.

Iris felt a pang of sadness as she thought about her own life – the one she was supposed to be living. But for the first time in months, she felt a spark of defiance ignite within her. She didn't have to follow anyone else's path; she could forge her own way.

Without thinking, Iris turned and walked back into the apartment, grabbing her camera bag and slinging it over her shoulder. She knew what she wanted now – not a life predetermined by others, but one that was hers alone. The city lights blurred together as she rushed out of the building, the sounds of laughter and music growing fainter with each step.

For Iris Arias, the night was just beginning.
