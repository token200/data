Iris Abdi stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the city below. Her dark hair whipped in the wind as she leaned against the railing, her eyes fixed on the twinkling lights of the skyscrapers. She was a woman of few words, but her silence spoke volumes.

As a child, Iris had grown up on the streets, surviving by her wits and cunning. But despite the hardships, she had never lost her determination to succeed. She had worked multiple jobs, studying at night when she could, until finally landing an internship at a prestigious law firm.

Now, as one of the few African-American women making it to the top of the corporate ladder, Iris was a force to be reckoned with. Her sharp mind and quick wit made her a formidable opponent in the cutthroat world of finance.

But Iris's success had come at a cost. She had lost touch with her roots, her family, and her friends from her old neighborhood. They didn't understand how she could leave them behind for the bright lights of the city. And neither did she, often.

As she stood on the rooftop, feeling the chill of the evening air, Iris was haunted by memories of her childhood home. She remembered the smell of fresh bread wafting from the kitchen, the sound of her grandmother's laughter as they played games together, and the feel of her parents' warm hugs after a long day.

Iris knew she had to find a way to reconcile her past and present selves. She couldn't keep running from who she was, but she also couldn't go back to the way things were before. As she looked out over the city, Iris felt a sense of longing for a life that was authentic, but still full of possibilities.

Just then, her phone buzzed with an incoming text. It was from her grandmother, asking when she would be home for dinner. Iris smiled, feeling a pang of guilt for having lost touch. She typed out a response, promising to come visit soon.

As she slipped the phone into her pocket and turned back towards the city, Iris felt a sense of determination wash over her. She was no longer just a woman with a successful career; she was also a daughter, a sister, a friend, and a member of a community that needed love and connection. And for the first time in a long time, she felt like she could finally find her way back home.
