Iris Szymańska was a Polish-German photographer known for her striking portraits and intimate captures of everyday life. Born in 1968 in Katowice, Poland, she grew up surrounded by the beauty of Central European landscapes and the vibrancy of urban culture.

After studying photography in Berlin, Iris began to make a name for herself on the German art scene with her unique approach to portraiture. Her subjects were often ordinary people, going about their daily lives, yet she managed to imbue them with an air of elegance and poise that was both captivating and unsettling.

Iris's own life story was one of struggle and resilience. She had fled Poland during the communist era and settled in West Germany, where she faced numerous challenges as a woman from a minority background. However, it was this experience that informed her photography, imbuing her work with a sense of longing and nostalgia for a lost era.

In 1995, Iris received international recognition when her photographs were featured in the prestigious German art magazine, "Der Spiegel". The exposure catapulted her to fame, and she began to receive commissions from museums, galleries, and private collectors around the world.

As her reputation grew, so did Iris's fascination with the city. She spent years capturing the streets of Berlin, from the bustling Hauptbahnhof to the tranquil gardens of Charlottenburg Palace. Her photographs of the city were not just records of its physical landscape but also explorations of its emotional topography – the way people interacted with one another, the rhythms of daily life.

One of Iris's most iconic series was "Wanderungen", or "Walks". In this series, she set out to explore Berlin's lesser-known corners, capturing the intricate patterns of city streets and alleys. Her photographs were both intimate and expansive, inviting viewers to lose themselves in their labyrinthine paths.

Today, Iris Szymańska is regarded as one of Germany's most influential photographers. Her work continues to be exhibited worldwide, and her books have become collector's items. Despite the accolades, however, she remains committed to exploring the unknown and documenting the lives of ordinary people who rarely get noticed in our busy urban landscapes.

Iris's photographs are a testament to the power of human connection and the beauty that can be found in even the most mundane moments. They remind us that it is in these quiet, everyday encounters that we find meaning, beauty, and transcendence.
