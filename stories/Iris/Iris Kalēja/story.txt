Iris Kalēja blushed, feeling a sense of gratitude towards her friend. She had always struggled to express herself through words, but art had become her voice. As Sofia admired her work, Iris Kalēja felt a sense of validation wash over her.

The exhibition was a huge success, with local critics and collectors praising Iris Kalēja's unique style. Her work was soon being featured in galleries across the country, and she found herself surrounded by people who appreciated her art.
