Iris Jasiński stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar landscape of Krakow's Wawel Station. The smell of old stone and coffee wafted through the air, transporting her back to summers spent exploring the city with her grandmother.

As she made her way through the station, Iris's thoughts turned to the reason for her return. It had been five years since she'd left Krakow, chasing a dream of becoming a writer in New York City. But after a string of rejections and soul-sucking gigs as a freelance editor, Iris found herself back in Poland, trying to rediscover the passion that had driven her to start writing in the first place.

She hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of her small flat on Kazimierz Street. As they drove through the winding streets, Iris gazed out at the city's medieval architecture, feeling a sense of nostalgia wash over her. The old town was quiet today, the only sounds the soft chime of bicycle bells and the murmur of conversation from the cafes.

When she arrived at her flat, Iris was greeted by the familiar sight of her grandmother's old armchair, now occupied by her own worn copy of "The Decameron". She smiled, feeling a sense of comfort in this small space. Her grandmother had always encouraged Iris to write, and it was here, among these ancient walls, that she'd first found her voice.

Iris spent the rest of the day wandering through the old town, taking in the sights and sounds. As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the city, she found herself back at Wawel Castle, standing before the imposing stone façade. It was here that Iris had once declared her love for literature, reciting poetry to anyone who would listen.

As the stars began to twinkle in the night sky, Iris felt a sense of peace settle over her. She knew that she still had a long way to go, but being back in Krakow reminded her of why she'd started writing in the first place – for love of language, and for love of home. With a renewed sense of purpose, Iris opened the notebook that lay beside her armchair and began to write. The words flowed easily, like a river returning to its source.
