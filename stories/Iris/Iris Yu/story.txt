As she honed her craft, Iris began to gain recognition for her unique style, which blended traditional Asian motifs with contemporary themes. Her paintings were exhibited in galleries across the country, and she was soon approached by collectors and museums eager to feature her work.

Despite her success, Iris remained committed to her artistic vision, refusing to compromise on her values or technique. She spent long hours in her studio, experimenting with new techniques and mediums, always pushing herself to innovate and improve.
