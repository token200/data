Iris Kovalchuk stepped out of her small apartment and into the bustling streets of New York City. As she walked to work, she felt the familiar hum of energy that seemed to course through her veins like electricity. It was a sensation she had grown accustomed to over the years, one that had become synonymous with Iris Kovalchuk's very being.

As a freelance journalist, Iris had learned to adapt to the fast-paced world around her. She thrived on deadlines and the thrill of chasing down a lead. Her colleagues often marveled at her ability to sniff out a story from seemingly nowhere. And yet, despite her many talents, Iris couldn't shake the feeling that there was something missing in her life.

It wasn't until she stumbled upon an obscure article about ancient mythology that Iris began to unravel the mystery of her own identity. The more she read, the more she felt a sense of kinship with the mythical creatures and heroes she had always been fascinated by. It was as if she had been searching for something all along, but hadn't quite known it.

Iris Kovalchuk's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her phone buzzing in her pocket. She pulled it out to find a text from an unknown number - "Meet me at the library tonight, 8pm." The message sent a shiver down her spine as she wondered who could be behind such an enigmatic summons.

Despite her trepidation, Iris found herself walking towards the library that night, her heart pounding in anticipation. As she pushed open the door, a figure emerged from the shadows - an elderly woman with piercing green eyes and a knowing smile.

"You're Iris Kovalchuk," the woman said, her voice dripping with familiarity. "I've been waiting for you."
