Iris Durand sat alone in her small, cluttered apartment, staring at the stack of unpaid bills on her kitchen counter. She had been struggling to make ends meet since leaving her job as a freelance writer six months ago. The uncertainty and lack of stability were suffocating her.

As she poured herself a glass of cheap wine, Iris's mind wandered back to her early days as a writer. She had always dreamed of making a name for herself in the literary world, but life had other plans. Her first book had tanked, and since then, she'd been stuck in a rut, taking on small gigs to make ends meet.

The doorbell rang, breaking Iris's reverie. It was her best friend, Léa, who lived across town. Léa burst into the apartment, carrying a large bag of fresh produce and a plate of homemade quiche.

"What's wrong?" Léa asked, noticing Iris's downtrodden expression.

"I just can't seem to catch a break," Iris replied, shaking her head.

Léa plopped down beside her on the couch. "You're talented, Iris. You've got a gift. What's holding you back?"

Iris sighed. "Fear of failure? Fear of success?" She laughed wryly. "Or maybe it's just fear itself."

Léa handed Iris a slice of quiche and a cup of coffee. "Sometimes, we need to face our fears head-on. You know what they say: 'The best way out is always through.'"

Iris took a bite of the quiche, savoring the flaky crust and rich eggs. It was her mother's recipe, one she'd only made a handful of times since moving away.

As they chatted, Léa pulled out her phone and began to scroll through Iris's social media feeds. "Hey, look at this," she said, pointing to an article on Iris's old blog. "It says you're 'one of the most promising young writers in France.'"

Iris blushed, feeling a spark of pride ignite within her. Maybe Léa was right. Maybe it was time to take a leap of faith and go for it.

The two friends spent the rest of the afternoon brainstorming ideas for Iris's next project – a novel that had been simmering on the backburner for months. As they talked, Iris felt her doubts dissipating, replaced by excitement and anticipation.

As Léa prepared to leave, she handed Iris a small gift box. Inside was a silver pen, engraved with Iris's name.

"For when the words won't come," Léa said with a smile.

Iris held the pen up, feeling its weight in her hand. She knew that this was exactly what she needed – a reminder that creativity and courage were within reach, no matter how uncertain the future seemed.
