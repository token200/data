Iris Petrenko was known for her striking features and razor-sharp wit. A brilliant and ambitious young journalist, she had already made a name for herself in the competitive world of investigative reporting.

Her latest assignment was no exception - to uncover the truth behind a string of mysterious disappearances in the small town of Ravenswood.

As she sat at her desk, sipping a lukewarm cup of coffee, Iris Petrenko's mind began to wander back to her childhood. Growing up in a family of modest means had instilled in her a strong sense of determination and resilience.

With her notebook and pen at the ready, Iris Petrenko set out into the fading light, determined to uncover the secrets that Ravenswood had been hiding. The game was on, and she was ready to play.
