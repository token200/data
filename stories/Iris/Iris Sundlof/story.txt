Iris Sundlof stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out at the breathtaking view of the city below. The sun was setting, casting a warm orange glow over the towering skyscrapers and bustling streets. As she took in the sights and sounds, Iris felt a sense of peace wash over her.

It had been a long day, filled with meetings and deadlines to meet. But as she stood there, the stress and anxiety began to melt away. She closed her eyes, letting the cool breeze ruffle her hair, and let out a deep sigh.

Iris Sundlof was known for her sharp mind and quick wit, but sometimes she needed a break from it all. A chance to clear her head and recharge. And that's exactly what this rooftop offered.

As she stood there, lost in thought, Iris noticed a figure approaching her. It was her friend, Lena, who had been trying to get her attention all day. "Hey, Iris, I was starting to think you'd never come up here!" Lena called out, climbing onto the roof beside her.

Iris turned to smile at her friend. "Sorry about that," she said, wincing slightly as her muscles relaxed from holding a pose for so long. "I needed some alone time."

Lena nodded understandingly. "You're welcome to it. I won't interrupt." She sat down next to Iris on the edge of the roof, and the two friends sat in comfortable silence for a moment.

After a while, Lena spoke up. "So, how's work going? Any new projects?"

Iris opened her eyes, which had grown heavy from staring at the city view. She shook her head. "Not yet," she said, smiling wryly. "But I'm sure something will come up soon."

Lena laughed. "You're always right when that happens." The two friends chatted on for a while longer, enjoying each other's company and watching the sun dip below the horizon.

As the stars began to twinkle in the night sky, Iris stood up, stretching her arms over her head. She smiled at Lena, feeling grateful for this moment of peace and connection. "Thanks for understanding," she said, smiling. And with that, the two friends parted ways, each returning to their respective lives with a little bit more joy and calm in their hearts.
