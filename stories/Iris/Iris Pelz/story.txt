Iris Pelz stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, her eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of movement. As a private investigator, she had seen her fair share of dark alleys and seedy characters, but tonight was different.

Rumors had been circulating about a mysterious figure known only as "The Architect" who was rumored to be behind a string of high-profile heists in the city. The police were stumped, and Iris had decided to take on the case herself.

As she made her way deeper into the alleyway, the air grew thick with the smell of smoke and grease. She spotted a figure huddled in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee.

"Mind if I join you?" Iris asked, nodding towards the figure.

The person looked up, startled, and Iris saw a flash of recognition in their eyes. "You must be Pelz," they said, standing up to reveal a petite woman with piercing green eyes.

"Iris Pelz," she replied, extending her hand.

The woman shook it firmly. "Lena Grant. I've been expecting you."

Iris raised an eyebrow. "Expecting me? How do you know who I am?"

Lena smiled. "I know everything about you, Ms. Pelz. Even your favorite coffee shop in the city."

Iris felt a surge of unease. This woman knew too much.

"What do you want?" Iris asked bluntly.

Lena took a seat beside her. "I want to tell you what I know about The Architect. Meet me at the old warehouse on 5th and Main at midnight if you're interested."

With that, Lena turned and disappeared into the night, leaving Iris staring after her in confusion.

As Iris made her way back to her car, she couldn't shake off the feeling that she was being watched. She glanced over her shoulder, but saw nothing but darkness.

When she arrived at the warehouse, Lena was already waiting for her, dressed in a black jumpsuit and carrying a small briefcase.

"Welcome," Lena said, as Iris took a seat beside her. "Tonight, we're going to take down The Architect once and for all."

Iris raised an eyebrow. "You know I'm not just any ordinary PI. I have connections with the police department."

Lena smiled. "That's what they think. But tonight, you'll see that I have something that will put them in a tight spot."

With a flick of her wrist, Lena revealed a photograph of The Architect, revealing a shocking connection to Iris' own past.

Iris felt her world turned upside down as she realized the truth about her new friend and their motives.
