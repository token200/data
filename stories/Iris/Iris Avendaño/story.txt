Iris Avendaño sat alone in her small, cluttered apartment, staring at the worn photograph on her coffee table. It was an old family picture, taken on a sunny beach vacation when she was just a child. Her bright smile and infectious laugh seemed to leap off the page, a stark contrast to the somber expression on her face now.

Iris Avendaño had always been a creative soul, with a passion for music that rivaled her love of art. As a teenager, she spent countless hours practicing guitar and writing songs in her room, lost in her own little world of melodies and lyrics. But life had other plans, and Iris found herself pursuing a more "practical" career as an accountant.

As the years went by, Iris Avendaño's love of music never truly faded. She would often sneak away to local open mic nights, where she'd strum her guitar and belt out tunes that brought a smile to the faces of strangers. But with the demands of her day job and the pressure to conform to societal expectations, Iris began to lose touch with her artistic side.

Tonight was different, though. Tonight, Iris Avendaño felt restless, like a caged bird struggling to fly. She picked up her guitar and began to play, the chords flowing effortlessly from her fingers as she sang of love, loss, and longing. The notes seemed to fill the room, echoing off the walls as she poured out her heart on the page.

For the first time in years, Iris Avendaño felt truly alive. She closed her eyes, letting the music wash over her, and let go of all the doubts and fears that had held her back for so long. As the final note faded away, she opened her eyes to find herself bathed in a warm, golden light, as if the very stars themselves were shining down on her.

In that moment, Iris Avendaño knew she couldn't turn back the clock. She had to follow her heart, no matter where it led. With a newfound sense of purpose, she packed up her guitar and headed out into the night, ready to face whatever lay ahead, armed with nothing but her music and her unwavering determination to be true to herself.
