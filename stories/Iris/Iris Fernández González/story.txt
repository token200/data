Iris Fernández González had always been drawn to the world of art. As a child, she would spend hours sketching the intricate patterns on her abuela's traditional Spanish tiles. Her mother, a painter herself, encouraged Iris's creativity, setting up a small studio in their home and providing her with an array of colors and mediums.

As Iris grew older, her passion for art only intensified. She began to study fine arts at university, where she honed her skills and developed her unique style. It was during this time that Iris Fernández González discovered her love for abstract expressionism.
