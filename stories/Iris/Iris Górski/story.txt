Iris Górski stepped out of her small apartment, onto the bustling streets of Kraków's Old Town. As a journalist and historian, she had spent countless hours exploring the city's winding alleys and learning its secrets. But today, she was on a mission to uncover a piece of her own family's history.

Iris had always been fascinated by the stories of her grandmother, Berta, who had fled Poland during World War II and made her way to America. She remembered Berta's eyes, her voice, her hands – but the specifics of her journey remained shrouded in mystery. Iris was determined to change that.

As she wandered through the crowded market square, Iris stopped at a small café and ordered a coffee. The owner, an elderly woman named Wanda, greeted her with a warm smile. "Ah, Iris, what brings you here today?" she asked, as she poured the steaming liquid into a tiny cup.

"I'm looking for information about my grandmother's family," Iris explained. "Berta Górski – do you know anything about her?"

Wanda's eyes widened behind her thick glasses. "Yes, I think so. Your Berta was a member of the Polish resistance during the war."

Iris's heart skipped a beat. This was it – this could be the break she needed.

"Tell me more," she urged Wanda, as the old woman began to spin a tale of secret meetings and coded messages. Iris listened, entranced, as Wanda spoke of Berta's bravery and resourcefulness in the face of danger.

As they talked, a young woman approached their table – a girl with bright pink hair and a nose ring, who introduced herself as Kasia, Wanda's granddaughter. "I'm so sorry I'm late," she said, "but my grandmother asked me to fetch some documents from the attic."

Kasia handed Iris an old folder filled with letters, photographs, and other mementos. As Iris flipped through the pages, a photograph caught her eye – a group of young women, smiling and confident, their faces marked by the lines of exhaustion and worry.

"This is Berta," Kasia said, as she took the photo from Iris's hands. "I remember my grandmother talking about this – it was her wedding day."

Tears pricked at Iris's eyes as she looked around the café, now filled with a new sense of connection and purpose. She knew that she had only scratched the surface of her family's story, but for the first time in years, she felt like she was getting close to the truth.
