Iris Lehtonen stepped into the small, cozy café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. It was a typical Wednesday afternoon in Helsinki, and Iris had promised her friend Anna she'd meet her here to discuss their latest art project.

As Iris waited by the counter, sipping on a cup of strong Finnish coffee, she noticed Anna sitting at a corner table, sketchbook in hand. The two friends had met while studying graphic design at Aalto University, and since then, they'd collaborated on numerous creative projects. Today was no exception.

"Anna! You're running late," Iris teased, as she made her way over to the table.

Anna looked up from her sketchbook, a sheepish grin spreading across her face. "Sorry, I got caught up in my design process. So, what's the plan for today?"

Iris took a seat opposite Anna and pulled out a small notebook from her bag. "We need to finalize our concept for the new exhibit at the Design Museum. Remember how we discussed incorporating recycled materials into the installation?"

Anna nodded enthusiastically, her eyes lighting up with excitement. "I've been working on some ideas – what about using repurposed glass bottles to create a stunning light fixture? We could call it 'Ocean's Tear'."

Iris Lehtonen's eyes widened as she flipped through Anna's sketchbook, marveling at the intricate details and creative potential of each design. She scribbled down notes in her own notebook, feeling the ideas flow freely.

As they brainstormed and tossed around concepts, Iris couldn't help but think about how far their friendship had grown since those early days as art students. Anna's unique perspective and attention to detail always brought out the best in Iris Lehtonen's designs.

The hours passed swiftly, with only a few sips of coffee separating them from finishing up their project. As they packed up their things to leave, Iris turned to Anna with a smile. "You know what? I think we've got something amazing here. Let's make this exhibit happen!"

Anna grinned back, her eyes shining with excitement. "I couldn't agree more, Iris Lehtonen. We make an unstoppable team."

As they walked out of the café, side by side, Iris felt a sense of pride and gratitude for their friendship – and the incredible art that flowed from it.
