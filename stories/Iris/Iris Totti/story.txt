Born Iris Totti to a family of modest means, Iris had always been driven to succeed. She worked multiple jobs to put herself through college, where she honed her writing skills and began to make a name for herself as a talented young journalist.

After graduating, Iris landed an internship at the city's most prominent newspaper, where she quickly proved herself to be a rising star. Her aggressive reporting style and fearless attitude made her a favorite among readers, but also earned her many enemies among those in power.
