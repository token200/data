Iris Eglītis stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small town of Riga's station. She had been away for so long, lost in the haze of memory and regret. Her grandmother, Māra, had written to her, urging her to return home, but Iris wasn't sure if she was ready.

As a child, Iris had spent countless summers at her grandparents' house on the outskirts of town, where the trees whispered secrets and the sea sparkled like diamonds. But life had taken its toll – her parents had passed away in a tragic accident when she was just a teenager, and her grandmother had disappeared into the crowd, leaving Iris with nothing but memories.

Now, at twenty-five, Iris felt lost and uncertain about her future. She had studied art, but her passion had never quite translated to success. The city seemed to swallow her whole, leaving her feeling like a tiny, insignificant speck in the grand scheme of things.

As she made her way through the station, Iris spotted a figure waiting for her – an older woman with piercing green eyes and silver hair that cascaded down her back like a river of moonlight. Māra Eglītis beckoned to her with a gentle smile.

Iris felt a jolt of surprise as she approached her grandmother. She had thought she'd never see her again, but here she was, standing before her like a beacon in the darkness.

"Kļava," Iris whispered, using the nickname Māra used when they were children. "What are you doing here?"

Māra's eyes crinkled at the corners as she smiled. "I've been waiting for you, Iris. You're home now."

As they walked out of the station, Iris felt the air fill with a sense of possibility. Maybe this was where her journey would begin – not with answers, but with questions. Māra led her to their old family cottage, where the scent of baking and memories enveloped them like a warm blanket.

Iris knew that she still had much to learn about herself and her place in the world. But for now, with Māra by her side, she felt a sense of belonging – like she was home at last.
