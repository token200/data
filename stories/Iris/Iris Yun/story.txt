Iris Yun stepped off the crowded bus and onto the sidewalk, weaving past pedestrians on her lunch break. As a marketing specialist at a trendy startup in Shoreditch, she was always on the move, juggling emails, social media, and meeting notes in her mind.

But amidst the chaos of urban life, Iris's thoughts often drifted to her grandmother, who had passed away a year ago. Her name was Mrs. Yun, a kind-hearted woman from Seoul who had immigrated to London with her family when Iris was just a child. She had taught Iris how to make traditional Korean desserts, like patbingsu and hotteok, which Iris still made for her friends on special occasions.

Iris decided to take a detour from the hustle and bustle of the city and visit the small Korean market that Mrs. Yun used to take her to when she was younger. The smell of sesame oil and fresh kimchi wafted through the air as she browsed the stalls, her eyes scanning for the familiar signs of her grandmother's favorites: spicy perilla leaves and sweet mandu.

As she haggled with the vendor over the price of a bag of gochujang paste, Iris felt a pang of nostalgia. She remembered the way Mrs. Yun would laugh when she was trying to cook, her face smeared with chili flakes and rice powder. The smell of Korean spices transported her back to those sunny afternoons spent exploring the markets with her grandmother.

The vendor handed her the bag with a warm smile, saying "Ah-ya, come visit me soon!" Iris smiled back, feeling a sense of connection to this small shop that had been a part of so many fond memories. As she left the market and headed back into the city, she felt revitalized, her mind clear of work-related stress.

Iris spent the rest of her lunch break making patbingsu for a coworker's birthday party later that evening. She laughed as they took their first bites, the cold sweetness and crunchy sesame seeds bringing smiles to everyone's faces. In those moments, she felt like she was still walking alongside Mrs. Yun, carrying on the traditions and stories of her grandmother's love.

The day went by in a blur of emails and deadlines, but Iris carried with her a quiet sense of contentment, knowing that some things – like Korean desserts and family memories – remained timeless and worth savoring.
