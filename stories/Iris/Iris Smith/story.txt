One day, Iris Mae received an invitation from a young girl who had grown up watching her work. The girl, named Maria, wanted to meet Iris Mae in person and learn more about her art. Overjoyed by the prospect of connecting with someone she had inspired, Iris Mae traveled to Mexico City to spend a week with Maria.
