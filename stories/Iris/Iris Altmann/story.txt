Iris Altmann stepped into the bustling café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him in the corner, sipping on a latte and lost in thought. Her brother, Max, had been her rock since their parents' passing five years ago.

As she approached, he looked up, a mixture of relief and wariness crossing his face. Iris smiled warmly and slid into the seat across from him. "Hey, sis," he said, using the nickname only he reserved for her.

"Iris Altmann" – he often slipped up – chuckled and playfully rolled her eyes. "Max, I swear, no one calls me that except you."

Their conversation flowed easily, like they'd been discussing everything from their childhood memories to the latest job opportunities in town. Iris, an aspiring writer, had always dreamed of finding a publisher for her debut novel. She confided in Max about her frustration with the publishing industry and his words of encouragement helped ease her doubts.

As they chatted, the waiter arrived with a plate of freshly baked pastries, their scent wafting through the air and sending Iris's stomach growling. "I'm starving," she admitted, digging into the flaky croissant. Max laughed and ordered another round for both of them.

Over coffee and sweet treats, they discussed everything from literature to their shared love of hiking in the nearby woods. It was these quiet moments with her brother that brought Iris Altmann the most comfort – a reminder that she wasn't alone in this world.

As they finished their meal and prepared to leave, Max placed a hand on hers. "Hey, I know you're struggling, but your writing is going to make a difference," he said, his eyes sincere. Iris felt a surge of gratitude towards her brother, not just for the words of encouragement, but also for being there whenever she needed him.

Together, they left the café, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead – side by side, as sisters, and as writers.
