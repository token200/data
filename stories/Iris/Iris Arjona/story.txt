Iris Arjona stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out at the city skyline as the sun dipped below the horizon. She took a deep breath, feeling the cool breeze fill her lungs, and closed her eyes. This was her favorite time of day - when the world seemed to slow down and she could clear her mind.

As she opened her eyes, Iris's gaze fell upon the city map spread out on the small wooden table beside her. She was planning a surprise party for her best friend, Sofia, who was turning 25 tomorrow. Iris had been friends with Sofia since college, and they shared a love for adventure, good food, and great music.

Iris Arjona's mind began to whirl with ideas as she studied the map. She knew that Sofia loved Italian food, so she had booked a table at Bella Vita, a quaint little restaurant in Little Italy. And for the party itself, Iris had rented out a private room at a local jazz club, where they would play a playlist of Sofia's favorite tunes.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Iris made her way to the kitchen to start preparing dinner. She was an excellent cook and had planned a delicious menu of spaghetti with meatballs, bruschetta, and cannoli for dessert. Her roommate, Rachel, was busy setting up the party decorations, and Iris couldn't wait to see how everything would come together.

The night before the party, Iris curled up on her couch with a book and fell fast asleep, exhausted from all the planning she had done. She knew that Sofia would be thrilled with the surprise party, and she was looking forward to seeing her friend's face light up when she walked into the room tomorrow evening.

As Iris drifted off to sleep, she couldn't help but smile at the thought of the big day ahead. It was going to be a night to remember, and she knew that Sofia would always treasure the memory of their 25th birthday celebration.
