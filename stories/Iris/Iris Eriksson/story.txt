Iris Eriksson stood at the edge of the lake, her feet sinking into the damp earth as she gazed out at the water. The sun had long since set, casting a dark silhouette over the trees, but Iris didn't notice. She was lost in thought, her mind replaying the events of the past few days.

As a photographer, Iris had always been drawn to the unknown, the unexplained. She spent most of her time traveling to remote locations, capturing the beauty and mystery of the natural world on film. But lately, she'd been experiencing strange occurrences that made her question everything.

She'd seen shadowy figures lurking in the woods, heard whispers in the dead of night. At first, Iris had dismissed it as mere paranoia, but the events had grown more frequent and intense. Tonight was no exception. She could feel eyes upon her, watching her from just beyond the treeline.

Iris took a deep breath and began to walk along the lake's edge, the water lapping at her ankles. The trees seemed to loom over her, their branches creaking in the breeze like skeletal fingers. She felt a shiver run down her spine, but she pressed on, determined to uncover the truth.

As she walked, Iris noticed something odd. A small boat was moored to a nearby dock, its engine sputtering and dying with each passing moment. The wood creaked and groaned as it settled into the water, like an old bone laid to rest. Iris approached cautiously, her heart pounding in her chest.

Suddenly, a gust of wind swept through the trees, extinguishing the boat's last flicker of life. Iris felt a jolt run through her body, and she stumbled backwards, falling onto the wet earth. As she sat there, she noticed something peculiar - a small piece of paper clutched in her hand.

It was a Polaroid photograph, developed on the spot, showing a figure standing just beyond the treeline. The image was grainy and faded, but one feature stood out: Iris's own face staring back at her from the lens.

With shaking hands, she picked up the camera that had captured the photo, feeling an icy dread creeping over her. What did it mean? Who or what was behind these strange occurrences? And why was Iris herself a part of the mystery?

As the darkness closed in around her, Iris knew that she'd have to uncover the truth if she wanted to survive. She took a deep breath and stood up, determined to confront whatever forces were at work, head-on.
