Dániel Khan sat at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of files in front of him. As the lead investigator for the prestigious detective agency, Khan Investigations, he had seen it all. But the case that lay before him now was different.

A wealthy businessman had been murdered, and the only clue was a cryptic message scrawled on his office wall: "The Devil is in the details." The police were stumped, and Khan had been called in to crack the case.

As he poured over the evidence, Dániel's mind began to wander. He thought back to his childhood, growing up on the streets of Budapest with a single mother who worked tirelessly to provide for him. His parents had died when he was just a teenager, leaving him alone and adrift. But his determination and sharp intellect had carried him through.

Khan's eyes snapped back to the present as he realized that this case was personal. The victim was a ruthless entrepreneur who had made his fortune by stepping on others. Dániel knew the type of man he was, and he couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction at the prospect of unmasking him.

With renewed focus, Khan began to sift through the evidence once more. He noticed a small inconsistency in the victim's alibi, which led him down a rabbit hole of deceit and corruption. The closer he got to the truth, the more Dániel felt himself being drawn into the darkness of the human psyche.

As the hours ticked by, Khan found himself lost in thought, wondering what drove someone to commit such a heinous crime. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was staring into the abyss, with no safety net to catch him if he fell.

And then, it hit him. The phrase on the wall was more than just a clever riddle - it was a red herring. The killer wasn't trying to mislead him; they were trying to distract him from something much simpler. Dániel's eyes scanned the room once more, this time noticing a small security camera in the corner that had been expertly concealed.

With a triumphant smile, Khan picked up the phone and dialed the agency's number. "We've got our man," he said to his team over the line. As he listened to their congratulatory remarks, Dániel couldn't help but feel a sense of pride. The Devil may be in the details, but Dániel Khan had uncovered the truth, one carefully crafted lie at a time.
