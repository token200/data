Dániel Bierhals was known for his unassuming nature, often blending into the background as he went about his day. As a music journalist, he had spent years honing his craft, interviewing some of the biggest names in the industry and uncovering hidden gems that few others had discovered.

Despite his reclusive tendencies, Dániel Bierhals was always on the lookout for the next great story. He spent hours scouring the streets of Berlin, listening to musicians play impromptu sets in tiny cafes and clubs, searching for that elusive spark that would set their career ablaze.

One evening, as he was leaving a particularly grueling interview, Dániel Bierhals stumbled upon a young singer-songwriter named Lena.
