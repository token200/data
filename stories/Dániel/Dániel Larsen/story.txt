Dániel Larsen stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the small station for any sign of the car he had arranged to meet him in. It was a chilly autumn evening, and the rain that had been threatening all day finally began to fall, casting a misty veil over the town.

Dániel Larsen pulled his coat tighter around himself and made his way towards the old Ford Escort that was parked by the curb. The driver, a gruff but kind-eyed woman named Gudrun, greeted him with a nod as he opened the door.

"Welcome to Húsavík, Dániel Larsen," she said, her voice low and soothing. "I trust your journey here was uneventful?"

Dániel Larsen smiled wryly, shaking his head. "Just the usual delays and cancellations," he replied. "But I made it, thanks to you."

Gudrun chuckled, putting the car in gear as she pulled out of the station. The two of them drove through the streets of Húsavík, the rain growing heavier with every passing minute.

As they approached Dániel Larsen's destination – a small, secluded cottage on the outskirts of town – he could feel a sense of excitement building inside him. This was it, his chance to start anew and leave the past behind.

Dániel Larsen took a deep breath as Gudrun dropped him off at the door. He smiled at her, feeling a sense of gratitude for the kindness she had shown him over the years.

"Thank you again, Gudrun," he said, handing her a generous tip before turning to disappear into his new home.

The cottage was quiet and still, the only sound the patter of rain on the roof. Dániel Larsen felt a sense of peace wash over him as he looked around at the simple but cozy space. This was it, his chance to start again – and he was determined to make the most of it.
