As he began to dig deeper, Dániel encountered resistance from the mayor's office and even some of his own colleagues at the local newspaper. But he refused to back down, driven by a fierce determination to expose the truth.

Finally, after weeks of relentless pursuit, Dániel had enough evidence to write a scathing exposé that would shake the foundations of the town hall. He titled it "The Mayor's Dirty Secret" and submitted it to his editor with trembling hands.

To his surprise, the story was published on the front page of the newspaper, sending shockwaves through the town. The mayor was forced to resign, and Dániel Piotrowska became an overnight sensation in Kraków.
