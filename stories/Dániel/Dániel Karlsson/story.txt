Dániel Karlsson trudged through the snow-covered streets, his boots crunching on the frozen crystals. A journalist by trade, he had always been drawn to the darker corners of life, and tonight was no exception. He was investigating a string of bizarre occurrences in the small town of Ravenswood, where residents reported hearing eerie whispers in the dead of night.

As he turned a corner, Dániel Karlsson spotted a figure huddled in a doorway. The man's eyes seemed sunken, his skin pale and clammy. "Excuse me," Dániel said, approaching him cautiously. "Can I help you with something?"

The man looked up, startled, and then nodded slowly. "Just trying to stay warm," he muttered.

Dániel Karlsson nodded sympathetically. He had always been good at getting people to open up to him, and he sensed that this man was hiding something. He pulled out his notebook and pen, trying to appear non-threatening. "What's your name?" he asked gently.

The man hesitated before answering, "J—just Joe."

Dániel Karlsson nodded again, jotting down a few notes. There was something about Joe that didn't add up – a faint air of desperation around him. He made a mental note to look into the man's background further.

As they stood there in silence, Dániel Karlsson couldn't shake off the feeling that he was being watched. He glanced around, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. The whispers seemed to be coming from all directions now, echoing through the streets like a chilling chant.

Suddenly, Joe spoke up again, his voice barely above a whisper. "It's starting again," he said, his eyes darting nervously around the street. Dániel Karlsson's journalist instincts kicked in – this was the break he had been waiting for. He leaned forward, pen poised over his notebook. "What do you mean?"
