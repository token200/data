Dániel Kentaro had always been an outsider in his small village. Growing up as the son of a traveling artist, he never quite fit in with the traditional ways of the villagers. While they were content to tend to their fields and livestock, Dániel's curiosity led him to explore the world beyond their borders.

As a young man, Dániel Kentaro spent countless hours poring over his father's old maps and sketchbooks, dreaming of far-off lands and exotic cultures. He longed to see the world for himself, to experience all its wonders and learn from its people.

One day, Dániel made up his mind to leave the village and make his way into the unknown. His parents, though worried for his safety, supported his decision and gave him a small pouch of gold to set him on his journey.

With a sense of excitement and trepidation, Dániel Kentaro set off towards the east, following a dusty road that wound its way through rolling hills and dense forests. He walked for days, sleeping under the stars and waking with the sun, until finally he caught sight of a bustling marketplace in the distance.

Overwhelmed by the sights and sounds of the city, Dániel felt like a small fish in a vast pond. But as he wandered through the crowded stalls, taking in the vibrant colors and enticing smells, he began to feel a sense of belonging. He struck up conversations with merchants and travelers, learning about their lives and hearing tales of far-off lands.

For the first time in his life, Dániel felt like he had found his place in the world. He knew that he would always be an outsider, but he also knew that being different was what made him special. As he sat on a bench, watching the sun set over the city, Dániel Kentaro smiled to himself, knowing that he had finally come home.
