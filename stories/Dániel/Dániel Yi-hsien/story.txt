Dániel Yi-hsien was a poet and painter who lived in Taipei during the 1920s. Born into a wealthy family, he was given every opportunity to pursue his artistic passions, which often found themselves at odds with the expectations of his parents.

As a young man, Dániel was drawn to the works of modernist writers like Guomao and Lu Xun, whose rejection of traditional Chinese values resonated deeply with him. He began writing poetry in their style, but his family was dismayed by what they saw as his "subversive" ideas.

Despite this, Dániel continued to write and paint, using the pseudonym "Tien-i" to conceal his identity from those who might disapprove of his work. His art was heavily influenced by the Impressionist movement, which he had discovered while studying in Paris.

As his reputation grew, so did the tensions within his family. Dániel's parents demanded that he abandon his artistic pursuits and take over the family business, but their son refused to be bound by tradition. He became increasingly isolated from those around him, preferring the company of his art to that of his relatives.

One night, as a fierce storm raged outside, Dániel sat at his easel, paint-splattered hands moving deftly across the canvas. His latest piece was taking shape before his eyes, a bold and vibrant depiction of Taipei's cityscape. He lost himself in the creative process, oblivious to the turmoil brewing within him.

As the storm subsided, Dániel emerged from his studio, blinking in the bright sunlight. He felt a sense of purpose he had not known in years, as if his art was finally a reflection of his true self. With renewed determination, he set out to establish himself as an artist, determined to prove to his family – and himself – that Dániel Yi-hsien's creative spirit would not be silenced.

And so, with bold brushstrokes and unflinching vision, Dániel Yi-hsien embarked on a journey of artistic self-discovery, leaving behind the doubts and fears that had once threatened to stifle his dreams.
