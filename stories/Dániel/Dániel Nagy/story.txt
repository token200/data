Dániel Nagy stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It had been months since he'd last set foot in Budapest, and the city seemed to have changed little despite the passing time. As he made his way through the crowds, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.

A fellow passenger on the train had caught his eye – a young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She'd been reading a book, but when their gazes met, she'd looked up, her expression unreadable. Dániel had felt a jolt of recognition, as if he'd known her before.

He hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of his family's old apartment building. As they sped through the city streets, Dániel couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. He'd spent many happy hours in that very apartment, playing hide-and-seek with his siblings and listening to his mother's stories of their ancestors.

The taxi pulled up outside the building, and Dániel paid the driver before stepping out onto the pavement. The woman from the train was waiting for him on the steps, her eyes locked on his. "Dániel Nagy," she said, her voice low and husky. "It's been a long time."

He nodded, feeling a shiver run down his spine. "Lászlóva." She smiled, her lips curving upwards. "I've missed you."

As they walked into the apartment building together, Dániel couldn't help but wonder how this stranger had known his name, and what she wanted from him now that she'd found him.

The elevator took them to the top floor, where Dániel's family used to live. They stepped out onto the small balcony, taking in the view of the city spread out before them. The woman sat down beside him on the chair, her eyes fixed on the horizon.

"I've been searching for you for a long time," she said finally, her voice barely above a whisper. "Dániel Nagy, I think we have some unfinished business to attend to."

Dániel's heart was racing as he turned to face her, his mind reeling with questions and doubts. Who was this woman, and what did she want from him? But before he could ask any of them, she reached out and took his hand, her touch sending shivers down his spine.

"I think we can help each other," she said, her eyes locked on his. "I'm not just looking for you, Dániel Nagy – I need your help."
