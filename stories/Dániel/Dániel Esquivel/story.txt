Dániel Esquivel grew up in a world of poverty, but his parents instilled in him a sense of hope and resilience that would carry him through the toughest of times. He worked tirelessly from a young age, helping his mother with her small bakery and later working in the fields to support his family.

As Dániel Esquivel entered adulthood, he knew that he wanted more for himself. He had big dreams and aspirations, but the world seemed determined to hold him back.
