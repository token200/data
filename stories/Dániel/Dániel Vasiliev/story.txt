Dániel Vasiliev stepped into the dimly lit café, scanning the room for any sign of her contact. She spotted him in the corner, nursing a cup of black coffee and staring intently at his phone.

As she approached, he looked up, his eyes locking onto hers with an air of familiarity. "Dániel Vasiliev," he said softly, standing to greet her.

They exchanged nods, both knowing the protocol was to keep interactions brief. Dániel Vasiliev's reputation as a skilled operative had preceded her, and she knew her contact took his job very seriously.

"I have what you requested," she said, sliding a small folder onto the table between them. Inside lay classified documents detailing the inner workings of a rogue organization.

The man, whose name was Ivan, scanned the contents quickly before nodding in approval. "These will be invaluable."

Dániel Vasiliev leaned back into her chair, eyeing him warily. She had worked with Ivan before, but their partnership was always transactional. He needed the information; she needed payment.

As they chatted idly about inconsequential topics – everything from the latest hacking techniques to popular folk music in Eastern Europe – Dániel Vasiliev couldn't shake off the feeling that something wasn't quite right. Ivan seemed... distracted.

It wasn't until he casually mentioned a recent trip to Budapest that she pieced together the connection. A safe house, one of many around the city, was actually an undercover location for a clandestine meeting between powerful figures from rival factions.

Dániel Vasiliev's instincts told her she had walked into something much bigger than she'd initially anticipated. The stakes were higher now; not just her payment but also the entire global balance of power hung in the balance.

She extracted the folder back, eyes narrowing as Ivan watched her closely. "Consider this our agreement," she said finally, standing up to leave. "You won't breathe a word about this, nor share the information with anyone."

Ivan nodded once, expression inscrutable, before she turned and disappeared into the crowded streets of Budapest.
