Stefano Pei-ling was a free-spirited artist who lived life on her own terms. Born in Taipei, Taiwan, to a Taiwanese mother and Italian father, she had grown up surrounded by the vibrant colors and sounds of her multicultural heritage.

As a child, Stefano Pei-ling would spend hours watching her mother weave intricate patterns on the loom, mesmerized by the way the threads seemed to come alive under her fingers. It was this early fascination with textiles that would eventually lead her to become a renowned textile artist, known for her bold and eclectic designs.

After completing art school in Florence, Italy, Stefano Pei-ling set out to make a name for herself in the competitive world of fashion. She worked as an intern for several high-end designers, learning the ins and outs of the industry and honing her skills as a creative problem-solver.
