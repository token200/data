Infiltrate the highly secure databases of a prominent corporation and uncover evidence of corporate espionage. Stefano knew it was a risk, but the promise of riches and power was too enticing to resist.

The client was left speechless, unable to comprehend how Stefano had managed to breach their defenses so effortlessly. As for Stefano, he disappeared into the shadows, his legend growing with each passing day.
