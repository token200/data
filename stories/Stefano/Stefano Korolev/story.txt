Stefano Korolev, a former KGB operative turned freelance investigator, sat in his dimly lit office, sipping on a cup of cold coffee. The flickering fluorescent lights above his desk cast an eerie glow on his weathered face, etched with the lines of countless late nights and high-stakes missions.

It had been years since Korolev left the KGB's ranks, but the scars from his past still lingered. He had tried to leave the espionage game behind, but the skills he had honed during his time in the spy agency remained second nature to him. Clients from all over the world came to Stefano Korolev, seeking his expertise in matters of national security and global intrigue.

One such client, a wealthy businessman named Viktor Petrov, sat across from Korolev, his eyes scanning the room as if searching for an exit. Korolev knew that look - it was the same one he had seen on countless occasions, when someone's alibi didn't quite add up.

"What makes you think I'm involved in this, Stefano?" Petrov asked, his voice dripping with skepticism. "I have a reputation for being one of the most honest men in Russia."

Korolev smiled wryly. He had seen it all before - the smokescreen of innocence, the carefully constructed facade of integrity. But he also knew that sometimes, the truth lay just beneath the surface.

"I'm not saying you're involved, Viktor," Korolev said, his eyes locked on Petrov's. "But I am saying that your company has been embezzling funds, and we have reason to believe that you might be the mastermind behind it."

Petrov's face darkened, but Korolev just shrugged. He had dealt with men like this before - men who thought they were above the law, who thought they could outsmart even the most skilled operative.

"I'll tell you one thing, Stefano," Petrov spat. "You're going to regret taking on this case. You're going to regret ever crossing me."

Korolev raised an eyebrow. He had heard that threat before too. But he knew that in his line of work, threats were just a way of life. And he was always ready for whatever came next.
