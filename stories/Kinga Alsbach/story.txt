Kinga Alsbach stepped out of her castle, breathing in the crisp morning air. As the ruler of Alsbach, she had grown accustomed to the weight of responsibility, but it still felt like a mantle she should not have to bear.

Her thoughts turned to the recent troubles plaguing the kingdom. A band of raiders had been terrorizing villages along the border, and Kinga's men had failed to catch them. The people were growing restless, and Kinga knew that if something wasn't done soon, it would be her own head on the chopping block.

As she made her way through the bustling streets of Alsbach, Kinga was greeted with nods and curtsies from the townspeople. They spoke of her in hushed tones, their eyes filled with a mix of admiration and fear. Some whispered that she was too soft, that she didn't rule with enough steel. Others claimed that she was too weak, that she couldn't make the tough decisions necessary to keep the kingdom safe.

Kinga stopped before a nearby blacksmith's forge, watching as the fiery flames danced across the metal being shaped into arms and armor for her soldiers. She knew that these men were her best hope against the raiders, but even their bravery was not enough to put an end to the problem.

As she turned to leave, Kinga noticed a young girl standing at the edge of the crowd, watching her with wide eyes. The girl looked no more than ten winters old, and yet there was something about her that caught Kinga's attention. Perhaps it was the way the sunlight highlighted the wisps of hair escaping from beneath her cap, or maybe it was the look of determination etched on her face.

Without thinking, Kinga knelt down beside the girl, who looked up at her with a mixture of surprise and curiosity. "You have a plan to deal with these raiders?" she asked, her voice softening for the first time that day.

The girl shook her head, looking around nervously as if worried about being overheard. "I've been watching them," she said quietly. "They seem...frightened. Like they're running from something more than just mead halls and swords."

Kinga's eyes narrowed, a spark of interest igniting within her. Could this young girl be the key to unlocking the secrets of the raiders? She nodded curtly, making a decision on the spot.

"Take care of yourself, child," she said, standing up and straightening her shoulders. "I'll take it from here."
