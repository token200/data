Meerim Berzina stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It had been years since she'd set foot in this rural town, and yet the memories still lingered like the scent of damp earth.

As a child, Meerim had spent summers here with her grandparents, learning the ways of the land from her grandmother's patient hands. But that was before the war, before the world had torn her life apart. Now, she came back to lay low for a while, to gather her thoughts and figure out what came next.

The stationmaster looked up as Meerim approached, his eyes narrowing slightly at the sight of her worn leather satchel and tired face. "Meerim Berzina," he said, his voice low and cautious. "I wasn't expecting you."

"I could have fooled you," Meerim replied with a wry smile, rummaging through her bag for a pocket watch. She wound it absently, the tick-tock a familiar comfort.

Her grandfather's farm still stood outside town, though it had changed hands several times since he'd passed away. Meerim made her way there now, following the dusty road that led to the old house. The fields were overgrown, and the barn was a mess, but something about the place felt like home.

As she worked, clearing out the debris and tending to the parched soil, Meerim began to feel the weight of her past lifting. It wasn't easy – there were still moments when the memories came flooding back, like waves crashing against the shore – but with each passing day, the pain receded a little further.

Eventually, the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the landscape in a warm orange light. Meerim stood on the porch, feeling the breeze rustle her hair as she watched the stars begin to twinkle overhead. For the first time in years, she felt like herself again, like Meerim Berzina – not just a ghost haunting the shadows of her own past.

The silence was almost palpable, but Meerim didn't mind. She knew that some wounds would never fully heal, but for now, it was enough to be back in this place, surrounded by the memories and the land she loved.
