Meerim Yu stepped out into the bustling streets of New Alexandria, her eyes scanning the crowds with a mix of curiosity and caution. As a skilled "memory hunter," she had spent years honing her ability to extract and manipulate memories from others.

Her latest assignment was from the enigmatic Lord Harrington, who had requested that Meerim retrieve a specific memory from a high-ranking official in the city's government. The memory in question was said to be linked to a string of recent murders, and Lord Harrington suspected that it held the key to unraveling the mystery.

Meerim made her way through the crowded marketplaces, weaving past merchants and traders as she searched for her target. She had been warned that the official's memories were heavily guarded, but Meerim was undaunted. With a few subtle cues and whispered incantations, she managed to sidle up beside the official in a quiet alleyway.

"Please, remember," Meerim coaxed, her voice barely above a whisper. "The image of a child playing in a forgotten garden."

The official's eyes glazed over as he stared into the distance, his face contorted in a mixture of nostalgia and pain. Meerim leaned forward, her fingers tracing the lines of his forehead as she probed deeper.

The memories flooded back, like ripples on a pond. Meerim saw images of a sun-drenched garden, overgrown with vines and shrubs. A small child played among the flowers, laughing and chasing after butterflies. But amidst the idyllic scene, Meerim detected a hint of darkness - a faint scent of decay that seemed out of place in such a beautiful setting.

"Lord Harrington wants to know about this garden," Meerim reported, her voice measured as she recounted the memory's secrets. "There was something... wrong with it."

As she finished speaking, Meerim felt a shiver run down her spine. She had always been drawn to the mysteries of the past, but sometimes she wondered if uncovering these memories came at too great a cost. The ghosts that lingered in people's minds were not easy to shake.

With her task complete, Meerim vanished into the crowds, leaving behind only whispers of her presence and the echoes of forgotten memories.
