Now, as Meerim sat on her bed, strumming her guitar, she felt the weight of responsibility on her shoulders. As one of Poland's most prominent folk singers, she was expected to carry the torch of traditional music forward. And she did – with dedication and passion.

With each note she played, Meerim Wójcik transported herself back to her childhood, when music was a source of joy and comfort.
