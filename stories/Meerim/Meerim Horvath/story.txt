Meerim Horvath stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the desolate station. She had been traveling for days, and the final leg to her destination was almost within reach. As a skilled smuggler, Meerim had seen her fair share of dingy, rundown places like this one.

She adjusted her pack, making sure everything was secure before setting off into the cool morning air. The sun was just starting to rise, casting a pale light over the dusty town beyond the station. Meerim's boots scuffed against the rough stone pavement as she made her way through the deserted streets.

People passed her on the sidewalk, but none of them gave her a second glance. They knew who Meerim Horvath was - or rather, what she did. Rumors swirled that she was involved with some shady organizations, but Meerim preferred to keep to herself. Her work was too complicated for casual acquaintances.

As she walked, the buildings grew taller and more ornate, a testament to the town's history. Meerim had heard whispers of an ancient artifact hidden somewhere within these walls, one that could change the course of her life forever.

She turned a corner, and suddenly the station gave way to a grand entrance. A sweeping staircase curved upwards, leading to the upper floors. The sign above the door read 'The Red Griffin Inn', and Meerim knew she had finally arrived.

A warm smile spread across her face as she pushed open the door. Inside, the air was thick with smoke and laughter. Barmaids polished mugs while musicians strummed lively tunes on their instruments. Meerim Horvath felt a sense of belonging for the first time in days, and she knew that this was where she belonged - at least for now.

Meerim took a seat at the bar, ordering a whiskey as she surveyed her surroundings. She spotted several shady characters lingering near the fire pit, their eyes scanning her with interest. For once, Meerim felt like she could blend in. Maybe even make some new friends. As long as they didn't ask too many questions about her past, that was.
