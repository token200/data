Meerim Hughes stood at the edge of the grand ballroom, her eyes scanning the sea of elegant guests as they twirled and laughed together. As the youngest daughter of the wealthy and influential Lord and Lady Harrington, Meerim had always been expected to follow in their footsteps and marry well.

But Meerim's heart belonged to books, not balls. She spent most of her free time devouring classics in the library, dreaming of adventures beyond the confines of the estate. Her parents, however, were determined to see her wedded to a man of means and status, rather than some "unsuitable" scholar.

As she watched, a tall figure emerged from the crowd, his piercing blue eyes locking onto hers with a hint of recognition. It was Finnley Blackwood, the infamous rogue and occasional thief who had a reputation for being untouchable. Meerim's parents had always warned her away from him, but she couldn't help feeling drawn to the enigmatic figure.

Finnley made his way through the crowds, his eyes never leaving Meerim's face. When he reached her side, he bowed low and whispered a single word in her ear: "Run."

Meerim's heart skipped a beat as Finnley swept her away from the ballroom, out into the moonlit night air. They fled across the gardens, dodging startled gardeners and leaping over obstacles, until they reached the safety of an old oak tree.

There, Finnley turned to Meerim with a mischievous grin. "You're a far cry from the demure little debutante I expected," he said, his voice low and husky. "I like you, Meerim Hughes."

Meerim felt a shiver run down her spine as she met Finnley's gaze. She had always dreamed of adventure, and now it seemed that adventure was coming for her in the most unexpected way.

"I've been waiting for someone to set me free," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Finnley chuckled and pulled Meerim close, his lips brushing against hers in a soft, gentle kiss. "Then let's get started, my dear Meerim Hughes."
