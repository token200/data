Meerim Szab√≥ stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar smell of diesel fuel and damp earth wafting up to greet her. She had been away for months, chasing dreams and fortune in the bustling cities of Europe, but now she was back in her hometown of Tbilisi, Georgia.

As she made her way through the crowded station, Meerim's eyes scanned the sea of faces, searching for a glimpse of familiarity. Her mother, Nino, had promised to meet her here, and Meerim couldn't help but feel a flutter of excitement at the prospect of seeing her loved one again.

She spotted a figure with a scarf wrapped around her head and a kind smile on her face, beckoning Meerim over. "Meriem! Mina!" her mother exclaimed, sweeping her into a tight hug. "I've missed you so much!"

Meerim hugged her back, feeling a lump form in her throat as she took in the sight of her mother's weathered hands and the silver threads that had begun to creep into her hair.

As they walked through the streets, Nino asked Meerim about her adventures, listening with wide eyes as she recounted tales of her time studying art in Paris and working as a waitress in Berlin. She spoke of the people she had met, the food she had eaten, and the strange customs she had encountered along the way.

But as they walked, Meerim couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. Her mother seemed distant, preoccupied with her own worries and concerns. "What's wrong, Mina?" Meerim asked, noticing the faint lines etched into Nino's brow.

Nino hesitated, collecting her thoughts before speaking in a hushed tone. "Meriem, I have some news. Your father has been ill for weeks, and... well, it's not looking good."

Meerim's heart sank as she felt a wave of grief wash over her. She had always known that her parents' time was limited, but hearing it now felt like a weight crushing down on her.

As they continued through the city streets, Meerim clung to her mother, trying to find some solace in the familiar rhythms and sounds of home. But as she looked up at Nino's tired face, she knew that this was no ordinary trip back to visit family - it was a pilgrimage to confront the uncertain future ahead.
