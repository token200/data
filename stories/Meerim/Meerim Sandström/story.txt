Meerim Sandström stood at the edge of the small, snow-covered cabin, her eyes scanning the frozen tundra before her. The wind howled and whipped her long, dark hair into a frenzy, but she didn't flinch. This was her home, after all – the place where she had grown up as a child, learning to hunt and survive from her father.

As she stepped inside, the warmth enveloped her like a hug. Her mother, Astrid, looked up from the fire pit, a smile on her face. "Meerim, you're late," she said, nodding towards the stove.

Meerim shrugged, taking off her parka and dropping it to the floor. She hung her mittened hands over the flames, feeling the warmth seep into her bones. Her father, Göran, had passed away a year ago, but his memory still lingered in this small cabin – in the smell of smoke and wood, in the way the light danced across the walls.

She walked over to the table, where a steaming bowl of soup awaited her. Astrid served it with a wooden spoon, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "You've been out all morning," she said, concern etched on her face. "What did you find?"

Meerim took a spoonful, savoring the flavors. She had spent hours tracking the deer, following its tracks across the frozen landscape. It was a big one – one that would feed her family for weeks to come.

As they ate in silence, Meerim's mind wandered back to Göran. She remembered his tales of the old days – stories of battles fought and won, of harsh winters endured. He had taught her everything she knew, from hunting to healing. Without him, this cabin felt empty – a hollow shell of what it once was.

But today, Meerim didn't feel lost or alone. She felt strong, like Göran's spirit was guiding her footsteps across the snow. As they finished their meal and began the day's chores, she realized that she was exactly where she was meant to be – in this cabin, with her family, living off the land.

Meerim smiled to herself as she worked, feeling a sense of contentment wash over her. She might miss Göran, but today, she knew she could face whatever the day brought. With Astrid by her side and the wind at her back, Meerim Sandström was ready for anything.
