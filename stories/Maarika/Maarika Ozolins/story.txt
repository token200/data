Maarika Ozolins stepped into the crowded café, scanning the room for her friend, Elina. The bell above the door jingled as she made her way through the throng of people. She spotted Elina sipping a latte by the window and quickened her pace.

As she approached, Elina looked up and smiled. "Hey, Maarika Ozolins! What brings you here today?" she asked, setting down her cup.

Maarika took a seat across from Elina, unwrapping the scarf from around her neck to reveal the vibrant purple scarf she wore on special occasions. The café owner had gifted it to her for being an excellent math whiz in high school.

Elina chuckled. "That scarf still brings back memories of our math competitions. Do you remember how we outsmarted our teachers every time?"

Maarika laughed, a mischievous glint in her eye. "Of course, I do! Those were the best times."

As they chatted, Maarika's phone buzzed with an incoming text from her best friend, Kristine. Maarika checked the screen and smiled before showing it to Elina.

"It's an invitation for our math club's annual tournament," she explained, "and it looks like we've been chosen as the defending champions."

Elina's eyes lit up. "That's awesome! We need to start practicing right away. When is the tournament scheduled?"

Maarika pulled out her calendar and checked the date. "It's two weeks from now. I was thinking of organizing a study group meeting tonight at my place."

Elina nodded enthusiastically. "Sounds like a plan. Let's make it happen, Maarika Ozolins!"

As they continued to discuss their strategy for the tournament, the café began to empty out, and the atmosphere grew quieter. Maarika and Elina were absorbed in their conversation, lost in the world of numbers and puzzles that had always come so naturally to them.

Maarika leaned back in her chair, a satisfied smile spreading across her face. She knew that with friends like Elina by her side, she could conquer any challenge that came their way – math problems or otherwise.
