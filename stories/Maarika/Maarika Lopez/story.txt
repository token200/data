Together, the group would spend hours sipping coffee, sharing stories, and exploring the city's hidden gems. Maarika found solace in their company, knowing that she had finally found a place where her creativity was not just tolerated but celebrated. As she sat among her new friends, listening to Emma's latest art exhibit ideas or watching Jack recite his latest poem, Maarika knew that she had found her tribe.
