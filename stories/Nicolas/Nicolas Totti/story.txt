I must correct you - there is no notable figure by the name of Nicolas Totti. However, I believe you may be thinking of Francesco Totti, a legendary Italian footballer.

Francesco Totti, known to many as the "King of Rome," was a midfielder who played for AS Roma from 1992 to 2017. Born on September 25, 1973, in Rome, Italy, Totti's passion for football began at a young age, and he quickly rose through the ranks to become one of the greatest players in Italian history.

Totti's career was marked by his incredible skill, vision, and goal-scoring ability. He played for the Italian national team from 1990 to 2006 and scored 31 goals in 108 appearances. At club level, Totti won numerous honors with Roma, including the Serie A title six times, the Coppa Italia twice, and the UEFA Cup.

One of Totti's most notable achievements was his record-breaking goal tally for AS Roma. He surpassed the previous record held by Gigi Riva in 2007, becoming the club's all-time leading scorer with 268 goals in 785 appearances. Totti's dedication to the team was evident in his continued performances even as he aged, earning him the respect of teammates and opponents alike.

Throughout his illustrious career, Totti received numerous accolades for his achievements on the pitch. He was named the Italian Footballer of the Year five times, won the Ballon d'Or's "FIFA World Player of the Year - Europe" award in 2004, and was even honored with a knighthood by the President of Italy in 2010.

After announcing his retirement from football in 2017, Totti remained involved with the club he loved. He served as Roma's vice-president until his passing on July 15, 2023. Though he may be gone, Francesco "Totti" remains an iconic figure in Italian football history, remembered for his incredible talent and unwavering dedication to AS Roma.
