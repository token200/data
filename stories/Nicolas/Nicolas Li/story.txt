Nicolas Li walked into the crowded caf√©, scanning the room for his friend, Emma. She was already seated at their usual table, sipping on a latte and staring intently at her laptop screen. As Nicolas approached, she looked up and smiled.

"Hey, Nick," she said, using his nickname. "I'm so glad you're here."

Nicolas Li smiled back, taking a seat across from Emma. "I wouldn't have missed it for the world," he replied. "What's new with you?"

Emma leaned in, her eyes sparkling with excitement. "I just landed my dream internship at a publishing house," she said, barely containing her enthusiasm.

Nicolas Li was thrilled for his friend. He had always known that Emma was destined for great things. As they chatted, Nicolas couldn't help but think about how far he and Emma had come since their college days. They had been inseparable during their time at university, sharing countless nights spent studying, laughing, and exploring the city together.

After finishing her coffee, Emma closed her laptop and stood up. "Shall we grab some lunch?" she asked, already knowing that Nicolas Li would be happy to join her.

As they walked through the bustling streets, Nicolas couldn't help but feel grateful for their friendship. Emma was more than just a friend - she was his confidante, his partner in crime, and his biggest supporter. He knew that he could always count on her to be there for him, no matter what life threw their way.

Over lunch, they talked about everything from books to music to their plans for the future. Nicolas Li felt at peace, knowing that Emma was by his side every step of the way. As they parted ways after lunch, Emma turned to Nicolas and said, "Thanks for being an amazing friend, Nick. I don't know what I'd do without you."

Nicolas Li smiled, feeling a warmth in his heart. "You'll never have to find out, Em," he replied, smiling back at her.
