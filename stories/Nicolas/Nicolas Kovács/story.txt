Nicolas Kovács stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room with a mix of curiosity and caution. He had received an invitation from a mysterious stranger to meet here, in this forgotten corner of Prague, and he was determined to uncover the truth.

As he waited at the counter, sipping on a cup of black coffee, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was an elderly woman with piercing green eyes and a warm smile.

"Nicolas," she said, her voice low and soothing. "I've been expecting you."

Kovács' instincts told him to be wary, but there was something about the woman's demeanor that put him at ease. He nodded, and she gestured for him to follow her.

They walked through the winding streets of Prague, passing by ancient buildings and quaint shops. The woman led him to a small park, where a lone fountain sang its gentle melody. She sat down on a bench, motioning for Kovács to join her.

"My name is Ariana," she said, as if introducing herself were no great feat. "I've been watching you, Nicolas. I know about your past."

Kovács' grip on his cup tightened. Who was this woman? How did she know him?

Ariana's eyes seemed to bore into his soul. "You're not who you think you are," she said, her words like a whispered secret. "You were born with a gift, one that sets you apart from others."

Kovács felt a shiver run down his spine. What gift could he possibly possess? He shook his head, trying to clear the cobwebs.

Ariana leaned forward, her voice taking on a conspiratorial tone. "Your talent lies in healing," she said, her eyes sparkling with intensity. "You have the power to mend the wounds of others."

Kovács' mind reeled as he tried to process Ariana's words. Healing? Was that really his gift?

As they sat there, the sun began to set behind them, casting a warm orange glow over the city. Kovács felt a sense of wonder wash over him, and for the first time in years, he felt like he was being called to something more.

Ariana's eyes seemed to hold a secret message, but Kovács couldn't quite decipher it. He knew only that his life was about to change in ways he couldn't yet imagine.
