I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Nicolas Avendaño. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created recently. If you'd like, I can generate a short story about a character with this name.

Here is a 400-word short story about Nicolas Avendaño:

Nicolas Avendaño was a quiet, unassuming man who lived in the small town of San Miguel. He worked as an accountant at a local firm, where he spent most of his days staring at spreadsheets and crunching numbers. But despite his mundane appearance, Nicolas had a secret: he was a passionate poet.

Every night, after work, Nicolas would sneak into the old library on the outskirts of town and pour over the works of the great Latin American poets. He found solace in their words, which spoke to him in a way that no one else's did. As he read, his fingers would move across the pages, scribbling down lines of verse that seemed to flow from his very soul.

One evening, as Nicolas was walking home from the library, he stumbled upon a group of street performers gathered on the plaza. A young woman with a vibrant purple scarf and a guitar slung over her shoulder caught his eye, singing with a voice that was both raw and beautiful. Nicolas listened, entranced, as she belted out a tune that echoed through the streets.

As she finished her song, the crowd erupted into applause, and Nicholas felt an inexplicable urge to join in. He pulled out his notebook from his pocket and began to recite one of his own poems:

"La ciudad dormía, la luna era
la estrella que iluminaba el camino"
(The city was sleeping, the moon was the star that lit the way)

The crowd gathered around him, mesmerized by the rhythm and cadence of his words. The woman with the purple scarf smiled at him, and for a moment, Nicolas felt like he was seeing her in a new light.

From that day on, Nicolas became a regular performer on the plaza, reciting his poems to anyone who would listen. His numbers began to grow, and people started to recognize him as the quiet accountant with a hidden talent. But for Nicolas, it didn't matter; all that mattered was sharing his words with others, and letting the music of the city lift him up.

As he performed on stage each night, the purple scarf girl by his side, Nicolas knew that he had found his true calling – not as an accountant, but as a poet of the people.
