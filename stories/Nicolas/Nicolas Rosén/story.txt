Nicolas Rosén stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station as he took in the familiar sights and sounds. It was as if he had been back to Malmö in Sweden for the past few years a lifetime ago.

He pulled out his phone and checked the time - 3:45 PM on a chilly autumn afternoon. His friends were meeting him at Café Kock, just a block away from the station. Nicolas had arrived early, hoping to secure a seat by the window where he could watch the hustle and bustle of the city outside.

As he waited, he couldn't help but think about how far he'd come since leaving Malmö for college in Copenhagen. He had always been driven, chasing his dreams and working hard to make a name for himself in the world of business. But now, as he gazed out at the grey sky, Nicolas felt a pang of restlessness.

He checked his phone again and saw that his friends were running late. Maybe they'd gotten stuck in traffic on the way from Lund? Nicolas shrugged it off and decided to grab a coffee instead, settling into a quiet corner table by the window.

As he sipped his latte, Nicolas noticed an elderly man sitting across from him, typing away on his laptop. There was something about the man's intensity that caught Nicolas' attention - perhaps it was the way he worked with precision and care, or maybe it was the hint of a smile playing on his lips.

The old man looked up, catching Nicholas' eye in the mirror reflection of the windowpane. He smiled warmly and nodded at Nicolas before returning to his typing. It was as if they shared a secret understanding that transcended words.

Suddenly, the door swung open and his friends burst into the café, chattering excitedly about their plans for the evening. Nicolas watched as they made their way to the table behind him, feeling a pang of nostalgia wash over him.

But as he turned back to the window, Nicholas caught another glimpse of the elderly man, typing away with renewed purpose. It was then that he realized - sometimes, it's not where you go, but who you meet along the way, that truly matters.
