Nicolas Molnar stepped into the dimly lit jazz club, the smooth sounds of the saxophone filling his ears as he made his way to the bar. He was a man of simple tastes, and yet, there was something about this particular venue that drew him in.

As he ordered a whiskey on the rocks, Nicolas' eyes scanned the room, taking in the eclectic mix of patrons. There were hipsters sipping craft beers, couples holding hands, and solo travelers nursing their own losses. He spotted a familiar face across the room - an old flame, Sofia, who had moved to Paris six months ago.

Their eyes met for a moment before she turned away, lost in conversation with her date. Nicolas felt a pang of longing, but he shook it off, knowing that getting involved again would only lead to heartache. He took a sip of his drink and began to make his way around the room, greeting acquaintances and strangers alike.

Nicolas had always been a bit of a loner, content with spending his free time reading or taking long walks in the park. His work as an editor for a small publishing house kept him busy during the day, but at night, he craved solitude. He wasn't one for grand gestures or grand romances.

As the night wore on, Nicolas spotted Sofia again, this time walking out of the club with her date. They exchanged a brief hug and kiss, before disappearing into the Parisian night. The saxophone player launched into an impromptu solo, filling the room with melancholy notes.

Nicolas smiled to himself as he watched the scene unfold. He knew that Sofia was better off without him, and besides, his own heart belonged to his books - and perhaps, one day, a new story would catch his attention, drawing him out of the shadows once again. The night wore on, with Nicolas lost in thought, nursing his whiskey, and letting the music wash over him like a balm.
