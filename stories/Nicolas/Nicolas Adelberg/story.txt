Nicolas Adelberg stepped out of the rain and into the cozy café, shaking the water off his umbrella. As he waited in line to order, he couldn't help but notice the peculiar glances from the patrons. It wasn't often that someone with a name as unusual as Nicolas Adelberg walked into a crowded establishment.

As a writer, Nicolas had grown accustomed to people staring at him, trying to make sense of his full name: Nicolas Adelberg. Some thought it was exotic, while others whispered it was some sort of joke. But Nicolas knew that his name was simply a reflection of his parents' eclectic tastes.

He ordered a cup of coffee and took a seat by the window, watching as the rain-soaked streets came alive with umbrellas and raincoats. A young woman sat down across from him, her eyes fixed on Nicolas's name tag (he always carried one, just in case).

"Excuse me," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Do you mind if I ask... how do people react to your name?"

Nicolas smiled wryly. "It's an acquired taste, I suppose." He told her about his childhood, when he was teased and called 'Adel-bug' by his classmates. But as he grew older, Nicolas began to appreciate the uniqueness of his name.

The young woman listened intently, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. When Nicolas finished speaking, she smiled warmly. "I think it's beautiful," she said. "It suits you."

As they chatted, Nicolas realized that sometimes, being different wasn't something to be ashamed of – but rather a strength. He thanked the woman for her kindness and left the café feeling revitalized.

Back on the streets, Nicolas felt the rain wash away some of his insecurities about his name. As he walked, people's reactions changed from curiosity to friendliness. It was as if being around someone who understood him made them see his full name – Nicolas Adelberg – in a new light.

As the rain slowed to a gentle patter, Nicolas smiled to himself. Maybe one day, his name would be more than just something people whispered about; maybe it would become a badge of honor.
