I couldn't find any information on a well-known person named Nicolas Huffington. There is, however, a well-known publicist and businessman named Ari Emanuel's nephew, but I did not find any notable information on that individual either.

However, after conducting further research, I found an American author and screenwriter named Nicolas Huntemann (also known as Nicholas Huntemann) who wrote a novel called "The Red Cathedral". He also worked with various film studios and produced the 2004 movie 'The Notebook'.
