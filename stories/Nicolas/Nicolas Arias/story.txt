Nicolas Arias stepped into the dimly lit room, his eyes adjusting to the soft glow of the candles that lined the walls. As a renowned art historian, he had spent years studying the works of the past masters, but it was tonight's invitation that brought him to this private gallery.

The host, an enigmatic figure known only as "M," greeted Nicolas with a warm smile. "Welcome, Dr. Arias. I'm so glad you could make it tonight."

Nicolas, whose full name was Dr. Nicolas Rafael Arias, returned the smile and nodded graciously. He had heard whispers of M's fascination with the works of 19th-century European artists, and he was eager to see if his own knowledge would prove valuable.

As they walked through the gallery, Nicolas's eyes widened in awe at the masterpieces on display. There was a stunning Monet watercolor, a vibrant Van Gogh landscape, and even a rare Picasso sculpture that he had only read about in books.

M led him to a final room, where a single painting hung on the wall. It was a striking portrait of a woman with piercing green eyes, her gaze seeming to follow Nicolas as he moved around the space.

"Ah, Dr. Arias," M said, his voice low and mysterious. "This is one of my favorite pieces. The artist's name is Eug√®ne Delacroix. What do you think of it?"

Nicolas hesitated for a moment before answering, his mind racing with theories about the painting's provenance and significance. Finally, he spoke up, his words tumbling out in a rush.

"I believe this painting was created during the height of Delacroix's career, around 1840. The use of color and composition is characteristic of his work from that period...and yet, there's something about this piece that sets it apart from the others."

M nodded thoughtfully, a hint of a smile on his lips. "I think you may be right, Dr. Arias. You have a keen eye for art. I look forward to seeing what other insights you bring to our little gathering."

As Nicolas left the gallery, he couldn't shake the feeling that M's interest in him went far beyond mere curiosity about his knowledge of art. He wondered if their encounter was merely a coincidence or something more...
