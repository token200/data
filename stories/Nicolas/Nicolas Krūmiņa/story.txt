I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Nicolas Krūmiņa. However, I can create a story for you.

In the bustling streets of Riga, Latvia's capital city, a young man named Nicolas Krūmiņa was making a name for himself as a master craftsman. His small shop, nestled between a vintage bookstore and a quaint café, was a treasure trove of intricate woodcarvings and delicate metalwork.

Nicolas, or Nick as he was known to his friends, was a born-and-bred Rigan with a passion for traditional craftsmanship. He spent most of his childhood watching his father work in the family's woodcarving shop, learning the intricacies of lathe work and wooden design.

As a young man, Nick had left Latvia to study fine arts in Paris, where he fell under the influence of Art Nouveau and its emphasis on flowing lines and organic forms. He returned home with a newfound appreciation for the beauty of traditional Latvian craftsmanship, and set out to revive it.

Over the years, Nick's shop had become a magnet for curious locals and tourists alike, all drawn by the enchanting aroma of freshly cut wood and the promise of unique, handmade creations. His commissions ranged from delicate wooden spoons to elaborate candle holders, each piece imbued with love and care.

One day, as Nick was working on a particularly intricate carving, he received an unexpected visit from a young girl named Līga. She had heard about his shop through her grandmother, who claimed that Nick's work was infused with magic. Intrigued, Līga asked if she could commission him to create a wooden puppet for her upcoming birthday.

Nick smiled and accepted the challenge, his fingers moving deftly as he brought the puppet to life. When finished, he presented it to Līga with a flourish, watching as her eyes sparkled with delight.

As the years went by, Nick's shop continued to thrive, attracting visitors from all corners of the globe who sought not only exquisite craftsmanship but also a connection to Latvia's rich cultural heritage. And at its heart, Nicolas Krūmiņa remained, his passion for traditional crafts burning bright like a beacon in the night.

As he often said himself, "A true master is not measured by his tools, but by the love and care with which he wields them."
