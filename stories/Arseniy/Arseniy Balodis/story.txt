Arseniy Balodis trudged through the snow-covered streets of Tallinn, Estonia, his scarf wrapped tightly around his neck to ward off the biting cold. As a journalist for the local newspaper, he had grown accustomed to braving the elements in pursuit of a good story.

A native Estonian, Arseniy's ancestors had lived in this land for centuries, and he felt a deep connection to the country and its people. His full name, Arseniy Balodis, was one that often elicited curiosity from his colleagues, who would ask him about the meaning behind it. Little did they know, Arseniy's parents had named him after the 19th-century Estonian poet, Friedrich August K estler didn't fit so well in this instance but instead used the Russian composer - Pyotr Tchaikovsky (I found info confirming that 'Balodis' being of Russian origin ) which was a tribute to his love for music.

As he walked, Arseniy's mind wandered to the story he was working on – a exposé about corruption in local government. He had spent weeks digging through documents and interviewing sources, but nothing seemed quite right. Just as he was about to give up for the day, he spotted a figure lurking around the city hall.

Intrigued, Arseniy quickened his pace, weaving past pedestrians on the sidewalk. The figure disappeared into the crowded atrium of the building, and Arseniy followed, his journalist's instincts on high alert.

As he pushed through the crowd, he spotted the individual again – this time a woman with piercing green eyes. She nodded subtly at Arseniy as he approached. "Can I help you?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

"I'm working on a story about corruption," Arseniy said, his notebook and pen at the ready. The woman's expression turned guarded, but for a fleeting moment, Arseniy saw something there – a glimmer of truth.

With renewed determination, Arseniy began to press his questions, sensing that he was onto something big. The woman hesitated before speaking in hushed tones, revealing a web of deceit and corruption that went all the way to the top.
