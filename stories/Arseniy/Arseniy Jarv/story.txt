Arseniy Ivanovich Jarv was a man with a mysterious past. His eyes seemed to hold a thousand secrets, and his smile could charm the birds from the trees. He walked into the dimly lit bar, his black leather jacket slung over his broad shoulders, and made his way to the counter.

The bartender, a gruff old man named Grigori, looked him up and down before nodding in greeting. "Arseniy Ivanovich, what can I get you tonight?" he asked, his voice dripping with familiarity.

Arseniy slid onto a stool, his eyes scanning the room as if searching for someone. He ordered a whiskey on the rocks, and Grigori expertly mixed it without breaking stride.

As he sipped his drink, Arseniy's gaze settled on a young woman sitting alone at a table near the window. She looked lost in thought, her hair falling around her face like a curtain of dark silk. He felt a sudden urge to approach her, to reach out and touch the fragile skin of her cheek.

But something held him back. Perhaps it was the fear of rejection, or maybe he simply didn't want to get tangled up in another person's drama. Whatever the reason, Arseniy remained seated, nursing his drink as the night wore on.

As the hours ticked by, the bar grew quieter, and the patrons began to disappear one by one. Grigori leaned over the counter, wiping down the surface with a dirty rag. "You're not like most people, Arseniy," he said, his voice low and conspiratorial. "You've got a story hidden behind those eyes of yours."

Arseniy raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. "What makes you say that?" he asked, his voice smooth as silk.

Grigori smiled, a sly glint in his eye. "Let's just say I've known you for a long time, Arseniy Ivanovich Jarv. And I think I know more about your past than you do yourself."

Arseniy snorted, but a hint of curiosity lingered at the edge of his expression. He finished his drink, tossed a few rubles on the counter, and stood up to leave. As he walked out into the cool night air, he couldn't shake the feeling that Grigori had scratched open a wound that would take a long time to heal.
