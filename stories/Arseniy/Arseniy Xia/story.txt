Arseniy Xia was a man shrouded in mystery. His enigmatic presence seemed to draw people in, only to repel them with an air of detachment. A former KGB operative turned freelance investigator, he had built a reputation for himself as a master of the dark arts.

It started with a simple job: find out what happened to a wealthy businessman who had gone missing in Moscow. Arseniy took the case, and after weeks of digging, uncovered a web of deceit that went all the way to the top of the Russian government. He exposed the truth, and the businessman's family was able to get closure.

Word of his skills spread quickly, and soon Arseniy was fielding offers from all over the world. From high-society couples seeking answers about their missing spouses, to corporations wanting to uncover corporate espionage, he took them all on.

But with each new case came a sense of unease. There were those who seemed to be following him, always lurking just out of sight. Arseniy had grown accustomed to living off the grid, using encrypted comms and burner phones to stay one step ahead of his adversaries.

One night, as he was sipping whiskey in a dingy bar on the outskirts of town, a woman walked in, her eyes scanning the room before locking onto him. She slid into the stool beside him, ordering a vodka on the rocks. "You're Arseniy Xia," she said, without introduction.

He nodded, and she pulled out a small notebook from her purse, flipping through its pages until stopping at a sketch of himself. "We've been watching you," she said. "Your skills are... impressive. But we think it's time someone took you in."

Arseniy raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. Who were these people? And what did they want from him? As he looked into her eyes, he saw a glimmer of something there that made his instincts sit up and take notice.

"Tell me more," he said, downing the rest of his drink in one gulp.

The woman smiled, and for the first time in years, Arseniy felt like he might be in this for the long haul.
