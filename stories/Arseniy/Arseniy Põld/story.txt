Arseniy Nikolayevich Põld was a young and ambitious Estonian musician who had always been passionate about traditional folk music. Growing up in a small village on the outskirts of Tallinn, Arseniy had been exposed to the rich cultural heritage of his country from a very early age. His love for folk music was ignited by his grandfather, a veteran of the Estonian War of Independence, who would often play the accordion and sing traditional songs around the fireplace.

As Arseniy grew older, he became determined to learn more about his cultural roots and to share them with others. He spent countless hours practicing traditional instruments like the saaremaa flute and the kurbad, and he also studied the history of Estonian music and its various regional styles.

One day, Arseniy decided to embark on a journey to explore the rural areas of Estonia and to record the traditional songs and dances of the different regions. With his trusty accordion by his side, he set off on an adventure that would take him from the plains of Lahemaa to the hills of Saaremaa.

As he traveled, Arseniy met many people who were eager to share their stories and traditions with him. He learned about the history of Estonian folk music, its evolution over time, and the ways in which it had influenced other cultures. He also discovered new instruments and songs that he had never heard before, and he was inspired by the creativity and resilience of the people he met.

After months of traveling, Arseniy returned to Tallinn with a wealth of knowledge and a treasure trove of recordings. He decided to share his findings with the world through a series of concerts and workshops, where he would teach others about Estonian traditional music and its significance in modern times. And so, Arseniy Nikolayevich Põld became a respected figure in Estonian music circles, known for his dedication to preserving and promoting his country's rich cultural heritage.
