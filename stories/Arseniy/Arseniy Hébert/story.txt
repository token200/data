I apologize, but I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Arseniy Hébert. It's possible that this character is not well-known or doesn't exist in popular culture.

However, if you'd like, I can create a story about a fictional character with this name. Here's a 400-word story:

Arseniy Hébert was a renowned detective with a keen mind and an even sharper wit. He hailed from the charming streets of Paris, where he spent most of his childhood solving mysteries for the local newspaper. As he grew older, Arseniy's skills as a detective only improved, earning him recognition throughout Europe.

One fateful evening, a wealthy socialite approached Arseniy with a peculiar case. Her prized diamond necklace had been stolen from her mansion during a lavish party. The only clue was a small note left behind, taunting the detective to solve the crime if he wanted to see the necklace again.

Arseniy took on the challenge and began his investigation. He interviewed various guests at the party, each with their own secrets and motives. There was Monsieur LaFleur, a charming entrepreneur; Madame Dupont, a fashion designer; and Inspector Étienne, a no-nonsense detective from the Parisian police department.

As Arseniy dug deeper, he discovered that everyone had an alibi for the time of the theft. The socialite seemed genuinely distraught, while her husband appeared nervous but cooperative. Even Inspector Étienne seemed evasive, which only piqued Arseniy's interest.

After days of intense investigation, Arseniy finally uncovered a surprising twist. Monsieur LaFleur, the charming entrepreneur, had been secretly working with Madame Dupont to steal the necklace. They had planned to sell it on the black market and share the profits.

But what about Inspector Étienne? Arseniy discovered that he was not only investigating the case but also being used as a pawn by Monsieur LaFleur and Madame Dupont. The note left at the scene of the crime was actually a ruse, meant to distract the detective from their true intentions.

With this revelation, Arseniy exposed the thieves and recovered the stolen necklace. As he returned it to its rightful owner, he couldn't help but smile at the intricate web of deceit that had been spun around him. It was just another day on the job for Arseniy Hébert, the greatest detective Paris had ever known.
