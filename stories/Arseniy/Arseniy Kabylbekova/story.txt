As Arseniy Kabylbekova stepped into his workspace, the scent of freshly cut wood and paint wafted through the air. He began to work on his latest piece, a large-scale sculpture of a tree with twisted metal branches that seemed to writhe like living vines.

His art was never simply about aesthetics; it was about challenging perceptions and sparking conversations that lingered long after the last brushstroke had been applied.
