A Michelin-starred chef with a penchant for experimentation, he had gained a reputation for pushing the boundaries of flavor and technique.

As he began planning the menu, Arseniy turned to his trusted sous chef, Natalia, for input. Together, they decided to create a seven-course tasting menu that would highlight traditional Russian ingredients in innovative ways. The dishes included a chilled borscht soup shooter, served with a dollop of crème fraîche and a sprinkle of edible gold dust; a pan-seared sturgeon fillet with a quail egg yolk sauce; and a rich beef stroganoff, served with a side of truffled mashed potatoes.
