I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Arseniy Errani. If you would like, I can help create a character profile for this name and then write a short story based on that profile.

Here's a possible character profile for Arseniy Errani:

Name: Arseniy Errani
Age: Late 20s/Early 30s
Occupation: Former KGB Agent turned Private Investigator

Background: Born in Moscow, Russia, Arseniy Errani grew up in a family of modest means. He was always drawn to the world of espionage and intelligence gathering, much to his parents' dismay. After completing his education, he joined the KGB, where he spent over a decade working undercover and conducting high-stakes missions.

Eventually, Errani became disillusioned with the KGB's tactics and morals, and he defected to the West. He settled in Berlin, Germany, where he began working as a private investigator, using his skills to help those in need.

Personality: Arseniy is a complex and brooding individual, haunted by his past mistakes and struggling to find redemption. Despite this, he has a strong sense of justice and will go to great lengths to protect those he cares about.

Physical Description: Tall, dark-haired, and piercing-eyed, Errani exudes an aura of quiet confidence. He is always impeccably dressed, favoring tailored suits and crisp white shirts that reflect his former life as a spy.

Now, here's a short story based on this character profile:
