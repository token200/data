Arseniy Kozłowski was a man with a reputation for being untrustworthy. His past was shrouded in mystery, and his name was whispered in hushed tones among the people of Kraków's underbelly.

Rumors swirled about Arseniy's involvement in various illicit activities - from smuggling contraband to extorting protection money from local businesses. Some claimed he had ties to organized crime syndicates, while others believed he was a rogue agent working against his own government.

Despite the whispers and suspicions, few people knew much about Arseniy himself. He was a lean, imposing figure with piercing blue eyes that seemed to bore into those he met. His dark hair was often slicked back, revealing a prominent widow's peak that added to his air of enigma.

One fateful evening, as the sun dipped behind the Vistula River, Arseniy found himself in a seedy bar on the outskirts of town. The patrons were a mix of shady characters and desperate souls, all drawn together by some shared secret or desperation.
