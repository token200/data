Freddie Andersen stepped off the plane in Copenhagen, Denmark, feeling like a kid on Christmas morning. He had just been traded to his childhood favorite team, the Denmark national hockey team, and he couldn't wait to get started.

As he made his way through customs, Freddie's mind wandered back to his childhood days spent watching NHL games with his father. Growing up in Minnesota, Freddie had always dreamed of playing for the Golden Knights, but life had taken him down a different path. A string of injuries had derailed his chances at making the team, and he found himself stuck in the minor leagues.

But now, thanks to a surprise trade from his current team, the Arizona Coyotes, Freddie was given a second chance. And what a chance it was – playing for the country where hockey was king, with a team that had won the World Cup just a few years prior.

As he made his way through the airport, Freddie was greeted by the team's captain, Jonas Holøs. The two exchanged hugs and words of encouragement before making their way to the bus that would take them to their next destination: training camp.

The days that followed were a whirlwind of physical training, on-ice sessions, and team meetings. Freddie threw himself into every practice, determined to prove himself as more than just a backup goalie. He had always prided himself on his quick reflexes and sharp instincts, but he knew that in the NHL, you needed more than just talent – you needed experience.

As the days turned into weeks, Freddie began to feel like he was finally finding his groove. The drills felt easier, the saves came more naturally, and the conversations with his teammates grew more comfortable. It was as if he had been playing for the team all along.

One evening, after a particularly grueling practice, Freddie made his way to the hotel room where he shared a suite with teammate Andreas Martinsen. As they settled in for some dinner and rest before the next day's games, Freddie couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude towards the people who had believed in him when no one else would.

"I'm so glad I got traded," Freddie said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Andreas nodded in agreement, passing Freddie a plate of cold cuts. "I thought you were done for, mate."

Freddie smiled wryly. "Just like that."

The two sat in silence for a moment before Martinsen spoke up again. "You know, we've got some big games coming up. We could use you in the net."

Freddie's eyes lit up with excitement as he realized what this meant – not just playing in a game or two, but taking on a crucial role that would determine the outcome of the season.

With renewed purpose and energy, Freddie dove into the next day's practice, ready to prove himself once and for all.
