Henry Fournier was a man with a passion for history and architecture. As a renowned architectural historian, he had spent years studying the grand structures of Europe and beyond. His love affair with the past had taken him to the most forgotten corners of the world, where he uncovered hidden gems and shedding new light on bygone eras.

Henry Fournier's latest obsession was the medieval town of Annecy in the French Alps. He had spent countless hours pouring over dusty texts and scouring local archives for any mention of this enigmatic place. His search had finally paid off when he stumbled upon an ancient manuscript detailing the construction of the town's iconic Château d'Annecy.

As Henry Fournier delved deeper into his research, he became increasingly convinced that the Château held secrets to the town's mysterious past. He spent countless nights poring over the manuscript, taking meticulous notes and making detailed sketches. His colleagues began to take notice of his tireless work ethic and the depth of his knowledge.

One fateful evening, as Henry Fournier was leaving the local library, he stumbled upon a cryptic message scrawled on the wall - "Meet me at the Château at midnight". The hairs on the back of his neck stood on end as he felt an inexplicable shiver run down his spine. Who could have written this message? And what did they want with Henry Fournier and the Château d'Annecy?

Henry Fournier's curiosity was piqued, and he couldn't resist the urge to investigate further. He made his way back to the library, determined to uncover more about the mysterious message. As the clock struck midnight, Henry Fournier arrived at the Château, ready to face whatever lay ahead.

As he stepped inside the grand halls of the Château, a figure emerged from the shadows - an elderly man with piercing blue eyes and a knowing smile. "Ah, Henry Fournier," the old man said, his voice dripping with mystery. "I've been waiting for you."
