It was a typical Wednesday evening in Buenos Aires, and the dimly lit café on Calle Florida was abuzz with intellectuals. Among them was a peculiar individual - Henry Luis Borges, renowned author and metaphysician. His piercing eyes darted between his companions as he conversed with ease about philosophy, literature, and the intricacies of time.

As he sipped his tangerine-flavored tea, Borges pondered the notion of infinite labyrinths and parallel universes. "What if I were to traverse one such labyrinth," he mused aloud, "and arrive at a corner identical to another? Would I be entering a duplicate universe or merely stumbling upon an alternate facet of reality?"

His companions exchanged perplexed glances, accustomed as they were to Borges' abstract musings. Dr. Antonio Caviglia, the philosopher, chimed in with a thought-provoking question: "Perhaps, Henry, you'd find yourself navigating an identical labyrinth within a mirrored reflection. The notion blurs further when considering the infinite regressions of our own minds."

Borges chuckled as he stroked his unruly beard, "Ah, but that's where the true conundrum lies - can we truly distinguish between thought and reality? Do the mirrors in which I reflect my soul contain a separate me, identical yet distinct?"

As the night wore on, Borges led the group through an existential labyrinth of their own making. Conversations danced among notions of eternity, infinity, and the fleeting nature of human experience.

Suddenly, as if conjured by his thoughts, a bespectacled young man with an air of curiosity slipped into the café. He introduced himself as Ricardo, a student researching the connections between Borges' literary work and the theories of Immanuel Kant. As they conversed, it became clear that Ricardo was drawn to the enigmatic author's ability to merge philosophical concepts with poetic language.

In this moment, Borges revealed an essence to Ricardo - "Writing is not merely a product of one's own mind but also an extension of its labyrinthine possibilities." With those words, he handed Ricardo an unseen manuscript page, blank except for a tantalizing phrase: "The infinite and the infinitesimal are only distant mirrors reflecting one another."

And with that cryptic message, the gathering dispersed as individuals, each carrying their own distinct mirror, lost within an infinite expanse of possibility.
