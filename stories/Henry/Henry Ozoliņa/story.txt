Henry Ozoliņa was a man with a passion for music that bordered on obsession. As a child, he spent hours listening to vinyl records in his parents' cramped living room, mesmerized by the melodies and harmonies that filled the air. His parents, both Latvian immigrants, had brought their love of folk music with them from home, and Henry was fascinated by the stories and traditions behind every song.

As he grew older, Henry's interest in music only deepened. He began to teach himself how to play the guitar, spending hours each day practicing until his fingers bled and his hands ached. His parents encouraged him, recognizing the joy that music brought him, and soon they were all playing together as a family.

Henry Ozoliņa's love of folk music led him to study classical guitar at university, where he honed his skills and developed his unique style. After graduating, he began performing locally, playing at weddings and festivals and eventually landing a few gigs at larger venues.

But it wasn't until he stumbled upon an old record player in a thrift store that Henry Ozoliņa's true passion project was born. He spent hours scouring the shelves for rare and obscure records, always on the lookout for something that would inspire his music. And then, one day, he found it: a dusty old 78 rpm of traditional Latvian folk songs.

Enthralled by the sounds and stories behind the music, Henry Ozoliņa spent months transcribing the melodies and harmonies into his own compositions. He wrote songs that captured the spirit of his ancestors' homeland, using language and imagery to evoke the rugged beauty of Latvia's landscapes. The result was a unique blend of traditional folk and modern rock, with lyrics that sang of love, loss, and identity.

For Henry Ozoliņa, music was more than just a hobby or a career – it was a way of connecting with his roots and expressing himself to the world. And as he took the stage, guitar in hand, he knew that he had found his true calling.
