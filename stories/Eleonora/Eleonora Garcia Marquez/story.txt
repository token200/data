Eleonora Garcia Marquez was known for her fierce determination and unwavering passion for social justice. As a young lawyer, she had dedicated her career to fighting for the rights of marginalized communities, often finding herself in the face of adversity.

Growing up on the streets of Miami's Little Havana, Eleonora had seen firsthand the struggles faced by many Latinx families who were constantly overlooked and underrepresented.
