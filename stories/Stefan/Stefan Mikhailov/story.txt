Stefan Mikhailov, a former KGB agent turned independent operative, sat at the dimly lit café on the outskirts of Berlin. His piercing green eyes scanned the room, taking in every detail as he nursed a cup of cold black coffee.

It had been five years since Stefan left the Soviet Union, driven by a growing disillusionment with the regime's atrocities and his own complicity in its crimes. He had used his skills to gather intel on high-ranking officials, exposing corruption and manipulation from within. The KGB had not taken kindly to his betrayal, and he had been forced to flee.

Now, Stefan worked for himself, taking on clandestine missions that allowed him to use his talents without allegiance to any government. His latest client was a wealthy businessman seeking information on a rival company's plans to dominate the European market.

As Stefan listened to the businessman's concerns, he noticed a familiar face across the room – a woman with piercing blue eyes and short, spiky black hair. It was Natalia, an old flame from his KGB days. She had been recruited by a rival agency, one that aligned with his values but operated outside the bounds of official sanction.

Stefan's instincts told him to be wary of Natalia's presence. He signaled to her, and she made her way over, her eyes locked on his.

"What brings you here, Stefan?" she asked, her voice husky and confident.

"I'm working a job," he replied, his tone neutral. "You're not exactly known for your impartiality."

Natalia smiled, a mischievous glint in her eye. "I've seen better days, Stefan. I'm working on a mission that requires...let's say, our unique set of skills."

Stefan raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. He knew that Natalia was willing to push boundaries and break rules when it suited her.

"What kind of mission?" he asked, his curiosity piqued.

Natalia leaned in close, her voice barely above a whisper. "I have intel on a rogue agent within the EU's intelligence community. Someone who's been manipulating events from behind the scenes."

Stefan's eyes narrowed. This was exactly the kind of information he needed to take down his rival company and gain an edge.

"Tell me more," he said, his voice firm.

Natalia handed him a small folder containing her findings. Stefan scanned its contents, his mind racing with possibilities.

This could be it – his chance to take revenge on those who had wronged him, while also advancing his own interests.

He nodded at Natalia, a silent agreement formed between them.

Their partnership was sealed, and the game was on.
