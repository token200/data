As the founder of his own consulting firm, Bak's services were in high demand by top-tier corporations and government agencies looking to stay one step ahead of their cyber threats. But despite his success, Stefan Bak remained a recluse, preferring to keep to himself and avoiding the spotlight whenever possible.

One night, Bak received a cryptic message from an unknown sender, inviting him to take on what promised to be the ultimate challenge.
