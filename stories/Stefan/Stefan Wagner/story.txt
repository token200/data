Born on a chilly winter night in 1992, Stefan grew up surrounded by music. His parents, both avid music lovers, would often take him to concerts and festivals, introducing him to an array of genres. As he entered his teenage years, Stefan discovered his true passion for indie rock, drawing inspiration from bands like The National and Arcade Fire.
