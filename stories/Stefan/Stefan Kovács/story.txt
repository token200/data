Stefan Kovács stepped out of the cold night air and into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of the woman he had been searching for. It was a habit he had developed over the years – always being prepared, always watching.

He had heard that she would be here tonight, at this small, forgotten corner of Vienna. The whispers had spread like wildfire through the underworld, and Stefan had finally tracked her down.

As he waited, sipping his coffee and observing the patrons, a figure caught his eye. She was sitting in the back, her dark hair pulled up into a tight bun, her eyes fixed intently on some point beyond the window. Stefan's heart quickened as he recognized the faint flicker of desperation emanating from her.

He made his way to her table, his movements fluid and deliberate. As he approached, she looked up, her eyes locking onto his with an intensity that sent a shiver down his spine.

"Stefan Kovács," she whispered, her voice husky with emotion.

"The one and only," Stefan replied, taking a seat across from her. "I've been looking for you."

The woman – Sofia, he had learned – looked at him with a mix of fear and defiance. She knew that she was in danger, that Stefan's reputation preceded him.

"What do you want?" Sofia spat, her eyes flashing with anger.

Stefan leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers together as he regarded her. "I want to know what happened," he said quietly. "The night you left. The reasons behind your flight."

Sofia's gaze dropped, her shoulders sagging under the weight of her secrets. Stefan knew that look – it was a familiar one from their past encounters.

"I didn't leave because I was running from something," Sofia said finally, her voice barely above a whisper. "I left because I had to get away."

Stefan raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "What is it that you had to escape?"

Sofia's eyes flashed with fear once more before she spoke the words Stefan knew he would hear.

"It's him," Sofia spat, her eyes flashing towards the door as if expecting some unseen enemy to burst in at any moment. "The one who's been following me for years."

Stefan's face hardened into a mask of stone. He had heard rumors – whispers that someone was tracking Sofia, that she was being hunted.

But Stefan knew better than anyone how to track and hunt. And he would do whatever it took to keep her safe.

"I'll take care of him," Stefan promised, his voice steady and reassuring.

Sofia's eyes searched his face, searching for reassurance in the depths of his gaze. She saw something there – a spark of determination, a glimmer of protection – and for that moment, she knew that she was not alone.

Together, they sipped their coffee, watching the shadows dance across the walls as Stefan began to weave a web of intrigue and deception, determined to keep Sofia safe from those who sought to destroy her.
