Upon arrival, he found himself face-to-face with an unlikely ally - a brilliant hacker known only by her handle, 'Zero Cool'. Together, they formed an uneasy partnership, united in their quest for wealth and notoriety. As the night wore on, Stefan Valja discovered that the score was far more complicated than initially thought, involving intricate puzzles, hidden passcodes, and encrypted files.
