Levente Nurlanov was a young and ambitious journalist who had just arrived in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Born in the small town of Karakol, Levente had always been fascinated by the world beyond his mountainous home. He spent countless hours reading about history, politics, and culture, and it was only natural that he would become a journalist.

Over the next few weeks, Levente found himself drawn back to the café again and again, eager to learn more about the history of his adopted city.
