Levente Angert was a recluse who lived on the outskirts of Budapest. Few people knew his true identity, and even fewer had ever laid eyes on him. The locals whispered that he was a former scientist, driven mad by his own experiments gone wrong.

As it turned out, Levente Angert's past was shrouded in mystery. He had indeed been a brilliant mind, working tirelessly in the fields of genetic engineering and biotechnology. However, his obsession with unlocking the secrets of life eventually consumed him.

People began to notice strange occurrences around town. Equipment would malfunction, plants would wither and die, and some even reported seeing shadowy figures lurking around the forest. The locals knew that something was amiss, but no one suspected Levente Angert's involvement.

One stormy night, a young journalist named Szab贸 decided to investigate the rumors surrounding the reclusive scientist. She tracked him down to an abandoned laboratory on the outskirts of town, where she found Levente Angert huddled in the corner of his makeshift bunker.

Szab贸 approached cautiously, unsure what she would find. As she entered the lab, she was met with a sight that defied explanation. Rows upon rows of test tubes and Petri dishes lined the shelves, containing a plethora of bizarre organisms and mutated creatures.

Levente Angert looked up from his work, his eyes bloodshot and wild. "I've been trying to create life," he muttered, his voice barely audible over the howling wind outside.

Szab贸 was taken aback by the scientist's ramblings. She asked him what had driven him to such extremes, but Levente Angert just shook his head and continued working.

As Szab贸 turned to leave, she caught a glimpse of something peculiar on one of the shelves - a small vial containing a glowing liquid. The label read "Project Erebus" in bold letters. It seemed that Levente Angert's obsession with life was far from over.
