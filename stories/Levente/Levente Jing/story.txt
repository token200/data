Levente Jing stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. She had been traveling for hours, and the exhaustion was starting to wear thin. As she made her way through the crowded corridors, Levente Jing's thoughts turned to the reason behind her journey - a chance encounter with an old friend.

It had been years since Levente Jing last set foot in the city, and much had changed since then. She had built a new life for herself, one that was far removed from the turbulent past she had left behind. But a message from her childhood best friend, Sofia, had stirred up long-dormant emotions and compelled Levente Jing to return.

As she emerged onto the streets, the warm sunlight caught her off guard, and she squinted against its intensity. Levente Jing hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address Sofia had provided. The ride was short but felt like an eternity, as she wrestled with memories that had long been buried.

When the taxi finally pulled up outside Sofia's apartment building, Levente Jing took a deep breath and stepped out onto the sidewalk. She hadn't seen Sofia in years, not since they'd parted ways after high school. The pain of their separation still lingered, but she was determined to lay it to rest this time.

Sofia answered her knock with a radiant smile that quickly faltered as she took in Levente Jing's worn expression. "Levente...it's been so long," Sofia said, ushering her inside.

The two women spent the next few hours catching up on lost time, reminiscing about old times and sharing stories of their new lives. As they laughed and reminisced, Levente Jing felt a weight lifting off her shoulders - perhaps it was time to finally let go of the past.
