His menu featured innovative dishes such as "Ceviche de Marlin" and "Duck Empanada," which quickly gained a cult following among foodies.

His dedication earned him the coveted title of "Green Chef" in Montreal, cementing his reputation as a culinary leader.

Despite his international recognition, Andrés remained true to his roots. He often incorporated traditional Argentine flavors into his dishes, much to the delight of his customers. One evening, he even invited friends and family from Argentina to join him for a special dinner party, where they feasted on empanadas, asado, and other classic Argentine dishes.
