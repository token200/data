Andrés Sariñana sat on the edge of his bed, staring blankly at the worn wooden floorboards beneath him. It was a habit he'd developed over years, one that brought him solace in times of turmoil. As he gazed down, his mind began to wander.

He thought about the day his family's farm had been taken by the government. The way his parents had fought for every acre, every head of livestock, only to see it all stripped away without a fight. The pain and anger still lingered within him, fueling a fire that burned bright in his heart.

Andrés' eyes drifted upward, tracing the lines etched on his face like the topography of a worn map. His features told stories of their own – the sharp jawline, the dark circles beneath his sunken eyes, and the faint scar above his left eyebrow, which he'd gotten during a scuffle with some boys from a neighboring village when he was just a teenager.

He thought about his childhood, spent playing in the fields alongside his siblings, laughing until their bellies ached. His parents had worked tirelessly to build a life, but the economic instability had always hung over them like a shadow. Andrés remembered the countless nights they'd huddled around the radio, listening to news reports of protests and government crackdowns, feeling like they were living in a war zone.

As he sat there, lost in thought, a faint memory began to resurface – one that made his chest constrict with emotion. His abuela had taken him on walks through the surrounding countryside when he was just a boy. She'd pointed out the constellations, teaching him how to identify the different patterns and myths associated with them.

Andrés' eyes welled up as he recalled the last time he'd seen her. He must have been around 12 years old. His abuela had passed away suddenly, leaving behind a void that still felt like an open wound. The pain of losing her had only intensified over the years, fueling his desire for justice.

He rose from the bed, his joints stiff from the long hours spent sitting. Andrés knew he couldn't change the past, but he was determined to leave his mark on the present and future. He took a deep breath, feeling the cool night air fill his lungs, and began to make his way toward the door.

The next steps in his journey were uncertain, but Andrés was ready to face whatever lay ahead. With each step forward, he felt his resolve growing stronger – fueled by the love of his family, the anger of the oppressed, and the guidance of those who had come before him.
