Andrés Lafourcade sat alone at his desk, staring blankly at the scribbled pages in front of him. A renowned poet and novelist, he had always found solace in the written word, but lately, it seemed like an endless well of dry wells.

As a young man, Andrés had been consumed by the world of words. He devoured books by Borges and García Márquez, spent hours scribbling lines on scraps of paper, and dreamt of publishing his own masterpiece. And then, one day, it happened – his first novel was published to critical acclaim.

But since then, Andrés had found himself stuck in a rut. His words seemed shallow, his characters flat. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was repeating himself, that there was something more just out of reach.

As he sat at his desk, the sun streamed through the window, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air. Andrés felt like he was trapped in a perpetual twilight, unable to find his way back into the bright world of words.

Just then, his phone rang. It was his best friend, Luis. "Hey, Andrés, how's it going?" Luis asked, his voice warm and familiar.

Andrés sighed. "I don't know, Luis. I feel like I've lost my way."

"I know what you mean," Luis said. "Sometimes I think we get so caught up in trying to be something that we forget who we are."

Andrés thought about this for a moment. Was it true? Had he lost his way?

"Thanks, Luis," Andrés said finally. "I needed to hear that."

The two of them talked for hours, reminiscing about old times and sharing stories about their latest writing projects. As the sun began to set, Andrés felt a spark ignite within him.

"I think I need to take a break," he said to Luis.

"Do it," Luis replied. "You can't force creativity, Andrés. Sometimes you just have to let it happen."

Andrés nodded, even though Luis couldn't see him. He got up from his chair and walked away from the desk, leaving the words unspoken on the page.

As he wandered through the city, Andrés felt a sense of freedom that he hadn't experienced in months. The world was vast and full of possibilities – maybe it was time to explore them again.

Andrés returned home that night with a newfound sense of purpose. He sat at his desk once more, but this time, the words flowed easily.
