Andrés Faust sat alone at the worn wooden table, staring at the whiskey glass in front of him. The dim light of the small café seemed to reflect off the condensation on the glass, creating a miniature world of its own. He took a sip, feeling the familiar burn as it descended down his throat.

It had been five years since he'd left the university, after being expelled for "excessive questioning of authority." The story went that he'd asked too many uncomfortable questions about the true nature of reality and the human condition. Some said he was searching for answers to questions nobody else dared to ask.

Faust sipped his drink again, lost in thought. He often found himself pondering the meaning of life, much like the existentialist philosophers he'd studied as a student. Yet, unlike them, he didn't seem content to simply ponder – he had to dig deeper.

He'd been on the move ever since, seeking out the truth wherever it might be found. Some said he was on a quest for spiritual enlightenment; others whispered that he was searching for something more sinister. Faust didn't know what his own motivations were anymore – not even to himself.

A soft knock at the door broke the spell. The waitress, an old woman with a kind face, slid into the seat across from him. "You again, Andrés?" she asked, her voice low and familiar.

He nodded, taking another sip of his whiskey.

"I brought you something," she said, sliding a small package across the table. Inside was a thin notebook and a pen. "A friend thinks you might find it... enlightening."

Faust took the notebook, flipping through its pages to reveal the scribbles of an unknown author. The writing spoke of darkness and light, of life and death. As he read on, something in him stirred – not quite excitement, nor exactly fear. More like a resonance.

He looked up at the waitress, his eyes searching for answers that never came. "Who is it?" he asked, but she just smiled and patted his hand before disappearing into the night.

Andrés Faust was left alone once more, surrounded by the shadows of the café, with only his whiskey-stained notebook as a companion on his endless quest for truth.
