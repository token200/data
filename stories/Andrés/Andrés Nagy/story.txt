The response was immediate and overwhelming. The media coverage sparked outrage and calls for accountability, and soon Andrés' name was on everyone's lips. He had done it again, using his talent and determination to bring justice to those who had been wronged.

As he accepted an award for his reporting, Andrés Eduardo Nagy couldn't help but think back to the countless hours of research and investigation that had led to this moment.
