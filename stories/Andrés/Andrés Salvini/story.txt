Andrés Salvini's eyes locked onto the worn stone facade, his mind racing with the weight of his past. A seasoned detective, he had seen it all - the worst of humanity, the darkest corners of the human psyche. But nothing could have prepared him for this.

A knock at the door broke the silence, and Andrés reluctantly made his way to answer it. His partner, Sofia, stood in the entrance, her expression grim.

"What've we got?" Andrés asked, already knowing.

"Sabotage," she replied. "The mayor's office was vandalized last night. Whoever did this wants us to find out who."

Andrés nodded, his eyes never leaving the face of their suspect, Lucrecia - a quiet, reserved woman with an unnerving habit of watching everyone around her. He'd interviewed her before; she had an air of innocence that grated on him.

As they delved deeper into the case, Andrés found himself lost in thought. A child prodigy who never quite found his place, Lucrecia's history was riddled with unexplained gaps and half-truths. And yet, he couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more to her story than met the eye.

As they questioned Lucrecia further, Andrés caught glimpses of something in her gaze - a flicker of desperation, a spark of defiance. He sensed that beneath her stoic exterior lay a life shrouded in secrets and fear.

One night, as he poured over the case files in his cluttered office, Andrés stumbled upon an article from Lucrecia's childhood, detailing her time in an orphanage where she'd been subjected to brutal physical and emotional abuse. The words seemed to leap off the page, echoing a phrase that Lucrecia herself had uttered during their interrogation: "I was just trying to survive."

In that moment, Andrés realized that his preconceptions about Lucrecia were nothing but a facade - a shield she'd built to protect herself from a world that didn't want her. The once-skeptical detective now saw the truth behind Lucrecia's eyes, and it shook him to his core.

Their latest case had taken an unexpected turn; Andrés couldn't help but wonder what lay hidden beneath the surface of this quiet woman, waiting to be uncovered.
