Andrés Ayumi had always been a free spirit, never content to follow the crowd or conform to societal norms. As a child, she would spend hours exploring the woods behind her house, collecting leaves and pinecones, and dreaming of adventures beyond her small town.

As she grew older, Andrés' love of nature only deepened, and she began to study botany in college. She spent countless hours in the greenhouse, surrounded by plants and soil, feeling a sense of peace and contentment that eluded her in other areas of her life.

Despite her passion for botany, Andrés found herself at odds with the academic world. Her instructors would often dismiss her ideas as "frivolous" or "unscientific," and she began to feel like an outsider among her peers.

One day, while working in the greenhouse, Andrés received a visit from her estranged grandmother, Abuela Lucía. Abuela Lucía was a wise and kind woman who had always known Andrés' love of nature, but had never encouraged it. Instead, she had urged Andrés to pursue a more "respectable" career, one that would bring her financial stability and social respectability.

But Abuela Lucía's visit was not just a social call. She had brought with her a small, delicate seedling, passed down through generations of their family. It was a rare species, one that only bloomed once a decade under the light of a full moon. Andrés' heart swelled as she gazed upon the tiny plant, feeling a sense of connection to her heritage and her own desires.

Abuela Lucía smiled at Andrés, her eyes shining with understanding. "You've always been a wildflower, m'ija," she said. "Don't let anyone tell you otherwise." And in that moment, Andrés knew exactly what she wanted to do with her life: to cultivate the beauty and wonder of the natural world, and share it with others.

As Abuela Lucía prepared to leave, Andrés felt a sense of gratitude wash over her. She thanked her grandmother for visiting, and for giving her the gift of self-discovery. And as she watched Abuela Lucía disappear into the trees, Andrés Ayumi knew that she would never be the same again.
