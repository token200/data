Andrés Green was a man with a mysterious past. He walked into Jack's Tavern, a dimly lit bar on the outskirts of town, and ordered a whiskey without a word. The patrons eyed him warily, accustomed to the shady characters that frequented this dive.

As he waited for his drink, Andrés surveyed the room with an air of quiet confidence. His eyes seemed to bore into those who caught his gaze, as if daring them to look away. His dark hair was slicked back, revealing a sharp jawline and piercing green eyes that sparkled like emeralds in the dim light.

The bartender, a gruff man named Joe, raised an eyebrow at Andrés' arrival. "What brings you here tonight?" he asked, wiping down the counter with a dirty rag.

Andrés took a sip of his whiskey, his expression unreadable. "Just passing through," he said finally, his voice low and smooth as silk.

Joe snorted. "You don't exactly blend in around here, pal. What's your story?"

Andrés' eyes locked onto Joe's, and for a moment, the bartender felt like he was drowning in their depths. Then, without warning, Andrés leaned forward, his voice dropping to a whisper. "I'm a collector," he said, his words sending a shiver down Joe's spine.

The patrons began to edge away, sensing that something more sinister lurked beneath Andrés' charismatic exterior. Jack, the tavern owner, stepped forward, his massive frame towering over Andrés. "What kind of collector?" he asked, his voice firm but wary.

Andrés smiled, a cold, calculating smile. "The things people lose," he said, his eyes glinting with mischief. "Valuables, secrets... the hidden treasures of the human heart."

As Jack watched, Andrés' drink emptied in an instant, and he vanished into the night, leaving behind only a whispered promise: "I'll be back." The patrons breathed a collective sigh of relief as Jack shook his head, muttering, "You never know what's gonna walk through that door tonight."

Andrés Green was a ghost, a presence felt but rarely seen. Some said he was a thief, others a spy. But one thing was certain: when Andrés Green walked into town, people took notice – and often paid the price for doing business with him.
