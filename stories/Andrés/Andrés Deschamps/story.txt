His drawings were characterized by a level of precision and detail that bordered on obsession. It was this exacting attention to detail that earned him such widespread acclaim.

As Andrés grew older, his work continued to evolve and mature. He began experimenting with new materials and techniques, incorporating elements of abstract expressionism into his charcoal drawings. The result was a body of work that was at once deeply personal and universally relatable.

Throughout his life, Andrés Juan Pedro Deschamps remained true to his artistic vision, refusing to compromise or conform to external expectations. It was this unwavering commitment to his craft that had earned him such enduring recognition and respect from the art world.
