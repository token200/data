Sophia knocked on the door, and after a pause, it swung open to reveal Hartwig Smith himself. His eyes narrowed behind thick glasses, assessing the young intruder before inviting her in. Over steaming cups of coffee, Sophia probed for answers about the artifact, but Hartwig Smith remained characteristically tight-lipped.

As they parted ways, Sophia couldn't shake off the feeling that she had merely scratched the surface of a far more complex enigma. What secrets lay hidden behind those piercing eyes? What drives a man to keep such an air of mystery surrounding him?

As she walked back into the rain-soaked night, Sophia's thoughts returned to Hartwig Smith, whose full name seemed to echo in her mind like a cryptic message: Hartwig Smith, guardian of secrets and keeper of tales.
