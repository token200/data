Hartwig Sepp was an enigmatic figure in the small Austrian village of St. Johann. He was known for his sharp wit and cunning business sense, but also for his somewhat sinister reputation. Sepp owned the local factory that produced the infamous "St. Johann's Splint" – a product so durable it could withstand even the most extreme weather conditions.

Sepp himself rarely ventured into town, preferring to keep to himself at his grand estate on the outskirts of the village. But when he did emerge, locals would notice the peculiar aroma wafting from his direction – an unmistakable blend of wood smoke and engine oil.

One stormy evening, as a bolt of lightning split the darkness, Sepp's factory was engulfed in flames. Panicked villagers fled the scene as fire engines arrived to battle the inferno. Amidst the chaos, one man, Martin Hainzer, a young apprentice at the factory, discovered an unusual document buried beneath his desk drawer.

As the smoke cleared, Sepp stood unscathed beside Martin, an uncanny grin spreading across his face. It became apparent that he had foreseen the fire and deliberately left the documents to be found by someone less... vigilant. The letter detailed a peculiar arrangement: in exchange for immunity from prosecution and a substantial sum of gold, Martin would provide Sepp with the exclusive rights to manufacture his patented Splint design.

Martin was torn between gratitude for the rescue and outrage at being coerced into betraying his craft. As word of the affair spread throughout St. Johann, villagers began to view Sepp in an even more unfavorable light. It seemed that beneath his rough exterior lay a ruthless businessman willing to exploit anyone who stood in his way.

Despite this newfound suspicion, Martin chose to sign the agreement – unable to resist the promise of financial freedom or the sheltered comfort of immunity from prosecution. The following morning, as the village awoke to find Sepp's Splint being mass-produced by Martin himself, it became clear that some wounds run deeper than others.
