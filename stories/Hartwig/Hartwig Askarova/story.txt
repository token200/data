Hartwig Askarova stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar town. The sign above the station read "Kragnir" in faded letters, a place she'd never heard of before. Her mother had written to her from here once, but only briefly, about a distant cousin who needed help with their farm.

Hartwig's own life was far more complicated. She'd left her homeland after being accused of witchcraft, forced to flee under the cover of night. Now, at twenty-five, she found herself in Kragnir, seeking a fresh start.

As she made her way through the streets, Hartwig noticed the townsfolk watching her from afar. They seemed curious, yet wary, their faces a blur of suspicion and distrust. She'd learned to hide her true nature – her wild magic, which often manifested in strange ways, like making flowers bloom with a mere touch.

Hartwig's thoughts turned to the letter she held tightly in her hand. It was from a woman named Aria, who claimed to be an expert in herbalism and botany. The words promised "a new life" and a chance to "learn control" over Hartwig's powers. Desperate for answers, Hartwig had come to Kragnir.

As she walked, the houses grew closer together, their wooden facades adorned with colorful flowers that seemed to lean in, as if sharing secrets. Aria's cottage stood at the end of a winding alley, its door painted with symbols that shimmered like moonlight on water.

Hartwig knocked twice, and the door swung open to reveal Aria – an older woman with eyes that sparkled like gemstones. "Welcome, Hartwig," she said, her voice like a warm breeze. "I've been expecting you."

The air was thick with the scent of dried herbs as Aria led Hartwig into the cottage. There, among shelves filled with jars and potions, the young woman discovered an unusual calm within herself. It was as if, for the first time in years, she'd found someone who truly understood her.

Over steaming cups of tea, Aria listened to Hartwig's stories, nodding knowingly when the girl spoke of her struggles with magic. "You don't need to hide," she said, her voice soft but firm. "Your powers are a gift – one that requires patience, trust, and practice."

For the first time in years, Hartwig felt like herself again – a thread of hope weaving its way through the darkness. In Kragnir, amidst the whispers and doubts, she found a glimmer of light. And with Aria by her side, she knew she could finally learn to harness her wild magic, and find her place in this strange new world.
