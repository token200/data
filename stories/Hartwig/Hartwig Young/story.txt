Hartwig Young stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station as if searching for something. Or someone. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a smell that seemed to cling to him like a shroud.

As he made his way through the deserted streets, Hartwig's thoughts turned to the letter in his pocket. It had arrived just yesterday, postmarked from an address he didn't recognize. The words, penned by an unknown hand, spoke of a place he'd once known but could no longer recall: Ashwood, a name that now seemed to haunt him.

Hartwig's memories were hazy, like a fog that clung to his mind. He recalled fragments of childhood – playing in the woods, listening to the old man's stories – but they seemed distant, unreal. The world around him blurred and shifted, leaving only shadows of a life he couldn't quite grasp.

A figure appeared beside him on the pavement. It was Emily, her eyes wide with concern as she grasped his arm. "Hartwig, what are you doing here?" Her voice was laced with an unspoken question: What had brought him to Ashwood?

"I came to find answers," Hartwig replied, his voice barely above a whisper.

Emily hesitated before leading him toward the old cottage where they'd once spent countless afternoons exploring. The door creaked as Hartwig pushed it open, and a musty smell wafted out. Inside, memories began to stir – whispers of laughter, the scent of baking bread.

But amidst the familiar comforts, something felt off. Hartwig's eyes roved over the room, searching for a clue that would unravel the tangled threads of his past. The air seemed to thicken with an unseen presence, as if the very house itself was watching him.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting Ashwood in an eerie twilight, Hartwig felt the weight of his forgotten life bearing down upon him. He turned to Emily, his eyes locking onto hers in a silent plea for understanding. "What do I need to remember?" he asked, his voice barely audible over the whispering leaves.

Emily's expression softened, her eyes filled with compassion. "You don't have to remember everything, Hartwig. You just need to trust that the memories will come when they're ready."
