Hartwig Zielińska was a man with a passion for life's simple pleasures. A retired librarian from Warsaw, Poland, he spent most of his days tending to his small garden, where he grew all manner of herbs and vegetables that he would use in his beloved cooking. Despite his quiet demeanor, Hartwig had a rich inner world, filled with stories of his childhood and the people who had shaped him into the man he was today.

As he worked in his garden, Hartwig's mind often wandered to his late wife, Elżbieta, who had been his partner in every sense of the word. Together, they had built a life filled with love, laughter, and a deep appreciation for the beauty of everyday things. After Elżbieta passed away, Hartwig found solace in his garden, where he could connect with her memory and find peace.

One sunny afternoon, as Hartwig was pruning his rose bushes, he heard a knock at the door. It was his young neighbor, Jakub, who had come to ask for Hartwig's advice on how to care for his own small garden. Hartwig smiled warmly and welcomed Jakub into his home, offering him a cup of tea and a seat by the fire.

As they chatted, Hartwig began to regale Jakub with stories of Elżbieta's love of gardening and cooking. He told him about the time she had made her famous pierogi ruskie for a gathering of friends, or the way she would always save him a slice of apple pie from her baking. Jakub listened wide-eyed, mesmerized by the warmth and love that radiated from Hartwig's presence.

As the afternoon wore on, Jakub thanked Hartwig for his wisdom and promised to return soon. As he left, Hartwig felt a sense of contentment wash over him. Being around young people like Jakub reminded him that life was still full of beauty and wonder, even in old age. He returned to his garden, feeling grateful for the simple joys that had brought him so much happiness throughout his life. And as he worked, he knew that Elżbieta's spirit was with him, smiling down on him from wherever she might be.
