However, assuming you meant the actress Michelle Rodriguez (also known by her stage name Michelle Saldana), here's a story:

Michelle Rodriguez was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. Growing up, she was always fascinated by acting and performing. She started taking dance classes at a young age and later moved to California to pursue a career in the entertainment industry.

Michelle's breakthrough role came when she was cast as Rita Moreno's daughter, Gabrielle Solis, in the ABC soap opera "General Hospital." Her portrayal of the complex and troubled character earned her a Daytime Emmy Award nomination.

As Michelle grew older, she began to take on more mature roles in films like "Girlfight" and "Shadow of the Wolf." Her performances showcased her range as an actress and solidified her place in Hollywood.

In 2001, Michelle was cast as Nymeria in HBO's hit series "Game of Thrones," playing a key role alongside other talented actors. The show became a global phenomenon, and Michelle's performance earned her widespread critical acclaim.
