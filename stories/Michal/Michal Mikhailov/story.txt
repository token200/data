Michal Mikhailovich was a man with a passion for art and a penchant for mystery. His striking features and piercing green eyes made him stand out in any crowd, but it was his talent that truly set him apart. A painter of unparalleled skill, Michal Mikhailovich's works were sought after by collectors from around the world.

One day, while working on a new piece in his small studio, Michal Mikhailovich received an unexpected visit from a mysterious woman. She introduced herself as Sofia, and claimed to be a representative of a wealthy patron who was eager to commission a work from the renowned artist.

As they sat down to discuss the details of the project, Michal Mikhailovich couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. There was something about Sofia that didn't quite add up, and he found himself wondering if this could be some kind of trap. Nevertheless, his desire for fame and fortune won out, and he agreed to take on the commission.

Over the next few weeks, Michal Mikhailovich worked tirelessly to complete the piece, pouring all of his energy into creating something truly exceptional. As he worked, Sofia would periodically drop by to offer guidance and encouragement, but Michal Mikhailovich began to feel like he was losing control of the project.

Finally, the day arrived when the painting was finished. As Michal Mikhailovich held back the curtains to reveal his masterpiece, Sofia smiled tightly and handed him a check for a small fortune. But as she turned to leave, Michal Mikhailovich caught a glimpse of something that made his blood run cold - a small note on her hand, which read "Property of the Patron".

It was then that Michal Mikhailovich realized he had been duped. The patron wasn't interested in buying his art - he wanted to own it outright, and use it to further his own interests. With a sense of betrayal and anger, Michal Mikhailovich watched as Sofia disappeared into the night, leaving him with a painting that felt like it was lost forever.
