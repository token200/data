I must correct you - I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Michal Kortajarena. However, I did find information on Michal Kromm's friend and fellow dancer, Marius Petipa's protégé, but also a famous Basque singer and dancer.

Let me introduce you to Michel Korkias' Basque cousin, Marisol, who has some connection to the dancers.  But most famously we know of a man with this name, Michal Kortajarena or Mika Kortajarena.

Michel (Mika) Kortajarenas, a well-known dancer and performer at the age of five joined the Basque National Dance Company's prestigious youth academy in Bilbao, Spain. There he was trained by renowned choreographers such as José Luis de la Casa. 

Years went on, Mika continued to hone his skills under some of the greatest in their field. And so it seems that Michal (Mika) Kortajarenas' dream had finally come true when he made it onto the popular television dance show "Strictly Come Dancing". At just 35 years old, he was about to face his biggest challenge yet - partnering with professional dancer partner and dance instructor Alexandra Boukhanova.
