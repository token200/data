Born Grace Elizabeth Kazuo in Los Angeles, California, to a Japanese mother and an American father, she grew up surrounded by the rich cultural heritage of both worlds.

Grace's journey as an artist began in her teenage years, when she would spend hours sketching and painting in her small studio above her parents' sushi restaurant. Her mother, a skilled calligrapher, had taught her the art of traditional Japanese lettering, which Grace incorporated into many of her pieces. Her father, an avid music lover, introduced her to jazz and blues, influences that seeped into her vibrant color palette.

After studying fine arts in college, Grace began exhibiting her work at local galleries and eventually landed a solo show at the prestigious Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The exhibition was a resounding success, with critics praising her innovative use of materials and her bold, unapologetic style.

She was living her dream, and her art was reflecting the world around her in all its beauty and complexity. With a smile on her face, she knew that this was just the beginning of an incredible journey.
