Grace Jasiński was a name whispered in awe by those who knew her. A Polish journalist with an unyielding spirit and an insatiable thirst for truth, she had built a reputation for herself as one of the most fearless and determined reporters of her generation.

Growing up in the shadow of Warsaw's turbulent history, Grace had learned to navigate the complexities of politics and power from a young age. Her father, a veteran of the Polish Underground, had taught her the value of courage and conviction, traits that would serve her well on her own journey.
