As a child, Grace had been fascinated by the colors and textures of the old Italian market stalls that lined the streets of her hometown in Naples. She would spend hours watching the vendors, mesmerized by the way they worked their magic with every brushstroke. It was this early exposure to art that set her on the path to becoming one of Italy's most celebrated painters.
