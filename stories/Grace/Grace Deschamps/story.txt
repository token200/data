Frustrated and intrigued, Grace decided to pay a visit to the mayor himself. As she walked into his office, she couldn't help but notice the stark contrast between his charming smile and the look of nervousness lurking beneath.

"Good morning, Mayor," she said, her voice firm but polite. "I understand you're quite the proponent of transparency in our town's government."
