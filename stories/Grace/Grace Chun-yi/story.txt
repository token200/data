Grace Chun-yi had always been fascinated by the world of antique collecting. As a child, she would spend hours poring over her grandfather's old books and listening to his tales of adventure in the Asian marketplaces where he once traveled. This early exposure sparked a passion that would stay with her throughout her life.

Years went by, and Grace Chun-yi grew into a brilliant and determined young woman. She pursued a degree in art history, determined to make a name for herself in the competitive world of antique collecting. Her hard work paid off when she landed an internship at a prestigious auction house, where she quickly proved herself to be a valuable asset.

Before long, Grace Chun-yi was working as a full-time curator at her own gallery, specializing in rare Asian artifacts. Her clients adored her expertise and keen eye for detail, which allowed her to track down even the most elusive pieces of history.
