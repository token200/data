Grace Shinichi walked into the small café, scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Rachel, sitting in the corner, sipping on a latte. Grace made her way over, exchanging warm smiles with Rachel.

"Hey, Rach," Grace said, sliding into the booth across from her friend. "What brings you here today?"

Rachel shrugged, taking a sip of her drink. "Just needed a break from work, I guess. How about you? You look like you could use one."

Grace nodded, reaching for her own coffee cup. She took a sip, feeling the caffeine course through her veins. As she sat there, lost in thought, Rachel began to ask questions.

"So, Grace Shinichi, what's new with you?" Rachel asked, using Grace's full name as if it was an old habit.

Grace smiled wryly. "Not much, Rach. Just the usual. Got my nose buried in some novels and trying to meet a looming deadline at work."

Rachel chuckled. "I can relate. Sometimes I feel like we're just trying to keep our heads above water."

The two friends sat in silence for a moment, watching as other patrons came and went. Then Rachel spoke up again.

"You know, Grace Shinichi, sometimes I forget that you're actually alive and not just a figment of my imagination."

Grace laughed, feeling a warmth spread through her chest. "I'm glad to put an end to that myth, Rach."

As they chatted, the café began to fill with more people, but Grace and Rachel remained lost in their own little world. They talked about everything and nothing, their conversation flowing easily.

At one point, Rachel mentioned a new book she'd been reading, and Grace's eyes lit up. "Oh, I've heard of that one! Is it any good?"

Rachel nodded enthusiastically. "Definitely worth the read. You'll love it."

As they finished their drinks and prepared to leave, Rachel reached out and placed a hand on Grace's arm. "You know, Rach, sometimes I think we're more alike than you realize."

Grace smiled, feeling a deep connection with her friend. "I think that's what makes our friendship so special, Shinichi – or whatever it is I am."

Rachel laughed, pulling her into a warm hug. "Whatever you are, you're my person."
