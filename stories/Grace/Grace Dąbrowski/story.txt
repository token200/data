Grace DÄ…browski stood at the edge of the forest, her piercing green eyes scanning the dense foliage as she searched for any sign of her missing sister. The sun was setting over the treetops, casting a warm orange glow over the landscape, but to Grace, it only seemed to highlight the darkness that had taken her sister.

It had been three weeks since Sofia went missing, and every day felt like an eternity. The police were stumped, and their theories were getting more and more outlandish by the hour. But Grace knew better. She knew that something was off about this whole thing, something that didn't add up.

As a former detective herself, Grace had seen her fair share of cases, but there was something about Sofia's disappearance that felt different. Maybe it was the way she had disappeared into thin air, leaving behind no signs of struggle or force, just a simple note on the kitchen table saying "I'm sorry" and "I'll be back". It didn't make any sense.

Grace took a deep breath and stepped forward, her boots crunching through the underbrush. She followed the path that Sofia had taken the last time they saw each other, her heart pounding in her chest. The trees seemed to close in around her as she walked, their branches tangling together above her head like skeletal fingers.

As she turned a bend in the path, Grace caught sight of something glinting in the fading light. She quickened her pace, her excitement growing with every step. Suddenly, she was standing at the edge of a small clearing, and there, in the center of it all, was Sofia's phone.

Grace rushed forward, snatching up the phone from its hiding place among the leaves. As she scrolled through Sofia's texts, her eyes widened in shock. There were messages from someone named "A", who claimed to be taking care of Sofia while Grace was away. The language was cryptic, but one phrase kept repeating itself: "You'll never find me".

Grace felt a chill run down her spine as she read the words. Who was this person? And what did they want with Sofia? She knew she had to get to the bottom of it, no matter what it took.

With a newfound sense of determination, Grace set off into the forest, ready to follow whatever trail lay ahead, no matter how dark or twisted it might be.
