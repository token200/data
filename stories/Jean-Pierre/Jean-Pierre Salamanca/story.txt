Jean-Pierre "Papa" Salamanca sat in his favorite armchair, sipping his whiskey as he watched the sunset over the Hudson River. His eyes narrowed slightly, lost in thought as he puffed on his cigar.

He was a man of few words, but when he spoke, people listened. Papa Salamanca had earned his nickname through years of dealing and negotiating with various factions in the city's underworld. He had built an empire, one that spanned from extortion to human trafficking, all while maintaining a veneer of respectability.

As he sat there, lost in thought, the doorbell rang. It was one of his associates, come to discuss a potential new venture. Papa Salamanca gestured for him to sit down and listened intently as the young man outlined his plan.

"I'm telling you, Jean-Pierre, this is going to be huge," the associate said. "We're talking millions in profits with just one small expansion."

Papa Salamanca's expression remained unreadable, but he knew exactly what was being proposed. He had heard it all before, and he wasn't impressed.

"I'm not interested," Papa Salamanca finally said, his voice low and even. "I have my own plans for the city. Plans that don't involve getting my hands dirty."

The associate nodded hastily and took his leave. As the door closed behind him, Papa Salamanca lit another cigar, blowing out a stream of smoke as he lost himself in thought.

He was an old man now, with creaky joints and dwindling energy. But even so, he still held sway over many of the city's power players. They knew better than to cross him, or at least they pretended to.

The phone on the table rang, breaking the silence. Papa Salamanca picked it up, listening for a moment before responding in his signature drawl.

"Ah, yes. I'll take care of it myself. Don't bother trying to find anyone else."

As he hung up the phone, a smile spread across his face. He may not be as spry as he used to be, but Papa Salamanca was still the kingpin around these parts. And nobody would ever tell him otherwise.

He snuffed out the cigar and stood up, his joints creaking in protest. "Time for bed," he said to himself. As he shuffled off into the darkness of his bedroom, it was clear that even an old man like Jean-Pierre Salamanca could still pack a punch.
