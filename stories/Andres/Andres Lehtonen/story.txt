Andres Lehtonen was known for his striking features and razor-sharp wit, but few people knew that behind those piercing blue eyes lay a heart of gold. As a seasoned diplomat, Andres had traversed the globe, forging alliances and brokering peace treaties with ease.

His sharp mind and charisma made him an asset to any organization, which is how he landed his first job at the Finnish Foreign Ministry.

Years of service took Andres to far-flung corners of the world, where he honed his diplomatic skills in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges. In Angola, for instance, he negotiated a peace deal between warring factions that was hailed as one of the greatest successes of his career.

Despite his many accomplishments, Andres remained humble and grounded. He never let his success go to his head, always staying connected with his roots and the people who mattered most.
