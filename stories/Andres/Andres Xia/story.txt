Andres Xia was a man of mystery and intrigue, shrouded in an air of secrecy that seemed to follow him wherever he went. His piercing green eyes sparkled with intelligence, and his chiseled features hinted at a sharp mind behind the enigmatic smile.

As a former CIA operative, Andres had seen it all – from the darkest corners of human depravity to the highest echelons of power. His extensive training and expertise had made him a formidable asset in the world of espionage, but after leaving the agency, he'd chosen to retire to a quiet life on the outskirts of Buenos Aires.

Despite his efforts to keep a low profile, whispers of Andres Xia's past continued to circulate among the city's underworld figures. Some said he was still working for the CIA, pulling strings from behind the scenes; others claimed he was involved in a series of high-stakes heists, using his vast knowledge of global finance to fund his own clandestine operations.

Andres scoffed at such rumors, preferring to spend his days lost in the pages of classic literature and sipping whiskey by the fireside. Yet, on certain nights when the moon hung low over the Rio de la Plata, he couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching him – following him, waiting for him to slip up.

One fateful evening, Andres did just that. While lost in thought as he strolled through a deserted alleyway, he failed to notice a figure lurking in the shadows. Before he could react, a hand grasped his wrist and spun him around.

It was a young woman with skin as pale as alabaster and eyes like dark pools of water. She smiled enigmatically and pressed a small piece of paper into Andres' palm before vanishing into the night. The note read: "Meet me at Café San Juan at midnight. Come alone."

Andres' instincts screamed warning, but something about the woman's gaze stayed his hand. He felt an unexplainable connection to this mysterious stranger – perhaps it was her shared love of Proust or the way she seemed to hold secrets within those piercing eyes.

Whatever the reason, Andres knew he had to attend that midnight meeting. Little did he know, his quiet life was about to take a dramatic turn, and Andres Xia would be thrust back into the world of espionage with a force he couldn't control.
