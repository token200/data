One day, Andres received a call from a wealthy businessman who was being blackmailed by an unknown individual. The businessman had been receiving threatening messages and demands for money, and he didn't know who was behind it or why. He begged Andres to take on the case and put an end to the blackmail.

Andres Thomas agreed, and set out to investigate.

After days of tireless work, Andres finally got his break - a suspicious character had been spotted lurking around the businessman's office building.

Andres tracked down the suspect and confronted them in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. The man, revealed to be a disgruntled former employee, was caught off guard when Andres presented him with evidence of his crimes. He quickly confessed to the blackmail scheme and agreed to cooperate with Andres to bring the perpetrator to justice.
