Timofey González Fernández, or Tiko to those who knew him, was an artist with a rebellious heart. Growing up in the vibrant streets of Mexico City, he had always been drawn to the colors and sounds that filled his world. His father, a passionate painter himself, encouraged Timo's creativity from a young age.

As a child, Timo spent hours watching his father work on canvases, mesmerized by the way paint seemed to bring life to empty spaces. He experimented with his own materials - scraps of fabric, old CDs, and whatever he could find in his parents' studio - to create an ever-changing tapestry of art.

But it was during his teenage years that Timo's style truly began to take shape. Inspired by the city's underground music scene, he started incorporating distorted guitars riffs into his paintings, infusing them with a raw energy that reflected the pulsing rhythms and chaotic beats of Mexico City.
