The psychologists were perplexed by this request, but they agreed to accommodate his wishes. As a result, Timofey's research took an unusual turn. He would ask participants about their memories, analyzing the way their faces lit up or dulled when recalling specific events. His conclusions were groundbreaking, shedding new light on the complexities of human memory.

One fateful evening, Timofey Ming-che walked into a dimly lit caf√©, where a group of artists gathered to share stories and ideas.
