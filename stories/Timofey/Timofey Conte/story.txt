One day, a young woman named Sofia stumbled upon Timofey's work while exploring the Latin Quarter. Enchanted by his art, she sought him out, hoping to learn from the master himself. Over coffee, they talked about everything from art to music to life's mysteries. As they parted ways, Timofey offered her some sage advice: "Create with your heart, Sofia. That's where true beauty lies."
