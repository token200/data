As his star began to rise, Timofey found himself performing on stages big and small, sharing his story with audiences from all walks of life. He remained true to his roots, incorporating elements of his Latin American heritage into his music, which resonated deeply with fans.

Through hard work and dedication, Timofey Jimenez Lopez became a rising star in the country music scene, proud to call himself one of Nashville's most exciting new talents. And though he missed Los Angeles dearly, he knew that this was where his musical journey had been meant to take him.
