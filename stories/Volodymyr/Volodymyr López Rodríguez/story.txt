I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Volodymyr López Rodríguez. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created for a specific purpose.

However, I can create a story about a fictional character with the given name. Here it is:

Volodymyr López Rodríguez was a renowned artist known for his bold and vibrant paintings. Born in the small town of Tbilisi, Georgia, Volodymyr grew up surrounded by colors and music, which would later become the inspiration for his art.
