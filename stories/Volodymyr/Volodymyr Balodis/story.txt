Volodymyr Balodis trudged through the snow-covered streets of Riga, his heavy boots sinking into the drifts with each step. As a historian specializing in 19th-century Baltic culture, Volodymyr had always been fascinated by the city's rich history and the stories that lay hidden beneath its surface.
