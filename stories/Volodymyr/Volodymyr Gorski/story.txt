Volodymyr Gorski was a man shrouded in mystery. His piercing blue eyes seemed to hold secrets, and his chiseled features made him look like a Renaissance sculpture come to life. A former KGB agent turned mercenary, Volodymyr had a reputation for being untouchable.

He walked into the dimly lit bar, his black leather jacket creaking as he moved. The bartender looked up, recognizing the infamous Volodymyr Gorski. "The usual?" he asked, pouring a shot of vodka into Volodymyr's waiting glass.

Volodymyr took a sip, feeling the burn all the way down. He was a man with a taste for danger, and this bar was one of his favorite haunts. It was a place where spies and assassins could blend in, away from prying eyes.

As he sat at the bar, Volodymyr noticed a young woman sitting alone at a table in the corner. She looked like she had seen better days, with dark circles under her eyes and a look of desperation etched on her face. He couldn't help but feel drawn to her, despite himself.

Over a few drinks, Volodymyr learned that her name was Sophia, and she was being pursued by some very bad people. He offered to help her, and in return, she would tell him more about the mysterious organization she had been working for.

As they talked, Volodymyr realized that Sophia was not like anyone he had ever met before. She was smart, resourceful, and brave. For the first time in a long time, he felt a spark of connection with someone.

But as the night wore on, Volodymyr knew that his life was too complicated to get involved with anyone. He left Sophia with a warning, telling her to lay low for a while and stay out of trouble. As he walked out of the bar, he couldn't shake the feeling that he had just made a mistake.

After all, when you're Volodymyr Gorski, you don't do "simple" or "selfless." You did what was best for your business, no matter who got hurt along the way.
