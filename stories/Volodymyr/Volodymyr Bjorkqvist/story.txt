In the quaint town of Åre, Sweden, a young and talented figure skater named Volodymyr Bjorkqvist was making waves in the figure skating community. Born to Ukrainian parents, Volodymyr had grown up surrounded by the sport, watching his mother compete in local competitions while he learned to lace up his skates.
