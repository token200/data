Volodymyr Krumins stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small town of Ashwood. The signs of aging were evident in the weathered buildings and overgrown gardens, but Volodymyr felt a sense of nostalgia wash over him. It had been years since he'd last set foot in this place.

Volodymyr Krumins, once a renowned scientist, had left Ashwood behind after a scandal involving his research had forced him into exile. The memories of that fateful day still lingered in his mind, like an open wound.

As he made his way through the quiet streets, Volodymyr couldn't help but notice the curious glances from the townsfolk. It was as if they knew who he was, even if they didn't remember his name. He had changed it, of course – Krumins to something more innocuous – but the whispers followed him like a shadow.

Volodymyr arrived at his new home, an old cottage on the outskirts of town, and began to unpack the few belongings he'd brought with him. It was a simple existence, one he'd chosen for reasons both practical and philosophical.

The next day, Volodymyr Krumins set out into the surrounding countryside, searching for something – anything – that might take his mind off the past. He walked for hours, losing himself in the rolling hills and verdant forests, until finally, he came upon a clearing. In the center of it stood an old oak, its bark gnarled and twisted with age.

For a long moment, Volodymyr simply looked at the tree. It was as if the world had slowed down, allowing him to breathe for the first time in years. The memories of Ashwood, of his scandal, and of his own identity began to fade away, replaced by a sense of peace.

As he turned to leave, Volodymyr Krumins felt a weight lift from his shoulders. He knew that this was just the beginning – a chance to rebuild, to rediscover himself in a place where no one knew his true name.
