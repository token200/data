A few hours later, Magdalena Kalējs arrived at the address listed on the security footage. She knocked gently on the door, which was answered by none other than Maris Kozlovskis' own nephew, Edgars. The surprise on his face spoke volumes as he surrendered the stolen necklace to Magdalena.

With the case solved and justice served, Magdalena Kalējs returned to her office, ready for her next challenge. Her reputation grew as word of her remarkable skills spread throughout the city.
