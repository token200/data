Magdalena Sten stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. The small town of Ravensburg was not exactly known for its vibrant nightlife, but Magdalena had come to expect that. As a private investigator, she'd grown accustomed to the quiet hours, when the only sound was the creaking of old wooden signs and the distant hum of crickets.

Magdalena Sten checked her watch for what felt like the hundredth time, the faint scratches on the leather strap a reminder of past cases. She had been hired by a wealthy businessman to investigate a string of mysterious occurrences at his family's ancestral home, now abandoned and slated for demolition. According to his son, strange noises echoed through the empty halls at night, and some brave souls reported seeing shadowy figures darting around corners.

As she made her way through the town, Magdalena Sten noticed the locals watching her with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. She was no stranger to being an outsider in Ravensburg; the town's tight-knit community didn't take kindly to outsiders, especially not ones like herself who wore their heart on their sleeve.

Magdalena pushed open the creaky door of the local pub, where she spotted her contact, a gruff but kind-hearted bartender named Klaus. He raised an eyebrow as she took a seat beside him, and Magdalena could almost see the gears turning in his mind: How did this city girl end up poking around Ravensburg's history?

"You're looking for answers about the old Sten place," Klaus said, pouring her a stein of ale without waiting for permission. "My wife's cousin used to live there. She always told me it was cursed."

Magdalena leaned in, her eyes locked on Klaus'. "Tell me more about that."

As Klaus spoke, Magdalena listened intently, the sound of his words weaving together with the creaking of the old pub and the faint whisper of Ravensburg's secrets.

She left the pub as the sun dipped below the horizon, the stars starting to twinkle like diamonds in the night sky. Her eyes scanned the empty streets once more, but this time, she didn't feel alone. The shadows seemed to shift just a little, like they were watching her too.
