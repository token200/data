Lena Briedite was a 25-year-old freelance writer who had always been fascinated by the world of mythology. Growing up in a small town in Lithuania, she spent most of her childhood listening to tales of ancient gods and goddesses from her grandmother, who had inherited the stories from her own mother.

As Lena delved deeper into her research, she became particularly intrigued by the legend of the Biberiene, a mythical bird said to possess the power of healing. According to myth, the Biberiene was born from the tears of the gods and could cure even the most grievous wounds.

One day, while browsing through a dusty old bookstore in Vilnius, Lena stumbled upon an ancient tome bound in worn leather. As she opened the book, she discovered that it was a collection of myths and legends from various cultures, including her own Lithuanian heritage.

As she flipped through the pages, Lena came across a passage describing the Biberiene's powers. According to the myth, the bird had the ability to heal any wound, but only if it was given a special gift: a strand of pure crystal.

Lena was captivated by the story and decided that she wanted to write her own mythology around the Biberiene. She spent the next few weeks researching and writing, pouring all her energy into creating a new legend about the mythical bird.

As she worked on her manuscript, Lena found herself becoming more and more like her namesake heroine. She took long walks through the forest, imagining the Biberiene soaring above the trees, its wings beating fiercely as it searched for its next victim to heal.

Finally, after months of work, Lena's book was complete. She titled it "The Healing Wings of the Biberiene" and sent it off to publishers everywhere. While she waited anxiously for a response, Lena couldn't help but feel a sense of pride knowing that her full name, Lena Briedite, would soon be synonymous with mythological fiction.

Years went by and Lena's book became a bestseller, earning her recognition as one of the leading authors in the field of mythology. She continued to write, always staying true to her Lithuanian heritage and the legend of the Biberiene that had inspired her from the start.
