Lena Bergström stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar sights of her hometown. The small Swedish town was bustling with activity, as it always was on summer weekends. Lena's thoughts, however, were elsewhere. She had just graduated from university in Stockholm, and was now back home to explore her family's old summer cottage.

As she made her way through the crowded station, Lena's eyes landed on a familiar figure - her best friend, Sarah, waiting for her with a bright smile. The two had grown up together, exploring the woods and lakes of Bergström's farm. Now, as they hugged tightly, Lena felt a sense of nostalgia wash over her.

"Hey, Len! I've missed you so much!" Sarah exclaimed, using the nickname only she was allowed to use.

Lena chuckled, feeling a warmth spread through her chest. "I've missed you too, Sarah. It's good to be home."

The two friends spent the afternoon wandering through the fields and forests, catching up on each other's lives. Lena had always been close to her family, but with university looming ahead, she had felt a pang of uncertainty about what lay next. Her parents had reassured her, of course - Bergström was an old name, passed down from generation to generation, and this summer cottage had been in their family for centuries.

As the sun began to set, Lena's thoughts turned to the long list of tasks ahead: cleaning out the old storage rooms, tending to the garden, and figuring out what to do with her degree. But as she looked around at the familiar sights of Bergström's farm, she felt a sense of peace settle over her.

She would take some time to figure things out, Lena decided, but for now, she was home. And that was enough.
