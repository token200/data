Lena Rosén stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar station in Munich. She had been traveling for hours, and the thought of a warm beer and a good night's sleep was all that kept her going. As she made her way through the crowds, Lena couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her.

She had always loved Germany, ever since she'd spent her summer break here as a teenager. Her parents had been on sabbatical at the time, and Lena had tagged along with them, spending long days exploring the city and its surroundings. She remembered strolling along the Isar River, laughing with her parents, and making friends with locals who spoke little English.

Now, years later, Lena found herself back in Munich, this time on a mission to reconnect with old friends and make some new ones. As she walked towards the station's exit, she spotted a familiar figure waiting for her - Jakob, an old friend from university. The two had lost touch after graduation, but their social media feeds remained full of each other's posts.

Lena smiled as Jakob enveloped her in a warm hug. "Long time no see!" he exclaimed, and Lena chuckled in response. They spent the next hour catching up on each other's lives - Jakob's new job, Lena's freelance writing career, and everything in between.

As they parted ways for the night, Jakob invited Lena to join him for a beer at a nearby pub. She accepted, feeling grateful for this unexpected reunion. Over a cold pint of Weissbier, Lena found herself thinking about her life since leaving Germany. She had always been drawn to adventure and change, but sometimes she wondered if she'd lost touch with the simpler things in life.

As the night wore on, Lena realized that some friendships never truly fade away. Jakob's easygoing nature and infectious laughter reminded her of why she loved their friendship so much. With a renewed sense of purpose, Lena made a mental note to stay in touch this time around. After all, when you've got friends like Jakob waiting for you back home, there's no reason to be away for long.

With a heart full of warmth and a new promise of connection, Lena Rosén raised her beer glass in a silent toast to old friends and new beginnings.
