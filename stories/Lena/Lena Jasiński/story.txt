Lena Jasiński sat alone in her small apartment, staring blankly at the wall as tears streamed down her face. It had been a year since she'd last spoken to her estranged father, and the pain still felt like an open wound.

As a child, Lena had always looked up to her father, who had been a musician in his youth. He'd played the guitar on street corners and in small bars, and Lena would often join him, singing along to his songs. But as she grew older, their relationship began to fray. Her father's substance abuse problems had worsened, and he'd eventually abandoned her mother and herself.

Now, as a young adult, Lena was trying to make a name for herself as a singer-songwriter. She'd just released her debut album, and the response had been overwhelmingly positive. But despite her success, she couldn't shake the feeling of emptiness inside. It was as if a part of her was missing, like a piece of music that she couldn't quite remember.

Lena's eyes wandered to a old photograph on her mantle. It was a picture of her and her father, taken when she was just a teenager. He was smiling, his guitar slung over his shoulder, and Lena looked up at him with wide eyes and a smile. She felt a pang in her heart as she gazed at the photo, remembering the happy times they'd shared.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was her manager, who'd come to check on her and see how she was doing. Lena smiled weakly and invited him in. As he sat down in the armchair across from her, she began to talk about her feelings, about the pain of losing her father and struggling to find her place in the world.

Her manager listened attentively, nodding his head and making supportive noises. When Lena finished talking, he put a hand on her shoulder and said, "You're doing great, Lena Jasiński. You're exactly where you're meant to be."
