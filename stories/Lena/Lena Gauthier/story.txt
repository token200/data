Lena Gauthier walked into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee and staring intently at his laptop screen. It had been months since they'd last seen each other, but the memory of their last encounter lingered in her mind like a ghost.

Lena made her way over to him, her heels clicking against the floorboards. As she approached, he looked up, catching her gaze and flashing a brief smile before returning to his work. She chuckled inwardly – still had that effect on her.

"Lena Gauthier," he said, looking up at her with a hint of surprise in his eyes, "I didn't expect you'd show up so soon."

"Likewise," she replied, taking a seat across from him. They spent the next hour catching up, discussing everything from their jobs to their personal struggles and fears.

As they talked, Lena couldn't help but notice the changes in her friend. His hair was longer, his eyes seemed brighter, and there was an air of confidence about him that she hadn't seen before. She asked him if everything was okay, and he smiled wryly.

"I've been seeing someone," he said, looking away for a moment before meeting her gaze again. "Her name is Sophia – nice girl, by all accounts."

Lena's heart skipped a beat as she processed this new information. She had always known that he'd have to move on eventually, but hearing it now still caught her off guard.

"I'm happy for you," she said finally, forcing a smile onto her face. "Really, I am."

He smiled back, his eyes crinkling at the corners, and Lena felt a pang of sadness wash over her. She knew that this marked the end of their exclusive friendship – he had found someone new to share his life with.

As they parted ways, Lena couldn't help but wonder what the future held for him and Sophia. Would they be happy together? Only time would tell.
