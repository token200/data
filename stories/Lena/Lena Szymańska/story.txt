Lena Szymańska stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. As she made her way through the empty waiting area, a piece of paper caught her eye. It was a note, scribbled in haste and left on a bench.

"Lena Szymańska, meet me at Café des Arts at 5pm," it read.

Lena's heart skipped a beat as she realized who might have written the note. Kasia, her old friend from university days, had been missing for months. They had lost touch after graduation, but Lena had never forgotten about Kasia's quirky sense of adventure and love of art.

She quickened her pace, her mind racing with possibilities. What could Kasia want to talk about? And why now, after all this time?

As she arrived at Café des Arts, Lena spotted a figure sitting in the corner, nursing a cup of coffee. It was Kasia, looking more radiant than ever with her bright smile and sparkling eyes.

"Lena!" Kasia exclaimed, leaping from her seat to envelop Lena in a tight hug.

"You're alive!" Lena laughed, feeling a mix of emotions: joy, relief, and a hint of trepidation.

Kasia settled back into her chair, looking more subdued. "I know it's been a while, but I've been through some things, Lena. Things that made me realize what truly matters to me."

Over steaming cups of coffee, Kasia shared stories of her travels, her art, and her newfound sense of purpose. Lena listened intently, captivated by her friend's renewed passion.

As the evening wore on, they talked about everything and nothing – their lives, dreams, fears. It was as if no time had passed at all, yet everything had changed.
