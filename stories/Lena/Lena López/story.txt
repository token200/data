Lena López sat at her desk, staring blankly at the computer screen in front of her. She was supposed to be working on her marketing campaign for a new client, but her mind kept wandering back to the argument she'd had with her best friend the night before.

As a graphic designer and entrepreneur, Lena was always juggling multiple projects and deadlines. But what made it even harder was that she was also the owner of her own business, which meant she had to wear many hats at once. She was both the creative force behind her designs and the CEO of López Designs.

Despite her best efforts, Lena couldn't shake off the feeling that she'd let her friend down. Her friend, Maria, had been her partner in crime since college, and they'd always been there for each other through thick and thin. But when Maria decided to pursue a master's degree on the other side of the country, Lena felt abandoned.

As she sat at her desk, Lena felt a surge of frustration and sadness. She knew she needed to talk to someone about how she was feeling, but it wasn't like she could just pick up the phone and call Maria right now. They were still friends, but their relationship had changed in ways she couldn't quite process.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was her coworker, Carlos, who poked his head into the room to check on her progress. "Hey, Lena, how's it going?" he asked, noticing the look of distraction on her face.

Lena sighed and rubbed her temples. "I don't know, man," she admitted. "I just feel really overwhelmed right now."

Carlos nodded sympathetically. "You've got this, Lena. You're one of the most talented designers I know. And besides, Maria's not going anywhere. She'll be back when it's time for you to celebrate your victory."

Lena smiled slightly at Carlos' words, but deep down, she knew he was right. She needed to focus on her work and take care of herself before she could worry about what other people were doing.

With renewed determination, Lena turned her attention back to the computer screen in front of her. She took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and let the creative juices flow once again. As she worked, she felt a sense of calm wash over her, and for the first time that day, she felt like she was exactly where she was meant to be.
