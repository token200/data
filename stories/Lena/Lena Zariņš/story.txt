Lena Zariņš stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar landscape of Riga's old town. As a photographer, she had returned to her hometown many times, but each visit still held a sense of wonder.

Born and raised in Latvia, Lena Zariņš had always been drawn to the city's intricate mix of Soviet-era grandeur and Art Nouveau charm. Her camera, slung over her shoulder, was an extension of herself as she wandered the streets, searching for the perfect shot.

As she walked, Lena Zariņš noticed the way the light danced through the narrow alleys, casting long shadows that seemed to stretch on forever. She quickened her pace, eager to capture the fleeting moment when the sun's rays hit the stone facades just so.

She stopped in front of a particularly beautiful building, its facade adorned with intricate carvings and ornate balconies. Lena Zariņš raised her camera to her eye, framing the shot to emphasize the delicate patterns etched into the stonework.

Just as she took the photo, a young woman approached her, smiling. "You're a photographer?" she asked in broken English. Lena Zariņš nodded, and the woman introduced herself as Līga, a local artist who had grown up in Riga's old town.

As they chatted, Lena Zariņš learned that Līga was working on a project to document the city's hidden spaces – secret gardens, tucked-away courtyards, and forgotten corners of the old town. The photographer's ears perked up as she listened, her mind racing with ideas for how she could collaborate with Līga.

Together, they set out to explore the city, camera and notebook in hand. As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over Riga's rooftops, Lena Zariņš knew that this trip would be different from any other. She was no longer just capturing images – she was discovering new stories, new perspectives, and a deeper connection to her own heritage.

As they parted ways that evening, Līga turned to Lena Zariņš and said, "Thank you for seeing Riga through your lens." The photographer smiled, knowing that this was just the beginning of a beautiful collaboration.
