Lena Persson stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of saltwater and seaweed washing over her like a warm hug. She had returned to her hometown of Malmö, Sweden, for the summer solstice celebrations, and was eager to reconnect with old friends and family.

As she made her way through the bustling streets, Lena's thoughts turned to the past few years. After completing her degree in environmental science, she had landed a job at a non-profit organization working to reduce plastic waste in the ocean. It was a dream come true, but also came with its share of challenges and long hours.

Despite the demands of her job, Lena made it a priority to spend time with loved ones this summer. Her mother, Birgitta Persson, had already invited her over for dinner on Saturday night, and Lena couldn't wait to catch up. She walked up the path to their family home, the sound of laughter and sizzling meat carrying from the kitchen.

 Inside, Lena was greeted with a warm smile by her mother, who handed her a glass of freshly squeezed lemonade. The table was set with colorful tablecloths and an array of delicious dishes, each one more tantalizing than the last. Lena's stomach growled in anticipation as she took a seat next to her father, Johan Persson.

As they ate and chatted, Lena felt a sense of peace wash over her. This was what summer was all about – good food, good company, and making memories with those she loved. After dinner, the family gathered on the balcony, watching the stars twinkle to life in the night sky.

Lena felt grateful for this life she had built, for the people who supported her and the work that brought her joy. As the night wore on, she knew that this summer, like all summers before it, would be one to remember. And as she settled into bed that night, surrounded by the comforts of home, Lena Persson felt truly at peace.
