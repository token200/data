Lena Kovács stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. As a freelance journalist, she had spent countless hours researching and interviewing sources in Budapest, but tonight was different. Tonight, she was meeting with someone who claimed to have information about her sister's disappearance.

The past year had been a blur of sadness and frustration for Lena. Her younger sister, Anna, had vanished during a trip to Prague when they were teenagers. The police had given up on the case years ago, but Lena refused to accept that it was closed. She had spent every spare moment researching and investigating, convinced that she could find some lead, some clue that would bring her sister home.

As she waited for her contact to arrive, Lena sipped her coffee and gazed out the window at the twinkling lights of the Danube River. The café was old-school Budapest, with worn wooden tables and a fireplace crackling in the corner. It was the kind of place where secrets were whispered over cups of strong coffee.

Just as she was starting to feel like it was going to be another false lead, a figure slipped into the booth across from her. He introduced himself as Viktor, an old acquaintance from Lena's research days.

"Lena," he said, his voice low and serious. "I think I can help you."

Lena leaned forward, her heart racing with excitement. What did Viktor know? Was it finally going to come to light?

Viktor hesitated before speaking, his words spilling out in a rush. He told Lena about a mysterious phone call he had received months ago, from an unknown number. The caller claimed that they knew what had happened to Anna and were willing to reveal the truth – but only if Lena met them at a deserted warehouse on the outskirts of town.

Lena felt a shiver run down her spine as Viktor finished speaking. She didn't know what to believe or who she could trust, but one thing was certain: she was in this now, for better or worse.
