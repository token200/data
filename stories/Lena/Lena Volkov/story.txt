Lena Volkov stepped onto the dimly lit stage, her eyes scanning the crowd with a mixture of familiarity and unease. As the lead singer of the enigmatic rock band "Echo Requiem," she was no stranger to the spotlight, but tonight felt different. The tension in the air was palpable, like the very fabric of the music itself was trembling.

As Lena began to sing, her voice soared through the venue like a wounded bird set free. Her words poured out like venom, a cathartic release of emotions that left the audience gasping for breath. It was as if she was channeling some deep, dark well within herself, and the notes were the tears that flowed from it.

The crowd was entranced, mesmerized by Lena's performance. They sang along, their voices blending with hers like a chorus of the damned. The music was a raw, visceral thing, a primal scream that echoed through every cell in their bodies.

As she reached the climax of her set, Lena's eyes locked onto something beyond the stage. A figure, shrouded in shadows, stood at the edge of the crowd, watching her with an intensity that made her skin crawl. It was her manager, Viktor Kuznetsov, who had been instrumental in shaping Echo Requiem into the force it was today.

Lena's thoughts were a jumble of emotions as she finished her final song and took her bow. She felt like she'd been torn apart and put back together again, leaving her fragile and vulnerable. As she walked offstage, Viktor waited for her, his eyes burning with an inner fire that seemed to pierce right through her.

"Lena Volkov," he said, his voice low and husky. "You're a genius, but you're also a liability. We need to talk about the direction of this band."

Lena's heart sank, her mind racing with worst-case scenarios. She knew Viktor was always pushing for more, more exposure, more success. But at what cost? She took a deep breath, steeling herself for the conversation ahead, knowing that she would have to make some difficult choices if she wanted to preserve the essence of Echo Requiem.
