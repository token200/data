Ingemar Yang stepped out of the rain-soaked streets and into the warmth of his small, cluttered apartment. He was exhausted from another long day of working as a private investigator, and all he wanted to do was curl up on his couch with a good book and a cup of tea.

As he changed into dry clothes, Ingemar's mind kept wandering back to the case that had been haunting him for weeks. A wealthy businessman had hired him to investigate the theft of a valuable artifact from his estate, but every lead seemed to end in a dead-end. Ingemar was beginning to feel like he was getting nowhere fast.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was his friend and colleague, Rachel Lee. "Hey, Ingemar, I heard you were stumped on that case," she said, plopping down onto the couch beside him. "Want some company?"

Ingemar smiled wearily and gestured for her to sit down. Together, they poured over the files and notes from the case, searching for any clue that might have been missed.

As they worked, Ingemar's friend and colleague kept bringing up his full name - Ingemar Yang, a nickname he had always hated but which seemed to stick no matter how hard he tried to shake it. "You're really getting close, Ingemar Yang," she said, her eyes scanning the papers intently. "I can feel it."

Ingemar rolled his eyes good-naturedly, despite himself feeling a twinge of gratitude for Rachel's persistence. Together, they worked late into the night, pouring over every shred of evidence until finally, just as the sun began to rise, Ingemar spotted something.

It was a small detail - a tiny scratch on one of the walls of the businessman's study, which looked suspiciously like it had been made with a very specific type of stone. And that, Ingemar Yang realized, was exactly what he needed to crack the case wide open.

With newfound excitement, Ingemar leapt out of his chair and began making phone calls, connecting the dots between the scratch and an old rival who had just come into town. It was going to be a long day, but for the first time in weeks, Ingemar Yang felt like he was on the right track.

As he headed out into the bright sunlight with Rachel by his side, Ingemar couldn't help but smile - after all that work, even a little bit of bad luck wouldn't ruin his mood. Not today, at least.
