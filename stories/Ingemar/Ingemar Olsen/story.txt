Ingemar Olsen trudged through the snow-covered streets, his eyes scanning the frosty buildings for any sign of life. A former police detective from Copenhagen, he had retired to this small coastal town in Norway, hoping to escape the memories that haunted him.

As he turned a corner, the sound of laughter drifted out of a nearby café. Ingemar's instincts kicked in, and he quickened his pace, his hand instinctively reaching for the pocket where his phone was tucked away. He had never been one to shy away from danger, but the past few years had left him with a lingering sense of unease.

He pushed open the door and stepped inside, his eyes adjusting to the warm glow of the café. The patrons fell silent as he made his way to the bar, his presence commanding attention. Ingemar flashed a small smile, and the bartender, a gruff but kind-hearted man named Hans, nodded in recognition.

"What can I get you, Ingemar?" Hans asked, already reaching for the coffee pot.

"Just a black coffee, please," Ingemar replied, taking a seat at the bar. "And don't skimp on the crema."

As he waited for his drink to arrive, Ingemar's gaze wandered around the café. A group of locals huddled in the corner, playing cards, while an older woman sat by herself, sipping a cup of tea. Her eyes caught Ingemar's, and for a moment, they locked in a silent understanding.

A young couple walked in, hand in hand, laughing and chattering like children. They took seats at a table near the window, oblivious to the world outside. Ingemar watched them with a wistful expression, remembering when he too had been carefree.

Hans set his coffee down in front of Ingemar, accompanied by a plate of freshly baked pastries. "On the house," Hans said, as if reading Ingemar's thoughts.

Ingemar took a sip of his coffee, feeling the warmth spread through his chest. It was moments like these that reminded him he wasn't just a retired detective; he was still Ingemar Olsen – a man who had seen it all and come out the other side.

As he gazed around the café once more, Ingemar felt a sense of peace settle over him. He knew the darkness was always lurking, waiting to pounce, but in this small town, where everyone knew each other's stories, perhaps that wasn't so bad after all.
