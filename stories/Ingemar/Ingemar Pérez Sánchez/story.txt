Ingemar Pérez Sánchez stepped out of the warm sun and into the dimly lit café. He was no stranger to the looks he received, but after years of living in exile, some things never got old. The curious stares, the whispered conversations, the lingering gazes – it all still made him twitch with discomfort.

As a former general in the Bolivarian Revolutionary Army, Ingemar had been at the forefront of the opposition to President Maduro's regime. He was captured, tortured, and imprisoned for years, his name becoming synonymous with resistance. But now, he was a ghost, a shadow of the man who once commanded troops.

The barista approached him with a mixture of curiosity and wariness. "El General?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Ingemar nodded curtly, signaling that it was okay. He ordered a coffee, his hands shaking slightly as he handed over his card. As the waitress walked away, he took a moment to collect himself.

The café was a haven for exiles like Ingemar – those who had lost everything and everyone they once knew. It was here that he could blend in, lose himself in the sea of strangers. But tonight was different. Tonight, Ingemar felt restless. He couldn't shake off the feeling that his past was about to catch up with him.

As he sipped his coffee, a young journalist walked into the café, her eyes scanning the room until they landed on Ingemar. She approached him hesitantly, a notepad and pen at the ready.

"General Pérez Sánchez?" she asked, her voice firm but polite. "We've been looking for you."

Ingemar raised an eyebrow, his instincts on high alert. What did she want from him? He wasn't some forgotten relic to be pounced upon like a curiosity shop find.

"I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about," Ingemar said, trying to keep his tone light. But the journalist's eyes locked onto his, and he knew he had been caught off guard.

The words spilled out of her in a torrent: "We've uncovered evidence of your involvement in the failed coup attempt last year. We want to know what happened."

Ingemar's grip on his cup tightened as the world around him began to spin. This was it – this was the moment he had been waiting for, or rather, dreading. The ghost was back, and this time, he wouldn't be able to hide.

With a slow smile spreading across his face, Ingemar leaned in, ready to tell his story once more.
