Ingemar Delacroix was a man shrouded in mystery, with an air of quiet confidence that commanded attention without ever demanding it. As a renowned detective, he had solved some of the most baffling cases in the city, and his reputation as a mastermind of deduction had spread far and wide.

One drizzly afternoon, Ingemar Delacroix received a visit from the wealthy socialite, Mrs. Harrington. Her usually composed demeanor was ruffled, and her eyes betrayed a deep-seated fear as she begged Ingemar Delacroix to help her sister, who had gone missing in the city's underbelly.
