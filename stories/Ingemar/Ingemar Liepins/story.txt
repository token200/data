Despite the risks, Ingie was undaunted. He had always been driven by a strong sense of justice, and he was determined to see this assignment through to its conclusion. With his trademark blend of toughness and intelligence, Ingemar "Ingie" Liepins set out to expose the mole and bring him to justice, no matter what the cost.
