Madame LeRoux herself greeted Hélène Ayumi warmly, introducing her to the shop's eclectic inventory. As they browsed together, Madame LeRoux revealed that she had once been a fellow artist, and her passion for discovering new talent was still burning bright.

Hélène Ayumi was enchanted by the old woman's infectious energy and decided to purchase several of the shop's rare art supplies. In return, Madame LeRoux offered to mentor Hélène Ayumi, sharing her own knowledge and expertise with the young artist.

Under Madame LeRoux's guidance, Hélène Ayumi's skills flourished. Her paintings began to gain even more attention, with critics praising her bold style and innovative use of color.
