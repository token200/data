Hélène's life took a dramatic turn when she caught the eye of Gaius Julius Caesar Octavian, also known as Augustus, the future Emperor of Rome. Their whirlwind romance was met with opposition from Hélène's father, Claudius, who disapproved of his daughter's union with a man he deemed unworthy.

Despite her family's objections, Hélène and Augustus continued to see each other in secret. The young couple's love for each other only grew stronger as they navigated the treacherous waters of Roman politics.
