Hélène Arias stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar streets of her hometown. The small town of Saint-Pierre was still sleepy, but Hélène knew that by summer, it would be bustling with tourists seeking refuge from the city.

As she made her way to her small bakery, the scent of freshly baked croissants wafted out into the street, enticing passersby. Hélène Arias had always been proud of her family's bakery, which had been a staple in the community for generations. She took pride in her work, carefully crafting each pastry and bread to perfection.

Inside the bakery, Hélène's mother, Madame Dupont, was busily prepping for the day's customers. "Bonjour, Maman," Hélène said, giving her a warm hug. Her mother smiled, "Bonjour, chère. I see you're already up to your elbows in flour."

Hélène chuckled and began helping her mother with the morning preparations. They worked together seamlessly, their hands moving in tandem as they expertly mixed and kneaded dough. The bakery was more than just a business – it was a family tradition.

As the day went on, the bakery filled with the sounds of chatter and the aroma of freshly baked bread. Hélène Arias moved from table to table, chatting with regular customers and taking orders for special occasions. She loved being the center of attention, but she also cherished the quiet moments, when it was just her and her mother working together.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm glow over the bakery, Hélène's thoughts turned to her own future. She had always dreamed of expanding the bakery, maybe even opening a second location in the city. But for now, she was content with the quiet life, surrounded by the people and places she loved.

Madame Dupont noticed her daughter's distracted expression and put a gentle hand on her arm. "What's on your mind, chère?" Hélène smiled, "Just thinking about the future, Maman. But for now, I'm happy right here."

Her mother smiled back, her eyes shining with love. "I'm proud of you, Hélène Arias. You're carrying on our family's tradition, and making it your own."
