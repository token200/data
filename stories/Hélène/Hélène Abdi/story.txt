Hélène Abdi stepped off the plane and onto the sun-baked tarmac, her eyes scanning the familiar landscape of Addis Ababa. A native Ethiopian, she had spent years living abroad, working as a journalist and photographer for various publications. But after a decade away, Hélène felt an insatiable itch to return to her roots.

As she made her way through customs, Hélène's thoughts turned to her latest assignment: chronicling the lives of rural Ethiopian farmers struggling to adapt to climate change. She had spent months researching and planning, pouring over reports and conducting interviews with experts in the field. But nothing could truly prepare her for the harsh realities she would soon face.

Hélène's first stop was a small village on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, where she met with a local farmer named Alemu. Over steaming cups of green tea, Alemu shared his struggles to adapt to the changing climate – the droughts, the floods, the unpredictable weather patterns that left him wondering if he would ever be able to grow enough crops to feed his family.

As Hélène listened intently, she felt a deep sense of solidarity with Alemu and his community. She knew firsthand the impact of climate change on her own life – the loss of traditional livelihoods, the displacement of communities, the crushing weight of uncertainty that hung over every decision.

Over the next few weeks, Hélène traveled to rural villages across Ethiopia, meeting with farmers, herders, and community leaders. She saw the devastating effects of drought, the heartbreaking impact of erosion, and the resilience of people who had lost everything but refused to give up.

As she packed her bags to leave, Hélène felt a sense of gratitude for this journey. It was not just about documenting the struggles of rural Ethiopians – it was about bearing witness to their strength, their courage, and their unwavering commitment to survival. She knew that her story would be told in many different voices, but she also knew that hers would be one of hope, one of solidarity, and one of a people who refused to be silenced.

As the plane took off for Paris, Hélène gazed out at the receding landscape, feeling a sense of peace wash over her. She knew that she had only scratched the surface of this complex issue, but she also knew that she would return, again and again, until the stories of rural Ethiopia were told with the depth, the nuance, and the compassion they deserved.
