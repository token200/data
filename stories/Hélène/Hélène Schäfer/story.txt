Hélène Schäfer stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him at the corner table, sipping a cup of black coffee and reading the newspaper. The flicker of recognition in his eyes was enough to lead her to him.

As she approached, he looked up, a hint of a smile on his lips. Hélène slid into the seat across from him, running a hand through her dark hair. She hadn't seen Marc since the summer they spent together as teenagers, exploring the winding streets of Montmartre and laughing until their sides hurt.

Their friendship had always been complicated. They were both artists, chasing each other's dreams in the city that never slept. Hélène was a painter, capturing the vibrant colors of Paris on canvas, while Marc wrote poetry, his words dripping with emotion.

Years had passed since they'd last spoken, and yet, the connection between them remained strong. They talked long into the night, their conversation flowing effortlessly from art to music to politics. It felt like no time had passed at all.

As they chatted, Hélène noticed a look of concern on Marc's face. "What is it?" she asked, reaching out to touch his hand.

"I've been getting some strange letters," he said, his voice low. "People claiming I stole my inspiration from others. That I'm not a true artist."

Hélène felt a surge of anger on his behalf. She knew the cutthroat world of art, where talent and hard work were constantly questioned. But she also knew that Marc's work was genuine, infused with a raw emotion and vulnerability.

"You're being unfairly accused," she said firmly. "Your art speaks for itself."

Marc smiled, a hint of relief in his eyes. "You always know just what to say, Hélène. Thank you."

As they finished their coffee and prepared to leave, Hélène felt a sense of gratitude towards her friend. Despite the ups and downs of life, their friendship remained strong, a testament to the power of art and human connection.

"You should come see my latest exhibition," she said, as they parted ways on the street. "I'd love for you to be there."

Marc nodded, his eyes lighting up with excitement. "I'll be there, Hélène. Always."
