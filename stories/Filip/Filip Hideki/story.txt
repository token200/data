Filip Hideki was a man with a mysterious past. His full name, Filip Hideki, followed him everywhere, a constant reminder of his humble beginnings. Born in a small village on the outskirts of Tokyo, Filip had grown up surrounded by the hustle and bustle of city life. Despite his rough start, he had always been drawn to music, teaching himself to play the guitar as a teenager.
