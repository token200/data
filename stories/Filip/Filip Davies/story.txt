As a museum curator in the small town of Willow Creek, he spent most of his days surrounded by artifacts and relics from centuries past.

One day, while organizing an exhibit on the local history, Filip stumbled upon an old trunk that had been forgotten in the back of the museum's storage room. As he lifted the lid, a faint smell of smoke wafted out, and inside, he found a collection of letters written by his great-grandfather, a soldier who had fought alongside Allied forces during the war.
