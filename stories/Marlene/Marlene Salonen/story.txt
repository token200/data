She possessed an otherworldly beauty, with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair that cascaded down her back like a waterfall of night. Her smile could light up a room, and yet, it was a smile that spoke volumes of hidden emotions.

Marlene Salonen lived in the city, where she resided in a small, unassuming apartment above a quaint café.

But there was something more to Marlene Salonen than met the eye. She had a way of observing people that was almost unnerving, as if she could see right through their masks.
