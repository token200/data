Marlene Balodis stepped out into the crisp morning air, her eyes squinting against the glare of the sun as it rose over the horizon. She took a deep breath, feeling the cool mist of Lake Erie fill her lungs, and began her daily walk along the shore.

As she strolled, Marlene's mind wandered to the small beachside town where she had grown up. It was a place where everyone knew each other's business, and the summers were long and lazy. She remembered spending hours playing in the waves with her siblings, chasing after seagulls, and listening to the sound of the gulls crying overhead.

But life had taken its toll on Marlene. Her parents had passed away when she was young, leaving her to care for her younger brother. The financial struggles had been overwhelming, and she had eventually left the town to start fresh in Cleveland. She had worked hard to build a new life, but it wasn't without its costs.

As she walked, Marlene noticed a group of children playing on the beach, laughing and shouting as they chased after each other. It brought back memories of her own childhood, and for a moment, she felt a pang of nostalgia. She continued her walk, lost in thought, until she came to the old lighthouse that stood sentinel over the lake.

Marlene had always been fascinated by the lighthouse, its towering presence seeming to reach up towards the sky like a giant finger. As a child, she would often sneak away from her chores to explore its rooms and climb to the top of the lantern room. She remembered feeling brave and invincible as she gazed out over the water.

As she stood there, the wind whipping her hair into a frenzy, Marlene felt a sense of peace wash over her. It was a fleeting moment, but it was enough to make her realize that even though life had taken its toll, she was still standing. She thought about all the struggles she had faced, and the sacrifices she had made, but she knew that she would always carry the memories of her childhood with her.

With a newfound sense of resolve, Marlene began her walk back home, feeling the weight of her responsibilities lift slightly from her shoulders. She knew that she still had a long way to go, but for now, in this moment, everything felt okay.
