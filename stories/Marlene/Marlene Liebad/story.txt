Marlene Liebad was a woman with a reputation that preceded her. She was a private investigator, known for being one of the best in the business. Her sharp mind and quick wit had earned her a loyal client base, but also made her many enemies.

It was on a chilly autumn evening when Marlene received a visit from a young woman named Sarah. Sarah's eyes were filled with tears as she sat across from Marlene, clutching a small folder in her hand.

"Please, you have to help me," Sarah begged, her voice trembling. "My sister has gone missing and the police are stonewalling me."

Marlene's instincts told her that this was more than just another missing person case. She listened intently as Sarah recounted her sister's last days before she vanished.

As Marlene poured over the folder's contents - a few cryptic notes, a handful of phone records, and a single photograph - she began to piece together a complex puzzle. The threads seemed to point to one thing: Sarah's sister had been investigating some shady dealings in the city.

With her sharp mind racing, Marlene set out on the case, determined to uncover the truth behind her disappearance. She interviewed witnesses, scoured through documents, and even paid visits to some of the more unsavory characters on her list.

But as she delved deeper into the mystery, Marlene found herself being watched. She would catch glimpses of a figure lurking in the shadows, always just out of reach. It was as if she had a tail, someone who knew her every move and was waiting for her to slip up.

Despite the danger, Marlene pressed on, driven by her determination to solve the case. And then, one fateful night, she received a phone call that would change everything.

"Meet me at the old warehouse on 5th and Main," a low voice said. "Come alone."

Marlene hesitated for a moment before deciding to take the risk. As she approached the abandoned building, her heart pounding in her chest, she felt a sense of trepidation wash over her.

But as she stepped inside, a figure emerged from the darkness, their face illuminated by the faint light of a single bulb. It was Sarah's sister, alive and well - but with a warning that would leave Marlene stunned: "You're next."
