Rihards Moreau sat alone in his small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by stacks of old books and dusty trinkets. He was a man of few words, preferring to spend his days lost in the pages of a good novel or scribbling away in his worn leather journal.

As he poured himself a cup of cold coffee from the pot on the stove, Rihards' mind wandered back to the events that had led him to this moment. A former sailor who had spent years at sea, he had seen his share of storms and struggles. But it was during one fateful voyage that he had discovered his true passion – writing.

It was a dark night, and Rihards was huddled in the corner of the ship's cabin, trying to warm himself by the fire. He pulled out his journal and began to write, pouring all his thoughts and feelings onto the page. The words flowed like the sea itself, carrying him away on a tide of creativity.

Years later, Rihards had left the sea behind, trading it in for a life of quiet contemplation in this small apartment. He still wrote, often long into the night, when the world outside seemed to be hushed and the only sound was the scratching of his pen against the page.

As he sat there, lost in thought, Rihards became aware of a faint scratching at the door. It was a soft tap-tap-tap, like the quiet knocking of a small bird on the windowpane. He set down his coffee cup and rose from his chair, smoothing out his rumpled jacket before making his way to the entrance.

To his surprise, it was an old woman with piercing green eyes and a mischievous grin. She carried a worn leather satchel slung over her shoulder and a twinkle in her eye that made Rihards feel like he'd stumbled upon a treasure trove of secrets.

"What brings you here?" she asked, as if reading his mind. "Come to join me for a tale or two?"

Rihards nodded, feeling an inexplicable sense of belonging. And so, they sat down together, sipping coffee and spinning yarns that wove themselves into the fabric of Rihards' own stories. The scratching at the door became a distant memory, replaced by the scratching of their pens against the page – two writers lost in the world of words.
