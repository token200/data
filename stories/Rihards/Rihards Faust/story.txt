Rihards Faust was a young and ambitious scientist who had always been fascinated by the mysteries of the universe. Growing up in a small town, he spent most of his childhood gazing up at the stars, dreaming of what lay beyond the reaches of human understanding.

Despite his many talents, Rihards struggled to find success. His ideas were constantly dismissed by his peers, and he found himself stuck in a dead-end job that offered him little financial reward or recognition. It was this sense of frustration and disillusionment that led Rihards Faust to make a fateful decision: he would sell his soul to the devil himself in exchange for unlimited knowledge and power.
