Rihards White stepped out of his small, cluttered apartment and into the crisp morning air. He stretched his lanky frame, yawned, and began to walk down the street, his eyes scanning the crowded sidewalks for familiar faces. As he navigated through the throngs of people, Rihards couldn't help but feel a sense of detachment. He was always watching from the outside, observing the world around him without truly being a part of it.

Rihards had grown up on the streets, fending for himself since his parents' divorce when he was just a teenager. He had learned to rely only on himself, to never let anyone get too close. But despite this tough exterior, Rihards had a soft spot for those in need. He spent most of his free time volunteering at a local soup kitchen, serving hot meals to the homeless and marginalized.

As he walked, Rihards noticed a young girl sitting on a bench, staring intently at her phone. She looked lost and scared, like she was searching for something that might never be found. Rihards's instincts told him to approach her, to offer some words of comfort or perhaps even his own story. But he hesitated, unsure if he wanted to get involved.

Just then, a woman with a kind smile caught his eye. She was sitting on the bench beside the girl, speaking softly and stroking her hair. Rihards watched as the girl's eyes began to well up with tears, but the woman's words seemed to calm her, to soothe her fears.

"Hello," the woman said, turning to Rihards. "I'm Sarah. I've been watching this young lady sit on this bench for hours, trying to figure out what's wrong."

Rihards shrugged, feeling a pang of curiosity. "Just lost in thought, I guess."

Sarah nodded sympathetically. "We all have our struggles. But sometimes, it takes someone to listen and offer a helping hand to make all the difference."

As they spoke, Rihards felt something stir inside him. It was as if he had finally found someone who understood him, someone who saw beyond his tough exterior to the vulnerable soul beneath.

For a moment, Rihards forgot about his own struggles, forgot about the walls he had built around himself. He let himself be seen, let himself be heard. And as he looked at Sarah and the young girl, he knew that maybe, just maybe, it was time to let someone in.
