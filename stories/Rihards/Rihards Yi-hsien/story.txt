I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Rihards Yi-hsien. It's possible that this is a unique or original character concept, or it may be a name with no public record. If you'd like to provide more context or details about Rihards Yi-hsien, I can try to help.

However, if you'd like, I can create a short story around the name "Yi-hsien" in general, using my understanding of Chinese culture and history. Here's an example:

---

In the misty alleys of 19th century Taipei, a young man named Yi-hsien walked alone, his eyes scanning the crowded streets for any sign of trouble. A member of the local Hakka community, Yi-hsien was well-respected among his peers for his bravery and cunning.

As he turned a corner, Yi-hsien spotted a group of rough-looking men harassing a young merchant. Without hesitation, the young man stepped forward, his eyes flashing with anger. The attackers took a step back, intimidated by Yi-hsien's fearless demeanor.

"What seems to be the problem?" Yi-hsien asked, his voice firm but polite.

The leader of the group sneered at him. "You're just a lowly Hakka," he spat. "We don't take orders from you."

Yi-hsien smiled wryly and produced a small wooden cane from his pocket. With a few swift movements, he dispatched the attackers with precision and skill.

As the dust settled, the merchant approached Yi-hsien, his eyes wide with gratitude. "Thank you, sir," he said, bowing deeply. "I owe you one."

Yi-hsien chuckled and patted the merchant's shoulder. "You don't owe me anything," he said. "Just be more careful in the future, and maybe we'll never meet again."

And with that, Yi-hsien walked off into the misty night, disappearing into the crowd as mysteriously as he had appeared.

Please let me know if you'd like me to continue working on this story or start fresh with a new character concept.
