Rihards Jankowska stepped into his small, cluttered office, surrounded by the memories of a lifetime. His eyes scanned the room, taking in the faded photographs of his family, the worn leather armchair where he had spent countless hours writing letters to loved ones who had long since passed away, and the shelves lined with dog-eared copies of Dickens and Dostoevsky.

As the former editor-in-chief of Latvia's most esteemed literary magazine, Rihards had been instrumental in launching the careers of some of the country's most celebrated writers. His keen eye for talent and his passion for storytelling had earned him a reputation as one of the most respected voices in Latvian literature.

But now, at 65 years old, Rihards was retired, and his focus had shifted from publishing to preserving the literary legacy he had helped create. He spent his days poring over manuscripts, editing submissions, and offering words of encouragement to aspiring writers who sought his guidance.

Despite his advanced age, Rihards still possessed a spark that ignited in the minds of those around him. His sharp mind and quick wit could tackle even the most complex arguments with ease, and his kindness had earned him a special place in the hearts of many who knew him.

One afternoon, as he sat at his desk, surrounded by stacks of papers and dog-eared books, a young writer knocked on the door. "Rihards, I'd love to share my latest work with you," she said, her eyes shining with excitement.

Rihards' face lit up as he ushered the young woman into his office. As they sat down together, he listened intently to her story, offering words of praise and constructive criticism that would help shape her manuscript into something truly remarkable.

For Rihards, there was no greater joy than watching someone bring their dreams to life. He had seen so many writers come and go over the years, but this one... this one had something special. As he nodded along with each word she spoke, a quiet satisfaction settled in his chest, a reminder that his work was far from done.

As the afternoon drew to a close, Rihards smiled at the young writer, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "You have talent," he said, his voice warm and genuine. "Don't ever let anyone tell you otherwise."
