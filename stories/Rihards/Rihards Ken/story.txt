One day, while strolling through the city streets, Rihards Ken stumbled upon a small art gallery tucked away in a quiet alley. The exhibit was comprised of works by local artists, but one piece in particular caught his eye: a haunting portrait of a woman with piercing green eyes. There was something about the painting that resonated deeply with Rihards Ken.

As he stood before the artwork, lost in thought, the gallery owner approached him. "You have a certain... je ne sais quoi," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I sense that you appreciate art more than just its surface-level beauty."
