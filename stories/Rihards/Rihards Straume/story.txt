Rihards Straume was a man shrouded in mystery. Few people knew much about his life before he arrived in the small town of Krummaburg, nestled deep within the Baltic forest. He moved with an air of quiet confidence, his piercing blue eyes scanning the crowds with an intensity that made others feel uneasy.

As a local butcher, Straume was known for his exceptional skill with a knife and his ability to craft the most exquisite meat dishes in the region. However, there were whispers among the townsfolk about his troubled past. Some said he had served time for murder, while others claimed he had been involved in dark magic rituals.

One winter evening, as the snow fell gently outside, Straume's apprentice, Hans, approached him with a nervous look on his face. "Rihards, I've seen something," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "I was out collecting firewood when I saw a group of shadowy figures lurking near the old windmill on the outskirts of town."

Straume's expression remained unreadable, but Hans could sense a flicker of interest in his eyes. He nodded and motioned for Hans to follow him. Together, they walked towards the abandoned windmill, the only sound being the crunch of snow beneath their feet.

As they approached the windmill, Straume produced a small, ornate knife from his belt. With a deft touch, he began to examine the surrounding area, sniffing the air with an intensity that made Hans's skin prickle with unease.

Suddenly, Straume froze, his head cocked to one side as if listening for something. Hans followed his gaze and saw a faint light flickering in the distance. "It's coming," Straume whispered, a hint of excitement creeping into his voice.

Without another word, Straume and Hans turned and sprinted back towards town, leaving the mysterious figures to their fate. As they emerged from the forest, the townsfolk gathered around them, their eyes wide with a mix of fear and curiosity.

Rihards Straume stood tall, his piercing blue eyes burning with an inner fire that seemed almost...otherworldly. He smiled, a small, enigmatic smile, and vanished into the crowd, leaving behind only whispers of his true nature.
