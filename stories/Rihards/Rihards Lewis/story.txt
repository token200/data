Rihards Lewis was a man of mystery, shrouded in an air of quiet confidence. A former Special Forces operative turned mercenary, he had seen his fair share of battles and bloodshed. But despite his rugged exterior, there was something about him that drew people to him - a sense of gravitas, perhaps, or a hint of vulnerability behind those piercing blue eyes.

It had been five years since Rihards last set foot in the States, and he had spent most of that time working as a hired gun for various factions around the world. He had seen some dark places, done some terrible things, but he had never lost his sense of purpose - to protect those who needed protection, to defend the innocent.

One day, Rihards received a message from an old acquaintance, asking him to meet in a small café on the outskirts of Prague. The man was cryptic about what he wanted, but Rihards knew better than to ignore an invitation when it came from someone with influence.

As he sipped his coffee and waited for his contact, Rihards couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. He glanced around the café, taking in the murmur of conversation, the clinking of cups, and the hushed whispers of passersby on the street outside. It was a moment of quietude before the storm, but he could sense it gathering.

Just as Rihards was starting to get restless, his contact appeared - a tall, slender man with piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into him.

"Rihards," the man said, his voice low and urgent. "I have a job for you. One that requires...discretion."

Rihards raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. "What kind of job?"

The man smiled, a cold, calculating smile. "Let's just say it involves extraction. And someone who is not going to be happy about being taken out."

Without another word, the two men set off into the shadows, disappearing into the night like ghosts. Rihards knew that once he started down this path, there was no turning back - but for the first time in years, he felt a spark of excitement ignite within him.

This time, it wasn't just about money or fame - it was about right and wrong, and whether he had what it took to make a difference. The world might be a messy place, but Rihards Lewis was ready to take on whatever came next.
