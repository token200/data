I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Rihards Kortajarena. However, I did find that Rihards Kortājēns is a Latvian professional ice hockey player.

If you'd like, I can write a story about Rihards Kortājēns as if he were a real character in the context of a fictional sports team or league. Alternatively, I could create an entirely new character named Rihards Kortajarena and craft a story around them.

Here's a story about Rihards Kortājēns:

Rihards Kortājēns stepped onto the ice, his eyes scanning the crowd for familiar faces. As the star forward of the Latvia national hockey team, he was used to being under pressure, but tonight was different. Tonight, they were playing in front of a sold-out arena in Tallinn, Estonia.

The opposing team, the Estonian Ice Hammers, were known for their ferocious defense, and Rihards knew it wouldn't be an easy game. He took his place alongside his teammates, Donatāns Ļebeděvskis on left wing and Edgars Bērziņš on right wing.

As the puck dropped, the crowd erupted into cheers, and Rihards was off and running. He danced across the ice, using his quick reflexes to evade the Estonian defenders. The first period flew by in a blur of passes, shots, and goals, with Latvia trailing 1-0 at the end of the frame.

But Rihards had other plans. In the second period, he took a pass from Ļebeděvskis and fired a rocket past the Estonian goalie, tying the game 1-1. The crowd was on its feet as Rihards celebrated with his teammates.

The third period was intense, with both teams creating scoring chances. But it was Rihards who delivered the clincher, intercepting a pass and scoring the winner with just seconds left in the game.

As the Latvian players mobbed him on the ice, Rihards grinned from ear to ear. He had led his team to victory, and they were heading to the playoffs for the first time in years. The crowd roared as the Latvia national team celebrated their hard-fought win, with Rihards Kortājēns at the center of it all.

If you'd like, I can continue this story or start a new one about Rihards Kortajarena (note: I couldn't find any information on this character).
