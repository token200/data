Rihards Sten trudged through the snow-covered streets of Riga, his boots crunching on the frozen crystals. The cold was biting, but it couldn't penetrate the numbness that had settled over him since he'd lost her.

He'd known Anna since childhood, and they'd grown up together, exploring the winding streets and canals of their beloved city. She'd been the one who'd always made him laugh, who'd always challenged him to be his best self. And now, she was gone.

Sten's eyes wandered to the small café where they used to sit on rainy afternoons, sipping coffee and watching the world go by. He hadn't set foot in there since her funeral. The thought of going back made his heart ache anew.

He turned a corner, lost in thought, as he passed by the statue of the Latvian poet Frīdrijs Bungers. Sten had always been fascinated by the poet's melancholic verses, and now they seemed to echo his own sorrowful mood.

As he walked, the snow began to fall thicker, veiling the city in a white blanket. Sten felt like he was walking through a dream, one that was slowly disappearing into thin air. He knew he couldn't stay lost forever; eventually, he'd have to face the world again.

He stopped at a small café on the corner of a quiet street and ordered a hot chocolate. The aroma wafting from the cup was like a fleeting hug from an old friend. Sten took a sip, letting the warmth spread through his chest.

As he sat there, sipping his drink, a memory surfaced. Anna and he had once sat on this very same stool, laughing over a sketchbook filled with Riga's architectural wonders. She'd made him laugh so hard that day; he could still recall the sound of her giggles echoing in his ears.

The image brought tears to Sten's eyes, but as he looked around the café, he felt a spark of inspiration ignite within him. He pulled out his sketchbook and began to draw, letting his pencil wander across the page as memories poured forth.

In that moment, something shifted inside Rihards Sten. The grief still lingered, but it no longer consumed him. With each stroke of his pen, he felt a glimmer of hope rising like a sunrise over the snow-covered rooftops. Maybe, just maybe, life was worth drawing again, even in its darkest moments.
