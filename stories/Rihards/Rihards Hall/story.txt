Rihards Hall was a man shrouded in mystery, his past a labyrinth of unexplained events and eerie coincidences. Few people knew much about him, except that he had an uncanny ability to appear at the most inopportune moments.

It started with small things. He would show up at work on time, always dressed impeccably in his tailored suits. His colleagues found it unnerving, yet Rihards Hall seemed oblivious to their concerns. As the days passed, however, strange occurrences began to plague him. Equipment would malfunction, and he would find himself face-to-face with people who claimed to have known him before.

One evening, Rihards Hall walked into a local pub, ordering a whiskey without a word of introduction. The bartender raised an eyebrow as he handed over the glass. "You're that guy, aren't you?" he asked, his voice low and curious.

Rihards Hall smiled wryly, his eyes glinting with an otherworldly intensity. "Perhaps," he replied, taking a sip of his drink.

As the night wore on, more people approached him, each with their own story about Rihards Hall's past. They spoke of lost loves and forgotten lives, of places that seemed to have vanished into thin air. The patrons grew uneasy, unsure whether they were witnessing a genuine encounter or some sort of elaborate performance.

Eventually, the pub emptied, leaving only Rihards Hall and the bartender. As he prepared to leave, the bartender leaned in close and whispered, "You're not like anyone I've ever met."

Rihards Hall chuckled low in his throat. "That's what they say about me," he said, before vanishing into the night.

The next morning, the pub received an unusual delivery: a package containing no note or explanation, only Rihards Hall's business card. It read simply: "For those who know."
