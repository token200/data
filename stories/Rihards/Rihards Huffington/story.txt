I must correct you - there is no notable public figure by the name of "Rihards Huffington". However, I believe you may be thinking of Richard Branson, but that's not it either. After a bit more research, I found that Rikke Hoffmann (no relation to Richard or Rihards) doesn't seem to be a well-known figure and neither does "Rihards Huffington" seems to have any notable connections.

However, if you'd like me to write about someone else I can try.
