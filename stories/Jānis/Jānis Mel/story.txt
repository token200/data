Jānis Mel was a man with an unusual profession – he was the city's resident "memory curator." In a world where memories could be extracted from one's mind and stored in a physical form, Jānis's job involved collecting, preserving, and sharing these memories.

He worked in a small, cluttered shop filled with rows of dusty jars containing delicate glass orbs that glowed softly. Each orb contained a memory, carefully retrieved from the minds of those who had contributed them to his collection.

One day, a young woman named Līga entered Jānis's shop, her eyes red-rimmed from crying. She told him about her grandmother, who had passed away just the previous day. The memories they had shared were fading fast, and she wanted to hold onto them as long as possible.

Jānis nodded sympathetically and led Līga to a jar with an orb that glowed with a warm, golden light. This was her grandmother's memory – a sunny afternoon spent baking cookies together in the kitchen. Jānis carefully extracted the orb from the jar and handed it to Līga.

As she held the orb, memories flooded back into her mind. She remembered her grandmother's laughter, the smell of fresh-baked cookies wafting through the air, and the feel of her warm hands on hers. Tears streamed down her face as Jānis watched, his own eyes misty with understanding.

"Where did you get this orb?" Līga asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

"I collected it from your grandmother's mind," Jānis replied softly. "It's a rare and precious thing – the memories of loved ones can never truly fade."

Over the next few days, Jānis helped Līga preserve many more memories of her grandmother. He listened as she spoke about their favorite stories, songs, and traditions, carefully capturing these moments in his jars.

As word of his work spread, people began to seek out Jānis's services. A widower came seeking the memory of his late wife's smile; a couple wanted to relive their first kiss; and an elderly man yearned to remember the sound of his childhood home.

Jānis worked tirelessly to collect these memories, preserving them in his jars like precious treasures. And as he did, he realized that his role was not just about collecting and storing memories – it was about keeping the past alive, one delicate glass orb at a time.
