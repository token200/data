In the quaint town of Riga, Latvia, there lived a young and talented clockmaker named Jānis Handschuh. He was renowned for his exceptional skills in restoring ancient timepieces to their former glory. People would travel from all over to seek Jānis Handschuh's expertise, and he never failed to impress them with his attention to detail.

One sunny afternoon, a wealthy collector arrived in Riga seeking Jānis Handschuh's services. The collector had acquired an intricately carved grandfather clock that had been passed down through generations of his family, but it was no longer keeping time. Desperate to have the clock restored to its former function, the collector paid Jānis Handschuh a handsome sum for his work.

Jānis Handschuh began by meticulously cleaning the clock's mechanisms and examining every cog and gear. He carefully disassembled the clock, taking great care not to damage any of the delicate parts. As he worked, he hummed to himself, lost in thought as he pondered the clock's history and how it might have been used over the centuries.

After several days of tireless work, Jānis Handschuh finally had the clock ticking away once more. The collector was overjoyed and thanked Jānis Handschuh profusely for his exceptional skill. As a token of appreciation, he presented Jānis Handschuh with a beautiful pocket watch that had been passed down through his own family.

Jānis Handschuh was deeply moved by the gift and promised to take good care of it. He wound the watch and held it up to the light, admiring its intricate engravings and delicate mechanisms. As he did so, he couldn't help but feel a sense of pride in his work and a deep connection to the clock that had been restored to its former glory.

From that day forward, Jānis Handschuh continued to excel as a master clockmaker, renowned throughout Riga for his exceptional skills. His workshop became a place where people would come not only to have their clocks repaired but also to admire the beauty of time itself. And every time he worked on a new project, Jānis Handschuh's full name echoed in the minds of those who knew him as a master of his craft, Jānis Handschuh, the clockmaker extraordinaire.
