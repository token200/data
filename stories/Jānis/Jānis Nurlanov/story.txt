I couldn't find any information on a person named Jānis Nurlanov. It is possible that this person is fictional or not well-known.

However, I can generate a story about a character with the given name:

Jānis Nurlanov was a young and ambitious journalist who had just landed his dream job at the largest newspaper in Riga, Latvia. Born to a family of journalists, Jānis had always known that he wanted to follow in their footsteps and tell stories that needed to be told.

With his quick wit and sharp instincts, Jānis quickly made a name for himself as one of the most talented young reporters at the paper. He spent long hours researching and writing, determined to uncover the truth behind every story he covered.

One day, Jānis was assigned to cover a major scandal involving corruption in the city's government. Despite the pressure from his editors to stick to the script, Jānis refused to back down, convinced that he had stumbled upon something big.

As he dug deeper into the story, Jānis encountered fierce resistance from those who wanted to keep the truth hidden. But he persevered, relying on his sharp mind and quick thinking to stay one step ahead of the corrupt officials.

Finally, after weeks of hard work, Jānis broke the story, revealing a web of deceit and corruption that shook the city to its core. His bravery and tenacity earned him widespread acclaim, and he became known as one of the most respected journalists in Latvia.

Years later, when Jānis was accepted into the prestigious Journalist Academy, it was not surprising that his alma mater chose to honor him by bestowing upon him a lifetime achievement award. The citation read: "For outstanding contributions to investigative journalism, Jānis Nurlanov has set an exemplary standard for courage and integrity in the pursuit of truth."
