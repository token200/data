I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Jānis Németh. It's possible that this character doesn't exist in popular culture or literature.

However, I can create a story about a character with the given name and surname. Here is a 400-word story:

Jānis Németh was a skilled linguist who had spent his entire career studying the ancient tongues of Eastern Europe. His full name, Jānis Németh, was one that he rarely introduced to people outside of academic circles. He preferred to be known simply as Jānis, and only shared his surname with those who were familiar with his work.

Despite his reclusive nature, Jānis was renowned for his expertise in deciphering forgotten languages. His breakthroughs had shed new light on the history of Slavic peoples, and he had become a sought-after consultant for museums and historical societies.

One day, Jānis received an unexpected visit from a young woman named Sofia. She introduced herself as a historian working on a project to translate ancient texts, and was eager to learn more about the languages that Jānis specialized in. As they spoke, it became clear that Sofia's research was focused on the Némethian dialect, a language that had long been lost to the sands of time.

Intrigued by Sofia's work, Jānis agreed to share his knowledge with her. Over several weeks, he taught her the intricacies of the Némethian script and phonology, and helped her to decipher a series of cryptic texts. As they worked together, Jānis found himself drawn to Sofia's passion and energy, and began to see her as more than just a colleague.

As their collaboration came to an end, Jānis was struck by the realization that he had been missing out on a great deal by keeping his name to himself. He decided then and there that he would start using his full name, including his surname, in public. It was a small act of courage, but one that marked a turning point in Jānis Németh's life.

From that day forward, Jānis felt more confident in himself and in his work. He continued to study the ancient tongues, but now he did so with a renewed sense of purpose and community. And whenever he introduced himself, he smiled, knowing that he was not just a scholar, but a man with a story to tell.
