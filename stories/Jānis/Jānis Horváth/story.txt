I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Jānis Horváth. However, I can create a new story based on your request.

Jānis Horváth was a master clockmaker from Riga, Latvia. He lived in the late 19th century, an era of great industrialization and technological advancements. Despite this, Jānis remained devoted to his craft, spending countless hours in his small workshop perfecting the intricate mechanisms of timepieces.

One day, while working on a particularly complex clock, Jānis received an unusual request from the city's mayor. The mayor wished for a timepiece that would not only keep precise time but also incorporate a unique feature - the ability to display a different phase of the moon each night.

Intrigued by the challenge, Jānis accepted the task and set to work. He spent months studying the movements of the lunar cycle, experimenting with various gears and mechanisms. As he worked, his workshop became cluttered with fragments of brass, copper, and wood, but Jānis saw beauty in each piece.

Finally, after much trial and error, Jānis completed the timepiece. The mayor was overjoyed with the result, and soon, word of the moon-phase clock spread throughout the city. People from all walks of life came to see the marvel, mesmerized by its intricate mechanisms and the way it seemed to dance in the light.

As news of his creation reached beyond Riga's borders, Jānis became a celebrated figure, invited to showcase his work at international exhibitions. His moon-phase clock won several awards, cementing Jānis Horváth's reputation as one of the world's finest clockmakers.

Years later, when Jānis passed away, leaving behind a legacy of timepieces and an inspired workshop full of wooden tools, locals whispered that his spirit still worked among the clockwork mechanisms, guiding the hands towards the celestial rhythms.
