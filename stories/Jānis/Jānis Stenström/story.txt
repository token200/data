Jānis Stenström, a former Latvian sailor, stood at the edge of the dock, his weathered eyes gazing out at the sea. The salty air whipped through his thinning grey hair as he reminisced about the life he left behind.

As a young man, Jānis had set sail for distant lands, braving storms and rough seas in search of adventure. He'd spent years at sea, sailing from Riga to Rotterdam, and everywhere in between. His was a nomadic existence, where the only constants were the creaking of wooden hulls and the calls of seagulls.

But as the years went by, Jānis's body began to tell the tale of his years spent on the water. His back ached with every step, his hands scarred from decades of grasping oars and ropes. He'd tried to settle down once, marry a young woman named Līga and start a family in Riga. But the sea had always called him back.

Eventually, Jānis returned to the docks, where he worked as a sailor until his knees gave out on him. Now, at 70 years old, he spent his days watching ships come and go, feeling like an outsider among the wharfhands and merchants.

Despite his rough exterior, Jānis had a heart of gold. He remembered stories of the sea in a way that no one else did – the tales of storms and sunsets, of whales and sea monsters. At night, when the city lights twinkled across the water, he'd sit on the dock, listening for the whispers of the sea.

One evening, as Jānis sat lost in thought, a young girl with bright pink hair wandered onto the dock. She looked lost, yet not quite scared – more like she was searching for something. Jānis watched her as she gazed out at the horizon, feeling an unexpected sense of connection to this stranger.

Without a word, Jānis offered the girl a wooden spoon from his pocket and began to stir a pot of fish soup simmering on the dock's gas stove. As they ate together under the starry sky, he told her stories of the sea – tales that brought tears to her eyes and sparkled in her gaze.

For a brief moment, Jānis Stenström felt like he'd found his place back at the docks.
