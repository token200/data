Jānis Boulanger trudged through the snow-covered streets of Riga, his woolen coat flapping behind him like a wounded bird. It was February 1918, and the Russian Revolution had left Latvia in a state of turmoil. As a young baker's apprentice, Jānis had seen better days. His family's bakery, once the go-to spot for sweet treats, now struggled to stay afloat amidst the chaos.

As he approached the bakery, Jānis could see his brother, Andrejs, frantically scrubbing down the counters with a mixture of water and vinegar. The brothers' father had passed away just a few months ago, leaving them to carry on the family business. But it was proving harder than ever.

Jānis took off his cap and let out a sigh, his eyes scanning the empty streets. He could smell the faint scent of burnt bread wafting from the nearby blacksmith's shop. It seemed like every business in Riga was struggling to survive under the new regime. The brothers' family had always prided themselves on producing the finest pastries and breads in the city, but with the shortages and rationing, it was becoming increasingly difficult.

Just then, Andrejs caught sight of his brother and hurried over to give him a hearty handshake. "Jānis, I've got an idea," he said, his eyes sparkling with determination. "We'll start selling traditional bread again – you know, the kind made from flour we can get our hands on." Jānis nodded, intrigued by the plan.

Together, they gathered what ingredients they could scrounge up and began mixing dough by candlelight in the bakery's back room. The aroma of warm yeast wafted through the air, transporting them to a time before the war had torn their city apart. As they worked, they spoke little, lost in thought, but sharing a deep bond forged from years of hard work and shared struggles.

When the bread was finally baked, Jānis and Andrejs set out into the night, carrying baskets overflowing with freshly baked loaves to the hungry masses on the streets. It wasn't much, but it was something. They took pride in their humble offering – a taste of comfort in a city gone mad. Word spread quickly about the bakery that refused to give up, and soon more people came to buy their bread than ever before.

Jānis Boulanger knew that Riga would one day return to its former glory, but for now, it was just him and his brother carrying on the family tradition, one loaf at a time. As they walked through the city streets, Jānis smiled wistfully, his eyes scanning the shadows, knowing that there was still hope in this uncertain world – as long as there were bread and people willing to share it with each other.
