As a child, Jānis would spend hours listening to traditional Ecuadorian folk songs on his grandmother's old gramophone. He was particularly drawn to the melodies and rhythms that seemed to weave together like intricate threads. As he grew older, his fascination with music only deepened, and he began teaching himself to play the guitar.

Jānis Avendaño spent countless hours practicing, perfecting his craft under the guidance of a local music teacher who recognized his exceptional talent.
