Jānis De Rossi stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the sounds of Riga's streets enveloping him like a warm hug. He had been away for too long, his time in Berlin and London feeling more like exile than expat life. As he made his way through the crowded station, the bright colors of the city drew him back in.

He thought about his family, about how they would greet him with open arms after all these years. His mother's cooking, his father's stories – it was time to come home. Jānis had been away for five long years, chasing dreams and trying to make a name for himself as a writer. But the words that flowed so easily on paper didn't seem to translate to the pages of actual books.

He hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of his family's old apartment. As they sped through the city, Jānis watched the landmarks he had grown up with pass by – the Old Town gate, the Freedom Monument. It was like seeing the city for the first time again.

When they arrived at the apartment, his mother flung open the door and swept him into a tight hug. His father was sitting in the living room, a cup of coffee in his hand, a look of quiet amusement on his face. "Welcome home, Jānis," he said, his voice gruff but warm.

The days that followed were a blur of family dinners, stories about old times, and the sound of his mother's laughter filling the apartment. For the first time in years, Jānis felt like himself again – not just an expat trying to make it in the world, but a son returning home.

But as much as he wanted to stay buried in this warm, comforting bubble, he knew it couldn't last. He had a deadline looming for his next book, and his mother's gentle prodding was getting louder by the day. "You must write something new, Jānis," she said one evening, as they sat together on the couch.

"Mother, I have to focus on my life here, not just my writing," he replied, trying to push the words back down his throat. But deep inside, a spark had been lit. He knew that with the love and support of his family, and the energy of this vibrant city, he could find a way to bring it all together – his passion for writing, his love for his country, and his desire to make a name for himself as an artist.
