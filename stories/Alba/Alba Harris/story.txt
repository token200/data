Alba Harris was known for her razor-sharp wit and quick tongue, but few people knew that beneath her tough exterior lay a heart of gold. As a successful event planner, she had built a reputation for delivering flawless weddings and corporate events, and her clients adored her for it.

Despite her many accomplishments, Alba struggled to find love in the city. She had tried online dating, speed dating, and even asked her friends to set her up with their single friends – but nothing seemed to stick. Her friends and family often teased her about being too picky or too focused on her career, but Alba knew that she deserved better.

One evening, while closing down a particularly grueling event, Alba stumbled upon a small jazz club tucked away in a quiet alley. She had never been a big fan of jazz, but something about the soulful sounds wafting from the club's entrance drew her in. Inside, she found herself surrounded by the smooth sounds of a solo pianist, his fingers dancing across the keys with ease.

As Alba listened, lost in the music, a figure emerged from the shadows – a tall, dark-haired man with piercing green eyes that seemed to hold a thousand stories within them. He introduced himself as Leo, and they struck up a conversation about everything from their shared love of art to their childhood memories.

For the first time in years, Alba felt a spark of connection that went beyond surface-level small talk. She laughed at Leo's witty remarks, and he listened intently as she shared her passions with him. As the night wore on, they discovered a deep affection for one another – a bond forged over late-night conversations and impromptu jazz sessions.

As the evening drew to a close, Alba Harris smiled up at Leo, feeling like she had finally found someone who saw beyond her professional exterior. "I'm so glad I stumbled upon this club," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. Leo's eyes crinkled at the corners as he replied, "Me too, Alba. Me too."
