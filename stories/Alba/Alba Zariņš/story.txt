Alba Zariņš was a young and ambitious journalist who had made a name for herself in Riga, Latvia's capital city. With her sharp wit and keen instincts, she had already earned the respect of her colleagues and the trust of her sources.

As she walked down the streets of Old Town, Alba's eyes scanned the crowds, taking in every detail. She was on the hunt for a story, one that would expose the corruption and incompetence that had been plaguing the city's government for years.

Alba's thoughts turned to her recent encounter with the mayor, who had brushed off her questions about the recent rise in property taxes. She knew he was hiding something, and she was determined to get to the bottom of it.

As she turned a corner, Alba spotted a familiar figure standing outside the city hall building. It was the mayor's aide, Jānis, who had also been evasive during their previous conversation. Alba's instincts told her that Jānis might be more open to talking if she approached him in a different way.

She took a deep breath and walked towards him, a friendly smile spreading across her face. "Jānis, how are you today?" she asked, extending her hand.

Jānis looked surprised by the sudden change in tone, but he quickly recovered. "Alba Zariņš, it's good to see you," he replied, shaking her hand.

As they talked, Alba skillfully steered the conversation towards more sensitive topics. Jānis, sensing that she was not there to chat casually, began to open up about the mayor's office and its dealings with private developers.

Alba listened intently, her mind racing with possibilities. She knew that this information could be the key to breaking the story of her lifetime. As they parted ways, Alba felt a sense of satisfaction and excitement. She had finally gotten Jānis to talk, and she was one step closer to uncovering the truth.

With her notebook full of notes and her mind buzzing with ideas, Alba Zariņš returned to her office, ready to put the pieces together and create a story that would shake the very foundations of Riga's government.
