Alba Yu's eyes scanned the crowded market square, her slender fingers drumming an impatient rhythm on the worn wooden cane that supported her left leg. The injury had left her with a perpetual limp, but it hadn't slowed her down one bit. Not when there was work to be done.

As a member of the infamous Yu clan, Alba had grown up with a sense of duty and responsibility that bordered on obsession. Her full name, Alba Sophia Yu, rang out across the marketplace as vendors and customers alike bowed or curtsied in greeting. It was a habit she'd never gotten used to, but one that came with being part of an ancient and respected lineage.

Alba's gaze locked onto a shady-looking individual lurking at the edge of the square. He was known only as Raven, a skilled thief with connections to some of the most powerful families in the city. Alba's eyes narrowed as she watched him eyeing the nearby stalls, his hands restlessly drumming against his own thigh.

She knew that Raven was trouble, and yet... there was something about him that drew her in. Maybe it was the way he moved with an air of quiet confidence, or the sharp lines etched into his angular face. Whatever it was, Alba found herself wanting to know more about this enigmatic figure.

With a flick of her head, Alba dispatched one of her loyal bodyguards to fetch Raven, giving him a clear path through the crowd. He approached her with a smile that hinted at secrets and mischief, and Alba's gut tightened in anticipation.

"You're a hard woman to find, Alba Sophia Yu," he said, his voice low and husky. "But I think we can help each other out."

Without another word, Raven slid onto the stool beside her, and Alba felt the tension within her begin to unravel. This was what she'd been searching for – someone who knew the shadows as well as she did.

As the sun began to set over the city, casting long shadows across the square, Alba leaned in close, her voice barely above a whisper. "What do you propose we do, Raven?"

A sly grin spread across his face, and he launched into a plan that would change everything for Alba Sophia Yu – forever.
