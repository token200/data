Alba Trevisan stepped into the dimly lit gallery, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of her sister, Luna. The air was thick with the scent of old books and dust, a familiar smell that brought back memories of their childhood spent among the shelves of their family's antique shop.

As she made her way through the crowd, Alba's gaze landed on a figure standing by the window, lost in thought. Her sister, Luna Trevisan, was deep in conversation with a stranger, their voices hushed and intense. Alba's curiosity got the better of her, and she weaved through the guests to join them.

Luna turned to face her, a mixture of surprise and concern etched on her face. "Alba, I wasn't expecting you," she said, her voice low and guarded.

The stranger, a woman with piercing green eyes, smiled warmly at Alba. "I'm afraid I've taken the liberty of speaking with your sister about our shared interests," she explained, extending a hand.

As they introduced themselves, Alba learned that the woman's name was Sophia, a fellow book collector and historian. The conversation flowed easily, and soon the three were discussing everything from rare manuscripts to their favorite authors.

Luna Trevisan watched her sister with a thoughtful expression, her mind working overtime to reconcile Alba's passion for discovery with her own more practical approach to life. She had always known that Alba was driven by curiosity, but she had never fully understood the extent of it.

As the evening wore on, Sophia excused herself to fetch more refreshments, leaving Luna and Alba alone once again. "I've been meaning to ask you, Alba," her sister said, her voice softening. "Have you given any thought to taking a break from the shop? You're always so dedicated to the business."

Alba Trevisan hesitated, unsure of how to respond. She had always loved the antique shop, but lately, she had been feeling stifled by its routine. Perhaps this chance encounter with Sophia was just what she needed â€“ a reminder that there was more to life than dusty artifacts and familiar routines.

As they made their way through the crowded gallery, Alba couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement for the future, and the possibilities that lay ahead for her and her sister.
