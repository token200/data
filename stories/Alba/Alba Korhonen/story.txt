Alba Korhonen stepped out of her small Helsinki flat and into the crisp winter air, the scent of pine trees wafting up from the adjacent park. She breathed deeply, feeling invigorated as she made her way to her favorite café in the district.

As a freelance writer and part-time tutor, Alba's days blended together in a haze of deadlines and lectures. But on mornings like this, with the snowflakes gently falling onto the frozen lake, she felt most alive. She had always been drawn to the written word – the way it could transport her to far-off lands, or capture the intricate rhythms of everyday life.

At 25, Alba was still finding her voice as a writer. Her debut short story collection had received praise from critics and readers alike, but she knew that the real challenge lay ahead: crafting novels that would leave a lasting impression on readers. She spent countless hours poring over literary anthologies, scribbling notes in coffee-stained margins.

As she waited for her cappuccino to be prepared, Alba pulled out her phone and dialed the number of an old friend from high school. Lotta had always been a source of encouragement, and today was no exception. Over coffee, they discussed everything from art exhibitions to recent literary triumphs, their conversations weaving in and out of each other like the patterns on Alba's favorite scarf.

In between cups of coffee, Lotta mentioned that she'd signed her friend Kari up for a writing workshop at Aalto University – something about working with Finnish mythology. Intrigued, Alba asked if Kari was doing all right. He had started out as a promising young writer but, after his first few novels tanked, he seemed to fade into the background.

Lotta told her that Kari was still writing, albeit quietly; only sharing small pieces on social media for an online community of readers to find and appreciate. Alba's eyes widened in surprise – the way writers navigated rejection and creative uncertainty stung her own heart, even if she'd never written a novel yet.

As they parted ways outside the café, Lotta handed Alba a scribbled note: "Keep writing," it read. "The stories are there; you just need to believe." With those words, Alba felt another surge of inspiration course through her veins – she was on the right path, even if it meant charting uncharted waters.

She returned home with renewed purpose and a single idea that came to mind when she sat at her desk later that day.
