Alba Dubois stood at the edge of the cliff, her dark hair whipping in the wind as she gazed out at the vast expanse of ocean stretching before her. The small cottage she had rented for the summer was a cozy retreat from the chaos of her life in London, and for now, it felt like a sanctuary.

As a renowned detective with a sharp mind and a quick wit, Alba Dubois had solved some of the city's most baffling cases. But despite her success, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. Maybe it was the thrill of the chase, or maybe it was the quiet moments like this one, where she could finally be herself.

The sound of seagulls filled the air as Alba walked along the beach, her eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of life. She had always loved the ocean, finding solace in its vastness and power. As a child, she would spend hours exploring the tide pools and collecting shells, lost in wonder.

As she walked, the waves crashed against the shore, their rhythmic beat a constant reminder of the world's unpredictability. Alba Dubois thought about her latest case, one that still lingered in her mind like an open wound. The details were fuzzy, but the feeling remained - a sense of unease that wouldn't shake.

She reached a small cove, sheltered from the wind by towering cliffs. The sunlight danced across the waves, creating a dazzling display of light and color. Alba Dubois closed her eyes, letting the tranquility wash over her. This was what she needed - a chance to clear her mind and recharge.

For now, Alba Dubois let go of her worries and simply breathed in the salty air. As she stood there, the world seemed a little less complicated, and for that, she was grateful. The sound of the waves grew louder, a soothing melody that lulled her into a state of peace. And for once, Alba Dubois felt truly at home.
