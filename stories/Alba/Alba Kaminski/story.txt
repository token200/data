With her camera slung over her shoulder, Alba Kaminski navigated through alleys and side streets, searching for the perfect composition.

One drizzly afternoon, while exploring a particularly run-down neighborhood, Alba Kaminski stumbled upon an abandoned mural painted on the wall of an old warehouse.
