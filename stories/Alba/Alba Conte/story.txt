Alba Conte was an enigmatic figure, shrouded in mystery and whispers. She was known only by her surname, which was whispered in hushed tones among those who knew of her existence. Few had seen her, yet many claimed to have glimpsed her fleeting presence.

As a child, Alba had been told that she came from the other side – the world beyond the veil that separated reality from dreams. Her parents, strangers to each other and to her own identity, had brought her home with them, bearing secrets they dared not speak aloud. As she grew older, Alba began to sense the presence of something outside herself, a force that guided her toward the unknown.

She wandered the world, collecting stories like dust in her hands. She'd sit by campfires and listen to tales of myth and legend, feeling an unseen resonance within herself. Some claimed she was a spirit, while others believed she was simply lost – but it didn't matter; Alba knew what she felt.

As night fell, Alba would step into the shadows, letting the world fade behind her like mist. In these dark moments, she'd listen to the whispers of those who had come before, their voices carried on the wind. It was then that she gathered stories – ancient tales told in hushed tones by women long forgotten.

Her home was a mobile one: Alba traveled from town to town, sitting with those who needed guidance or merely listening when they had nothing to say. In every place, she left an impression – some claimed it was good fortune, others whispered of curses. They called her the Weaver, for she wove tales and truth into the fabric of lives.

There were times when Alba felt the presence around her grow thicker – like threads being spun together. She knew that day would come when she'd reveal herself to the world. But until then, she remained a whispered rumor, a hint of something more than what lay beneath the surface.

Alba Conte disappeared as suddenly as she appeared, leaving behind only her stories and the faintest echo of a presence still felt by those who listened. It was said that when the moon hung low in the night sky, you could still hear the soft hum of her thread weaver's song – if you dared to listen.
