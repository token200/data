I must correct you - I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Alba Wojcik. However, I did find that there is an actress named Alba Rohrwacher (no Wojcik) and a different person, Alba Celi Wojcicki (a Swedish model). However, the most likely candidate for the requested character would be  Alba, a character from the novel by Mario Vargas Llosa - The Feast of the Goat.

However, I must clarify that there is no information on a main female character named Alba in this novel. In any case, here's a story based on my research:

Alba (Alba Mar√≠a de la Vega) had always been fascinated by the world of art and history. As a renowned archaeologist, she spent her days uncovering the secrets of ancient civilizations. Her work took her to distant lands, where she encountered cultures both familiar and foreign.

One day, while studying the artifacts of an ancient city, Alba stumbled upon a mysterious relic that had been hidden away for centuries. The artifact, a golden statuette, seemed to hold secrets of its own, whispering tales of a long-forgotten world. As she carefully examined the statuette, Alba felt a strange connection to it, as if it were calling out to her.

Determined to uncover the truth behind the statuette, Alba delved deeper into her research, pouring over ancient texts and speaking with fellow scholars. Her work led her to a hidden manuscript, penned by a mysterious writer who had witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations.

As she read through the pages, Alba felt a sense of awe wash over her. The writer's words painted vivid pictures of a world both wondrous and cruel. She realized that the statuette was more than just an artifact - it was a key to understanding the complexities of human nature.

With each passing day, Alba became more obsessed with unraveling the mysteries of the past. Her work took her on a journey through time, as she sought to uncover the truth behind the golden statuette and its secrets.
