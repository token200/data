Alba Jansone trudged through the snow-covered streets, her eyes fixed on the small café ahead. It was her usual haunt, where she could escape the harsh glare of the world and lose herself in a good book.

As she pushed open the door, the bell above it rang out, and the owner, Old Matías, looked up from behind the counter. "Ah, Alba! My favorite lost soul," he said with a warm smile.

Alba slid onto her stool, shedding her woolen coat and gloves as she settled into the worn leather chair. She ordered a black coffee, and Old Matías handed it to her with a knowing nod.

It was here that she often came to reflect on her life. Alba was an outcast in her own village, where everyone knew each other's business and gossip spread like wildfire. Her eyes had always seemed to hold a secret, a story that only she understood. And so, she'd left, fleeing the expectations of others to make her own way.

As she sipped her coffee, Alba's thoughts wandered to her childhood, spent exploring the frozen lakes and forests surrounding her village. She was drawn to the unknown, the unexplained, and her parents had encouraged this curiosity from a young age. But once she'd discovered books, that's where her true passion lay.

Now, as an adult, Alba worked as a librarian in the very same town where she grew up. People whispered about her because she was different – her eyes seemed to see right through them, and her love of books made others uneasy. Still, she reveled in her solitude, surrounded by shelves upon shelves of stories waiting to be devoured.

Old Matías brought over a small package wrapped in brown paper. "A gift from someone who wants to remain anonymous," he said with a wink.

Alba unwrapped it to reveal an exquisite leather-bound volume, adorned with strange symbols and markings she'd never seen before. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she opened the book, releasing a whispered promise of secrets within its pages.

For Alba, this book was more than just a new addition to her library; it represented a doorway to hidden worlds and mysteries waiting to be unraveled. As she delved into its pages, the café's patrons grew quiet, listening in as if entranced by an unseen performance.

And so, Alba sat there, lost in her own world of stories and secrets, while Old Matías watched over her with a knowing smile, aware that sometimes, it's the ones who don't fit the mold who are the most fascinating.
