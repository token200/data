Alba Toth stood on the edge of the rooftop, gazing out at the city below. Her piercing green eyes seemed to hold a world of sadness as she stared down at the twinkling lights. The wind whipped through her long, dark hair, and she wrapped it tightly around her shoulders, trying to find some solace in its familiar comfort.

As an artist, Alba had always found solace in her work. Her brushstrokes were bold and expressive, capturing the turmoil that churned within her. She was known for her vivid portraits of the city's inhabitants – their stories, struggles, and triumphs all reflected back at her through the lens of her art.

Tonight was different, though. Tonight, Alba felt lost. Her latest exhibition had ended a week ago, but she couldn't shake the feeling that it wasn't enough. The critics had praised her work, but their words felt hollow now. She wondered if anyone truly saw her for who she was – beneath the surface of her art.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Alba Toth took a deep breath and stepped forward, into the unknown. Her eyes scanned the rooftop, taking in the scattered shards of broken glass and discarded dreams. A faint smile played on her lips as she spotted a lone candle left behind by a fellow artist.

With a quiet reverence, Alba lit the flame, watching as it danced in the flickering light. The dance reminded her of her own artistic journey – full of twists and turns, but ultimately leading to this moment. She felt a sense of peace wash over her, and for the first time that night, she saw the city below with fresh eyes.

In this moment, Alba Toth knew that she was exactly where she needed to be – not in front of the mirror, or on the canvas, but in the midst of life itself. The candle's gentle flame seemed to whisper a single message: that even in darkness, there is always light to be found.
