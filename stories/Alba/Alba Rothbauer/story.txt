Alba Rothbauer stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any signs of life. She had arrived in Vienna on a whim, seeking escape from the chaos of her own making. As she made her way through the quiet streets, the weight of her name – Alba Rothbauer – felt like a burden. It was a name that followed her everywhere, a constant reminder of her complicated past.

Alba had grown up in a family of artists and musicians, her parents' passion for creativity infecting her from a young age. She had always felt like she was destined for something more, but the expectations of those around her had held her back. Now, at 25, Alba found herself at a crossroads, unsure of which path to take.

As she walked, the sounds and smells of the city began to overwhelm her. The wail of sirens, the chatter of pedestrians, the sweet scent of pastries wafting from a nearby café – it was all too much. Alba felt like she was drowning in the chaos, unable to find her bearings.

She turned down a narrow alleyway, the buildings growing taller and more ornate as she walked. The air grew thick with history, the weight of centuries bearing down upon her. Alba felt a shiver run down her spine as she caught sight of a small café tucked away between two larger buildings. She pushed open the door, stepping inside into a warm and welcoming space.

The barista, an older woman with kind eyes, greeted her with a smile. "Willkommen, junge Frau," she said, offering Alba a seat at the counter. For the first time in hours, Alba felt like she was home. The name – Alba Rothbauer – seemed to fade into the background as she sipped her coffee and let the world slow down around her.

As she sat there, lost in thought, Alba began to realize that maybe it was okay not to have all the answers. Maybe it was enough to simply be, to let the world spin around her without getting tangled up in expectations and doubts. She smiled to herself, feeling a sense of peace wash over her. For the first time in years, she felt like Alba Rothbauer could finally breathe again.
