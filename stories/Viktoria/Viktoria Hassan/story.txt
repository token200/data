Viktoria Hassan stepped into the dimly lit caf√©, her eyes scanning the room for any signs of life. She had been searching for weeks, following every lead, every rumor, and every hint that might bring her closer to finding her sister, Sofia.

As she waited in line to order a coffee, Viktoria's mind wandered back to the day Sofia had gone missing. They were 16 at the time, inseparable, and now...now she was just a memory. The police had given up after months of searching, but Viktoria couldn't shake the feeling that Sofia was still out there, waiting for her.

When it was finally her turn to order, Viktoria asked for a black coffee and sat down at a small table by the window. She pulled out her phone and began to scroll through old photos, memories of better times with Sofia flooding her mind. Their parents had always been strict, but they had also taught them to be independent, to make their own way in the world.

As she sipped her coffee, Viktoria noticed a young woman sitting across from her, watching her with an intensity that made her skin prickle. The woman's eyes were striking, piercing green, and for a moment, Viktoria felt like she was staring into her own past.

The woman caught her eye again, and this time, Viktoria returned the gaze, her heart pounding in her chest. There was something familiar about her, something that made Viktoria feel like she was seeing herself for the first time.

Without thinking, Viktoria stood up and walked over to the young woman's table. "Excuse me," she said, trying to sound casual. "I couldn't help but notice...we look alike."

The woman smiled, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "I've been searching for someone too," she said, her voice low and husky. "A sister, I think."

Viktoria's heart skipped a beat as she sat down across from the stranger. For the first time in months, she felt like she was on the right track. Maybe, just maybe, Sofia was out there, waiting for her, and this woman could be her key to finding her.

"I'm Viktoria Hassan," she said, extending her hand.

The young woman took it, her handshake firm. "I'm Sofia Hassan too."
