Viktoria Hébert stepped into the grand foyer of her family's estate, the soft glow of candles and chandeliers illuminating her dark, porcelain skin. As the eldest child of the wealthy and influential Hébert family, she had grown accustomed to being treated like royalty.

But beneath her polished exterior, Viktoria seethed with resentment. Her parents' constant pressure to marry well and secure the family's fortune weighed heavily on her shoulders. She longed to break free from the stifling conventions that bound her, but every attempt at rebellion was met with disapproval and disappointment.

As she made her way through the bustling halls, Viktoria caught sight of her younger brother, Henri, laughing with their loyal servant, Pierre. She smiled wistfully; for a moment, she felt like a child again, free to play and indulge in simple pleasures. But that freedom was fleeting, and reality quickly asserted itself.

Viktoria's thoughts turned to the upcoming ball, where she would be forced to don her best gown and mingle with the cream of society. Her parents had already begun speculating about potential suitors, and Viktoria knew she would be under constant scrutiny.

In a moment of defiance, she snuck away from the main party to explore the neglected gardens behind the estate. The moon was full overhead, casting an ethereal glow over the crumbling statues and overgrown flowers. As she wandered through the desolate landscape, Viktoria felt a sense of peace wash over her. It was here that she could escape the weight of her responsibilities and be herself.

As she gazed up at the night sky, Viktoria spotted a small, injured bird perched on a nearby bush. Without hesitation, she knelt down to tend to its wounds, feeling an unexpected surge of compassion and connection to this tiny creature.

In that moment, something shifted within her. The mask she wore as the perfect daughter began to slip, revealing a glimmer of the person she truly wanted to be – strong-willed, free-spirited, and unafraid to take risks. As the bird took flight once more, Viktoria smiled softly, knowing that no matter what lay ahead, she would forge her own path, rather than following in her parents' footsteps.

With a newfound sense of determination, Viktoria made her way back to the ball, ready to face whatever challenges came her way. For the first time in years, she felt like she was dancing on her own terms.
