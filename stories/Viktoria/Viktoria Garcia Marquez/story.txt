Viktoria's first stop was the local police station, where she met with her old friend and colleague, Detective Juan Hernandez. He listened intently as Viktoria shared her findings, his expression growing more serious by the minute.

"I'll do everything I can to help you, Viktoria," he promised. "But we need to be careful. If this politician is involved in something like this, there will be those who won't take kindly to us poking our noses into their business."
