One day, a wealthy collector from the city heard about Viktoria's work and offered her a chance to showcase her art in his prestigious gallery. Viktoria was hesitant at first, but after much contemplation, she decided to take the leap. She packed her bags, said goodbye to her friends and family, and set off for the city.
