Viktoria Wilson stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of her connection. As a freelance journalist, she had grown accustomed to being on her own, but this assignment felt different. She was going undercover to investigate a string of high-profile hacks targeting small businesses in the city.

Viktoria Wilson took a deep breath and gathered her belongings, shouldering her bag as she made her way through the crowd. Her sources had told her that the culprit was a mastermind known only by their handle "Zero Cool." The nickname sent a shiver down her spine; Viktoria Wilson knew better than to underestimate someone with such a moniker.

As she waited for her ride, Viktoria Wilson's mind turned over the details of the case. She had spent hours poring over security footage and interviewing witnesses, but something didn't add up. The victims all seemed too similar – family-owned businesses, local restaurants, and small shops – yet the tone of the hacks was always professional, never threatening or personal.

Viktoria Wilson spotted her ride waiting by the curb, a nondescript sedan with tinted windows. She slid into the passenger seat as the driver pulled away from the station, joining the city's chaotic traffic. The driver's name was Alex, a trusted source who had agreed to help Viktoria Wilson get close to Zero Cool.

"Where are we headed?" she asked, watching as the city gave way to suburban sprawl.

"We're going to meet with one of the victims," Alex replied, glancing in the rearview mirror. "They think Zero Cool might be targeting them next."

As they drove, Viktoria Wilson's thoughts turned back to her research. She had a feeling that she was missing something, but what? The name "Zero Cool" echoed in her mind like a challenge – could she really take down this elusive hacker?

For now, she would have to keep digging, relying on her instincts and her sources to guide her through the dark underbelly of the city's tech underworld.
