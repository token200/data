Viktoria Lemoine stepped off the last train of the evening, her eyes scanning the deserted platform. The dim fluorescent lights above cast an eerie glow over the empty seats and worn luggage racks. She was used to such isolation, having grown up in a small town where the only sounds were the creaks and groans of the old wooden buildings.

As she collected her belongings from the train's lost and found, Viktoria felt a shiver run down her spine. This wasn't just any ordinary town; it was Ravenswood, the one place where her past and present collided in a tangled web of secrets and lies.

She had left Ravenswood five years ago, fleeing the darkness that lurked within its narrow streets. The memories of her childhood still haunted her – the whispers of her mother's name, the smell of smoke from the fire that took her father away, and the feeling of being forever lost in the woods behind their small cabin.

Viktoria pulled out a crumpled photograph from her pocket, showing a girl with piercing green eyes, just like hers. She was a stranger to everyone except her mother. The faded image seemed to shimmer in the dim light, reminding Viktoria that she still held onto something dear and precious – a piece of herself.

As she walked through the deserted streets, the silence seemed oppressive, yet it also felt almost liberating. Ravenswood might have been a prison, but for now, it was her sanctuary.

She stopped at the local café, where the owner, Mabel, recognized her with an old-fashioned smile and offered a warm cup of coffee. Viktoria thanked her quietly, not needing words to convey the depth of her emotions.

Over steaming coffee, Viktoria recounted stories of her journey, leaving out only the painful parts. She spoke of Parisian museums, where she lost herself in masterpieces that echoed her mother's name; of moonlit walks along Seine's riverbanks, feeling an odd sense of belonging to a world so foreign yet familiar.

Viktoria finally finished speaking, feeling like she had shed some of the weight that pressed upon her shoulders. The foggy windows cast an enigmatic glow outside, suggesting the mist-shrouded mountains beyond Ravenswood. For now, it was enough to be still and silent in this forgotten place, with only the echoes of the past and present whispering her name – a single sound amidst the symphony of lives left unspoken.

And as she sipped her coffee and let the darkness envelop her, Viktoria felt a gentle nudge toward redemption – the faintest promise that one day she would find her place among these woods and their haunting shadows.
