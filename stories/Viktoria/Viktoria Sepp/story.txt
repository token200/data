Viktoria Sepp stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar scene before her. The station was small, with only one line that stretched out into the countryside like a spindly finger. But to Viktoria, it felt like home.

She had always been drawn to this place - the rolling hills, the wind-swept fields, and the sense of isolation that seemed to seep from every stone. As a child, she would escape here with her grandfather, who taught her how to identify the different wildflowers and listen for the songs of the birds.

Now, at 25, Viktoria was returning to this place after many years away. Her father had passed away, leaving behind a legacy of land and secrets that only Viktoria's grandfather had known. The old man had been tight-lipped about their family's past, but he had left her his property with one condition: she must uncover the truth.

Viktoria took a deep breath as she made her way through the quiet station. She knew every face, every smile and every gossip that went around these parts. Some people whispered about her father's mysterious death, while others claimed to have seen Viktoria arguing with him on the night of his passing.

As she walked towards the old farmhouse, a sense of unease settled over her. This was where it all began - the reason for which she had come back to this place. She pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside, surrounded by the musty scent of old books and dusty memories.

In the kitchen, Viktoria found a letter from her grandfather, scribbled on a piece of paper with his familiar looping script. "The truth is hidden in plain sight," it read. "Look for the place where the sun doesn't shine."

Viktoria's eyes narrowed as she folded the letter and tucked it into her pocket. She had a feeling that this was just the beginning of a long journey, one that would uncover secrets she never knew existed about her family's past. But with every step, she felt herself getting closer to something - or someone.

As she stood there, listening to the wind rustle through the fields outside, Viktoria Sepp knew that this time, she was ready to face whatever lay ahead.
