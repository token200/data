As a child, Viktoria had always been fascinated by the world of technology, spending hours tinkering with gadgets and machines in her makeshift workshop beneath her parents' attic. Her natural talent for problem-solving and analytical thinking had quickly earned her recognition among her peers, who began to call her "The Ghost" due to her uncanny ability to disappear into the digital realm.

She worked tirelessly to uncover vulnerabilities and protect sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands. Her reputation as a formidable hacker had earned her both admiration and fear, with some labeling her a vigilante and others a menace.

Despite the risks, Viktoria remained committed to using her talents for good. She had a particular interest in exposing corporate malfeasance and bringing wrongdoers to justice.
