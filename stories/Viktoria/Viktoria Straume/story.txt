Viktoria Straume's eyes scanned the dimly lit alleyway, her senses heightened as she searched for any sign of movement. A former KGB agent turned freelance operative, Viktoria had seen her fair share of danger and deception. But tonight was different. Tonight, she was on a mission to uncover a mole within her own organization.

As she waited, the sound of footsteps echoed through the alley, followed by the rustle of fabric. Viktoria's hand instinctively reached for the knife at her waist, but she didn't draw it yet. She needed to know who this person was and what they wanted before taking action.

The figure emerged from the shadows, a woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. "Viktoria," the woman said, her voice husky. "I've been sent for."

Viktoria's gaze narrowed. "Who is your handler?"

The woman smiled, a small, enigmatic smile. "That would be...someone who prefers to keep a low profile."

Viktoria raised an eyebrow. She wasn't buying it. This was too convenient, too rehearsed.

"I'm not here to play games," Viktoria said, her hand tightening around the knife hilt. "I need to know what you're after and why."

The woman shrugged, her shoulders barely moving. "Just information. A little tidbit that could bring down an entire organization."

Viktoria's eyes locked onto hers, searching for any sign of deception. She knew she couldn't trust this woman completely, but a spark of curiosity had been ignited within her.

"What is it?" Viktoria asked finally, the knife still trained on the woman's chest.

The woman leaned forward, her voice dropping to a whisper. "A mole within our ranks. Someone who has access to classified information and is feeding intel to a rival organization."

Viktoria's grip on the knife tightened. This was what she had been searching for all along. She knew it wouldn't be an easy hunt, but she was ready.

The woman's eyes flashed with warning. "You're not going to like this, Viktoria. The mole is close. Too close."

With that, she turned and disappeared into the night, leaving Viktoria with more questions than answers. But one thing was certain: she would find out who the mole was, no matter what it took.

As Viktoria watched her disappear into the shadows, a cold determination settled within her. She would uncover this mole and bring them to justice, even if it meant putting herself in harm's way once again. The game had just begun, and Viktoria Straume was ready to play.
