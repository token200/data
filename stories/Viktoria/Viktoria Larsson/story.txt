Viktoria Larsson stepped into the dimly lit caf√©, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of her missing sister, Sofia. The rain poured outside, casting a melancholic mood over the small town. As she waited in line to order, Viktoria couldn't help but think about the last time they spoke.

Her name was Viktoria Larsson, and she had always been close to Sofia, who shared her love for photography and the outdoors. But after their mother passed away, their father's absence grew more pronounced. Sofia had taken it upon herself to care for him, leaving Viktoria with a sense of abandonment.

The barista handed her a steaming cup of coffee, and Viktoria took a sip, feeling the warmth spread through her chest. She thought about all the times she and Sofia would explore the nearby woods, capturing the beauty of nature on film. Their bond was unbreakable, and she couldn't shake the feeling that something had happened to her sister.

As she walked out into the rain, Viktoria spotted a figure huddled under an awning. She quickened her pace, her heart racing with anticipation. The stranger slowly rose to their feet, revealing a woman who looked eerily familiar. It was Sofia Larsson, her eyes sunken and her skin pale.

Viktoria's legs gave out beneath her as she rushed towards her sister, embracing her tightly. Sofia reciprocated the hug, tears streaming down her face. "I'm so sorry, Viktoria," she whispered, her voice shaking with emotion. "I had to leave, but I promise I'll never be away from you again."

Viktoria held her sister close, relief washing over her. She knew that Sofia's departure was a desperate attempt to escape the pain of their father's neglect. As they walked together under the rain-soaked sky, Viktoria vowed to be more supportive, to be there for her sister in times of need.

The two sisters stopped at a nearby lake, watching as the water lapped against the shore. Sofia pulled out her camera and began snapping photos, Viktoria joining in with a newfound sense of purpose. As they worked together, their laughter mingled with the raindrops, creating a symphony of joy and forgiveness.

In that moment, Viktoria Larsson knew that no matter what lay ahead, she would always be there for her sister, and that their bond would only grow stronger with time.
