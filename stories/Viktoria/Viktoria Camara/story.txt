Viktoria Camara stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of her contact. As a freelance journalist, she had spent years tracking down leads in the most unlikely of places, but this one was different. This one felt like a setup.

She spotted him across the room, a tall, lean man with piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into her very soul. He nodded at her, and Viktoria felt a shiver run down her spine as she made her way towards him.

"Viktoria Camara," he said, his voice low and smooth. "I've been expecting you."

Viktoria raised an eyebrow. "Expecting me?" she repeated. "That's not exactly how I'd put it."

He smiled, and Viktoria felt a flutter in her chest. She had always been drawn to men with secrets, and this one was no exception.

"My name is Julian," he said, offering her his hand. "And you, Miss Camara, are a woman after my own heart."

Viktoria took his hand, feeling a spark of electricity as their palms touched. "I'm more of a journalist at heart," she corrected him. "But I suppose we can come to an arrangement."

Julian led her out of the station and into the crowded streets, weaving through the throngs of people with ease. Viktoria felt like a child in his presence, but she knew better than to be intimidated.

As they walked, Julian told her about his organization - a group dedicated to exposing corruption and bringing justice to those who had been wronged. Viktoria listened intently, her journalist's instincts on high alert.

And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, the conversation was over. Julian stopped in front of a nondescript office building, and nodded at her once more. "The information you're looking for is inside," he said. "But be warned, Miss Camara - this story comes with a price."
