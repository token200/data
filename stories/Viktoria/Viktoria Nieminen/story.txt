Viktoria Nieminen stepped off the stage, her eyes scanning the crowded auditorium. She had just finished a blistering set at the annual Helsinki Music Festival, and the applause still lingered in the air. As the lead singer of the indie rock band "Echoes in the Dark," Viktoria's powerful voice had captured the hearts of the audience.

As she made her way through the throng of well-wishers, a sea of faces parted to reveal her childhood friend and confidant, Emma. The two girls had grown up together in Helsinki's vibrant music scene, bonding over their shared love of alternative rock and poetry.

Emma handed Viktoria a bouquet of wildflowers – her favorite. "You were amazing out there," she said, beaming with pride. "The crowd was eating it up."

Viktoria smiled, feeling the adrenaline still coursing through her veins. It had been years since Emma's family had passed away in a tragic accident, but Viktoria knew that Emma still felt their presence through music.

As they hugged, a commotion at the back of the room caught Viktoria's attention. A young journalist from a major music publication was jostling her way to the front, microphone in hand. "Viktoria, can I have a quote?" she asked breathlessly.

Viktoria nodded, her eyes locked on Emma's as she began to speak. "I write songs about the darkness and the light – about the parts of myself that I'm still trying to understand. Music has always been my therapy, my escape."

The journalist scribbled furiously, but Viktoria's gaze wandered, drifting to a figure at the edge of the room. He was tall and lean, with piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through her. She felt an inexplicable jolt of recognition, as if she had known him all her life.

"Who is that?" Emma asked, following Viktoria's gaze.

Viktoria shrugged, feeling a flutter in her chest. "I don't know," she admitted quietly. "But I think I'm about to find out."
