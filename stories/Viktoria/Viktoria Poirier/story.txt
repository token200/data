Viktoria Poirier stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any signs of life. She had been traveling for hours, and the weariness was starting to take its toll. As she made her way through the emptying crowd, a figure emerged from the shadows.

It was him – Pierre, the man who had been haunting her dreams for months. They had met by chance on a train just a week ago, and yet Viktoria Poirier couldn't shake the feeling that their encounter had been more than just coincidence.

Pierre smiled as he approached her, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "Viktoria," he said, his voice low and smooth. "It's good to see you again."

Viktoria felt a shiver run down her spine as she met his gaze. There was something about Pierre that drew her in, something that made her feel like she was drowning in his eyes.

They walked through the deserted streets together, the only sound the soft rustle of leaves beneath their feet. Viktoria Poirier couldn't help but wonder what had brought Pierre to this small town, and why he seemed to be searching for something – or someone.

As they turned a corner, a dilapidated café came into view. The sign creaked in the wind, reading "Café des Rêves" – Café of Dreams. Pierre pushed open the door, revealing a dimly lit interior that seemed to swallow them whole.

Viktoria Poirier hesitated for a moment, unsure if she should follow him inside. But something about Pierre's gaze made her trust him, and she stepped into the café with him. The air was thick with smoke and nostalgia, and Viktoria felt like she had stumbled into a different world altogether.

Pierre slid onto a stool at the bar, his eyes never leaving hers. "I have something to show you," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. And with that, he reached out and took her hand, leading her deeper into the heart of the café.
