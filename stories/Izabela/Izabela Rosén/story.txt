Izabela Rosén stepped out of her small apartment and onto the bustling streets of Stockholm. As a freelance journalist, she was no stranger to working long hours, but this assignment was particularly demanding. She had been investigating a corruption scandal within the city's government for weeks, and every lead seemed to end in a dead-end.

As she walked to the café where her source was supposed to meet her, Izabela's mind replayed the conversations they had exchanged so far. Her source, a low-level civil servant named Lars, had provided some tantalizing hints about the scandal, but nothing concrete. She couldn't shake the feeling that she was missing something crucial.

When she arrived at the café, Lars was already seated, sipping on a cup of coffee. He looked nervous, and Izabela's instincts told her to trust him. They exchanged brief pleasantries before he delved into the details of his job, explaining how certain government contracts had been awarded without proper bidding or oversight.

Izabela took furious notes, her eyes darting back and forth between Lars' face and the scribbled pages in front of her. This was it – the smoking gun she needed to expose the corruption and bring down the corrupt officials responsible. But as the meeting drew to a close, she noticed something strange: Lars seemed hesitant to go on record.

"Izabela Rosén," he said, his voice barely above a whisper, "I'm scared. I don't want my family to suffer because of this. Can you please promise me that you'll protect them?"

Izabela's gut told her that Lars was telling the truth, but she couldn't deny the feeling of unease creeping up her spine. She promised him that she would do everything in her power to keep his identity safe and secure.

As she left the café, Izabella felt a sense of determination wash over her. This story wasn't going to be easy to tell, but it was one she needed to share with the world. And if it meant putting herself at risk, so be it – Izabela Rosén was ready for whatever came next.
