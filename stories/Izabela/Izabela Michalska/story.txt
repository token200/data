Izabela Michalska was a name that commanded respect in the small town of Gdansk, Poland. A young and ambitious journalist, she had already made a name for herself with her sharp wit and keen observational skills. Her latest assignment had brought her to the local market, where she was determined to uncover the truth behind the recent surge in prices.
