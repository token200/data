Izabela's success was not limited to her artistic talent; she had also become a voice for women's empowerment in the Taiwanese art scene. Her bold style and unapologetic approach inspired many young artists, encouraging them to find their own unique voices.

As the evening drew to a close, Izabela returned to the gallery, where she was met with a standing ovation. Her parents, who had flown in from their rural hometown to support her, beamed with pride as they congratulated their daughter on her well-deserved success. Izabela Jhih-hao, the young artist from Taipei, had truly made her mark on the world of art.
