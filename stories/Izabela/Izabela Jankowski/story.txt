One crisp autumn morning, Izabela Jankowski set out on her daily rounds, carrying a worn leather satchel filled with an assortment of potions and remedies. She walked through the misty streets, exchanging warm smiles with the townspeople as she passed by their cottages. Her long, curly brown hair was tied back in a neat bun, revealing a smattering of freckles across her cheeks that only added to her gentle beauty.

As she arrived at the local inn, she spotted an elderly woman writhing in agony on the floor. Without hesitation, Izabela Jankowski rushed over to attend to the ailing woman, expertly extracting thorns from her arm and binding her wounds with a soft cloth. The innkeeper's wife, Mary, looked on with gratitude as Izabela worked her magic.
