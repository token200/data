Izabela Fournier stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar streets of Le Havre. It had been years since she'd returned to her hometown in France, but the memories still lingered. As Izabela Fournier, she'd grown up exploring the seaside town's hidden coves and listening to the stories of its fishermen.

Now, at 25, Izabela Fournier was a journalist, seeking inspiration for her next article. She'd heard whispers of a local legend – a mysterious lighthouse keeper who haunted the rocky shores. Intrigued, she began to investigate.

The villagers were tight-lipped about the keeper's identity, but one elderly fisherman shared a cryptic tale with Izabela Fournier. According to him, the lighthouse keeper was said to be a ghostly figure in a long coat, wandering the coastline under the light of full moon. Some claimed to have seen it on the beach at dawn, while others swore they'd heard its whispers carried by the wind.

Izabela Fournier's curiosity was piqued. She spent the next few days interviewing locals and scouring dusty archives for any mention of the keeper. As night fell, she set out on her own to find the lighthouse – a towering structure perched atop a rugged cliff.

As she approached, a gust of wind swept across the beach, extinguishing her flashlight. In the darkness, Izabela Fournier felt an eerie presence surround her. Suddenly, a faint light materialized in front of her, illuminating the rocky face of the lighthouse keeper.

For an instant, their eyes locked – Izabela Fournier's shining with determination, and the keeper's glinting like a lantern in the night sky. Then, as swiftly as it had appeared, the light vanished, leaving her alone on the beach.

Breathless, Izabela Fournier wondered if she'd imagined the whole encounter. Yet, when she returned to Le Havre, the villagers confirmed that they knew of the mysterious keeper – a guardian of the coastline, said to possess secrets and stories as old as the sea itself.

As Izabela Fournier sat in her small apartment, scribbling notes for her article, she felt an affinity with this enigmatic figure. Like Izabela Fournier herself, the lighthouse keeper was a guardian – a protector of memories and tales that only the tide could keep.
