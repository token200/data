As she grew older, Izabela's love for art only intensified. She began to dabble in painting, her brushstrokes bold and expressive, like a wild animal breaking free from its cage. Her studio was her sanctuary, where she could lose herself in the swirling colors and textures that seemed to dance across the canvas.
