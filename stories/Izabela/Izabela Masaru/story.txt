One day, while working on a particularly complex case involving embezzlement at a major corporation, Izabela stumbled upon a cryptic email that hinted at a much larger conspiracy.

And when she finally stumbled upon the smoking gun – a document that proved the true extent of the corporate espionage – she knew that she had done it. The story of a lifetime was about to be published, and Izabela Masaru's name would go down in history as one of the greatest investigative journalists of all time.
