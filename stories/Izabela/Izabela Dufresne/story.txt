Izabela Dufresne was known for her quick wit and sharp tongue in the world of high-stakes poker. A regular fixture on the tables at the prestigious Bellagio Casino, she had earned a reputation as a formidable opponent who wouldn't back down from a challenge.

But despite her tough exterior, Izabela's past was marked by tragedy. Growing up in a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn, she had lost her mother to gang violence when she was just a teenager. Her father, a former convict himself, had struggled to provide for his young daughter and her younger brother. As a result, Izabela had grown up on the streets, relying on her wits and cunning to survive.

It wasn't until she stumbled upon a poker game in a dingy backroom that Izabela discovered her true calling. Entranced by the thrill of the game and the rush of adrenaline it gave her, she became obsessed with improving her skills. She spent countless hours studying strategy, honing her instincts, and practicing her bluffing techniques.

As Izabela's talent began to earn her recognition in the poker world, she started to reinvent herself. She ditched her rough-around-the-edges style for a sleeker, more polished look, and adopted a confident air that commanded respect at the tables. But despite her newfound success, Izabela couldn't shake the demons of her past.

One night, after winning a particularly lucrative hand, she received a phone call from an unknown number. On the other end was a woman claiming to be an old friend from her neighborhood - someone who had known Izabela before her life took a dark turn. The voice on the other end was warm and familiar, but also tinged with sadness.

"Hey Izabela Dufresne," she said softly. "It's been a long time."
