Liu Hoffmann stood at the edge of the city, gazing out over the sprawling metropolis with a mixture of fascination and detachment. A stranger in this concrete jungle, he had no family or friends to speak of, only a small network of acquaintances from his years on the streets.

He was a man of mystery, even to himself. His past was a blur, shrouded in secrets and half-remembered dreams. Some said he was an ex-soldier, scarred by war and left with more questions than answers. Others whispered that he was a thief, a master of deception with no conscience to speak of.

The truth lay somewhere in between. Liu had grown up on the margins, surviving by his wits and his fists. He'd learned to trust no one, only himself. But there was something about this city, its steel skyscrapers and neon lights, that drew him back time and again like a moth to flame.

He walked through the crowded streets, weaving past pedestrians with an air of quiet confidence. People parted around him, sensing the tension emanating from his lean frame, his piercing green eyes. Some whispered warnings to their companions: "Watch out for him, he's trouble." Others simply shrugged and muttered, "Just another lost soul."

Liu Hoffmann didn't care about their opinions. He'd long since learned to ignore the whispers of others. His focus was on the city itself, its hidden rhythms and pulsing energy. He moved unseen through alleys and side streets, taking in the sounds and smells: street vendors calling out their wares, cooking spices filling the air, the distant thrum of traffic.

It was on one such stroll that he stumbled upon a small, nondescript shop tucked away between two massive skyscrapers. A faded sign above the door read "Ripples" – an enigmatic name, if ever there was one. Liu hesitated for a moment before pushing open the door, revealing a dimly lit interior and the faint scent of incense.

Inside, he found a single figure seated on a stool behind a counter: an elderly woman with wisps of silver hair framing her weathered face. Her eyes sparkled with knowing as she beheld Liu, a soft smile spreading across her lips.

"Welcome, Hoffmann," she said, using the surname that was all the world knew him by. "It's been a while."

Liu felt a shiver run down his spine at her words. How did she know? Had he made some mistake, revealing more than he'd intended to this mysterious shopkeeper?

"I don't recall..." he began, but she waved her hand.

"No matter," she said. "I have news of sorts for you. Come closer."

Liu approached the counter, his senses on high alert as the old woman leaned forward, speaking in hushed tones:

"There's a package waiting for you, Hoffmann. A message from an old acquaintance – one who knew your... past better than anyone. Meet them tonight, at the old warehouse by the docks. Come alone."

As Liu listened, a mix of excitement and trepidation coursed through his veins. The promise of revelation, perhaps even redemption, hung in the balance.

"Will they tell me the truth?" he asked, the question tumbling from his lips like a desperate cry for answers.

The old woman smiled enigmatically once more. "Ah, Hoffmann – that depends on what you're willing to listen for."

With those cryptic words, she handed him a small package wrapped in plain brown paper and tied with twine. The label read only: "Trust no one."
