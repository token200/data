Ishikawa Kask was a mysterious figure shrouded in legend. His full name, Ishikawa Kiyoshi, was whispered in awe by those who knew him, but few had ever laid eyes on the man himself. A master swordsman and assassin, Kask's true loyalties were unknown, even to his closest allies.

Rumors swirled that he hailed from the mountains of Akakawa, where he had spent years honing his craft under the tutelage of a reclusive sensei. It was said that Kask's blades sang with an otherworldly song when drawn from their scabbards, striking fear into the hearts of even the bravest warriors.
