Ishikawa Gupta was a name that commanded respect in the bustling streets of Tokyo. Few knew much about him, but his reputation as a master thief and con artist was well-known among those who operated in the shadows.

Gupta's early life was shrouded in mystery, with some claiming he was born into a family of thieves while others whispered he was a former member of an elite police unit turned rogue. Whatever the truth may have been, one thing was certain: Ishikawa Gupta was a master of deception and manipulation.

One evening, as the neon lights of Tokyo's streets reflected off the wet pavement, Gupta slipped through the crowds with ease, his eyes scanning for potential marks. He had set his sights on a high-stakes poker game at an exclusive club in the financial district, where the city's elite gathered to wheel and deal.

With his sharp wit and silver tongue, Gupta effortlessly won over the hearts and minds of his opponents, laying down bets with confidence that bordered on recklessness. But as the night wore on, he knew it was time to make his move – to extract a small fortune from under the noses of the club's owners.

As he counted his winnings, a mysterious figure emerged from the shadows, eyes locked onto Gupta with an unnerving intensity. It was Kaito, a rival thief who had been tracking Gupta for months. A silent game of cat and mouse ensued, each trying to outmaneuver the other in a battle of wits.

The stakes were high, but Ishikawa Gupta remained unruffled, his mind racing with calculations and counter-plans. For in a world where trust was a luxury few could afford, only those who knew how to manipulate and deceive truly thrived. As the night wore on, it became clear that this was more than just a game – it was a war of wits, with Ishikawa Gupta at its center.
