Ishikawa Salamanca sat in his favorite armchair, puffing on his cigar as he watched the sunset over the city. As one of the most powerful men in the Westerosi kingdom, it was a rare moment for him to relax and unwind.

Born into slavery as Ishikawa, he had been freed by his owner, Lord Tyrell, when he was just a child. He had grown up to become one of the most skilled and feared assassins in the Seven Kingdoms, earning the respect and fear of all who knew him. As Salamanca, he had built a reputation for being untouchable, a ghostly figure who could strike at will.

Despite his tough exterior, Salamanca had a soft spot for those in need. He had taken it upon himself to protect the people of King's Landing from the various threats that lurked in the shadows. Whether it was the Lannisters or the Tyrells, he had always managed to stay one step ahead, always watching and waiting.

As the night drew in, Salamanca stood up from his chair, stretching his tall frame. He walked over to a nearby mirror, adjusting his gloves and straightening his cloak. It was a habit he had developed over the years, a way of making sure he looked his best at all times.

With a final glance at his reflection, Salamanca turned and walked out into the night, disappearing into the shadows like a phantom. He knew that in the world of espionage and politics, one could never be too careful. But for now, he was content to let others worry about him, to bask in the knowledge that Ishikawa Salamanca, the greatest assassin the Seven Kingdoms had ever known, was out there watching and waiting.

As he vanished into the darkness, the people of King's Landing breathed a collective sigh of relief. They knew that as long as Salamanca was on their side, they would always have someone to protect them from the forces of darkness that lurked in every corner of the city. And so, with the knowledge of Ishikawa Salamanca watching over them, they settled into their beds for a well-deserved rest, safe in the knowledge that the night was protected by one of the greatest heroes the Seven Kingdoms had ever known.
