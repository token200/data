Ishikawa Marcuzzi stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the cityscape as the sun dipped below the horizon. His piercing blue eyes seemed to see right through the crowded streets, his mind a million miles away.

As a retired hitman, Marcuzzi had lived a life of violence and deception. He had left it all behind years ago, starting anew with a clean slate and a promise to himself to never again hurt anyone.

But the ghosts of his past lingered. Memories of blood-soaked alleys, whispered phone calls in dark rooms, and cold calculating eyes that seemed to bore into his soul still haunted him.

Marcuzzi's thoughts were interrupted by the soft chiming of his phone. He hesitated for a moment before answering, his instincts on high alert. It was an unknown number, but he recognized the smooth tone of the voice on the other end.

"Marcuzzi," he said, his hand instinctively reaching for the gun in his jacket.

"It's been a while," the voice said, dripping with sophistication. "I see you've managed to keep yourself busy."

Marcuzzi's grip on the phone tightened. Who was this? How did they know him?

"I'm doing just fine, thank you for asking," he replied warily.

The voice chuckled, low and menacing. "Oh, I think we both know that's not true, Marcuzzi. You've been hiding from yourself for far too long."

A shiver ran down Marcuzzi's spine as the voice continued to taunt him. Who was this person? And what did they want?

Suddenly, the line went dead. Marcuzzi stood there, frozen, his mind racing with questions and doubts.

He took a deep breath and let his eyes scan the rooftop, searching for any signs of surveillance or danger. Satisfied that he was alone, he made his way back to his apartment, the shadows closing in around him like a shroud.

As he locked the door behind him, Marcuzzi couldn't shake the feeling that his past had come to visit him once again. He knew then and there that he would have to confront it head-on if he was going to stay alive.
