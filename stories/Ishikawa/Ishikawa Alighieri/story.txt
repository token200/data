I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Ishikawa Alighieri. It's possible that this is a new or unknown character.

However, I did find information on two famous historical figures with similar names: Matsudaira Yoritaka and Matsuda (also known as Alighiero di Antiochia), also spelled "Alighieri".

Matsudaira Yoritaka was a Japanese daimyo who lived in the 15th century. He was a minor noble, but his story is not well-known.

Alighiero di Antiochia, also spelled "Alighieri", was a medieval Italian mercenary and soldier who fought for various European armies during the Crusades. His life and actions are shrouded in mystery.

If you would like, I can try to create a fictional character based on these historical figures or come up with a new name altogether.
