Ishikawa Rothbauer was a man of mystery, a master thief with an uncanny ability to slip in and out of the shadows unnoticed. His real name was lost to the annals of history, but his exploits were whispered about in hushed tones among the high society crowd.

He was known for his daring heists, often targeting the most secure vaults and safes in the city. No one seemed to know what motivated him, or how he managed to evade detection time and time again.
