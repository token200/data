The owner, an elderly man named Tanaka, looked up from behind the counter and nodded in her direction.

"Ishikawa-san," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "I've been expecting you."

Ishikawa Larsen smiled wryly. She had a reputation for being one of the best in the business, but she knew that didn't mean everyone was on her side. "What do you know about the disappearances?" she asked, taking a seat at the counter.
