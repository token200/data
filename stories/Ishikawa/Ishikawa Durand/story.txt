The police were stumped, but Ishikawa Durand was intrigued by the challenge. He accepted the case, determined to unravel the tangled threads of deception that led to the young woman's disappearance.

As Ishikawa Durand began his investigation, he noticed a peculiar symbol etched into the windowpane of the businessman's office building. The mark seemed to be some sort of code, but none of the local experts could decipher its meaning. Undeterred, Ishikawa Durand set out to crack the puzzle.
