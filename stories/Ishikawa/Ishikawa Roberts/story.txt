Ishikawa Roberts, a renowned journalist and investigative reporter, sat in her dimly lit office, surrounded by stacks of files and notes. Her sharp eyes scanned through the papers, searching for any clue that could lead to the story of a lifetime. As the daughter of a Japanese diplomat and an American mother, Ishikawa had grown up exposed to international politics and diplomacy.

With her quick wit and razor-sharp instincts, Ishikawa Roberts had built a reputation as one of the most feared and respected reporters in Washington D.C.
