One stormy evening, a young woman named Sophia arrived at Ishikawa Kwiatkowski's humble abode, clutching a worn photograph of her deceased mother. She had been plagued by grief and uncertainty since her passing, and Ishikawa Kwiatkowski was her last hope. As the wind howled outside, he invited Sophia to sit beside him on the couch.
