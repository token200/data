Ishikawa Kovács stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the crowded station for any sign of her contact. A figure emerged from the crowd, dressed in a long coat that seemed out of place among the locals.

"Ah, Ishikawa Kovács," the man said, with a slight accent. "I've been expecting you."

Kovács nodded curtly, her gaze never leaving the stranger's face. She was a woman of few words, and even fewer emotions.

"What do you want?" she asked, her voice low and even.

"I have information about your sister," the man replied, his eyes flicking towards the side. "She's been...assisting us."

Kovács's expression didn't change, but a spark of interest flashed in her eyes. Her sister had gone missing several years ago, and Kovács had given up hope of ever finding out what happened to her.

"Tell me," she said, her voice dripping with tension.

The man hesitated, then began to speak in hushed tones. "We've received reports that your sister is being held in a facility deep within the city. We can't get close, but we have reason to believe she's still alive."

Kovács's eyes narrowed, her mind racing with possibilities. She had always suspected that her sister was involved in something, but she had never imagined it would lead to this.

"What do you want me to do?" she asked, her voice firm.

The man leaned forward, his eyes locked on hers. "We need you to infiltrate the facility and gather more information. Your...particular set of skills makes you the perfect candidate for the job."

Kovács nodded again, her mind already racing with plans. She was Ishikawa Kovács, after all – a woman with a talent for getting in and out of tight spots unnoticed.

With a curt nod, she turned and walked away, leaving the stranger to his mysterious organization. But as she disappeared into the crowd, she knew that this was just the beginning of her mission.
