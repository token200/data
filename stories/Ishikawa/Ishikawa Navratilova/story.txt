I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Ishikawa Navratilova. However, I can create a new story based on real-life characters and adjust it to fit your request.

Meet Navratilova, the legendary tennis player known for her exceptional skill and fierce competitiveness. Born Martina Navratilova in Prague, Czechoslovakia, she defected to the United States in 1975, where she went on to dominate women's tennis for over a decade.

In this alternate scenario, let's imagine an alternative universe where tennis greats from different eras collided. Ishikawa, a young and talented Japanese player, emerged as one of the most promising names in the sport. Her idol was none other than Martina Navratilova herself.

Growing up in Tokyo, Ishikawa spent countless hours watching Navratilova's matches on VHS tapes, studying her serves, volleys, and footwork. She aspired to emulate the great Czech player's success on the court. With dedication and hard work, Ishikawa honed her skills, and soon she was making waves in the tennis world.

At a junior tournament in Tokyo, Ishikawa faced off against a young Japanese-American player named Takeshi Tanaka, who was a huge fan of Navratilova's comeback victories. As they played on the sun-kissed courts of Japan, Ishikawa couldn't help but feel a connection to her idol. She remembered watching Navratilova's historic matches at Wimbledon and thinking about how she too could achieve greatness in tennis.

The match between Ishikawa and Tanaka was intense, with both players exchanging shots and rallies that left the crowd in awe. In the end, Ishikawa emerged victorious, winning the set 6-4. As she lifted the trophy aloft, a beaming smile spread across her face. She knew that she had taken a step closer to realizing her dream of becoming a champion like her idol, Martina Navratilova.

From that moment on, Ishikawa dedicated herself to training harder than ever before, drawing inspiration from the legendary Czech player's unwavering determination and unrelenting passion for tennis. As she embarked on her journey to tennis stardom, Ishikawa knew that she had a long way to go, but with Navratilova as her role model, she was ready to take on the world.
