In the mist-shrouded streets of old Edo, a peculiar figure emerged from the shadows. Ishikawa Kaito, also known as Handschuh, was a master of disguise and deception. With his unruly black hair and piercing green eyes, he blended seamlessly into the crowds, always staying one step ahead of his pursuers.

Handschuh's real name was Ishikawa Kaito, but few knew this behind his elaborate masks and wigs. He had grown up on the streets, surviving by his wit and cunning, until one fateful night when he stumbled upon a hidden world of thieves and assassins.

Intrigued, Handschuh apprenticed under the infamous Ryōta-san, learning the art of stealth and deception from the master himself. Over time, Ishikawa Kaito honed his skills, becoming a valuable asset to Ryōta-san's organization. But as he delved deeper into the world of espionage, he began to question the morality of his actions.

One fateful evening, Handschuh received a cryptic message from an unknown sender, requesting his presence at the ancient temple of Fushimi Inari. There, he was met with a surprising revelation: Ryōta-san's true intentions were not what they seemed. The master had been playing both sides, using Ishikawa Kaito to gather intelligence while secretly serving a rival faction.

Shaken, Handschuh knew he had to escape before it was too late. Donning his most convincing disguise, he slipped away into the night, leaving Ryōta-san's organization behind. As he vanished into the shadows, Ishikawa Kaito vowed to use his skills for good, to bring justice to those who had been wronged.

From that day on, Handschuh walked a thin line between right and wrong, always staying one step ahead of those who sought to control him. His legend grew, as whispers of the mysterious Ishikawa Kaito spread throughout the city. And though his true name was lost to the ages, his actions spoke louder than any word: that of a man driven by a fierce sense of justice and a penchant for the unknown.
