I couldn't find any information on "Ishikawa Malinowska." It is possible that you are thinking of a different person, or that this is a fictional character. 

However, I did find some information on Marie Curie, and Barbara McClintock, and others who have been referred to as "Malinowska" or have similar first names. Could you be referring to one of them?

If so, I could write a story about the life of Ishikawa Malinowska, if that's what you would like.

However, it is possible that Ishikawa is a Japanese name and not related to Marie Curie, Barbara McClintock or anyone else famous by that name.
