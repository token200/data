Their legend had grown over years of pulling off daring heists, leaving behind a trail of clues that only the most skilled detectives could decipher.

One rainy evening, Inspector Tanaka sat huddled in his office, pouring over the latest string of burglaries in the affluent Shinjuku district. The thief seemed to be targeting rare art pieces and valuable artifacts, always leaving behind an enigmatic calling card with a single phrase: "The Shadow Weaver."
