One day, Ishikawa García Márquez received an invitation from a prominent art gallery to showcase his work in their upcoming exhibition. He was overjoyed at the opportunity and threw himself into preparing for the big event. For weeks, he painted tirelessly, experimenting with new techniques and mediums.
