Ishikawa Deschamps stood at the edge of the city, his eyes scanning the horizon as if searching for something. The wind whipped through his dark hair, carrying with it the scent of salt and seaweed. It was a smell he associated with home, but home was no longer a place for him.

Deschamps had grown up in a small coastal town, where the rhythm of the sea dictated life. His parents had been sailors, and from a young age, Deschamps had followed in their wake, learning the ways of the ocean and the stars that guided it. But he had also learned about the harsh realities of the sea: the storms that could swallow a ship whole, the loneliness that came with being out of reach.

One fateful night, Deschamps' life changed forever. He had been on board his parents' vessel when it was caught in a terrible storm. The ship broke apart, and Deschamps was swept overboard, clinging to a fragment of wood as the waves tossed him about like a rag doll.

When he finally surfaced, gasping for air, Deschamps saw something that made his heart skip a beat – his parents, standing on the shore, waving at him with tears in their eyes. They had survived the wreck and were waiting for him to join them again.

Deschamps was taken in by the city's authorities and given a new life, but he never forgot the sea or its lessons. He became an explorer of sorts, seeking out hidden coves and secret islands that few others knew existed. His reputation as a navigator grew, and people began to call him Ishikawa Deschamps – a name that meant "sea wanderer" in his native tongue.

Years went by, and Deschamps continued to roam the seas, always on the lookout for the next great discovery. He became known for his bravery, his wit, and his uncanny ability to read the signs of nature. His stories of adventures were told around campfires and in taverns, inspiring a new generation of sailors and explorers.

But despite all he had seen and experienced, Deschamps couldn't shake off the feeling of loss that lingered within him. The sea still held a special place in his heart – it was where he belonged, but also where he felt most alone.
