Asel Németh was a rising star in the Budapest jazz scene. Her soulful voice and virtuosic trumpet playing had already earned her a reputation as one of the city's most exciting young musicians.

Growing up in the streets of Pest, Asel had always been drawn to the sounds of the city: the wail of sirens, the chatter of pedestrians, and the haunting melodies that floated from the windows of the apartment buildings. She began playing trumpet at age eight, influenced by her father's old records of Charlie Parker and Miles Davis.

As she honed her craft, Asel's unique style emerged, blending traditional Hungarian folk music with modern jazz and rock influences. Her debut album, "Szeplő szalonka" ("Blood Orange Saloon"), was a critical and commercial success, praised for its emotional depth and technical precision.

At the age of 25, Asel Németh was already leading her own band, featuring some of Budapest's most talented musicians. Together, they played sold-out shows at iconic venues like the Matica Hungarian Academy and the Széchenyi Thermal Bath's concert hall.

One night, after a particularly raucous performance, Asel received an invitation from the renowned French jazz pianist, Laurent Voulzière, to join him on tour in Europe. The opportunity was too great to pass up, and Asel spent the next few weeks rehearsing with Voulzière's band, learning the intricacies of his complex arrangements.

The European leg of their tour took them from Paris to Berlin, Amsterdam, and finally back to Budapest, where they played a sold-out show at the iconic Erzsébetvárosi Terem. Asel Németh was on fire that night, her trumpet wailing like a lost soul as she sang about love, heartbreak, and the struggles of growing up in a rapidly changing world.

The performance was hailed as one of the highlights of Budapest's jazz scene for years to come, cementing Asel Németh's status as one of Europe's most exciting young musicians.
