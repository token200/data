Asel Varga stepped into the dimly lit tavern, the patrons' eyes fixed on her like she was an apparition from another world. The air was thick with smoke and the smell of stale ale, but to Asel, it was home. She had grown up in this very town, surrounded by people who knew every trick in the book, but hers was a secret they would never uncover.

Asel took a seat at the bar, her piercing green eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. The bartender, a gruff old man named Grimbold, raised an eyebrow as she ordered a mug of his finest ale. "You're still here, Asel Varga," he said with a chuckle, knowing full well that she was the one person in town who could hold her own.

As the night wore on and the patrons began to thin out, Asel noticed a figure sitting in the corner, hood up and face obscured. She recognized the telltale glint of steel beneath their cloak and made a mental note to keep an eye on them. It was never wise to trust someone who wore that much armor without a good reason.

Asel pushed her mug aside and stood, padding over to the stranger. The figure slowly rose, revealing a young woman with skin as pale as moonlight and eyes that seemed to burn with an inner fire. "You're looking for me?" Asel asked, hand resting on the hilt of her own blade.

The woman nodded once, then again, before Asel could respond. A burst of movement sent the patrons scrambling for cover, but not Asel Varga. With a swift kick, she sent Grimbold's stool flying towards the mysterious stranger, and then stood, ready to face whatever lay ahead. In this world, only those who knew their own strength would survive.

Without another word, Asel led the young woman out into the night, the shadows swallowing them whole. For Asel Varga, there was no turning back â€“ she had a reputation to uphold, and if anyone threatened that, they would have to answer to her alone.
