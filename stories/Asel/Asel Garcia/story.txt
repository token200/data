Asel García sat in the dimly lit coffee shop, nursing a cup of cold brew. She had always been a quiet person, content to observe the world around her rather than participate in it. Her full name, Asel García, was often mispronounced by those who didn't know her, and she had grown accustomed to the correction: "Ash-el."

As she sipped her coffee, Asel's mind wandered back to her childhood. Growing up in a large family of modest means, she had always felt like an outsider. Her full name, which her parents had chosen in celebration of the Spanish holiday Día de los Muertos, seemed out of place among the more traditional names of her peers.

Despite this, Asel had thrived. She was a voracious reader and writer, devouring books on everything from science to philosophy. She spent hours each day scribbling away in her journal, exploring themes of identity and belonging.

As she gazed around the coffee shop, Asel noticed a young woman sitting across from her, typing away on her laptop. There was something about the woman's intensity that resonated with Asel. She felt an overwhelming urge to introduce herself, but hesitated, unsure if she wanted to disrupt the woman's focus.

Just as Asel was about to give up, the woman looked up and caught her eye. "Mind if I join you?" the woman asked, smiling. Asel shook her head, and the two women struck up a conversation. They talked for hours, discussing everything from literature to politics.

As the night wore on, Asel felt a sense of connection she hadn't experienced in years. It was as if she had finally found someone who understood her, who saw beyond the surface level to the complex, multifaceted person beneath. As they parted ways, Asel smiled to herself, feeling a sense of hope she hadn't felt in a long time. Maybe, just maybe, her full name – Ash-el García – wasn't so strange after all.
