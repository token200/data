Asel Durchdenwald stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar smell of damp earth and decay wafting up to greet her. It had been years since she'd returned to her hometown of Ravenshire, but the memories still lingered like the ghostly fog that clung to the hills.

Asel's eyes scanned the deserted station, her gaze lingering on the faded sign creaking in the gentle breeze. She felt a pang of nostalgia wash over her as she thought about all the times she'd passed through this very spot with her father, exploring the winding roads and hidden streams that crisscrossed the countryside.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Asel couldn't help but feel a sense of disconnection. She had left Ravenshire behind years ago, seeking adventure and success in the bustling cities of the south. But as she navigated the narrow alleys and crumbling stone buildings, she began to feel a restlessness that she hadn't experienced in a long time.

Asel Durchdenwald stopped in front of the old family cottage, her heart skipping a beat as she gazed up at the familiar fa√ßade. The windows were cloudy with age, but the door still hung crookedly on its hinges, just as it had when she was a child. She pushed open the creaking door and stepped inside, her eyes adjusting to the dim light.

The cottage was small, as she remembered it, with a single room and a narrow loft above. But as Asel Durchdenwald made her way up the stairs, she noticed that the air inside felt different - fresher, cleaner. She smiled to herself, realizing that her long absence had not been in vain. Her father's careful maintenance had kept the cottage in good repair, even if it did feel a little smaller than she remembered.

As the sun began to set outside, casting a golden glow over the hills, Asel sat down on the narrow bed and ran her fingers over the worn wooden beam above her head. She felt a sense of peace wash over her, as if she had finally come home to herself. Ravenshire may have changed, but some things remained constant - like the memory of her family's love and connection to this land. And for Asel Durchdenwald, that was enough.
