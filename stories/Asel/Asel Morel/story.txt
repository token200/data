Asel Morel stepped out of her worn leather jacket, the city lights reflected off the wet pavement like a thousand tiny diamonds. The smell of rain and smoke hung heavy in the air as she stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the concrete jungle below.

A former member of the notorious gang, "The Syndicate," Asel had left it all behind years ago - or so she thought. Now, as a freelance journalist, she spent her days digging up dirt on corrupt politicians and shady business deals, always looking over her shoulder for the ghosts of her past to catch up with her.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket, shrill and insistent. Asel hesitated for a moment before pulling it out, scanning the screen for any signs of trouble. The message was from an unknown number - someone claiming to have evidence that could bring down one of the most powerful men in the city.

Asel's eyes narrowed as she read on, her mind racing with possibilities. She knew better than to trust anyone completely, but there was something about this message that felt different. Maybe it was the lack of arrogance or bravado - whoever had sent it seemed genuinely scared.

She took a deep breath and typed out a response, agreeing to meet at an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. As she waited for her source to arrive, Asel's mind wandered back to The Syndicate days. She had been one of their most loyal soldiers, but when they'd gotten too close to the truth about their boss's embezzlement scheme, she'd bailed out, abandoning her crew and her reputation.

It was a risk she wouldn't take again - at least, not until this new lead turned up something concrete. Asel's instincts told her that this story could be big, one that would finally bring some justice to the people of this corrupt city.

Just as she finished typing, a figure appeared from the shadows, huddled in the corner of the rooftop. "Asel Morel?" they whispered, eyes darting nervously around the desolate landscape.

Asel nodded curtly, her journalist's instincts on high alert. She pulled out her recorder and notebook, ready to listen - and learn the truth that this mysterious source was so desperate to share.
