Asel Yang wiped the sweat from her forehead as she surveyed the chaos before her. The small antique shop was a disaster zone, with shelves overturned and vases shattered all over the floor. She sighed and shook her head, trying to process the mess that had been left behind by her rival, Jasper Lee.

Asel, also known as Asel Yang- Kim, was an expert in rare antiques, and she had built a reputation for herself in the community of collectors and dealers. But when Jasper had pulled out all the stops to sabotage her shop, Asel felt like she'd been punched in the gut.

She began methodically picking up each piece of broken china, dusting it off with a soft cloth, and placing it back on its shelf. It was painstaking work, but someone had to do it. Asel took pride in every item that passed through her hands, knowing that they would be cherished by new owners soon enough.

Just as she finished reorganizing the shop, the door swung open and Jasper walked in, a smug look on his face. "Well, well, well," he said, surveying the tidy space before him. "Looks like someone's been busy cleaning up after themselves."

Asel rolled her eyes. "I might have spent some time tidying up," she admitted. "But I'll have you know that my shop is still the best in town."

Jasper snorted. "Is it? Because from where I'm standing, your shop looks like a ghost town."

Asel raised an eyebrow. She knew Jasper was trying to get under her skin, but it wasn't going to work. Not today. She smiled sweetly and said, "Maybe you're just not used to seeing someone else in the lead for once."

The challenge sparked something in Jasper's eyes, and he stepped forward, his voice rising with excitement. "Oh, I'm shaking in my boots, Asel Yang-Kim! Bring it on!"

Asel chuckled to herself as Jasper continued to rant and rave. She knew that deep down, he was scared of her â€“ not just because she'd won a few awards for her antiques, but also because she had a way of staying calm under pressure.

With a flick of her wrist, Asel sent a small vase flying in Jasper's direction, narrowly missing him as it landed on his own counter. "Looks like the real show is about to begin," she said with a wink.

And with that, the battle for supremacy was back on.
