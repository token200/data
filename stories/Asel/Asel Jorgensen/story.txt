Asel Jorgensen stepped out of the dusty trailer and into the bright sunlight, squinting as she scanned the horizon for any sign of life. She had been driving for hours, with nothing but the hum of her old van and the endless road stretching out before her. Asel Jorgensen was a woman on a mission, one that she wasn't quite sure what the end goal was yet.

A ruggedly handsome man in his mid-30s emerged from behind a nearby cactus, eyeing Asel with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. "You lost or something?" he asked gruffly, hand resting on the grip of his holstered pistol.

Asel flashed him a disarming smile, her bright blue eyes sparkling with amusement. "Just passing through," she said, running a hand through her tangled brown hair. "I'm looking for someone."

The man raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. "Who might that be?"

Asel's gaze drifted off into the distance, her thoughts consumed by the mysterious stranger she had been searching for. She had received a cryptic message weeks ago, hinting at the existence of this person and offering no other clues. Asel Jorgensen was a private investigator, with a reputation for being one of the best in the business.

"What's your name?" she asked the stranger finally, breaking the silence.

"I'm Jake," he replied, his expression softening ever so slightly.

Asel nodded, her mind racing with possibilities. "I'm Asel Jorgensen."

The two of them stood there for a moment, the only sound the rustling of the desert wind through the cacti. Then, without warning, Jake spoke up. "You're looking for someone who's been gone for a while," he said quietly.

Asel's eyes snapped back into focus, her heart racing with excitement. How did this stranger know? She leaned in closer, her voice barely above a whisper. "How do you know?"

Jake hesitated, then nodded once. "I was there too," he said, his words sending a shiver down Asel Jorgensen's spine.
