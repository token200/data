Asel Moreau stood at the edge of the bustling streets, her eyes scanning the crowds with an air of quiet detachment. A skilled thief and con artist, she had honed her skills on the streets of Paris, where she grew up as a child of poverty and crime.

Her latest mark was a wealthy merchant named Marcellus, who had recently acquired a rare and valuable gemstone. Asel had been watching him for weeks, studying his habits and waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Tonight was that moment, as Marcellus attended a charity gala at the city's most prestigious hotel.

Asel slipped into the crowded ballroom, her long black dress blending in with the other guests. She worked the room, charming Marcellus with her wit and beauty, all while keeping a watchful eye on his gemstone, which he wore as a pendant around his neck.

The night wore on, and Asel expertly extracted herself from Marcellus's side, feigning interest in a nearby conversation. She made a quick exit, disappearing into the crowded hallway. It was then that she spotted her partner-in-crime, Léon, waiting for her outside.

"Voilà," he said, holding up a small keycard. "The gemstone is safe with us."

Asel smiled, a plan already forming in her mind. Together, they had planned to sell the gemstone on the black market, using Asel's connections to fence it for a handsome profit.

But as they made their escape, Asel couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. She glanced over her shoulder, and saw Marcellus standing behind them, his eyes blazing with anger.

"You'll never get away with this," he spat, lunging at Léon.

Asel's instincts took over, and she drew a small knife from her sleeve, ready to defend herself and Léon. But to her surprise, Marcellus didn't attack. Instead, he dropped the keycard to his feet and backed away, eyes locked on Asel with an unnerving intensity.

"You're not like I expected," he said, voice dripping with disdain. "I thought you'd be a common thief, but...but there's something more to you."

Asel's grip on her knife faltered, and she felt a shiver run down her spine. Who was this man, and what did he want from her?
