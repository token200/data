Asel Sánchez-Gijón, a 30-year-old Afro-Cuban poet and performance artist, stood at the edge of the vibrant street market in Havana's Old Town. The scent of ripe mangoes and fresh coffee filled the air as people bustled about, haggling over goods and gossiping with neighbors.

Asel took out her notebook and began to scribble down phrases from the conversations around her: "La vida es un río que no se puede parar" ("Life is a river that cannot be stopped"), "El alma de la ciudad es el ruido de las pasadas" ("The soul of the city is the noise of footsteps"). She closed her eyes, listening to the rhythm of the market, and let the words flow onto the page.

As she wrote, Asel's thoughts drifted back to her childhood in Guantánamo. Growing up as a Afro-Cuban in a predominantly white community, Asel had always felt like an outsider – yet, it was this very feeling that had fueled her passion for poetry and performance.

After college, Asel began performing at local spoken word events, using her art to explore themes of identity, politics, and the African diaspora. Her words were raw, honest, and unapologetic, speaking directly to the hearts of those who listened.

As she finished writing a new piece, Asel felt a sense of excitement wash over her. She tucked her notebook into her bag and began to make her way through the market, taking in the sights and sounds like never before. Everywhere she looked, she saw fragments of Cuba's complex history: crumbling colonial buildings, brightly colored street art, the faces of people who had lived and loved and laughed in this city for centuries.

Asel stopped at a small café, ordering a cup of strong coffee and striking up a conversation with an elderly man sitting alone at a table. He was a former fisherman, he told her, and his eyes sparkled as he spoke of the sea's mysteries and the stories they whispered to him on quiet nights.

Asel listened, mesmerized, as the words flowed from his lips like a river itself. She felt the boundaries between herself and this stranger begin to blur – and it was in that moment, standing in the midst of Havana's street market, that Asel Sánchez-Gijón knew she had found her true voice.
