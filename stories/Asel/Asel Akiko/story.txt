Asel Akiko sat alone in her small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and scattered notes. Her eyes wandered to the worn photograph on her desk, a faded image of herself as a young woman, standing proudly beside her late husband, Taro. The memory of his warm smile still lingered in her mind, but the ache of his loss had been growing more pronounced with each passing day.

Asel was a brilliant mathematician, known for her groundbreaking work on non-Euclidean geometry. Her research had earned her international recognition and accolades, yet she couldn't shake off the feeling of emptiness that had been following her since Taro's untimely passing. Her colleagues and friends tried to be supportive, but Asel felt like a stranger in her own life.

One day, as she was pouring over a particularly vexing equation, there was a knock at the door. It was an unexpected visitor - a young woman named Natsumi, who had been one of Taro's graduate students. She told Asel that she had heard about her remarkable work and wanted to discuss some ideas with her.

As they sat down together, something shifted within Asel. Natsumi was enthusiastic, genuinely interested in learning from the renowned mathematician. For the first time in months, Asel felt like herself again - not just a grieving widow, but a passionate scientist. Together, they delved into the complexities of fractals and topology, their conversation flowing effortlessly.

Over the next few weeks, Natsumi became a regular visitor to Asel's apartment. She would spend hours helping with equations, asking probing questions that forced Asel to think creatively. It was like a spark had been reignited within her - the fire that fueled her passion for mathematics was burning brighter than ever before.

Asel realized that she wasn't alone in her grief; Natsumi was still grieving her own losses, but in this quiet company, she found comfort. They talked about everything and nothing, sharing laughter and tears, and slowly but surely rebuilding Asel's sense of purpose.

One evening, as they sat together on the couch, surrounded by scattered papers and empty coffee cups, Asel turned to Natsumi with a smile. "Thank you," she said softly, her voice filled with emotion. "You've given me back my math, my life."
