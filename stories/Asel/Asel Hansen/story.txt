Asel Hansen stepped off the bus and onto the dusty main street of Willow Creek, her eyes scanning the small town with a mix of nostalgia and trepidation. It had been ten years since she'd left this place behind, chasing her dreams in the city. But after a decade of chasing the wrong things, Asel had found herself back where she started – in the one place that had ever truly felt like home.

Asel's parents had always encouraged her to follow her heart, and after high school, she'd set out to make a name for herself in the art world. She'd studied in New York, worked as a freelance graphic designer, and even landed a few big clients before the economy took a downturn and her career stalled.

Now, at 28, Asel was back in Willow Creek, working part-time at the local bookstore while she figured out what came next. Her parents had welcomed her back with open arms, but Asel couldn't shake the feeling that she'd failed somehow. That this was all there was for her – a life of quiet desperation in a small town she didn't even recognize anymore.

Asel made her way through the crowded streets, nodding to familiar faces along the way. The old diner where she used to grab breakfast with friends still had its chrome exterior and vinyl booths, but now it seemed smaller, more fragile than before. She felt like a stranger in a place that was supposed to be hers.

Eventually, Asel arrived at her family's old Victorian home on Elm Street, its porch creaking beneath her feet as she climbed the steps. Her mom had painted the front door bright pink this summer, and it made Asel's heart ache with happiness. This was where her childhood memories were made – where she'd spent hours playing in the attic with her siblings.

Asel pushed open the door, feeling a wave of warmth and love wash over her. "Hey, kiddo," her mom called out from the kitchen. "Welcome home."

Asel smiled, dropping her bag onto the floor as she hugged her mother tight. For now, at least, Asel Hansen was exactly where she was meant to be – surrounded by people who loved her, and a place that still felt like home.
