Asel Pérez Sánchez was a young and ambitious journalist from Havana, Cuba. She had always been passionate about storytelling and uncovering the truth behind the city's most pressing issues. With a sharp mind and a quick wit, Asel was determined to make a name for herself in the competitive world of journalism.

One day, while working on a story about the struggles faced by Havana's elderly population, Asel stumbled upon an intriguing lead.

Her work was more than just a job – it was a calling, a chance to use her skills to make a difference in the world.

Asel's success had opened doors for her, and she was now working on an even bigger project: exposing the systemic corruption that had long plagued Havana's healthcare system.
