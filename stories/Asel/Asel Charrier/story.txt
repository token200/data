The stranger smiled, revealing perfectly straight teeth. "I've been expecting you," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "My name is Victor, by the way. And I'm here to warn you."

Victor hesitated, glancing around nervously before leaning in close. "Your life," he whispered.

Without hesitation, Asel Charrier knew that Victor was telling the truth. This investigation had just gotten a whole lot more complicated.
