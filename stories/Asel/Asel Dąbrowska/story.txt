I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Asel Dąbrowska. It is possible that this person is not well-known or was created for the purpose of the story.

If you'd like, I can create a new story about a fictional character with a similar-sounding name and Polish heritage (Dąbrowska means "dwarf" in Polish), but the rest of the details will be unique to that character. Let me know!
