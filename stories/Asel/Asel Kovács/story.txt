Asel Kovács stood alone on the windswept rooftop, gazing out at the city below. The stars twinkled like diamonds scattered across the velvet expanse, and for a moment, the world seemed to slow down. Asel Kovács took a deep breath, feeling the chill of the night air fill their lungs.

Asel Kovács had always been drawn to the solitude, finding solace in the quiet hours before dawn. It was here, on this rooftop, that they could clear their mind and lose themselves in thought. The city below pulsed with energy, a never-ending stream of humans rushing to and fro, but Asel Kovács felt disconnected from it all.

Their thoughts turned to the past, to memories of childhood summers spent exploring the rolling hills and forests surrounding their village. Asel Kovács remembered laughing with friends, chasing after butterflies, and watching the stars twinkle overhead. Those carefree days seemed a lifetime ago now, lost in the passage of time.

Asel Kovács thought about the journey that had brought them to this moment. From the streets of Budapest to the rooftops of Prague, they had wandered, searching for meaning in a world that often felt chaotic and overwhelming. Along the way, they had encountered people from all walks of life, each with their own story to tell. Asel Kovács had listened, absorbing the experiences and wisdom of those around them.

The wind picked up, rustling the leaves of the nearby plants, and Asel Kovács felt a shiver run down their spine. They wrapped their arms around themselves, feeling the cold seep into their bones. But even in the chill, they found a sense of peace. It was a fragile thing, perhaps, but it was theirs, a spark that glowed within them like a beacon in the darkness.

Asel Kovács stood there, suspended between the world and their own private universe, feeling the weight of time bearing down upon them. And yet, in this moment, they knew they were exactly where they needed to be – alone, with only the stars for company.
