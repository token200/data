Asel Koskinen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. It had been years since she'd last set foot in Ravensport, and the once-thriving mining town was now a shadow of its former self.

Asel's thoughts were consumed by the letter that had brought her back to this place. From an old flame, Kari T채hk채, who claimed he'd stumbled upon a long-buried secret about Asel's family past. The words had danced across the page like wildfire, igniting a curiosity she couldn't shake.

She walked through the empty streets, passing by abandoned storefronts and crumbling houses. Ravensport was a town with a history as tough as its people, but it seemed to be slowly dying. The mine that had once provided for so many families now lay closed, a reminder of the hard times that still lingered in the air.

Asel stopped outside her old family home, now worn and faded like the rest of the town. She hadn't been back here in decades, not since her father's death when she was just a teenager. Her mother had moved away, seeking better opportunities, but Asel had stayed behind, feeling lost and alone.

She pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside. The air was stale and musty, filled with memories of laughter and tears. Asel's eyes adjusted to the dim light, taking in the familiar contours of her childhood home. A smile crept onto her face as she remembered the countless hours spent playing in this very room.

Just then, a knock at the door broke the silence. Asel's heart skipped a beat as Kari T채hk채 appeared in the doorway, his eyes shining with an intensity that seemed almost otherworldly. "Asel," he said softly, his voice barely above a whisper. "I'm glad you came back."

Without another word, Kari slipped inside and followed Asel into the past she had left behind.
