Asel Boucher stepped into the crowded café, scanning the room for familiar faces. She spotted her best friend, Lena, sipping on a latte in the corner and made her way over.

Lena looked up as Asel approached, a hint of curiosity on her face. "Hey, what's new with you?" she asked, setting down her cup.

Asel took a seat across from her, running her hands through her short, dark hair. "Not much, just the usual. Working at the library and trying to adult," she said, sighing wistfully.

Lena chuckled. "I'm sure it's not as exciting as being a freelance writer."

Asel raised an eyebrow. "Hey, someone has to pay the bills. And speaking of which, I've been meaning to ask you... have you seen my grandma's old recipe book? I need it for a project at work and I swear she lent it to me last time we visited."

Lena shook her head. "Sorry, Asel Boucher. I haven't seen it since you brought it over that one time. Maybe your mom knows where it is?"

Asel nodded, taking out her phone to text her mom. After a few minutes of searching, she found the recipe book listed in her mom's notes app.

"Ah-ha! I knew she'd be able to find it," Asel said, pocketing her phone and grinning at Lena. "Thanks for trying to help me out."

As they chatted and laughed together, Asel couldn't help but feel grateful for her close friendship with Lena. They had met in college, bonding over their shared love of literature and writing.

Over the next hour, Asel and Lena discussed everything from their favorite books to their plans for the upcoming summer. Asel left the café feeling content and happy, knowing she'd found a true friend in Lena.

As she walked home, Asel couldn't help but smile at the memory of her conversation with Lena. It was moments like these that made her feel grateful to have such a wonderful life, filled with good friends, a fulfilling job, and a passion for writing.
