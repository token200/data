Asel Välja was a name whispered in awe by those who knew him. A master thief and forger, his exploits were the stuff of legend, with many believing that he could steal anything and make it disappear into thin air.

But few knew much about Asel himself, aside from the fact that he had an uncanny ability to blend into his surroundings like a ghost. His dark hair was always perfectly messy, and his piercing green eyes seemed to gleam with mischief even in the most mundane of situations.

One day, Asel found himself in the city of Tønsberg, a bustling metropolis filled with merchants and traders from all corners of the world. He had received a tip about a valuable artifact that was set to be sold at an auction house on the outskirts of town, and he aimed to get his hands on it.

Asel dressed in fine attire, complete with a top hat and a perfectly tailored coat, and made his way to the auction house. He mingled with the other guests, feigning interest in the various items up for sale, all the while keeping a close eye on the artifact he sought.

When the time came to bid on the artifact, Asel stepped forward with a confident smile and offered a sum that no one else was willing to meet. The auctioneer raised an eyebrow but ultimately sold it to him, unaware of the true nature of the transaction.

As soon as the dust had settled, Asel slipped out of the auction house, his prize in hand. He quickly made his way back to his lodgings, a small flat above a bakery in the city's old quarter.

There, he carefully examined his prize, revealing it to be a rare and valuable gemstone that could change hands for a king's ransom on the black market. Asel Välja smiled to himself as he tucked the gem into his pocket, knowing that he had once again pulled off the impossible.

As he sat in his flat, surrounded by the quiet of the night, Asel couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. Being a master thief and forger wasn't just about getting away with things - it was also about staying one step ahead of the game. And Asel Välja was always the first to know that the next move would come from him alone.
