As a young man, Ismail had grown up surrounded by the bustling streets of Marrakech, where merchants haggled over silks and spices.

One day, a mysterious woman appeared at Ismail's doorstep, shrouded in shadows and bearing an otherworldly aura. She introduced herself as Lila, a sorceress from a forgotten realm, and revealed that she had been searching for the master weaver for centuries.

Lila possessed a magical loom of her own, one said to weave not just fabric but the very essence of reality. As Ismail watched in wonder, she wove a tapestry so breathtakingly beautiful it seemed to capture the heart of the universe itself. The threads shimmered with an ethereal light, imbuing all who beheld it with a sense of wonder and awe.
