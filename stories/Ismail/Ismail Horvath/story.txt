Ismail Horvath stepped out of the rain-soaked streets and into the dimly lit café, shaking the water from his coat. As a freelance journalist, he was no stranger to the dampness that clung to every corner of this city. He slid onto a stool at the counter, catching the eye of the barista, who raised an eyebrow in recognition.

"What can I get you, Horvath?" she asked, using the nickname only a few regulars knew.

Ismail smiled wryly as he ordered his usual: a black coffee and a slice of stale bread. The café was one of the few places where he could escape the cacophony of the city outside and focus on his work.

As he sipped his coffee, Ismail's mind turned to the story he was working on – an exposé about corruption in the local government. He had been investigating for months, pouring over documents and conducting interviews with sources who were willing to speak anonymously.

The door swung open, and a figure slipped into the café, avoiding eye contact with anyone. Ismail's instincts prickled; this was either his source or someone else entirely.

He watched as the figure took a seat in the corner, hood up and face obscured. His eyes locked onto the individual, a spark of recognition igniting within him. He had seen that look before – the look of someone who knew they were being watched.

Without making a sound, Ismail slipped his notebook from his bag and began to scribble notes by the faint light of the café's single bulb. The figure didn't stir, its presence seemingly absorbing into the shadows like a ghost.

As the minutes ticked by, Ismail knew he had found what he was looking for – confirmation that his source was genuine. He folded up his notebook and tossed a few coins on the counter, ready to leave when the stranger finally stirred.

When they did, Ismail stood tall, meeting their gaze without flinching. The figure remained seated, but something in their eyes shifted, like a door creaking open to reveal a hidden truth.
