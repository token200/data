However, it was not until he stumbled upon an old, leather-bound book in a used bookstore that Ismail's true calling became apparent.

The book, bound in worn black leather, contained cryptic notes and equations that spoke of ancient financial theories and secret societies. Entranced, Ismail spent countless hours poring over the pages, devouring every word like a starving man at an all-you-can-eat buffet.
