Ismail Rosén stepped off the train and onto the platform, his worn leather satchel slung over his shoulder. As he made his way through the bustling station, the soft glow of the lamps above cast long shadows behind him, like dark fingers reaching out to snare him.

A musician and wanderer, Ismail Rosén had spent years traveling through Europe, playing his violin in street corners and taverns, earning enough coin to keep himself fed and sheltered. He was a man of few words, preferring the silence of the night to the chatter of strangers.

As he walked, the sounds of the city grew louder – the clanging of pots, the laughter of children, the wail of sirens in the distance. Ismail Rosén's eyes scanned the crowds, searching for a glimpse of familiarity, but found instead the faces of strangers, each one as unique as the next.

He stopped at a small café on the corner, ordering a cup of black coffee from the barista with a nod and a smile. As he sipped his drink, Ismail Rosén pulled out his violin case and began to play, the melancholy strains weaving in and out of the din of the city like a ghostly refrain.

The crowd gathered around him, mesmerized by the beauty of his music. For a moment, they forgot their troubles and troubles were forgotten – all that remained was the sound of Ismail Rosén's violin and the world seemed to slow its pace.

A young woman with piercing green eyes stepped forward, her face tilted upwards as if drinking in the melody. Ismail Rosén locked onto her gaze, his fingers moving with a precision that bordered on the fierce. As he finished his final note, she applauded along with the rest, her hands clapping out the rhythm like a percussive heartbeat.

For a moment, their eyes met, and Ismail Rosén felt a jolt of connection – as if in that instant, they had known each other for years, shared stories and secrets that only the wind could hear. But when she turned to leave, he was left standing alone once more, his violin case closed tight around his instrument, his thoughts lost in the silence of the city streets.
