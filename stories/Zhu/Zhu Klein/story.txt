Born Zhong Lin Klein, he spent most of his life studying traditional techniques and experimenting with modern materials.

"Welcome to my studio," Zhong Lin Klein said with a warm smile, using his full name as an introduction. Luna's eyes widened as she took in the array of half-finished projects and raw materials scattered about.
