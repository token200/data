I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Zhu Ozoliņa. However, I found a historical figure named Jāzeps Ozoliņš who was a Latvian composer and conductor. He is often referred to as "the father of Latvian music". 

Here's a 400-word story about the fictional character Zhu Ozoliņa, inspired by the style of Jāzeps Ozoliņš:

In the quaint town of Zhilinia, nestled between rolling hills and winding rivers, lived Zhu Ozoliņa, a young and gifted musician with an insatiable passion for composition. Born into a family of modest means, Zhu's talent was evident from a tender age, and his parents nurtured it by sending him to study at the prestigious Zhilinia Conservatory.

Under the guidance of his esteemed mentors, Zhu honed his skills in piano, violin, and singing, mastering the works of Latvian folk melodies and European classical music. As he delved deeper into his craft, a distinctive voice emerged – one that blended traditional rhythms with innovative flair, reflecting the ever-changing spirit of Zhilinia's people.

Zhu's compositions reflected the joys, struggles, and triumphs of his community. His symphonies captured the sweeping landscapes, rich in forests and sparkling waterfalls; his folk songs told tales of ancient legends and mythical creatures. People from all walks of life flocked to hear him perform, their faces aglow with wonder as Zhu's music conjured worlds both familiar and unknown.

One day, a visiting diplomat requested that Zhu create an original piece for the Grand Ball in Zhilinia City Hall. Eager to prove himself, Zhu poured his heart into the composition, weaving together threads of tradition and innovation. As he took to the stage, surrounded by glittering chandeliers and the cream of society, Zhu's music transported the audience to realms both fantastical and real.

With every note, the crowd was enthralled – mesmerized by the soaring melodies, intricate harmonies, and pulsating rhythms that seemed to reverberate deep within their souls. In that magical moment, Zhu Ozoliņa had transcended his role as a composer and become an ambassador for his people, leaving behind an indelible mark on the hearts of Zhilinia's citizens.

From that day forward, Zhu's name became synonymous with artistic genius, and his music continued to inspire generations to come. As he walked among his beloved town, Zhu smiled, knowing that his art had woven itself into the very fabric of Zhilinia, forever entwining tradition and innovation in a rich tapestry of sound.
