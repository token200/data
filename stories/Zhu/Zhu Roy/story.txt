Zhu Roy was a humble potter living in ancient China's countryside. He spent his days plying his trade, crafting beautiful ceramics that adorned the homes and temples of the local villagers. His work was simple yet elegant, with subtle curves and colors that seemed to capture the essence of nature.

Despite his modest occupation, Zhu Roy had a passion for storytelling. In the evenings, after the sun had set over the hills, he would sit by the fire with his friends and family, sharing tales of myth and legend. His voice was like honey, smooth and rich, drawing listeners in with every word.

One day, a young traveler passed through the village, seeking shelter for the night. He was weary from his journey and stumbled upon Zhu Roy's workshop, where he found the potter at work on a new piece of art. The man was intrigued by the beauty of the ceramics and introduced himself to Zhu Roy.

Zhu Roy welcomed the stranger with open arms, offering him food and drink. As they sat together, the potter began to spin a tale of the Dragon King, a powerful deity who ruled over the rivers and lakes of ancient China. The story was full of wonder and magic, with mythical creatures and hidden treasures woven into its fabric.

The traveler listened, entranced, as Zhu Roy brought the world of legend to life before his eyes. When he finished speaking, the man thanked him and offered a reward for the tale – a small lump of clay that would serve as payment for the potter's art.

From that day forward, the young traveler visited Zhu Roy often, listening to tales of myth and magic whenever he passed through the village. The potter grew fond of his visitor, sharing stories that brought joy and wonder into the man's life. And though Zhu Roy's work may have been simple in appearance, it held within it a depth and richness that was all its own – a reflection of the beautiful world of myth and legend that he loved to share.

Years went by, and Zhu Roy continued to craft his beautiful ceramics, but now his work took on a new significance. For in each piece, he wove a thread of magic and wonder, drawing people together with the tales he told of ancient China's mythical past. And as for the young traveler, he became one of those who spread the potter's stories far and wide, ensuring that Zhu Roy's art would be remembered for generations to come.
