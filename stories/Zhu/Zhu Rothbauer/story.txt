I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named "Zhu Rothbauer". It is possible that this character does not exist in my knowledge database or is a relatively unknown entity.

However, I can create a new character and write a story about them. Here's a 400-word story:

In the land of Azura, where the sun dipped into the horizon and painted the sky with hues of crimson and gold, there lived a young inventor named Zhu Rothbauer. He was known throughout the kingdom for his ingenious creations, which often seemed to defy logic and convention.

Zhu's workshop was a cluttered maze of gears, springs, and curious contraptions. The smell of oil and metal hung in the air as he tinkered with his latest project: a machine that could harness the power of the setting sun.

As the clock struck six, Zhu stepped back from his workbench and surveyed his creation. The device, which he had dubbed "Solaria," hummed quietly to itself, its brass body glowing with an inner light.

Suddenly, the door to the workshop burst open and in walked Lyra, the kingdom's most renowned astronomer. Her eyes widened as she took in the sight of Solaria, and Zhu's face fell as he realized his invention might not be as revolutionary as he thought.

But Lyra was not there to criticize. Instead, she reached out a hand and gently touched the brass casing of Solaria. "This is incredible," she breathed. "How does it work?"

Zhu explained his theory – that by focusing the sun's energy onto a series of crystalline lenses, he could generate an intense, localized beam of power. Lyra listened intently, her mind racing with possibilities.

As they spoke, Zhu and Lyra began to brainstorm together. They envisioned Solaria powering homes, irrigation systems, and even small villages. The potential was vast, and their excitement was palpable.

With renewed enthusiasm, Zhu set to work fine-tuning Solaria. Together, the inventor and astronomer worked through the night, their collaboration fueling a fire of innovation that would soon illuminate the entire kingdom.

As the first light of dawn crept into the workshop, Zhu smiled at Lyra, who was busy calculating the precise angle of the sun's rays to optimize Solaria's performance. "This is just the beginning," he said, his eyes shining with excitement.

And in that moment, Zhu Rothbauer knew that nothing could stop him from changing the world – one ingenious invention at a time.
