Rumors were swirling about the company's true intentions and the nature of its revolutionary new product. Zhu Vuorinen was determined to get to the bottom of it, no matter what it took.

As she arrived at the startup's sleek glass-and-steel headquarters, she was greeted by the company's charismatic CEO, who introduced himself as Elias Kerkkänen. He warmly welcomed Zhu Vuorinen into his office and offered her a refreshing glass of Finnish sparkling water.
