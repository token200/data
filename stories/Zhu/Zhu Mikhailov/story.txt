I couldn't find any information on a person named Zhu Mikhailov. Could you please provide more context or details about who Zhu Mikhailov is and what kind of story you would like me to write? 

If not, I can create a fictional character and write a short story around him.

Zhu Mikhailov was a renowned astrophysicist from the Soviet Union during the Cold War era. He was known for his groundbreaking research on black holes and their properties.

One fateful night in 1955, Zhu Mikhailov received an unusual visit from a mysterious stranger who claimed to be an alien observer from a distant planet. The being, who called himself "Zorvath," revealed that humanity had been watching Earth's progress with great interest, but also expressed concerns over the destructive tendencies of humans towards each other.

Intrigued by Zorvath's words, Zhu Mikhailov was drawn into a series of intense conversations about the nature of space and time. Over several weeks, the two men discussed topics ranging from Einstein's theory of relativity to the implications of quantum mechanics on black hole behavior.

Zhu Mikhailov became increasingly obsessed with the idea that there might be more to reality than what humans could perceive with their senses. He began conducting experiments in his laboratory, trying to create artificial black holes using powerful lasers and magnetic fields.

As news of his research spread, Zhu's colleagues grew concerned about his erratic behavior and increasing reclusiveness. However, they couldn't deny the remarkable breakthroughs he was making in understanding the mysteries of space-time.

Finally, after months of tireless work, Zhu Mikhailov succeeded in creating a stable black hole within his laboratory. The event marked a major milestone in human history, opening up new avenues for research and exploration.

Zhu Mikhailov's discovery sparked both awe and fear among the scientific community. While some hailed him as a visionary, others warned that his creation could be the beginning of humanity's downfall.

Zorvath reappeared to offer Zhu Mikhailov one final message: "The universe is full of mysteries, but beware, for the power to unlock them can also be a curse." With those ominous words, he vanished into thin air, leaving Zhu Mikhailov to ponder the true nature of his creation and its potential consequences.

From that day forward, Zhu Mikhailov was known as the man who tamed the cosmos, but at what cost?
