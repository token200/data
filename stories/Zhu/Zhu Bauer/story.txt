Zhu Bauer was a master thief known for her lightning-fast speed and unparalleled agility. Born Zhu Yanming, she had always been fascinated by the art of thievery, honing her skills on the streets of ancient China. As she grew older, her nickname "Bauer" (meaning "archer" in German) became synonymous with stealth and precision.

One night, under the light of a full moon, Zhu Bauer set out to steal the fabled Golden Dragon, a priceless artifact housed within the heavily guarded Imperial Palace. She had spent months casing the palace, studying the guards' routines and waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

As she slipped through the shadows, her bare feet barely making a sound on the stone floor, Zhu Yanming's trained eyes scanned the area for any sign of danger. Her hands moved swiftly, snatching a handful of pearls from a nearby vase before she was gone, leaving behind only a whisper of her presence.

The next morning, the Emperor himself received news of the theft, his face red with rage and disappointment. But when he called upon his trusted advisor to investigate, he was met with an enigmatic smile – for it was Zhu Yanming who had been seen lurking around the palace walls earlier that night.

Though she remained elusive, rumors of Zhu Bauer's exploits spread far and wide, earning her both admiration and notoriety throughout the land. Some claimed she was a hero, using her skills to bring balance to a corrupt society. Others whispered that she was a malevolent force, preying upon the wealthy and powerful for her own gain.

Zhu Yanming, however, remained indifferent to such labels. She knew only one truth: Zhu Bauer was the greatest thief of all time, and nothing would ever change that. With a knowing smile, she vanished into the night, ready to plan her next move – for in her world, every night was an opportunity to pull off the impossible.
