In the small village of Jing Huang, nestled in the rolling hills of ancient China, lived a young woman named Zhu Totti. She was known throughout the village for her remarkable skills as a calligrapher and painter, whose works seemed to capture the essence of the natural world.

Zhu Totti's full name was Zhu Yuyi Totti, which roughly translated to "Moonlight Pen Stroke." Her parents had given her this name in hopes that it would inspire her to create beauty that shone like the moon. As a child, she spent hours practicing the intricate strokes of calligraphy, mesmerized by the way the ink flowed across the paper.

As she grew older, Zhu Totti's talents only expanded. She began to paint vibrant landscapes and portraits, using colors that seemed almost otherworldly. Her brushstrokes danced across the canvas, imbuing each piece with a sense of life and movement. The villagers would gather around her easel, watching in awe as she brought her visions to life.

One day, a wealthy merchant from the nearby city came to Jing Huang seeking the finest artwork for his palace. He had heard of Zhu Totti's remarkable skills and sought her out, hoping to commission a piece that would surpass all others. After viewing several of her works, he was convinced: only Zhu Yuyi Totti could create something truly sublime.

The merchant commissioned a large-scale painting, depicting the majestic dragon king of Chinese mythology. Zhu Totti threw herself into the project, pouring all her energy and creativity into the work. For weeks, she toiled away, experimenting with colors and techniques until finally, the painting was complete.

When the merchant returned to behold his masterpiece, he was overcome with emotion. The painting seemed to pulse with life, capturing the essence of the dragon king in a way that transcended words. From that day on, Zhu Totti's full name, "Moonlight Pen Stroke," was known throughout the land as synonymous with excellence and beauty.
