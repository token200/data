Sara Dąbrowska was a young and ambitious journalist, known for her sharp instincts and quick thinking. Growing up in Warsaw, Poland, Sara had always been fascinated by the world of politics and social justice.

One day, Sara received an email from Magdalena, thanking her for shedding light on their cause.

As she looked back on her journey, Sara Dąbrowska knew that this was just the beginning of her fight for truth and justice.
