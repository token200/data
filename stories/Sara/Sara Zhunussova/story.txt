Sara Zhunussova stepped into the crowded café, weaving through the throngs of people as she made her way to the counter. She ordered a strong coffee and took a seat at a small table by the window, watching as the rain pattered against the pane.

As she sipped her coffee, Sara's mind began to wander back to her childhood in the small village where she grew up. Her parents had been nomads, traveling from place to place with their colorful caravan, and Sara had learned to be self-sufficient from a young age. She had always felt most at home when on the move, with nothing but the open road stretching out before her.

As she sat in the café, lost in thought, Sara noticed a young woman sitting across from her. The girl was sketching in a notebook, her eyes fixed intently on the paper as she worked. There was something about her that caught Sara's attention - perhaps it was the way her brow furrowed in concentration, or the way her hair fell in loose waves down her back.

After a few minutes, the girl looked up and caught Sara's eye. They exchanged a brief smile, and then the girl went back to her sketching. Sara watched her for a while longer, feeling a sense of connection to this stranger that she couldn't quite explain.

As she finished her coffee and prepared to leave, the girl closed her notebook and stood up. "I'm so sorry," she said, "but I couldn't help noticing you sitting there. You have a strange, far-off look in your eye." Sara smiled, feeling a sense of recognition with this stranger who seemed to understand her.

"I've been on the move my whole life," she said, as they shook hands. "I'm Sara Zhunussova." The girl's eyes widened in surprise, and then she laughed. "I'm Lena," she said. "And I think we might be long-lost friends."
