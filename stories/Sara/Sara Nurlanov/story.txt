Sara Nurlanov was determined to do justice to the story, pouring over notes and conducting interviews with the townspeople.

Her first stop was the local coffee shop, where she met with Maria, the owner and proprietor of the beloved caf√©. Over steaming cups of coffee, Maria shared her vision for the town's future, from the new shops and restaurants to the plans for a community center. Sara Nurlanov listened intently, taking meticulous notes as she asked follow-up questions.
