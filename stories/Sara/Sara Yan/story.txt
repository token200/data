Sara Yan had always been fascinated by the supernatural. Growing up in a small town in the Pacific Northwest, she spent countless hours poring over books on ghosts, demons, and other paranormal entities. As a child, her friends would often tease her about her "weird" interests, but Sara didn't let their skepticism deter her.

As she grew older, Sara's passion for the supernatural only intensified. She began to study the occult in earnest, spending long hours researching and experimenting with various forms of magic. Her parents, though worried about her safety, encouraged her pursuits, recognizing that Sara had a natural talent for magic.

Now, at 25, Sara was a skilled practitioner of the arcane arts. She worked as a consultant for a local paranormal investigation team, helping them to analyze evidence and debunk hoaxes. But despite her success in the world of ghost hunting, Sara couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more out there for her.

One night, while reviewing footage from a recent investigation, Sara stumbled upon an unusual recording. The tape showed a figure lurking just beyond the edge of frame, its presence seeming to warp and distort the air around it. Intrigued, Sara spent hours poring over the footage, trying to make sense of what she was seeing.

As the days passed, Sara found herself becoming increasingly obsessed with the mysterious figure. She devoured books on demonology and demon hunting, seeking any information that might shed light on the creature's identity. And finally, after weeks of research, she discovered a shocking truth: the figure was none other than Xexaria, a powerful demon from ancient mythology.

Determined to learn more about Xexaria, Sara set out on a perilous journey to confront the demon head-on. With her parents' blessing and the support of her investigation team, she embarked on a quest that would change her life forever. As Sara Yan, the young witch was ready to face whatever dangers lay ahead, armed with nothing but her courage and her wits.
