Sara Nilsson stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for any familiar faces. As she waited in line to order, her mind wandered back to the previous night's events. She had received a cryptic message from an unknown number, inviting her to meet at this very café.

As she reached the front of the line, Sara ordered a cup of black coffee and took a seat by the window. She pulled out her phone and checked the time. A few minutes later, a figure emerged from the crowd and made their way towards her.

It was Alex, an old friend from college. They had lost touch after graduation, but the message on his phone had sparked a mix of curiosity and apprehension within Sara. As they hugged, Sara couldn't help but notice the change in Alex's demeanor. He seemed more subdued, more introspective than she remembered.

"What brings you here?" Sara asked, as they sat down at a small table by the window.

"I got your message," Alex replied, his eyes darting around the café. "I didn't know what to make of it. But I figured it was better to face whatever is going on head-on."

Sara leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. "I've been getting these strange messages too, ever since graduation. They're always cryptic, but they seem to be watching me."

Alex's expression turned serious. "Do you think it's connected?"

Sara shook her head. "I don't know, but I'm starting to feel like I'm in over my head."

The two friends sat in silence for a moment, sipping their coffee and watching the people outside. Then, without warning, Alex spoke up.

"I have something to tell you, Sara Nilsson," he said, his eyes locked on hers. "Something that could change everything."
