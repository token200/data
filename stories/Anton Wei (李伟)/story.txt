Anton Wei, also known as Lee Wei, was a 25-year-old Taiwanese-Canadian singer-songwriter who had been making waves in the music scene with his unique blend of indie folk and electronic elements. Born in Taipei, Taiwan, to a family of musicians, Anton was exposed to music from a young age. He began writing songs at 15 and eventually dropped out of college to pursue a career in music.

After moving to Vancouver, Canada, Anton began performing at local venues and festivals, building a loyal following among fans who appreciated his introspective lyrics and soaring vocals. His debut album, "Lost in the Haze," received critical acclaim, with many praising his distinctive sound and emotional depth.

Despite his growing success, Anton struggled with anxiety and depression, which he often channeled into his music. His songs were a reflection of his inner world, exploring themes of love, loss, and self-discovery. With each new release, Anton's fan base grew, and he found himself playing larger venues and festivals across North America.

One evening, after a particularly grueling tour schedule, Anton received an email inviting him to perform at a prestigious music festival in New York City
