Lina Muller stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the quaint station. She had been traveling for hours, and finally, she was in the small town of Ravenswood, where her grandmother lived. Lina Muller had always been close to her grandmother, who had raised her after her parents' passing.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Lina Muller couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her. This was where she grew up, surrounded by the rolling hills and dense forests that seemed to stretch on forever. She had spent countless summers exploring these woods with her grandmother, learning about the local flora and fauna.

When she arrived at her grandmother's cozy cottage, Lina Muller was greeted with a warm smile and a steaming cup of tea. Her grandmother, Agnes, invited her in and they sat down by the fire to catch up on old times. As they chatted, Lina Muller couldn't help but notice the way the light danced through the windows, casting a golden glow over the room.

Over the next few days, Lina Muller settled back into the rhythms of small-town life. She spent her mornings helping Agnes with the gardening and baking, and her afternoons exploring the surrounding countryside on foot or by bike. It was peaceful, and for the first time in a long while, she felt like herself again.

As they sat down to dinner one evening, Agnes turned to Lina Muller with a curious expression. "You know, child," she said, her voice low and gentle, "I've been thinking about your life lately." Lina Muller's heart skipped a beat as her grandmother continued, "I think it's time you started making plans for yourself again. You're not just a young woman with a dream; you have the world at your feet."

Lina Muller felt a surge of determination rise up within her. She knew that her grandmother was right - she did have a life to live, and a future to build. And as she looked around at the familiar sights of Ravenswood, she knew exactly where she wanted to start.
