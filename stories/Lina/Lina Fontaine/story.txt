Lina Fontaine stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar sight of the old station. It had been years since she'd set foot in Ravenswood, but the small town still held a piece of her heart. As she made her way through the crowds, Lina Fontaine's thoughts turned to the reason for her return: her grandmother's estate.

Her grandmother, Odette Fontaine, had been a pillar of the community, and now that she was gone, Lina had inherited not only her home but also her vast collection of antique dolls. The dollmaker's shop on Main Street seemed like the perfect place to start her search for answers about Odette's past.

As Lina pushed open the door, a bell above it rang out, and the owner, Madame Dupont, looked up from behind the counter. "Ah, bonjour, Lina Fontaine! Welcome back to Ravenswood."

Lina smiled, feeling a sense of nostalgia wash over her. She had spent countless hours playing among these very dolls as a child, listening to Odette's tales of adventure and romance. Now, she hoped to uncover some secrets of her own.

Madame Dupont gestured for Lina to follow her, leading her to the back room where a shelf was dedicated entirely to antique dolls. As they browsed through the collection, Lina Fontaine's eyes widened in amazement – each doll seemed to hold its own story, and she felt an overwhelming urge to learn more.

The hours passed, with Madame Dupont sharing tales of Ravenswood's history and the various owners of the dolls over the years. As the sun began to set, Lina thanked her for the tour, feeling a sense of purpose that she hadn't felt in years. She knew that this journey would be long and difficult, but with each step, she was one step closer to understanding her family's past – and reclaiming a piece of herself.

Lina Fontaine left the shop with a small trunk under her arm, containing some of the most precious dolls from Odette's collection. As she walked away, the fading light cast long shadows behind her, but Lina knew that the real journey was only just beginning – one that would take her to the heart of Ravenswood and the secrets hidden within its ancient stones.
