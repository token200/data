Lina Kask stepped into the dimly lit tavern, her eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As a skilled huntress and member of the prestigious Order of the Silver Stag, she had faced her share of dangers, but this place reeked of something more sinister.

She spotted a hooded figure sitting in the corner, sipping a mug of ale. Lina Kask's hand instinctively went to the dagger at her waist, a habit formed from years of hunting in the wilderness. She approached the figure, her boots making soft crunching sounds on the wooden floorboards.

"Mind if I join you?" she asked, her voice low and even.

The hooded figure looked up, revealing piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into Lina Kask's soul. "I suppose it's no matter," they replied, their voice low and gravelly.

Lina Kask took a seat across from the stranger, her eyes never leaving theirs. "What brings you to this place?" she asked, trying to keep her tone neutral.

The figure leaned forward, their hood falling away from their face. Lina Kask's eyes widened in surprise as she saw it was none other than Arin Vex, a former enemy who had turned against the Order of the Silver Stag.

"I've been working undercover," Arin Vex explained, "trying to uncover the source of a dark force that threatens our world. I believe it starts here, in this tavern."

Lina Kask's grip on her dagger tightened as she listened to Arin Vex's words. She had always known that there was something amiss within the Order, but she had never suspected its extent.

"What do you need from me?" she asked, her hand still resting on her dagger.

Arin Vex smiled, a hint of mischief in their eyes. "I need your skills, Lina Kask. Together, we can uncover the truth behind this dark force and put an end to it."

Lina Kask's expression was unreadable as she considered Arin Vex's proposal. She knew that working with a former enemy would be fraught with danger, but something about Arin Vex's words resonated within her.

"I'm in," she said finally, standing up and smoothing out her cloak.

Arin Vex grinned, a glint of excitement in their eyes. "Together, we'll make a formidable team, Lina Kask."

As they left the tavern together, Lina Kask couldn't shake off the feeling that their journey was only just beginning, one fraught with danger and uncertainty. But she was ready to face it head-on, alongside her unlikely ally, Arin Vex.
