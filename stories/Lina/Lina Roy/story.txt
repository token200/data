Lina Roy stood in front of her desk, sipping her lukewarm coffee as she gazed out the window of her office in the Indian government ministry. She was a rising star in the party, known for her sharp wit and unapologetic honesty. As the Minister of State for External Affairs, Lina had a reputation for being fiercely loyal to Prime Minister Manoj Sharma.

Just then, her phone buzzed with an incoming call from her chief advisor, Rakesh Verma. "Lina, we have a problem," he said, his voice laced with worry. "The Pakistani foreign minister has called us again, and this time it's about the Kashmir issue."

Lina sighed, rubbing her temples. She had been dealing with this issue for months now, and she was no closer to finding a resolution. But she knew that Manoj Sharma would want her to try, so she nodded silently and began to listen.

"Rakesh, tell him I'll call him back in an hour," Lina said finally, ending the call. She sat back down, staring out the window as she tried to gather her thoughts.

As she pondered the situation, a knock at the door broke the silence. It was Manoj Sharma himself, his face creased with concern. "Lina, I need to talk to you about the Kashmir issue," he said, his voice low and serious.

"I know, sir," Lina replied, standing up to greet him. "I've been on it all morning."

Manoj smiled wryly. "Good. I was worried that you'd be asleep at your desk by now." He gestured for her to follow him, leading her out of the office and into a meeting room deep in the heart of the ministry.

As they sat down, Lina couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration wash over her. She knew that this issue was going to be a tough one to crack, but she also knew that Manoj Sharma trusted her implicitly. And with his backing, Lina Roy felt invincible.
