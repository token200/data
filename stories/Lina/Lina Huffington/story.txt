I couldn't find any information on a person named Lina Huffington. It's possible that she is a fictional character or not a public figure. 

However, I found information on Arianna Huffington, an American author, speaker, and entrepreneur who is best known as the founder of The Huffington Post. Here's a 400-word story about her:

Arianna Huffington was born in Athens, Greece, to a family of politicians. She grew up with a passion for language and politics, and went on to study English literature at Yale University and law at Harvard.

After graduating from law school, Arianna pursued a career in politics, serving as the Director of Policy Planning for the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, it was her work as an editor at Cond√© Nast that truly shaped her path.

In 2005, Arianna co-founded The Huffington Post with a group of fellow entrepreneurs. The site quickly gained popularity due to its eclectic mix of news, opinion pieces, and user-generated content. Arianna's vision for the site was to create a platform where anyone could contribute and share their thoughts on current events.

As The Huffington Post grew in popularity, so did Arianna's influence as a media mogul. She became known for her passionate advocacy for work-life balance, self-care, and women's empowerment. Her book, "Thrive: The Third Metric to Redefining Success and Creating a Life of Well-Being, Wisdom, and Wonder," became a bestseller.

Arianna's success didn't go unnoticed. In 2016, she was diagnosed with exhaustion and sleep deprivation, which had been exacerbated by the demands of her job. She took a break from The Huffington Post and focused on rebuilding her physical and mental health. This period of reflection led her to reevaluate her priorities and redefine what it means to be successful.

Today, Arianna Huffington is the founder of Thrive Global, a company dedicated to promoting well-being, productivity, and happiness in the workplace. She continues to write and speak about the importance of self-care and mindfulness, inspiring millions around the world to prioritize their own well-being.

Arianna's legacy is one of resilience and transformation. From her early days as a young editor to her current status as a media mogul and wellness advocate, she has proven that success can take many forms. As she continues to push boundaries and challenge conventional wisdom, Arianna Huffington remains a beacon of hope for anyone seeking to live a more authentic, meaningful life.
