Lina Kalēja was a skilled martial artist who had spent her entire life mastering the ancient art of Kalaripayattu. Born in Kerala, India, Lina's family had passed down their knowledge of this traditional Indian martial art from generation to generation.

For years, she devoted herself to perfecting her technique, honing her strength and agility, and learning the intricate philosophy behind the art.
