Lina Kovacs stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. She had been on the move for weeks, always staying one step ahead of her pursuers. As a former detective, she knew that her past was riddled with mistakes and dead ends, but she couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more out there for her.

Lina Kovacs adjusted her backpack and took a deep breath, feeling the familiar tension in her shoulders. She had been on the run since her last case went south, leaving her partner dead and her reputation in tatters. But she had always been one to take risks, and this time was no different.

As she walked through the station, Lina Kovacs noticed a young woman eyeing her from across the room. The woman's eyes were a deep brown, and her dark hair was pulled back into a tight ponytail. She looked like she belonged on the streets of Budapest, not in some dingy train station in Eastern Europe.

Lina Kovacs smiled wryly to herself. She knew that look all too well. It was the look of someone who had been through as much as she had, and yet still managed to hold her head high. The woman approached Lina Kovacs cautiously, introducing herself as Szofi.

Szofi told Lina Kovacs about a local artist who was being threatened by some shady characters. She wanted Lina Kovacs' help in getting the artist out of town safely. Lina Kovacs hesitated for a moment, weighing her options. But there was something about Szofi's determination that resonated with her.

"Okay," she said finally, "I'm in." Together, Lina Kovacs and Szofi set off into the unknown, their footsteps echoing through the deserted streets of Eastern Europe. As they walked, Lina Kovacs felt a sense of purpose wash over her, reminding her that maybe, just maybe, this was where she belonged.

For now, at least, Lina Kovacs had a new lead to follow, and a chance to redeem herself in the eyes of others. It was a start, and it would have to do. With Szofi by her side, Lina Kovacs felt like she could face anything that came their way.
