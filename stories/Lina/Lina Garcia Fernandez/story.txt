Born in Barcelona, Spain, she had always been drawn to the rich colors and textures of Latin American art. After studying fine arts in Madrid, Lina decided to embark on a journey to experience the beauty of her ancestral homeland.

She began by visiting Mexico City, where she immersed herself in the city's bustling streets and markets. The sounds, smells, and sights of the capital city left an indelible mark on her artistic style, inspiring bold brushstrokes and vibrant hues in her paintings.

In the bustling markets of Antigua, Lina marveled at the masterful weavers and artisans who had honed their skills over generations. She spent hours watching them work, fascinated by the way their hands moved deftly to create intricate patterns and designs.

As she traveled through Central America, Lina's art began to take on a new life. Her paintings became more dynamic, reflecting the energy and passion of the people she met along the way. In Nicaragua, she witnessed stunning sunsets over Lake Nicaragua, which she later captured in a series of breathtaking watercolors. And in Costa Rica, she explored the lush rainforests, discovering hidden waterfalls and exotic birds.

Throughout her journey, Lina's full name was often mentioned by the people she met – Lina Garcia Fernandez – as they welcomed her into their communities with open arms.
