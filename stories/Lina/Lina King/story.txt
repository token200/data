Lina King sat alone at her kitchen table, staring blankly at the newspaper in front of her. The headlines screamed of another devastating fire ravaging the city, leaving destruction and heartbreak in its wake. She felt a knot forming in her chest as she thought about the countless families that had lost everything.

As a volunteer firefighter, Lina knew the toll the job took on people's lives. She'd seen it time and time again: friends losing their homes, colleagues struggling to cope with trauma. But what really bothered her was when people forgot who they were before the fire department. They became "Firefighters" or just lost themselves in their new roles.

Lina sighed, pushing back her chair. She needed a change of scenery. Grabbing her bag, she headed out into the bright sunlight. The streets were bustling with people rushing to and fro, but Lina ignored them all. She made her way to the nearby park, where children were playing tag on the green grass.

One little boy caught her eye – no more than five years old, with a mop of messy brown hair and a grin that could light up a room. His eyes sparkled as he chased after his friends, completely carefree. Lina watched him for a while, feeling an unfamiliar pang in her chest.

For the first time in months, she wasn't thinking about fires or trauma or loss. All she saw was this little boy's joy. He reminded her of what it meant to be alive – unencumbered by worry or fear.

Without thinking, Lina knelt down beside him and asked if he wanted to draw something together. The boy eagerly agreed, and as they sat on the grass, sketching a family of animals playing soccer, Lina felt a weight lift off her shoulders.

In that moment, she remembered why she started volunteering in the first place: not just to fight fires but to be there for people who needed someone – anyone – to talk to. She realized that sometimes, all it took was a friendly ear and a drawing pencil to bring someone back from the brink of despair.

As they finished their art project, Lina stood up, brushing off her pants. "You know, little guy," she said with a smile, "I think you've taught me something important today."

The boy looked up at her, eyes shining bright. "What's that?" he asked.

Lina smiled again. "That sometimes, being alive means finding joy in the smallest things – and sharing it with others."
