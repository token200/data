Lina Avendano walked into the small café, her eyes scanning the crowded room for a familiar face. She had been searching for months, trying to track down the last lead in her sister's disappearance. The bartender, a friendly man named Carlos, looked up from his coffee and smiled.

"Lina! What brings you here today?" he asked, setting a cup of steaming coffee in front of her.

Lina took a sip, feeling a brief moment of comfort before her thoughts turned back to her sister. "I'm looking for information," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Anybody seen or heard anything about Emily Avendano?"

Carlos leaned in, his expression serious. "I remember a woman coming in here a few weeks ago. She was asking questions, too. I didn't think much of it at the time, but maybe you should talk to her."

Lina's heart skipped a beat as she asked Carlos to call the mysterious woman over. A few minutes later, a young woman with piercing green eyes walked into the café.

"Hi," Lina said, standing up to greet her. "I'm Lina Avendano. You were here a few weeks ago, asking questions."

The woman smiled politely. "Lily, nice to meet you, Lina Avendano. I was just trying to gather some information for a friend who's researching a case."

Lina narrowed her eyes, sensing that Lily wasn't telling the truth. She pressed on, determined to get as much information as she could from the enigmatic stranger.

"Okay," Lily said, seeming to relax in Lina's presence. "I did talk to someone about Emily Avendano. They mentioned a suspicious person seen lurking around her apartment complex."

Lina's ears perked up at this. This was exactly what she had been searching for. "Do you have any idea who that person might be?" she asked, her mind racing with possibilities.

Lily shook her head apologetically. "I'm afraid I don't know anything concrete. But I did find something interesting – a small piece of paper on the ground outside Emily's apartment building. It had a phone number on it."

Lina's eyes widened as she pulled out her phone to dial the number. This was her best lead yet, and she was determined to follow it to its conclusion.
