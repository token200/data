She began by working freelance projects, taking on commissions from friends and family to build up her portfolio.

When asked if she had any plans for the future, Kamila smiled confidently. "I'm just taking it one step at a time," she said. "But I do have big dreams â€“ eventually, I'd like to open my own studio and gallery."

The art critic, who had been quietly observing from the sidelines, stepped forward to offer his congratulations. "Kamila Mitchell, you truly are an exceptional talent," he said with a warm smile.
