Kamila Sandström, a 25-year-old Swedish journalist, had always been driven by a passion for storytelling. Growing up in the small town of Stockholm, she spent most of her childhood scribbling stories and interviewing locals about their lives.

After completing her degree in journalism, Kamila landed an internship at a local newspaper, where she quickly made a name for herself as a talented young reporter. Her sharp instincts and curiosity led to several breakthrough stories, earning her recognition within the industry.

One day, Kamila received a tip about a mysterious abandoned factory on the outskirts of town, rumored to hold secrets about Stockholm's industrial past.
