Anya Wojcik stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. She had been on the move for weeks, fleeing the memories that haunted her small town in Poland. As she gathered her belongings, a young woman with bright pink hair caught her attention.

"Excuse me," the pink-haired girl said, holding out a piece of paper. "I'm looking for someone to share an apartment with. The building's owner is willing to give us a great deal if we're willing to sign on the dotted line."

Anya's initial hesitation gave way to curiosity. She took the paper and scanned it quickly, her eyes widening as she saw her name scribbled across the top: Anya Wojcik, co-signer. A shiver ran down her spine as she looked up at the girl, whose name tag read Lily.

"I'm not sure," Anya said, tucking the paper into her bag. "I've been on my own for a while now."

Lily's expression softened. "I totally get it. I've been living out of a backpack for months too. But think about it – we could split the rent and utilities in half. You'd have plenty of room to spread out, and I'd have someone to talk to when the nights get tough."

Anya hesitated, weighing her options. She couldn't shake the feeling that this was more than just a chance to find a new place to stay – it was an opportunity to start anew.

As they discussed the terms, Anya's mind wandered back to her childhood home, where her memories still lingered like a ghostly presence. The wooden floorboards creaking beneath her feet, the sound of her parents' laughter carrying through the streets... she pushed the thoughts away, focusing on the present.

Lily, sensing her distraction, placed a reassuring hand on her arm. "Hey, you okay? We can do this."

Anya smiled wryly, tucking her hands into her pockets once more. Maybe it was time to take Lily up on that offer. After all, she did have two empty suitcases waiting for her in the back of the train car.

"You know what?" she said, a spark of determination igniting within her. "I think I'll take you up on that."

Together, they signed the lease and sealed their fate as unlikely roommates – Anya Wojcik, co-signer extraordinaire.
