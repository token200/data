Anya Vasiliev stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. She spotted her friend, Sasha, sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee. Anya made her way over, exchanging warm smiles with those around her.

Sasha looked up as Anya approached, and their eyes met in a flash of understanding. "Hey," Sasha said, setting down his cup. "It's been too long."

Anya slid into the seat across from him, running a hand through her dark hair. "I know. I've been busy with work." She took a sip of her own coffee, feeling the caffeine course through her veins.

Sasha nodded sympathetically. "I can imagine. You're always on the go." He turned his attention to the cup in front of him, stirring the remaining coffee with a spoon.

Anya's gaze drifted out the window, watching as people walked by on the bustling street below. She loved days like this – quiet, yet full of possibility. It was moments like these that she cherished, savoring the stillness before the chaos of her day began.

As they sat in silence, a group of artists strolled into the café, their colorful scarves and jewelry drawing attention to themselves. Anya's eyes widened as one of them caught her eye – a young woman with a paint-splattered apron and a wild tangle of curly hair. There was something about the way she moved, like she was alive and carefree.

Sasha followed her gaze, his eyebrows raising in interest. "Who's that?" he asked, turning back to Anya.

Anya shrugged, smiling. "No idea, but I think I need to meet her."
