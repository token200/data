Anya Szabo stepped onto the worn wooden dock, her eyes fixed on the small fishing boat bobbing in the gentle lake breeze. The sun was setting over the water, casting a warm orange glow across the surrounding trees. It was moments like these that Anya felt most at peace.

As she began to untie the boat's moorings, a soft voice called out from behind her. "Anya Szabo, what brings you out here tonight?" Her friend, Rachel, appeared on the dock beside her, a basket slung over her arm.

Anya smiled and handed over the rope. "Just needed some time to clear my head," she said, climbing aboard. The wooden planks creaked beneath her feet as she settled into the worn seat.

Rachel joined her, setting the basket down on the deck. "You've been working non-stop for weeks," she observed. "I'm starting to think you forget what it's like to relax."

Anya shrugged, letting out a deep sigh. She had always been driven, even as a child. Her parents had encouraged her passion for art, but life had taken her in a different direction. Now, at 30, she found herself lost and uncertain about her place in the world.

As they pushed off from the dock and began to glide across the water, Anya felt the tension in her shoulders begin to ease. The stars were starting to twinkle overhead, and the sound of crickets provided a soothing background hum. It was moments like these that reminded her why she had always loved the lake so much.

Rachel reached out and took her hand, giving it a gentle squeeze. "You're not alone, Anya Szabo," she said softly. "We'll figure this out together."

Anya smiled, feeling a sense of gratitude towards her friend. Maybe, just maybe, with Rachel by her side, she could find her way again. As the boat drifted across the lake, Anya let her eyes drink in the beauty of the night sky, feeling a glimmer of hope for the future.
