Anya Eglitis stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him in the corner, sipping on a cup of black coffee, and made her way towards him. The sounds of clinking cups and muted conversations enveloped her as she approached.

As she sat down across from Alexander, Anya Eglitis couldn't help but notice the worn-out notebook resting beside his cup. It was an odd habit of his, one that often caught her off guard. She raised an eyebrow in amusement, remembering how he'd explained it earlier – his love for writing and recording memories.

Anya Eglitis leaned forward, her elbows on the worn wooden table. "So, what's new with you? I feel like it's been ages since we last spoke." Alexander's eyes flickered upwards, a hint of warmth in their depths as he smiled. The lines around his mouth deepened, giving him an air of quiet wisdom.

Their conversation flowed effortlessly, touching on everything from books to music, each topic leading seamlessly into the next. It was as if they'd picked up right where they left off last time, like no time had passed at all. Anya Eglitis found herself lost in his words, the flickering candlelight casting a mystical aura over their conversation.

As the hours slipped by, the café's patrons began to dwindle, leaving only the two of them lost in their own world. It was then that Alexander pulled out his notebook once more, flipping through its pages with an air of nostalgia. Anya Eglitis watched, mesmerized, as he read aloud from a particularly worn entry – one that spoke of memories they'd shared long ago.

The words resonated deeply within her, and for a moment, time seemed to stand still. In that instant, Anya Eglitis knew exactly where she stood with Alexander – in the depths of their connection, where understanding was enough, and words were the only language required. As they sat there, surrounded by the soft hum of evening chatter, she felt at peace, her heart entwined with his, bound together like the threads of a worn tapestry.
