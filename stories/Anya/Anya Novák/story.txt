Anya Novák stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room with a mix of caution and curiosity. As a former CIA operative turned private investigator, she had seen her fair share of shady characters and deceitful deals. But there was something about this particular case that made her gut twist with unease.

A wealthy businessman, known for his ruthless tactics and connections to some of the most powerful people in Washington D.C., had hired her to investigate a mysterious threat against him. The stakes were high: if word got out that his business empire was under attack, it could topple entire governments.

Anya sipped on her coffee, taking a moment to gather her thoughts before making contact with the client. She knew he would try to spin her some elaborate tale of government sabotage or corporate espionage. But she had been around the block a few times – and had seen through such smokescreens time and again.

Just as she was about to make a call, a young woman with striking green eyes slipped into the booth across from her. Anya's instincts kicked in; this girl didn't look like your average café patron. "Mind if I join you?" the girl asked, her voice husky and confident.

"Not at all," Anya replied, sliding over to make room for the newcomer. The girl took a seat, sending a wave of tension through the small space. There was something about her presence that commanded attention – like she was made of fire and smoke.

"Who are you?" Anya asked, trying to keep her voice steady.

"I'm someone who knows what you're really after," the girl replied with a sly smile. "And I'm willing to give you some information... for a price."

Anya raised an eyebrow. She had a feeling she was in over her head. But something about this young woman sparked something within her – a spark of hope that maybe, just maybe, there was more to this case than met the eye.

Without another word, Anya agreed to hear her out. The girl leaned forward, a whispered promise hanging between them like smoke.
