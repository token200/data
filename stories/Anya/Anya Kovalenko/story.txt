Anya Kovalenko stepped into the crowded café, her bright blue eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Sasha, sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee. As she made her way over, Anya couldn't help but notice the way the morning light streaming through the window highlighted the dusting of freckles across Sasha's nose.

The two friends had grown up together in Moscow, exploring the city's hidden corners and sharing secrets beneath the stars. Now, as adults, they found themselves brought together again by circumstance – this time, to plan a surprise party for Sasha's upcoming birthday.

Anya slid into the booth opposite her friend, ordering a cup of coffee as she pulled out a small notebook from her bag. "So, I've got the guest list finalized," she said, handing Sasha the book. "Your aunt and uncle are coming, of course, along with your cousins."

Sasha's eyes widened as she flipped through the pages, scanning the list of names. "Wow, you've got everyone on the list!"

Anya smiled proudly. "I told you I'd get it done. Now, let's talk about the cake – what kind do you want?"

The two friends spent the next hour discussing everything from flavors to decorations, their laughter and chatter filling the café with warmth.

As they finished up, Anya stood up, her long brown hair bobbing as she did so. "I should get going," she said, tucking a small gift into her bag. "My mom is waiting for me – she's got a new project at work and I promised to help out."

Sasha watched as Anya Kovalenko made her way out of the café, feeling grateful for their enduring friendship. She knew that no matter where life took them, they'd always have each other's backs.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the city, Sasha couldn't help but feel excited for the surprise party planned for her friend. It was going to be an unforgettable night – one that would bring their group of friends together in celebration of the birthday girl and the unbreakable bond between them.

With a happy heart, Sasha took a sip of her coffee, feeling grateful for the memories they'd made and the adventures still to come.
