One day, Anya's father, Carlos Salamanca, summoned her to his office for a heart-to-heart conversation. "Anya, I know you're good at chess," he said sternly. "But what about your future? What will you do with that degree in economics?" Anya bristled at the suggestion that she needed permission to pursue her dreams. "I'll decide my own path, Father," she replied firmly. Carlos sighed, but deep down, he knew his daughter was right.

Years went by, and Anya's victories piled up. She became a household name, inspiring countless young players around the world with her incredible talent and unwavering confidence. As for her father, he learned to support his daughter's passions, even if they didn't align with his own desires.
