Anya Dufresne stepped out of the crowded café and into the crisp evening air, her eyes scanning the street for a glimpse of the stranger she had been searching for. As a private investigator, Anya had seen her fair share of cases, but there was something about this one that had piqued her interest.

Rumors had been circulating about a mysterious figure who had been leaving cryptic messages at various locations around town. The messages were always signed with the same initials: A.D. Only one person knew for sure that it was Anya's brother, Lucien, who had started this game of cat and mouse. But why?

Anya's thoughts were interrupted by a tap on her shoulder. She turned to see a young woman, no more than twenty-five years old, with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair.

"Hi," the woman said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I think you're looking for me."

Anya raised an eyebrow. "Who are you?"

"My name is Sophia," the woman replied, producing a small piece of paper from her pocket. On it was written: A.D. – Meet me at the old warehouse at midnight. Come alone.

Anya's heart skipped a beat as she took in the message. This had to be Lucien, but why was he playing it so cool? She tucked the paper into her jacket and nodded at Sophia. "I'll be there."

As Sophia turned to leave, Anya called out after her. "Wait!" The young woman turned back, a hint of curiosity in her eyes.

"I know who you are," Sophia said, a small smile playing on her lips. "You're the one who's been tracking my brother, aren't you?"

Anya nodded, feeling a sense of trepidation. She had never been one for games, but something about Sophia's words resonated with her. Maybe it was time to put an end to this game once and for all.

The two women exchanged numbers, and Anya watched as Sophia disappeared into the night, leaving her with more questions than answers. But she knew one thing for sure: this case just got a whole lot more interesting.
