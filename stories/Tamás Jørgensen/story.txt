Tamás Jørgensen stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the familiar sights of Copenhagen. It had been five years since he'd left this city, chasing dreams that seemed to slip further away with each passing day. Now, as he walked through the crowded streets, he felt a sense of unease wash over him.

Tamás's thoughts turned to the letter he'd received just days before. His father had passed away, leaving behind a small inheritance and a note. "Come home, Tamás," it read. "It's time to confront what you've been running from."

Tamás hadn't known his father for more than a year, but there was something about the old man's words that resonated deep within him. He'd always felt like an outsider in Copenhagen, like he didn't quite fit in. Maybe it was because he was the son of a man he barely remembered.

As he walked through the city, Tamás noticed the way people looked at him. They seemed to see right through his carefully crafted facade, to the turmoil that churned beneath. He'd always been good at hiding behind a mask of confidence and charm, but now it felt like a fragile disguise.

Tamás's first stop was the café where he used to meet his friends. The owner, Mrs. Jensen, looked up from her seat by the window and smiled warmly. "Ah, Tamás! Come give me a hug!"

For a moment, Tamás let himself get lost in the familiar comfort of the café. It was like stepping into a time machine, one that transported him back to a world he'd thought was behind him.

But as he sat down at his usual table and began to order a coffee, Tamás couldn't shake off the feeling that this wasn't just a visit home. His father's letter had left him with more questions than answers. What had his father been running from? And why did it matter now that he was gone?

Tamás's thoughts were interrupted by a voice behind him. "Hey, Tamás! Long time no see!"

He turned to face the person speaking, and for a moment, their eyes locked in a gaze that seemed to hold centuries of history between them.

"Klaus," Tamás said finally, his voice barely above a whisper.

It was only then that he remembered why Klaus had been such an important part of his life. They'd grown up together, sharing secrets and dreams as if they were old friends.
