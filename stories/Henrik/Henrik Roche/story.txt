Henrik Roche stood at the edge of the cliff, gazing out at the sea below. The wind whipped his dark hair into a frenzy as he stared out at the waves crashing against the rocks. He was lost in thought, his mind consumed by the memories that haunted him.

It had been five years since the accident, and yet the pain still lingered. Henrik's best friend, Leif, had died that fateful night, and no amount of grieving seemed to ease the ache. The memory of Leif's laughter still echoed in his ears, and the smell of saltwater on his skin brought tears to Henrik's eyes.

As he stood there, a figure emerged from the fog that rolled off the sea. It was Elara, her piercing green eyes locking onto Henrik's as she approached him. She had been his confidante, his friend, and his love. Their friendship had been forged in the fire of tragedy, and over time, it had blossomed into something more.

Henrik didn't need to ask why Elara was here; he knew she had come to offer her support. And as she wrapped her arms around him, holding him close, Henrik felt a sense of peace wash over him. It wasn't the same as having Leif back by his side, but it was something.

As they stood there, watching the sun set behind the waves, Elara whispered words of comfort in his ear. She told him that he wasn't alone, that she would be with him always. And Henrik felt a weight lift off his shoulders. He knew he still had a long way to go, but with Elara by his side, he felt like he could face whatever came next.

The stars began to twinkle in the night sky as they walked back down from the cliff, hand in hand. Henrik glanced over at Elara, her profile illuminated by the moonlight. He knew that she loved him, not because of what had happened, but because of who he was.

As they reached the shore, Elara turned to him and smiled. "You're still the same Henrik," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "The brightest light in my life."

And with that, Henrik knew he could face whatever tomorrow brought. For the first time in years, he felt like himself again â€“ broken, yes, but whole. With Elara by his side, he knew he would heal, and one day, he would find happiness once more.
