Without another word, she leaned in close, her breath caressing his ear. Henrik's heart skipped a beat as he realized that The Siren was not just any woman – but a puzzle waiting to be solved.

And so, Henrik Christensen found himself entangled in The Siren's web of intrigue, ready to unravel the tangled threads of her past and uncover the secrets she kept hidden behind those mesmerizing green eyes.
