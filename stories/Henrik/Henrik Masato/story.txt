Henrik Masato was a man of few words, but when he spoke, people listened. A Japanese-Swedish engineer, Henrik had spent his entire career pushing the boundaries of innovation and sustainability. His latest project, a revolutionary new material that could convert sunlight into usable energy, had garnered international attention.

As Henrik stood on stage at the annual Sustainable Energy Conference, he adjusted his glasses and began to speak. "Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce you to EnerGenesis," he said, gesturing to a sleek, silver prototype behind him.
