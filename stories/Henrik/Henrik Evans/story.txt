Henrik Evans sat alone at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of papers in front of him. As a renowned journalist, he had written countless stories on the most pressing issues of our time, but this one was different. This one was personal.

It had been three years since Henrik's younger brother, Alex, had gone missing during a solo expedition to the Arctic Circle. The police investigation had yielded nothing, and the family had been left with only speculation and unanswered questions. Henrik had spent countless hours researching, following every lead, no matter how small, in hopes of finding some semblance of closure.

As he poured over his notes, an idea began to form in his mind. He remembered a conversation he had with one of Alex's former friends, who mentioned a cryptic message that Alex had sent before disappearing. The message was simple: "Look for the Ice Worms."

Henrik's eyes narrowed as he sat up straight, his mind racing with possibilities. What did it mean? Was it just a metaphor or something more concrete? He quickly grabbed his phone and dialed the number of his trusted source.

The voice on the other end was hesitant at first, but as Henrik explained the idea that had formed in his mind, the source's tone became more urgent. "I think I know what Alex meant," they said. "He was referring to an ancient Inuit legend about a hidden cave system beneath the ice. It's said to be cursed."

Henrik felt a shiver run down his spine as he scribbled notes furiously. He had always been skeptical of urban legends, but there was something about this that felt different. Something that spoke to the very heart of what had driven him to pursue this story in the first place.

With newfound determination, Henrik hung up the phone and stood up from his chair. It was time to embark on a journey into the unknown. He packed his bags, grabbed his camera and notebook, and set off towards the Arctic Circle, determined to uncover the truth about Alex's disappearance once and for all. The Ice Worms were waiting, and Henrik Evans was ready to face them head-on.
