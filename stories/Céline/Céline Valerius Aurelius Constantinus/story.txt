The young patrician smiled in response, exchanging pleasantries before launching into her order. The vendor, familiar with her tastes, nodded knowingly and began to prepare the requested delicacies.

With her purchases in hand, Céline made her way back to her family's villa on the outskirts of the city.

Being the cleverest and most capable daughter in her family was not an easy feat, but she had risen to the challenge. Tomorrow would bring new opportunities, and Céline Valerius Aurelius Constantinus was ready to seize them. With a smile on her face and a spring in her step, she slept soundly, her dreams filled with visions of grandeur and possibility.
