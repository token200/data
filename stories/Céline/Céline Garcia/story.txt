Céline Garcia stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the crowded station. She had been away for five years, and everything about this place felt different. The once-quaint town of Mont-Saint-Michel was now a popular tourist destination, filled with fanny packs and selfie sticks.

As she made her way through the throngs of people, Céline's mind wandered back to the life she had left behind. She had been a painter in Paris, her art studio nestled between a patisserie and a vintage clothing store on the Rue des Batignolles. But after a painful breakup and a bout of creative stagnation, she had packed up her easel and moved back to her hometown.

Her family and friends had all tried to encourage her to stay in Paris, but Céline couldn't shake the feeling that she was meant to return to Mont-Saint-Michel. The ocean air, the sound of the tides crashing against the abbey walls, it all called to her. And besides, she had a small art studio now, tucked away on the outskirts of town.

As she walked through the streets, Céline felt a sense of disconnection. Everyone knew everyone here, and the rhythm of life was slow and unhurried. She longed for the energy of Paris, the feeling of being part of something bigger than herself.

But as she turned onto Rue Jacques de Chambrier, Céline's heart skipped a beat. The old family bakery, La Belle Épaisse, had just reopened its doors, and the scent of freshly baked baguettes wafted out into the street. Her mother had passed away a year ago, but Céline still remembered the countless afternoons she spent helping her inside.

She pushed open the door and was enveloped in a warm hug by the baker, Madame Dupont. "Céline, chère!" she exclaimed, as if no time had passed at all. For a moment, Céline forgot about Paris and her doubts. She forgot about everything except the sense of home that filled this small bakery.

As she bit into a still-warm baguette, Céline felt a spark of creativity ignite within her. Maybe this was where she belonged – in Mont-Saint-Michel, surrounded by the people and places she loved. And maybe, just maybe, her art would flourish here too.
