Céline Straume stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. She had been traveling for hours, and the solitude was starting to get to her. As she collected her luggage, a gentle breeze carried the scent of saltwater and seaweed through the air, transporting her to the coastal town where she had spent summers as a child.

Céline Straume had returned to this small village in Norway after years away, seeking refuge from the chaos of city life. She had inherited a small cottage from a great aunt she had never met, but it was here that Céline Straume felt a sense of belonging. The village was quiet and unassuming, its residents knowing her name and greeting her with warm smiles whenever she passed by.

As she made her way through the narrow streets, Céline Straume noticed the small shop she had always loved. It was run by an elderly woman named Solveig, who sold handmade crafts and told stories of the town's history over steaming cups of coffee. Céline Straume pushed open the door and was enveloped in a warm, comforting atmosphere.

Solveig looked up from behind the counter and smiled, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "Ah, Céline Straume! Welcome back to our little corner of the world." She handed her a small package wrapped in brown paper and twine. "I made this for you – some new seaweed soap and a few skeins of wool for your knitting."

Céline Straume's eyes welled up with tears as she took the gift, feeling a deep sense of gratitude towards Solveig and the village that had become her home. She spent the rest of the day exploring the coast, watching seagulls soar overhead and feeling the rough sand beneath her feet.

As the sun began to set, Céline Straume made her way back to her cottage, the scent of saltwater and seaweed still lingering in her nostrils. She knew that she had come home to a place where time moved slowly, and life was precious. And as she settled into her favorite chair by the window, watching the stars begin to twinkle in the night sky, Céline Straume felt a deep sense of peace wash over her – peace that came from being exactly where she belonged, surrounded by people who loved her for who she was.
