Céline Walker stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the quaint station. She had been to this place before, but it still held a sense of familiarity, like an old friend waiting to greet her. The smell of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the sound of distant laughter.

Céline's thoughts were elsewhere, however. Her mind was preoccupied with the past, with memories she had tried to bury for years. She had come back to this town to escape the ghosts that haunted her, to find solace in the familiar rhythms of everyday life.

As she made her way through the station, Céline's gaze drifted over the faces of the people around her. Some were tourists, eager to explore the local landmarks and sample the regional cuisine. Others were locals, going about their daily routines with a quiet efficiency that Céline admired.

She walked for several blocks, taking in the sights and sounds of the town. The buildings seemed to lean in, as if sharing a secret, and the streets were lined with ancient trees whose branches tangled together like a network of whispers.

Eventually, Céline found herself standing outside her childhood home. It was a small, two-story house with a patchwork roof and a garden full of wildflowers that spilled out onto the sidewalk. She hadn't set foot in this place since she left for college, and yet the moment she stepped up to the door, it felt like no time had passed at all.

The memories came flooding back, as they often did when Céline returned to this town. Memories of her mother's cooking, of afternoons spent exploring the woods behind their house, of lazy summer nights spent watching the stars twinkle overhead. It was a childhood that seemed almost idyllic now, like a dream she had long since lost.

Céline took a deep breath and let herself sink into the memories. For a few moments, she forgot about the world beyond this small town, forgot about her complicated relationships with her parents and her struggles to find her place in the world.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the streets, Céline felt a sense of peace settle over her. It was a fragile thing, one that might not last long, but it was enough for now.
