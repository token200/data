Céline Stenström stepped out of her small flat and into the crisp Stockholm air, taking a deep breath as she gazed up at the skeletal trees. It was early February, and winter still clung to the city like a damp shroud. She slipped on her scarf and began the walk to her favorite café, the one where she spent most of her days lost in thought.

Céline was a writer, or at least she tried to be. Her words had never quite coalesced into something publishable, but that didn't deter her. She spent hours scribbling in her notebook, fueled by coffee and melancholy. Her latest piece, a melancholic exploration of love lost, sat unfinished on the kitchen table.

As she pushed open the door to her café, a warm light enveloped her, and the familiar scent of stale coffee and worn wood filled her nostrils. She spotted Lars, the owner, wiping down the counter with a towel. He smiled as he saw her, and Céline returned the gesture with a gentle warmth.

Over a cup of lukewarm coffee, Céline pulled out her notebook and began to read aloud from the latest piece. The words poured out of her like tears, and Lars listened attentively, his eyes crinkled at the corners as he nodded along. When she finished, he offered her a sympathetic ear and some words of encouragement.

Outside, the sun struggled to penetrate the grey sky, casting a faint glow over the square. People walked quickly past, their footsteps muffled by their coats and boots. Céline stood frozen for a moment, watching them disappear into the distance. She felt like she was living in their shadows, hiding from the world.

Lars broke the silence, his voice gentle as he said, "You're not alone, Céline. Your words may not be enough, but they are yours." He handed her another cup of coffee and a pat on the back. Céline smiled through her tears, feeling a glimmer of hope she hadn't felt in weeks.

The sun dipped lower, casting an eerie light over the square. Céline tucked her notebook into her bag and stood up, ready to face whatever lay ahead. Maybe it was time to find her lost words again, and try to make sense of this melancholy world outside.
