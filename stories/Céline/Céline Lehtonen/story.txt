Celine was not an individual that people knew. She lived in her little apartment, always wearing black clothes. No one could guess what she looked like. The only thing they knew about her is how she can make a great cup of coffee.

It had been five years since she had lost her husband to cancer. He had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and passed away when Celine was 30 years old. Celine's husband was her best friend, his name was Alexander. 

Celine still remembers the day that Alexander got his diagnosis. She took him to the doctor and they both knew it was going to be bad news. The doctor told them that he had just a few weeks left to live.

In these five years, Celine has changed her life completely. She quit her job, moved into a new apartment in Paris, started cooking classes, baking bread, brewing coffee. Alexander always loved black coffee, and she would make it for him every morning.

But one day, Alexander told Celine that he was going to leave this world before the end of the month. Celine was devastated but also knew what to do. She packed a bag, went to Alexander's house in the countryside and took care of all his chores. It was then that she realized her life was not going anywhere.

That morning she had decided not to drink coffee at all until after her husband passed away. Now she takes it with pleasure - every single day of her life.

Celine has always been very quiet, now when people talk to her they find out about Alexander's coffee and how good his black coffee is.
