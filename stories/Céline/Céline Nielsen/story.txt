Céline Nielsen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of saltwater and creosote oil filling her lungs. She had been away for years, chasing dreams in Paris and New York, but now she was back in her hometown of Reykjavik, Iceland.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Céline felt a sense of nostalgia wash over her. The houses seemed smaller than she remembered, and the gardens more subdued, but the sound of the ocean still thrummed beneath everything, a constant heartbeat that reminded her of home.

She had always loved this place, with its rugged beauty and fierce storms, but after years of city life, Céline wasn't sure if it would still feel like home. She thought about the friends she had left behind – Ásgeir, the folk singer who had taught her how to play the fiddle; Sóley, the poet who had made her laugh until her sides ached.

As she walked towards the old wooden house on Vatnsnesí, Céline felt a strange sense of trepidation. What would she find here? Would anyone still be waiting for her? She pushed open the door and was enveloped in a warm light that seemed to spill from within, like a golden glow.

Her mother, Hjördis, was sitting on the couch, knitting a soft blue blanket. Her eyes lit up when Céline walked in – the same bright blue spark that had always been there, even when Céline thought she'd lost it.

"Céline!" she exclaimed, dropping her knitting to hug her tight. "Welcome home!"

Céline felt a lump form in her throat as she hugged her mother back. She knew she still had a lot of catching up to do – with everyone and everything. But for now, she was just happy to be here, surrounded by the familiar rhythms of home.

As they sat down to dinner together – a simple meal of fish and potatoes – Céline felt a sense of peace settle over her. She knew it wouldn't be easy, but she was ready to face whatever came next. After all, this was where she belonged. And as she looked out the window at the darkening sea, Céline knew that no matter what lay ahead, she would always have home to come back to.
