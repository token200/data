Céline Krūmiņš stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station with a mix of excitement and trepidation. She had been waiting for this moment for what felt like an eternity - her chance to leave her past behind and start anew in this quaint little town nestled in the rolling hills of rural Latvia.

As she made her way through the bustling streets, Céline's mind wandered back to her life in Paris. She thought about her friends, her job, and the life she had built for herself. But it was all starting to feel suffocating, like a weight that was slowly crushing her. She longed for freedom, for adventure, and for a sense of purpose.

Céline's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her phone buzzing in her pocket. She pulled it out to see a text from an unknown number - "Meet me at the old oak tree at midnight. Come alone." Her heart skipped a beat as she wondered who could be sending her such a cryptic message, and what they wanted with her.

Despite her reservations, Céline felt drawn to the mystery of it all. She had always been someone who thrived on intrigue, on uncovering secrets and solving puzzles. And so, at midnight, she found herself standing beneath the ancient oak tree, her eyes scanning the darkness for any sign of movement.

As the minutes ticked by, a figure emerged from the shadows - a woman with piercing green eyes and long, curly brown hair. "I've been waiting for you, Céline Krūmiņš," she said, her voice low and husky. "My name is Līga, and I have a proposition for you. One that could change your life forever."
