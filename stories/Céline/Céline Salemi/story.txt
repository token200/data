Céline Salemi stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the crowded station. As a freelance photographer, she had grown accustomed to the thrill of the unknown, but there was something about this small town in rural France that made her feel like she'd been here before.

As she made her way through the throng of people, Céline Salemi's gaze landed on a familiar face - her friend and fellow artist, Léon. He flashed her a bright smile as she approached, his dark hair mussed and his eyes crinkled at the corners from laughing too much.

"Bonjour, Céline!" he exclaimed, opening his arms for a warm hug. "I've been expecting you."

Céline Salemi chuckled and squeezed him back. She had known Léon since art school, when they'd bonded over their shared love of avant-garde photography. Now, years later, they'd parted ways but remained close friends.

As they walked through the town's winding streets, Céline Salemi couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder at the way the light fell on the ancient stone buildings. She pulled out her camera and began snapping shots, capturing the intricate patterns of the stonework and the vibrant colors of the market stalls.

Léon wandered alongside her, his eyes fixed on the faces of the people they passed. "You know, Céline Salemi," he said suddenly, "I've been thinking about our project - the one where we document the lives of these forgotten towns?"

Céline Salemi's heart skipped a beat as she turned to him with interest. She had always loved the idea of capturing the beauty in overlooked places, and this project was right up her alley.

As they sat down at a small café to discuss their plans, Céline Salemi felt a sense of excitement building inside her. With Léon by her side, she knew that this project was going to be something special - something that would capture the essence of these forgotten towns and leave a lasting impression on the world.

Over coffee and croissants, they pored over maps and research papers, planning their itinerary for the next few weeks. Céline Salemi's eyes sparkled with enthusiasm as she envisioned the images they would create, the stories they would tell - all of it coming together to form a powerful testament to the beauty of these hidden corners of France.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the town, Céline Salemi leaned back in her chair and smiled at Léon. "This is going to be incredible," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Léon grinned back, his eyes shining with agreement. "I couldn't agree more, Céline Salemi."
