Céline KissMartín Eglīte was a free-spirited artist known for her vibrant paintings and infectious smile. Her full name, which she rarely introduced to people, was often met with confusion, but those who knew her understood the unique charm that came with it.

Growing up in a small town surrounded by rolling hills and verdant forests, Céline's love affair with art began at a young age.
