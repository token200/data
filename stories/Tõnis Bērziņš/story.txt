Tõnis Bērziņš sat alone at his desk, staring blankly at the empty pages in front of him. He was a man of few words, and even fewer friends. His life had been one of quiet desperation since he left Estonia to escape the Soviet Union's suffocating grip.

As a young man, Tõnis had been a proud patriot, eager to serve his country in the war against the Reds. But as the years went by and the occupation became more and more oppressive, he found himself at odds with the government that had once seemed so just.

Now, in exile, Tõnis worked as an interpreter for Western agencies, using his skills to help the United States understand the intricacies of Soviet politics. It was a thankless job, but one that brought him a small measure of comfort and connection to the world outside.

But tonight was different. Tonight, he had received a visit from someone who claimed to be a contact from the resistance movement in Estonia. The letter, smuggled through the icy Baltic air, had hinted at a possible plan to overthrow the Soviet government once and for all.

Tõnis poured himself a cup of black coffee, his hands shaking slightly as he read the words again and again. Could it be true? Was there really a way to bring about change from within?

He thought back to the memories of his childhood, spent playing in the forests and fields around his village. He had always dreamed of being more than just a simple Estonian farmer; now, that dream seemed within reach.

But as he sat there, lost in thought, Tõnis knew that one misstep could mean capture and imprisonment – or worse. The risk was too great to take lightly.

Just then, the door to his small office burst open and a young woman strode in, her piercing green eyes fixed intently on him. "Tõnis," she said softly, using the name he rarely heard outside of this place. "I have come from Estonia."

His heart skipped a beat as he rose to his feet, his hand reaching for the pen that lay motionless on the desk. The woman was small and wiry, her dark hair pulled back into a tight bun. She wore a fur-lined coat, its folds revealing a flash of silk under the threadbare fabric.

"What news?" Tõnis asked quietly, his voice betraying none of his excitement.

The woman's eyes never left his face as she began to speak. "We have reason to believe that there are those within the Soviet government who share your vision – that of a free Estonia."

For an instant, Tõnis felt like he was floating on air, his doubts and fears forgotten in the thrill of possibility.
