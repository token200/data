Adriana Liepina was a young and ambitious artist, known for her bold and vibrant paintings that captured the essence of the city she loved. Growing up in a small studio apartment above her family's bakery in downtown Brooklyn, Adriana had always been surrounded by the sights and sounds of creativity.
