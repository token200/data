Adriana Visconti stepped out of her chambers, her silk gown rustling softly as she moved. It was a chilly morning in Milan, and the sun had barely begun to rise over the city. She took a deep breath, feeling the cool air fill her lungs, and began her daily routine.

As a member of the powerful Visconti family, Adriana's days were filled with politics and intrigue. Her father, Giangaleazzo, was the Duke of Milan, and she had learned early on to navigate the complex web of alliances and rivalries that defined their world.

But Adriana's heart belonged to art. She spent her free moments sketching in the castle gardens, capturing the beauty of the Italian landscape on paper. Her talent was undeniable, and she had already begun to make a name for herself among the artists of Milan.

As she made her way through the castle corridors, Adriana encountered her brother, Filippo. He was a skilled diplomat, and their father relied heavily on his counsel when dealing with foreign leaders. The brothers exchanged a brief nod, and Adriana continued on her way.

Her first appointment of the day was with the Duke himself. He sat behind a large wooden desk, his eyes fixed intently on Adriana as she curtsied before him. "So, my dear," he said, "I hear you've been working on some new pieces. Tell me, what inspires you?"

Adriana launched into a passionate discussion of her art, explaining the themes and emotions that drove her creativity. Her father listened attentively, his expression thoughtful.

When she finished speaking, the Duke nodded. "I think it's time we showcased your work at court," he said. "We'll have a grand exhibition in honor of your talent. But first, I need you to do something for me."

Adriana's heart skipped a beat as her father handed her a small package. Inside, she found a beautiful golden rose â€“ a symbol of the Visconti family crest. She knew that this was no ordinary gift, and her curiosity was piqued.

"Who is it from?" Adriana asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Her father smiled enigmatically. "That's for you to discover," he said.
