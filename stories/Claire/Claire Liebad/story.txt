Claire Liebad stood at the edge of the rooftop, her eyes fixed on the glittering city below. The wind whipped through her dark hair as she inhaled the smoky air, her gaze drifting over the endless skyscrapers. She felt small and insignificant, yet at the same time, she felt alive.

As a former hacker, Claire had spent years living in the shadows, her digital footprint hidden from prying eyes. But after a particularly close call with the authorities, she'd decided to hang up her keyboard and take on a new identity – that of a freelance journalist.

Her latest assignment had brought her to this rooftop, where she was sipping on a lukewarm coffee and scribbling notes into a battered notebook. The article was about a small startup company making waves in the tech world, and Claire aimed to dig deeper than anyone else would dare.

As she typed away on her laptop, the sound of footsteps echoed across the rooftop. She looked up to see a tall, lanky figure approaching her – his eyes locked onto hers with an unnerving intensity.

"You're Claire Liebad," he said, his voice dripping with familiarity. "I've been looking for you."

Claire's instincts kicked in, and she swiftly closed her laptop and stood up. The stranger's gaze roved over her face before landing on the tattoo of a snake coiled around her right wrist – a symbol that only a handful of people knew about.

"You're...long time no see," Claire said coolly, her voice laced with wariness.

The stranger smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "Let's just say we've both moved on. But I think it's time you remembered why you ever stopped being Claire."

For a moment, the air hung thick with tension as the two women sized each other up. Then, without warning, the stranger vanished into thin air – leaving behind only a note scrawled in red ink: "Meet me at Club Europa tonight. Come alone."

Claire's heart skipped a beat as she read the message over and over again. Who was this enigmatic figure? And what did they want from her now? As the sun dipped below the city horizon, Claire knew that this was just the beginning of a new chapter in her life – one where she'd have to navigate the blurred lines between truth and deception.
