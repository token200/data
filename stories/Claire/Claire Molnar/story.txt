Claire Molnar had always been fascinated by the abandoned amusement park on the outskirts of town. As a child, she would often sneak out of her house to explore its crumbling rollercoaster and rusted ticket booths. Now, as an adult, Claire's love for the forgotten park only grew stronger.

One day, while wandering through the overgrown gardens, Claire stumbled upon an old diary belonging to the park's former owner, a man named Henry. As she flipped through the yellowed pages, she discovered that Henry had once been in love with Claire's ancestor, a woman who had designed many of the park's iconic attractions.

Intrigued by this revelation, Claire Molnar began to dig deeper into her family history. She spent countless hours researching and interviewing local historians, finally uncovering a treasure trove of stories about her ancestors' involvement with the amusement park.
