Claire Fernandez sat alone in her dimly lit apartment, staring blankly at the walls as tears streamed down her face. It had been three months since she'd last spoken to her estranged father, and the pain still lingered like an open wound.

As a child, Claire had always felt like she was walking on eggshells around her father's temperamental nature. Her parents had divorced when she was young, and her father had taken primary custody of her. She remembered the countless nights spent crying herself to sleep, waiting for the storm to pass.

But as she grew older, Claire began to realize that her father's outbursts were not just about her â€“ they were about his own demons. He struggled with addiction and mental health issues, and Claire had always felt like a tiny, fragile vessel holding together the fragments of his shattered psyche.

Despite this, Claire loved her father in her own way. She wanted to help him find his footing again, to show him that there was more to life than just pain and anger. But every time she tried to reach out to him, he pushed her away.

Tonight was no different. Claire had written a letter to her father, pouring out all her emotions onto the page. She'd told him about the pain of being alone, about the feeling of being invisible in his life. And yet, as she looked around her apartment, she knew that he wouldn't read it. He never did.

As the tears began to dry on her cheeks, Claire got up and walked over to her old guitar. She'd learned to play when she was a teenager, and music had always been her solace. She strummed the strings, letting out a mournful melody that seemed to match the rhythm of her heart. In this moment, she felt like she was finally saying goodbye to the past, goodbye to the pain and the heartache. And as she played on, Claire knew that she would always carry her father's love with her, even if he couldn't see it.
