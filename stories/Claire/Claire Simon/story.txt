Claire Simon had always been fascinated by the abandoned asylum on the outskirts of town. As a child, she would often sneak peeks through the rusty gates, imagining the countless stories that must have unfolded within its crumbling walls. Now, as a renowned historian and paranormal investigator, Claire felt an inexplicable pull to explore the asylum's depths.

On this particular evening, Claire stood before the entrance, her flashlight casting eerie shadows on the facade. She had assembled a team of experts: Dr. Patel, a local expert on mental health; Matt, a tech-savvy sound engineer; and Rachel, a talented EMF researcher. Together, they aimed to uncover the truth behind the asylum's mysterious past.

As they ventured deeper into the decaying building, Claire couldn't shake off the feeling that she was being watched. Dr. Patel hypothesized that the isolation had driven former patients to madness, while Matt picked up strange whispers on his equipment. Rachel, meanwhile, detected unusual electromagnetic fluctuations in the air.

The team stumbled upon a hidden room, sealed behind a door adorned with cryptic symbols. Claire felt an electric thrill as she pushed aside the tattered curtains and revealed the long-abandoned hospital records. The papers spoke of a dark experiment conducted by the asylum's former director, who had attempted to harness the power of human psyches.

According to Dr. Patel, this experiment could have been the catalyst for the asylum's downfall – a catastrophic failure that led to the collapse of its very fabric. Claire sensed an otherworldly energy emanating from the room, as if the whispers and EMF readings were not mere natural phenomena but a manifestation of some collective consciousness.

As they explored further, Rachel stumbled upon a hidden logbook belonging to the director himself. The entries hinted at a descent into madness, with cryptic references to "The Patient" – an entity rumored to reside within the asylum's walls. Matt captured strange, almost-human responses on his audio recorder.

Suddenly, the atmosphere shifted, and Claire felt an icy presence settle upon her shoulders. She turned to her team, who exchanged nervous glances. Dr. Patel whispered that they were too close to awakening something they didn't understand.

"We should leave," she urged, but Rachel hesitated, as if bound by a magnetic force. The lights flickered, and Claire sensed The Patient stirring – an unseen force with the power to disrupt their reality.

In an instant of unspoken understanding, Claire knew that some mysteries were better left unsolved. She led her team toward the exit, leaving behind the secrets and whispers within the abandoned asylum's walls. As they vanished into the night, the air seemed to whisper a single, haunting phrase: "You should have stayed."
