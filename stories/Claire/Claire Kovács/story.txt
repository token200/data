Claire Kov√°cs sat alone in her small apartment, staring blankly at the walls as she tried to process the events of the past few days. The investigation into her sister's disappearance had been ongoing for weeks, but every lead seemed to end in a dead-end.

As she wandered over to the window, Claire couldn't help but think about how much her life had changed since her sister's vanishing. She used to be the responsible one, the one who kept everything together. But now, with her sister gone and their family torn apart, Claire felt lost and adrift.

Just as she was starting to feel overwhelmed, there was a knock at the door. It was Detective James, come to discuss the latest developments in the case. Claire let him in, her heart heavy with anxiety.

"So, Claire," he said, his expression sympathetic, "we've got some new information. We think your sister may have been in contact with someone before she disappeared."

Claire's eyes widened as the detective handed her a small piece of paper with a name on it. It was Viktor, an old acquaintance from her sister's past.

"What does this mean?" Claire asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

"It means we think Viktor may have had something to do with your sister's disappearance," Detective James replied. "We're going to bring him in for questioning."

Claire felt a surge of anger and determination as she listened to the detective's words. She knew that she would stop at nothing to find her sister, no matter what it took.

"I want to come with you when Viktor is brought in," Claire said, standing up straighter.

Detective James nodded, his expression grim. "I'll arrange for that. Just be careful, Claire. This case may get a lot more complicated than we think."

As the detective left, Claire felt a sense of resolve wash over her. She was going to find out what had happened to her sister, no matter what it took. And she was going to make sure that Viktor paid for his role in her disappearance.
