Claire Krūmiņš stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. She had been traveling through Eastern Europe for weeks, trying to escape the memories that haunted her. As a renowned journalist, Claire had covered many stories, but this one was different. This one was personal.

She hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of her old apartment building. The familiar streets and buildings seemed to blur together as she sat in silence, lost in thought. Claire Krūmiņš's mind kept wandering back to the night that changed everything - the night she lost her sister.

The taxi pulled up outside the building, and Claire paid the driver before stepping out onto the sidewalk. She took a deep breath and pushed open the creaky door, revealing a hallway that seemed frozen in time. The air inside was thick with dust and memories.

As she made her way to her apartment, Claire's thoughts turned to her latest assignment - a story about a local artist who had gone missing. She had been investigating for weeks, but every lead seemed to end in a dead-end. Claire Krūmiņš's instincts told her that there was more to the story than met the eye.

She opened the door to her apartment and stepped inside, dropping her bag onto the floor. The room was exactly as she had left it - except for one thing. On the kitchen table, a small note waited for her. It read: "Meet me at the old warehouse at midnight. Come alone."

Claire's heart skipped a beat as she read the words. This could be the break she needed to crack the case. But who was behind the message? And what did they want from her?

With a sense of trepidation, Claire Krūmiņš began to make plans for the night ahead. She would go to the warehouse, alone and unafraid. Because when it came to stories, she always followed her nose - no matter where it led.
