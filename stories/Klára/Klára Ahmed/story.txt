Klára Ahmed stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room with a mixture of familiarity and discomfort. As a journalist, she was no stranger to the city's underbelly, but it still unsettled her to see so many familiar faces mixed with the downtrodden and marginalized.

She spotted her source, a young woman known only as "Lena," sitting in the corner, nursing a cup of black coffee. Klára made her way over, weaving past the chatter and clinking cups.

"Lena, thank you for meeting me," Klára said, sliding into the seat across from her.

Lena looked up, her eyes red-rimmed from crying. "I didn't have a choice, Klára. I have to tell someone."

Klára nodded sympathetically. She had been investigating a string of disappearances in the city's immigrant community, and Lena's story was just the latest tip.

"What happened?" Klára asked, pulling out her notebook and pen.

Lena took a deep breath before speaking. "I used to work at a factory on the outskirts of town. It was a tough job, but it paid the bills. But then...then they started asking me questions about my family's country of origin. Who we were, where we came from, that kind of thing."

Klára's eyes narrowed. "What did you tell them?"

Lena hesitated before speaking. "I told the truth. I said we were from Egypt, just like my parents said. But then...then they started making threats against me and my family. They said if I didn't stop talking about our country, they would make sure no one ever spoke of it again."

Klára's pen moved quickly across her notebook as Lena continued to speak. She had heard stories of such treatment before, but it never got any easier to hear.

As Lena finished speaking, the café door swung open and a group of men in suits walked in. Klára's instincts told her they were connected to the factory where Lena worked.

"Sorry, Lena," Klára said, packing up her notebook. "I think our conversation is over for now."

Lena nodded, her eyes filling with tears again. Klára felt a pang of guilt, knowing she had put another life in danger by telling this story. But she also knew it was one that needed to be told.

As she left the café, Klára made a silent vow to herself: she would keep digging, no matter what it took, until justice was served and those responsible were held accountable.
