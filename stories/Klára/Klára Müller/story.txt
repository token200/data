Klára Müller trudged through the slushy streets, her eyes scanning the crowded café for a familiar face. She had just left the university and was starting to feel restless, unsure of what lay ahead. Her friends had all started their careers, moved in with partners, or traveled the world – Klára felt stuck.

As she pushed open the door to Café Europa, a bell above it jingled out a warm welcome. The cozy atmosphere enveloped her like a hug, and she spotted Anna sitting at the bar, sipping a cup of coffee. Anna was the only person who didn't judge Klára's aimless existence – the only one who listened when she ranted about her own uncertainty.

"Hey, Anna!" Klára called out, slipping onto the stool beside her friend. "What's new with you?"

Anna raised an eyebrow, smiling knowingly. "Just trying to find my place in the world, too." She chuckled. "I think I've finally found a coffee shop that understands me."

Klára laughed and ordered a hot chocolate from the barista, a friendly woman named Eva who always had a sympathetic ear. As they sipped their drinks, Anna asked Klára about her summer plans – or lack thereof.

Klára sighed, rubbing her temples in mock frustration. "I was supposed to be volunteering at that environmental organization, but I just couldn't muster up the energy. And then my parents were on my case about getting a 'real job'... you know how it is."

Anna nodded empathetically, and Klára realized she wasn't alone in her struggles. Her friends weren't as supportive, or as patient, as Anna was. Klára's thoughts drifted to the letters her mom had written – "You need direction, Klára! Get a plan!"

But for now, that direction seemed to involve getting lost in books and daydreaming about far-off places. Klára looked around Café Europa, where students were typing away on their laptops or chatting with friends. She longed to be part of that scene, but her uncertainty made it hard to take the first step.

Just as she was starting to feel more at peace, a shy voice interrupted from behind the counter. "Excuse me... do you guys need help? I'm just trying to figure out what I want to study..."

Klára exchanged a glance with Anna, who nodded encouragingly. The shy girl looked like her – uncertain and searching for guidance. Klára smiled back at Anna, feeling an unexpected surge of solidarity.

"I think we've all been there," she said softly.
