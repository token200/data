Klára Rothbauer stepped into the small café, her eyes scanning the dimly lit room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting alone by the window, his back to her as he sipped on a cup of black coffee. Klára had known him since childhood, and despite their complicated past, she still felt drawn to him.

As she waited in line to order, she couldn't help but think about how far they'd come. From their tumultuous teenage years to the present day, where he was now one of the most respected artists in Vienna. Klára's eyes lingered on the sketches scattered across his lap, each one a testament to his incredible talent.

She ordered her usual coffee and took a seat at the bar, watching as he finished his coffee and gathered his things. He didn't notice her at first, but as soon as their eyes met, he froze. Klára felt a flutter in her chest, a sensation she hadn't experienced in years.

Without a word, he stood up and made his way over to her. They exchanged a brief, awkward smile before he asked how her day was. Klára hesitated for a moment before answering that it was fine, just busy with work. He nodded sympathetically and began to walk her home, their conversation stilted but pleasant.

As they walked, the city lights twinkling around them, Klára found herself opening up to him in ways she hadn't thought possible. She talked about her job as a librarian, her love of literature, and even shared some stories from her own childhood. He listened intently, his eyes lighting up with interest whenever she spoke.

They reached her apartment building without speaking another word, the silence between them feeling more comfortable than she'd anticipated. Klára hesitated at the entrance, unsure if she wanted to say goodbye just yet. But as he turned to leave, their shoulders brushed together, sending a spark of electricity through both of them.

"Klára Rothbauer," he said softly, his voice barely audible over the sound of her own heartbeat. "I've missed you."

In that moment, Klára knew she'd made a mistake by leaving him all those years ago. She smiled, feeling a sense of closure wash over her, and nodded for him to come back inside. The door creaked shut behind him, enveloping them in the safety of their own private world once more.
