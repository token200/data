She knew that this was more than just a tribute to her art – it was a testament to the love and dedication she had poured into every stroke, every curve, and every delicate flourish.

For Klára Jian, there was no greater joy than creating something beautiful with one's own hands, imbuing the world with a fragment of beauty that would outlast her.
