Mia Virtanen stepped out of the rain and into the warm, cozy bar, shaking her long blonde hair as she smiled at the bartender. It was moments like these that she loved – just a quiet night in with a good book and a drink to take the edge off.

As she took a seat on one of the stools, a familiar figure caught her eye across the room. Kai Ranta, her best friend and former lover, sat alone at the bar, nursing a whiskey on the rocks. They hadn't spoken since their messy breakup six months ago, but Mia couldn't help feeling a twinge of curiosity as she watched him gaze lost in thought.

As she ordered her drink and settled in to wait, Kai's eyes finally met hers. For a moment, they just stared at each other – old habits died hard, it seemed. Then, without a word, he stood up and walked over to her side of the bar.

"Mind if I join you?" he asked gruffly, sliding onto the stool beside her.

"Not at all," Mia replied, raising an eyebrow as Kai ordered himself another drink. They chatted for a bit – light, small talk that didn't get too deep or painful – until finally, they landed on the topic of their shared love of old movies.

"I'm so over superhero blockbusters," Kai said, tossing back his drink and leaning in. "Give me a good rom-com any day."

Mia chuckled and nodded vigorously. "Preach, my friend. Give me a good rom-com anytime."

As they talked, the ice between them started to thaw – not dramatically, perhaps, but enough to make Mia feel like maybe, just maybe, she could let her guard down around Kai again.

They laughed and joked, reminiscing about old times and sharing stories of their respective lives. For once, it felt like nothing had changed between them – the spark was still there, waiting to be fanned into a flame.

As the night wore on, Mia realized that maybe she'd been too hasty in her judgment about Kai's intentions all those months ago. Maybe, just maybe, he wasn't as bad as she thought.

"I'm sorry," Kai said quietly, his eyes locking onto hers across the bar. "I was a jerk. I know I hurt you."

Mia took a deep breath and reached out, her hand brushing against Kai's as they locked gazes once more. "We all make mistakes," she whispered back, her voice barely audible over the hum of the bar.

As the rain outside poured down, Mia felt the room grow quieter – as if time itself was waiting to see what would happen next between these two old flames.
