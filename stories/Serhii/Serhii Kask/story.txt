Serhii Kask was a man on a mission. A former soldier turned detective, he had seen his fair share of battles and bloodshed in Ukraine's tumultuous past. But nothing could have prepared him for the mystery that was about to unfold.

It started with a cryptic message from an anonymous source, hinting at a long-buried secret involving one of Serhii Kask's most respected colleagues. The note read: "Look again at the case of Ivanov's death."

One night, as he pored over the evidence in his cramped office, Serhii Kask finally pieced together the puzzle. The killer had been someone close to Ivanov himself â€“ his own brother. The motive? Greed and betrayal.

Serhii Kask's eyes widened as the pieces clicked into place. He knew that this revelation would shake the foundations of Ukrainian society. And he, Serhii Kask, was ready to take on the challenge.
