One stormy night, Serhii Jarvinen received a call from the police department, requesting his expertise in solving a high-profile murder case. The victim was none other than the wealthy businessman, Antoni Välimaa. As Serhii Jarvinen arrived at the scene of the crime, he noticed that the rain seemed to be washing away any potential clues.

With his eyes scanning the room, Serhii Jarvinen spotted a small thread caught in the victim's shoe. He carefully removed it and examined it under the fluorescent lights. It was then that he discovered the crucial piece of evidence – a rare brand of fabric only used by one specific company.
