Serhii Mel stepped out of the train station, the crisp Moscow air hit him like a slap in the face. He rubbed his eyes, trying to shake off the fatigue that had been plaguing him for weeks. As a former soldier, he was no stranger to exhaustion, but this felt different. This felt like home.

Serhii had left Ukraine after the war, unable to shake the memories of the battles he'd fought in. He'd lost friends, comrades, and pieces of himself on those bloody fields. The world outside seemed harsher now, with its steel skyscrapers and cold stares. But Serhii knew that was where he needed to be – somewhere safe.

The train station spat him out into the streets, a blur of neon lights and honking horns. He hailed a taxi, the driver's gaze fixed on the rearview mirror as he asked the standard question: "Where you from?"

Serhii hesitated for a moment before responding with his old country's name – Ukraine. The driver raised an eyebrow but said nothing more. Serhii wondered if it was a bold move to share that much, but something about the driver's expression put him at ease.

The taxi dropped Serhii off in a nondescript apartment building on the outskirts of town. He took the stairs two at a time, fumbling for his keys as he caught his breath. As he unlocked the door and stepped inside, the silence enveloped him like a shroud.

His eyes adjusted slowly to the dim light, taking in the sparse furnishings and neatly arranged books. It was nothing grand, just a refuge – not that Serhii expected anything else from himself these days. His hands strayed over the spines of his favorite volumes – Tolstoy and Dostoevsky – their worn pages now offering a fleeting sense of comfort.

A knock at the door broke the stillness. "Hey," a soft voice called out, "I brought some groceries." Serhii opened the door to find Natasha standing on the threshold, her bright smile faltering for an instant as she took in his rugged appearance.

Natasha was one of those quiet, unassuming people – not like him. Yet, when he'd lost everything after the war, she'd taken him under her wing without question, bringing hot meals and listening ears. For Serhii Mel, she represented something bigger than just kindness; it was a reminder that some friendships didn't come from places of comfort or convenience.

With a heavy heart, he welcomed her in.
