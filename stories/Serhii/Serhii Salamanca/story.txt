Serhii Salamanca stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As the leader of the Crows, a notorious gang in the city's underworld, he had to be constantly on guard. The patrons cast nervous glances his way, sensing the aura of danger that surrounded him.

Serhii Salamanca made his way to the bar, ordering a whiskey as he surveyed the room. His gaze landed on a familiar face - Viktor, one of his most trusted lieutenants. Viktor nodded subtly in recognition, and Serhii Salamanca nodded back, acknowledging his presence without drawing attention.

As he sipped his drink, a hooded figure slipped onto the stool beside him. The air around them seemed to thicken with tension as they began to speak in hushed tones. Serhii Salamanca listened intently, his expression unreadable behind his sunglasses.

"What do you know about the shipment?" Viktor asked, his voice low and even.

The hooded figure hesitated before speaking, "I overheard some of the suppliers talking. It's supposed to arrive tonight."

Serhii Salamanca's eyes narrowed. He didn't like being kept in the dark, but this was one situation he couldn't afford to mess with. The shipment was too valuable to risk getting caught.

"I want you to keep an eye on it," he said finally, his voice firm. "Make sure nothing goes wrong."

The hooded figure nodded and slid off the stool, disappearing into the crowd before Serhii Salamanca could even process what had just happened.

He took another sip of his whiskey, his mind racing with possibilities. He knew that the shipment was too big to be left unattended - there were people willing to kill for it. Serhii Salamanca's instincts screamed at him to take action, but he needed to tread carefully. One misstep could mean disaster.

For now, he would keep a watchful eye on things. He was Serhii Salamanca, the leader of the Crows, and no one crossed him without facing consequences. The patrons of the tavern seemed to sense his unease, slowly backing away as he stood up to leave.
