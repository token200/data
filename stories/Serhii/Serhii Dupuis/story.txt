Serhii Dupuis stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the familiar streets of Montreuil. He had been away for months, chasing the thrill of extreme snowboarding in the Swiss Alps, but it was home that he longed to return to.

As he walked through the quiet streets, Serhii couldn't help but think about how much had changed since he'd left. His parents were still running the small boulangerie on Rue de Belleville, where he used to spend hours as a child watching them expertly mix and knead dough. The smell of freshly baked croissants wafted through the air, transporting him back to his carefree youth.

Serhii had always been drawn to adventure, but it wasn't just the thrill of the ride that attracted him – it was the sense of community he found in the mountains. Among his fellow riders, he'd forged lasting bonds and learned valuable lessons about perseverance and teamwork.

But as much as he loved the rush of adrenaline, Serhii knew he couldn't stay away forever. His parents were aging, and the boulangerie needed someone to take over. He'd promised himself that he would return home, help out, and put down roots for a while.

As he pushed open the door to the boulangerie, a warm light spilled out onto the sidewalk, and Serhii was enveloped by the familiar sounds of sizzling bread and lively chatter. His parents looked up from their workstations, beaming with pride as they took in his worn snowboarding jacket and rugged boots.

"Maman, Papa!" he exclaimed, planting a kiss on each cheek. "Welcome back to Montreuil!"

The next few weeks flew by in a blur of activity as Serhii settled into his new role at the boulangerie. He learned the intricacies of French patisserie and mastered the art of crafting the perfect baguette. The customers adored him, too – his infectious laughter and stories of the mountains had them swooning.

As he worked alongside his parents, Serhii realized that home wasn't just a place – it was people, traditions, and a sense of belonging. He knew that no matter where life took him next, Montreuil would always be his haven.
