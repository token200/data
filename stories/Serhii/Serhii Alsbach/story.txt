Serhii Alsbach stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station. He had been traveling for hours, and finally, he was here – in the city of Kursk, Russia. As a renowned geologist, Serhii had spent years searching for the rare mineral, Azurite, which was said to be found only in these parts.

As he made his way through the crowded station, Serhii's mind began to wander back to his days as a young boy growing up in Ukraine. He remembered spending hours poring over maps and books with his father, learning about the different minerals and rocks that could be found throughout their country. It was those early lessons that had sparked his passion for geology, and led him on the journey he was on now.

Serhii hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of his lodgings. As they drove through the city, Serhii's thoughts turned to his equipment – the samples he had collected, the maps he had studied, everything he needed to find that elusive Azurite. He had been searching for it for years, and he was determined not to leave without it.

The taxi dropped Serhii off at a small guesthouse on the outskirts of town, where he spent the afternoon sorting through his samples and studying his maps. As night began to fall, Serhii decided to take a walk around the city, getting a feel for the place and seeing if he could pick up any clues about where Azurite might be found.

It was as he walked that Serhii stumbled upon an old mine on the outskirts of town – a small, dilapidated building with a rusty gate and overgrown vegetation. Something about it drew him in, and he felt a thrill run through his veins as he approached. Could this be it? Could this be where he would finally find Azurite? Serhii's heart was racing as he pushed open the creaky gate and stepped inside.
