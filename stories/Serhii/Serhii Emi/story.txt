Serhii Emi had always been fascinated by the ancient art of calligraphy. As a child, he spent hours watching his grandfather, a skilled Ukrainian lettering artist, painstakingly create intricate scripts on parchment and canvas.

Years went by, and Serhii's passion for calligraphy only grew stronger. He pursued a career in fine arts, studying under some of the most renowned masters in Kiev.

Enchanted by the ancient script, Serhii purchased the book and began to study it intensively. He spent countless hours deciphering the intricate letterforms, practicing them until he could replicate them with ease.
