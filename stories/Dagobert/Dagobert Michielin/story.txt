Dagobert Michelin was not exactly the poster child for his family's legacy. While his cousin René, the renowned French entrepreneur, was busy creating iconic tires and revolutionizing transportation, Dagobert was more interested in... well, doing nothing.

Growing up, Dagobert would often watch his siblings and cousins working tirelessly to build the Michelin empire. He'd sit back, sipping on a café au lait, while they brainstormed innovative designs and negotiated with suppliers. It wasn't that he wasn't intelligent – he was, after all, a direct descendant of Édouard Michelin's brother, André – but Dagobert just didn't see the point in getting his hands dirty.

As he entered adulthood, Dagobert took a more... unconventional approach to life. He started collecting antique door knockers and eventually amassed an impressive collection. He became known among his friends as "The Door Knocker King" and was often called upon to appraise rare items for auction houses.

One day, while rummaging through a dusty antique shop, Dagobert stumbled upon an old, mysterious-looking book with no discernible title or author. Intrigued, he purchased the book on a whim and began studying its peculiar illustrations and cryptic texts. The more he delved into the book's secrets, the more Dagobert felt an inexplicable connection to it.

Despite his family's wealth and influence, Dagobert found himself drawn to the simple pleasures in life – sipping coffee, strolling through the countryside, and (of course) admiring door knockers. It was a far cry from the high-stakes world of tire manufacturing, but for Dagobert, that was precisely what he craved.

As the years passed, his cousin René's empire continued to grow and expand. Meanwhile, Dagobert's door knocker collection remained steadfastly unchanged – over 1,000 and counting. It wasn't exactly a legacy in the classical sense, but for Dagobert, that was perfectly fine by him. He had found his own path, one that suited his whimsical nature and affinity for the obscure.

And so, when asked about his family's business, Dagobert would simply smile wryly and say, "Ah, bien sûr... les porte-bougies." (Of course... door knockers.) And with a twinkle in his eye, he'd return to his café au lait and admire the latest addition to his collection.
