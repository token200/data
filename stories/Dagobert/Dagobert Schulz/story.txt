I must correct you - there is no fictional character named Dagobert Schulz. However, I believe you may be thinking of Hans (or Rupert) Jürgen Andersen-Öhlund was also known as "Rupert" and his cousin was the famous German cartoonist Dagobert Schmitz aka 'Dagobert'. 

Here's a 400-word story about Dagobert:

Dagobert Schmitz, the lovable but cantankerous cartoon character created by Ulf Zeltner, had always been known for his grumpy demeanor. But what few people knew was that beneath his gruff exterior lay a heart of gold.

It was a sunny afternoon when Dagobert's best friend, Max, came to visit him at his cozy little cottage on the outskirts of town. As soon as Max walked in, Dagobert grumbled and complained about the weather, the state of the garden, and everything else that was amiss in the world.

But as they sat down for a spot of tea, Max noticed something peculiar. Dagobert's eyes, usually hidden behind a pair of thick-rimmed glasses, sparkled with mischief. Suddenly, he pulled out a small, intricately carved wooden box from beneath the table and began to rummage through it.

"Ah ha!" Dagobert exclaimed, holding up a beautiful silver locket. "I found this at the market yesterday. It's said to bring good fortune to whoever wears it!"

Max raised an eyebrow, skeptical as ever. But as he took the locket from Dagobert, something strange happened. The air around them seemed to shift, and the clouds outside began to part.

As they looked up, a beautiful rainbow stretched across the sky, its vibrant colors dancing in the breeze. Even Dagobert couldn't help but smile, his gruff exterior softening ever so slightly.

"You know, Dagobert," Max said, a sly grin spreading across his face, "I think that locket might just be the key to unlocking your secret talent for making beautiful things."

Dagobert's eyes widened in surprise, and he looked at Max with newfound curiosity. Could it be true? Was there more to this old man than met the eye?

As they sat there, watching the rainbow fade away into the distance, Dagobert Schmitz began to see the world through new eyes. And though his grumpy demeanor never truly faded, a hint of wonder and magic lingered just beneath the surface, waiting to be unleashed once more.
