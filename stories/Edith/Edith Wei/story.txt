Edith Wei had always been fascinated by the old, worn piano in her attic. As a child, she would spend hours listening to her mother play, mesmerized by the way the keys seemed to dance beneath her fingers. As she grew older, Edith's love for music never wavered, and she began to teach herself how to play.

Despite her passion, Edith's parents encouraged her to pursue a more "practical" career. Her father, a successful businessman, wanted his daughter to follow in his footsteps and take over the family company. But Edith was determined to follow her dreams, even if it meant going against her family's wishes.

As she entered adulthood, Edith found herself at a crossroads. She could continue to pursue music as a hobby, or try to make a living from it. After much contemplation, Edith decided to take a leap of faith and move to the city to become a professional pianist.

It wasn't easy, of course. Edith faced rejection after rejection, and there were many times when she doubted her abilities. But she persevered, driven by her love for music and her determination to succeed. And slowly but surely, her hard work began to pay off.

Edith's big break came when she was invited to perform at a prestigious concert hall in the city. Her nerves were jangling as she took the stage, but as soon as she began to play, all her fears melted away. The music poured out of her like water, and the audience was entranced.

After that night, Edith's career took off. She became known throughout the city as a rising star in the world of classical music. And though she never forgot where she came from, Edith Wei knew that she had made the right decision in following her dreams. Her love for music had set her free, and she was forever grateful.

Years later, when Edith looked back on her journey, she would smile at the memory of that worn piano in her attic. It had been the catalyst for a lifetime of music, passion, and purpose. And as she took the stage once again, Edith Wei knew that she was exactly where she belonged â€“ among the notes, with her heart beating to the rhythm of her own drum.
