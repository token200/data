Edith Abdi was a woman with a passion for photography. Growing up in a small village in Somalia, she had always been fascinated by the world beyond her dusty streets. She spent hours pouring over her grandfather's old camera, learning the intricacies of capturing life's precious moments.

She trekked through the Andes, photographing the majestic peaks of South America. Her images told stories of resilience, hope, and community.

One day, while working in refugee camps, Edith Abdi met a young girl named Amina. Amina had fled her home country after her family was torn apart by conflict. Edith Abdi saw something in Amina's eyes that reminded her of herself - a deep longing for safety and belonging.

Edith Abdi took Amina under her wing, teaching her the art of photography. Together, they captured the struggles and triumphs of refugee life. Edith Abdi's camera became a tool for healing, as she used it to tell Amina's story and that of countless others.

But despite her success, Edith Abdi never forgot where she came from. She continued to use her camera to amplify the voices of those who had been silenced.

As Amina grew into a confident young woman, Edith Abdi knew it was time for her to take on new challenges. She founded a non-profit organization dedicated to providing photography training and mentorship to refugee women. The project, aptly named "Lens of Hope," quickly gained momentum, empowering countless women to share their stories through the power of photography.
