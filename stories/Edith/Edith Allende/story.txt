Edith Carolina Allende was a woman of mystery and intrigue. She lived a life that few knew much about, hidden behind the walls of her family's sprawling estate in Mexico City. Few people were lucky enough to have crossed paths with Edith, and even fewer had ever heard her speak.

Rumors swirled around the house like whispers in a crowded market. Some said she was a wealthy heiress with a penchant for designer gowns and exotic vacations. Others claimed she was a reclusive recluse, locked away from the world by grief or guilt.

The truth lay somewhere in between. Edith was indeed a member of one of Mexico's most influential families, but her life had taken a dramatic turn when her father, a famous politician, died suddenly. The loss left her shattered, and she retreated into herself, hiding behind a mask of elegance and refinement.

As the years passed, Edith grew more reclusive. She stopped attending social events and refused to answer phone calls from acquaintances who wished to reconnect. Her family tried to reach out, but she was elusive, always one step ahead.

One day, a young journalist named Sofia stumbled upon an old photograph of Edith in her youth. The image showed a bright-eyed, charming girl with a mischievous grin and sparkling eyes. Intrigued, Sofia set out to uncover the truth about this enigmatic woman.

Sofia spent months tracking down leads, following whispers and rumors until she finally found herself standing on the porch of Edith's estate. She knocked softly, hesitant to intrude on someone who had kept her secrets for so long.

To her surprise, the door creaked open, revealing a soft-spoken woman with piercing green eyes and a subtle smile. It was Edith Allende, and she was not what Sofia had expected â€“ but that was exactly what made this encounter so fascinating.

For a moment, they simply looked at each other, two women bridging gaps of time and misunderstanding. Then, in a whisper, Edith spoke her first words to anyone outside the family circle: "I'm glad you came."
