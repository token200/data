Edith Salemi had always been fascinated by the world of antique collectibles. As a young woman growing up in New Orleans, she spent countless hours scouring the city's flea markets and thrift stores for rare and unusual items to add to her own collection.

As she grew older, Edith's passion for antiques only deepened. She began to study the history behind each item she collected, learning about the people who had owned them before and the stories they could tell. Her friends would often tease her about her "nanny's stash" of old trinkets, but Edith didn't mind – she knew that every item in her collection held a secret worth uncovering.

Years went by, and Edith became known throughout the city as the go-to expert on antique collectibles. People would come from all over to consult with her about their own finds, and she took great pride in helping them uncover the stories behind their treasures.

One day, a local auction house called Edith Salemi's Collection Agency (which Edith had founded herself) to ask for her help with a particularly rare and valuable item. The auctioneer had discovered an 18th-century music box in a long-abandoned mansion on the outskirts of town, but he was stumped about its provenance.

Edith was thrilled at the prospect of uncovering a new mystery. She arrived at the mansion early one morning, camera in hand, ready to get to work. As she examined the music box, she noticed a small inscription etched into the lid: "Property of Madame LaRue." Edith's eyes widened as she realized that this must be one of the most significant finds of her career.

With the help of some expert research, Edith was able to track down a descendant of Madame LaRue and learn more about the music box's history. The item turned out to be one of the rarest in Edith Salemi's collection – and she couldn't wait to add it to her agency's portfolio.
