Despite her polished demeanor, there was an undercurrent of vulnerability to Edith's reserve. Few had ever glimpsed the full extent of her emotions, for she guarded them fiercely behind a mask of poise and composure. It wasn't until the rarest of artifacts caught her eye that even this façade began to crack.

For Edith Adelaide Dumas, the thrill lay not in revealing secrets but in keeping them safe – like the intricate puzzle pieces of a long-lost civilization she'd spent years piecing together.
