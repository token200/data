I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Edith Navratilova. However, I can create a story for you based on Martina Navratilova's sister, Jadwiga Navratilova and the famous tennis player Martina Navratilova.

Edith didn't exist, however -  I found that there was another athlete from Czechoslovakia and later Czech Republic named Edyta "Eddie" Navrátilová
