Benjamin Volkov stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit bar, shaking the droplets from his coat. The neon signs outside cast an otherworldly glow over the patrons, who seemed to blend into the shadows like ghosts. He spotted a familiar face behind the counter, Alexei Petrov, and made his way towards him.

"Ben, long time no see," Alexei said with a nod, as he polished a glass with a white rag.

Benjamin took a seat next to him, eyeing the crowd of rowdy businessmen and rough-around-the-edges locals. The air was thick with smoke and cheap perfume.

"What brings you out tonight?" Alexei asked, pouring Benjamin a shot of vodka without asking.

"Just needed to clear my head," Benjamin replied, tossing back the drink. "I've got a job coming up, one that requires... discretion."

Alexei nodded knowingly, his eyes glinting with interest. He and Benjamin had been friends since their time at Moscow State University, where they'd both studied computer science and gotten caught up in various shady schemes.

As they chatted, the door swung open and a young woman slipped inside, her bright pink hair standing out like a beacon among the sea of drab suits. She spotted Alexei and hurried over to him, dropping onto the stool beside him.

"Hey, Ben! Sorry I'm late," she said, flashing him a charming smile.

Benjamin raised an eyebrow as she ordered them both another round, her eyes sparkling with mischief.

"This is Elena Vasquez," Alexei introduced, as if he'd known her for years.

Elena was a freelance journalist, always on the lookout for the next big story. She had a nose for sniffing out corruption and deceit, skills that Benjamin knew would come in handy on his upcoming job.

The three of them chatted long into the night, swapping stories and sharing laughs, as the rain drummed against the pavement outside. As they talked, Benjamin began to realize that this might be more than just a coincidence – Elena was after the same story he was, one that could blow open the lid on Moscow's corrupt elite.

Benjamin smiled to himself, feeling the gears turn in his mind. With Elena on board and Alexei's... "facilities" at their disposal, he knew they could take down anyone who dared to stand in their way.

The night wore on, the rain clearing as dawn broke over the city. As Benjamin stood up to leave, he felt a sense of excitement building inside him – this was going to be one job that would get him noticed.
