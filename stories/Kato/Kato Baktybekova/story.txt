As a child, Kato would sit at his feet, mesmerized by the way he coaxed beautiful melodies from the strings and reeds. She would watch him practice for hours on end, taking mental notes of every nuance and phraseology. As she grew older, Kato began to take lessons with her father, learning the intricacies of Uzbek music theory and technique.
