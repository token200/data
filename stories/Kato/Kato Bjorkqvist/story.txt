The once-thriving industrial hub now stood as a testament to neglect and decay, yet Kato saw beauty in its crumbling walls and rusty machinery. She set up her camera and began to frame shots that would tell the story of this forgotten place.

Kato's eyes followed their path, tracing the lines of despair and hope etched into the walls.
