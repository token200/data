One sunny afternoon, as Kato walked down the street, his keen eyes scanned the crowds for any sign of trouble. Suddenly, he spotted a young woman frantically waving her arms at passersby. Kato sprinted towards her, his long strides eating up the distance.

As he approached, he saw that she was clutching a small notebook and looked like she had seen a ghost. "Please, you have to help me!" she exclaimed, breathlessly. Kato quickly assessed the situation and took charge, ushering the woman into a nearby coffee shop for safety.

With his exceptional skills in interrogation, Kato began questioning the shaken young woman, whose name was Sophia.
