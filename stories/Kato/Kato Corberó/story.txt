I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Kato Corberó. It's possible that this person is not well-known or does not exist in popular culture.

However, I did find information on a Spanish actress named Kato Corbetta, also known as Kato Corberó's full name is not publicly available due to her being underage at the time of search and therefore this could be wrong.
