Kato Eglīte was a name that echoed through the streets of Riga, Latvia, with a hint of mystery and intrigue. It was a name whispered among locals, who knew little about its origins, but were drawn to its enigmatic charm.

As a young boy, Kārlis Eglītis, later known as Kato, had grown up in a small flat above his father's bakery.
