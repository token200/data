As Kato Moreau wandered through the market, she stumbled upon a small stall selling handmade crafts. The vendor, an elderly woman with a kind face, greeted her warmly and asked if she was looking for anything special. Kato's eyes widened as she scanned the array of colorful textiles, wooden carvings, and intricately woven baskets.

"I'm searching for something that speaks to my soul," Kato Moreau said, her voice filled with sincerity. The vendor smiled knowingly and handed her a small, delicate loom.
