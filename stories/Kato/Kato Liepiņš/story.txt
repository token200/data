Kato Liepiņš stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the chill of the Baltic air hitting him like a slap in the face. He had left his small town in Latvia behind, seeking adventure and a new life in the bustling streets of Riga.

As he made his way through the crowded station, Kato's eyes scanned the signs and announcements, searching for the address he had memorized: 15 Lāčplēsis Street. A small smile played on his lips – it was where he would find his new job, as a mechanic at a local garage.

Kato had always been fascinated by machines, spending countless hours tinkering with old cars in his backyard. After completing his apprenticeship, he had set out to make a name for himself in the world of mechanics. And now, with a letter from a potential employer in hand, he was one step closer to achieving his dream.

As he walked down Lāčplēsis Street, Kato took in the sights and sounds of the city. The smell of fresh bread wafted from a nearby bakery, enticing him to stop and sample some of the local cuisine. He ignored the temptation, focusing instead on finding his new workplace.

The address 15 was unassuming, with a small sign above the door that read "Liepkalnieķu automobiļu mazā māja" (Liepkalnieki Garage). Kato's heart quickened as he pushed open the door and stepped inside.

A gruff voice from behind the counter greeted him, inquiring about his appointment. Kato produced the letter and explained his situation, to which the man nodded and handed him a set of keys. "Welcome to Liepkalnieki Garage, young one. You have a lot of work ahead of you."

Kato spent the next few weeks learning the ins and outs of the garage, working alongside experienced mechanics who taught him everything they knew. He quickly proved himself to be resourceful and diligent, earning the respect of his colleagues.

As he worked, Kato's thoughts turned to his family back home. His parents had sacrificed much for him to pursue his dreams, and he was determined to make them proud. With every passing day, he felt more at home in Riga, and more confident in his ability to succeed as a mechanic. The city, once intimidating, now seemed like a place where he belonged.
