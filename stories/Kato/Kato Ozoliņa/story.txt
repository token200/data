I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Kato Ozoliņa. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created recently. Can you provide more context or details about who Kato Ozoliņa is?

Kato Ozoliņa trudged through the dense forest, her eyes scanning the underbrush for any sign of the elusive figure she had been tracking. A seasoned huntress from the small village of Riga, Kato had spent years honing her skills and learning the secrets of the forest.
