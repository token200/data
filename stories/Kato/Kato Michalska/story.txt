Kato Michalska was a name that commanded respect in the underground art scene of Berlin. A skilled graffiti artist, Kato's murals were renowned for their vibrant colors and thought-provoking messages. Born to Polish parents in the early 1990s, Kato had grown up surrounded by the city's eclectic culture, which would later inspire their artistic style.
