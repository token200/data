Kato Pedersen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station as if searching for something – or someone. It had been years since he'd last set foot in Ravenswood, but the memories still lingered like a damp fog.

As a young man, Kato had grown up on this very platform, his parents working at the local bakery. He remembered laughter and warmth, the smell of fresh bread wafting through the air. But that was before his life took a drastic turn. A car accident had left him with a damaged leg and a penchant for solitude.

Kato's eyes landed on an old friend, Søren, who stood sipping a cup of coffee at the station entrance. They exchanged a brief nod before Søren beckoned Kato over.

"Come, Kato! We've got work to do," Søren said, leading him out into the bright sunlight.

Kato followed his friend to the old lighthouse on the edge of town, its towering presence looming like a sentinel. Inside, they found the rest of their team, all huddled around a makeshift workbench, covered in tools and half-finished projects.

"What's the plan?" Kato asked, curiosity getting the better of him.

"We're fixing up an old boat," Søren explained, "going to sail it out to the island for repairs. It'll be a good chance for us to get some work done while enjoying the peace and quiet."

As they set off, Kato felt a spark of excitement he hadn't experienced in years. Maybe this was the start of something new – a fresh beginning.

The journey to the island was grueling, but the scenery changed as the sun dipped below the horizon. Seagulls cried overhead, their cries echoing through the night air.

As they arrived at the small dock, Kato's thoughts turned to his past and what he'd left behind. He thought about his parents, who had passed away just a few years prior. Their bakery was still going strong, but it wasn't the same without them.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Kato began working on the boat, losing himself in the rhythm of chiseling and sanding. For the first time in a long while, he felt like himself – like he was finding his footing again.

As the stars began to twinkle overhead, Kato smiled wistfully at Søren. "Thanks for bringing me back here," he said quietly.

Søren grinned back, clapping him on the shoulder. "We're going to get this done, Kato Pedersen."

In that moment, Kato knew that no matter what lay ahead, he was ready to face it – one wave at a time.
