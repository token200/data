Beatrice Cook, also known by her stage name "Bea", was a pioneering British ethnomusicologist and sound artist. Born on March 10, 1880, in London, England, Bea grew up with a passion for music and the natural world. She began her career as a musician, playing the violin and singing, but soon became fascinated by the sounds of other cultures.

In the early 20th century, Bea traveled to Africa and Asia, collecting unusual instruments and recordings that would later become the foundation of her groundbreaking work in sound art. Her extensive travels took her to remote villages and cities, where she met with local musicians and learned about their traditional music-making practices.

Upon her return to England, Bea began experimenting with the instruments she had collected, incorporating them into her own compositions. She was particularly drawn to the sounds of African drums and flutes, which she used to create haunting melodies that seemed to evoke the spirits of the natural world.

As her reputation grew, so did her influence on the development of modern sound art. Bea's work challenged traditional notions of music as mere entertainment, instead positing it as a powerful medium for evoking emotions and conjuring the unknown. Her collaborations with artists like W.E.B. Du Bois and Henrietta Johnson further solidified her position at the forefront of this movement.

One of Bea's most famous works is "The Voice of the Tube", a 1910 recording that captures the sounds of London's Underground railway. The eerie, wavering tones of the train's horn and rumble of wheels on tracks have become iconic, and continue to inspire artists and musicians today.

Throughout her life, Beatrice Cook remained committed to exploring the boundaries of sound and its relationship to the human experience. Her pioneering work in ethnomusicology and sound art continues to inspire new generations of musicians, artists, and scholars, cementing her legacy as one of the most innovative and influential figures of the 20th century.
