Beatrice Rothbauer was a woman with a passion for painting and a heart full of creativity. Growing up in a small town surrounded by rolling hills and lush green forests, she spent most of her childhood exploring the outdoors and collecting inspiration for her art.

As she grew older, Beatrice's love for painting only deepened, and she went on to study fine arts at a prestigious university.
