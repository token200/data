Beatrice Yi-hsien, a fiery and independent soul, lived in a world where tradition and convention were suffocating. As a young woman growing up in 1950s Taipei, she longed to break free from the constraints of her family's expectations.

Born into a wealthy merchant family, Beatrice was expected to marry well and manage the household, just like her mother before her. But Beatrice had other plans. She dreamed of becoming an artist, of expressing herself through music and painting, not just playing the role of dutiful wife.

As she navigated the complexities of high society, Beatrice found solace in her small circle of friends who shared her passion for art and freedom. There was James, a charming American journalist who had settled in Taipei; Lian, a rebellious poet who spoke truth to power; and Mei, a talented young painter who saw the world through bold brushstrokes.

Together, they formed a secret collective, where they would meet secretly under the light of the full moon to discuss their art, politics, and dreams. Beatrice's own art took shape during these midnight gatherings – vibrant paintings that spoke to her soul and those of her friends.

But as Beatrice's talents began to gain attention, she faced pressure from her family and society to conform. Her father, a respected businessman, threatened to cut her off if she didn't marry the man he had chosen for her – a wealthy merchant with no artistic inclinations whatsoever.

Determined to stay true to herself, Beatrice defied her father's wishes and left Taipei for Paris, where she immersed herself in the vibrant art scene. She enrolled in a prestigious art school, honed her craft, and eventually exhibited her work in some of the city's most esteemed galleries.

When news of her artistic triumphs reached Taipei, Beatrice's family was shocked – and furious. Her father disowned her, branding her an "ungrateful daughter" for rejecting their values. But Beatrice knew she had made the right choice. As she stood before her paintings in the city of love, with James by her side, she knew that she had found her true self.

The night sky above Taipei whispered secrets to Beatrice Yi-hsien – a reminder that sometimes, it takes courage and determination to break free from the chains of convention and forge one's own path.
