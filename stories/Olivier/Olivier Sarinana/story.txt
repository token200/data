One day, Olivier received a call from a wealthy businessman named Henri, whose safe had been compromised by a group of skilled thieves. Olivier agreed to take on the case, and arrived at Henri's office building just as the thieves were making their escape with the stolen goods.

Without hesitation, Olivier sprang into action, using his knowledge of the building's ventilation system to track down the thieves and retrieve the stolen items. He was able to recover most of the valuable goods, but unfortunately, a priceless diamond necklace had been stolen along with some other valuable artifacts.

Henri was grateful for Olivier's expertise and thanked him profusely for his services. As Olivier departed the building, he couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction at having used his skills for good rather than ill.
