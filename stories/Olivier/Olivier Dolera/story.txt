Olivier Dolera stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar streets of Montparnasse. It had been five years since she'd left Paris, seeking a fresh start in the small town of Saint-Pierre. But despite the efforts to leave her past behind, Olivier's thoughts often wandered back to the city she once called home.

As she made her way through the winding streets, the scent of freshly baked croissants wafted from the nearby patisserie, transporting Olivier back to lazy Sundays spent exploring the Latin Quarter with friends. She smiled wistfully, remembering the countless hours they'd spent discussing art and literature over coffee at Caf√© de Flore.

Olivier's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her phone buzzing in her pocket. It was a text from her best friend, Sophie, inviting her to meet up for dinner that evening. Olivier's heart skipped a beat as she read the message - it had been far too long since they'd last spoken.

As she walked into the cozy bistro, the warm glow of candles and the soft strains of jazz music enveloped her. Sophie was already seated at their favorite table, a glass of wine in hand and a look of excitement on her face. "Darling, it's so great to see you!" she exclaimed, as Olivier settled into the seat across from her.

The evening flew by in a flurry of laughter and reminiscence, as they caught up on each other's lives. Olivier told Sophie about her decision to leave Paris and start anew, while Sophie shared stories of her own adventures - from working at a fashion magazine to traveling the world. As the night drew to a close, Olivier felt grateful for this chance reunion with her dear friend.

As they walked out into the cool evening air, Sophie turned to Olivier with a mischievous grin. "You know, I've been thinking of returning to Paris soon," she said. "I think it's time you came back too, Olivier Dolera." Olivier's heart skipped a beat at the mention of her full name - it had been a long time since anyone had called her that.

For a moment, Olivier hesitated, unsure if she was ready to face the ghosts of her past once more. But as she looked over at Sophie, she knew that with her friend by her side, anything seemed possible. And so, the seeds of possibility were sown - perhaps it was time for Olivier Dolera to return to the city of love and light, where her heart had always belonged.
