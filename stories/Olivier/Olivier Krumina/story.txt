Olivier Krumina was an enigmatic figure, shrouded in mystery and intrigue. A master thief and con artist, he had earned the nickname "The Fox" for his cunning and quick wit. With a reputation that preceded him, few dared to cross Olivier Krumina's path.

One night, Olivier Krumina set his sights on the wealthy collector, Mr. Harrington. The target was a rare and valuable artifact, one that had been passed down through generations of Harringtons.
