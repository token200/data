As he took a seat at the bar, the bartender raised an eyebrow in recognition. "The infamous Olivier Thompson," he said with a sly smile. "I should have known it was you."

Olivier smiled back, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he replied, "And I should have known it was you, my good man. You're always full of surprises."

The bartender chuckled and slid Olivier a whiskey on the rocks. "Well, I suppose that's one way to put it," he said with a grin.
