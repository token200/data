I must correct you that Olivier Maldini is not a real character and I couldn't find any information on someone with that name associated with notable individuals or public figures.

However, it's possible that you may be thinking of Franco Baresi's fellow Italian footballer,Franco Baresi's teammate, Franco Baresi is actually a well known Italian footballer. However if you are looking for a story about Olivier Maldini then the answer would be different

Let me rewrite the prompt as the following:

Story: The Unlikely Artist 

Olivier Maldini was never known to be an artist in his life. As one of the greatest defenders in football history, he had dedicated his career to the beautiful game. However, after hanging up his boots, Olivier found himself with a lot of free time on his hands.

One day while wandering through the streets of Milan, Olivier stumbled upon a small art studio. The owner, an eccentric old man named Marcello, took pity on Olivier and offered him a chance to try painting. At first, Olivier was hesitant but soon became fascinated by the world of art.

As he began to create, Olivier discovered that his passion for football translated perfectly into his newfound love of art. His bold brushstrokes and vibrant colors reminded him of the beautiful game he loved so much. 

Olivier's artistic journey took off as Marcello introduced him to other talented artists in Milan. Before long, Olivier was showcasing his artwork alongside some of Italy's most renowned painters.

His friends and family marveled at his talent, calling him "El Maldini de la pintura" or "The Painted Defender". As Olivier continued to hone his craft, he realized that his passion for art was just as strong as it had been for football.

Years later, when asked about his unexpected journey into the world of art, Olivier would smile and say "I never thought I'd be a painter, but life has a way of surprising you. And I'm grateful to have found my new passion in the beautiful game of art."
