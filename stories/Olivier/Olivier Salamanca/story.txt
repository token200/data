Olivier Salamanca, the infamous calculating genius and head of Los Pollos Hermanos, sat in his office, sipping on a glass of fine scotch. His piercing brown eyes scanned the pages of a financial report, calculating every dollar, every profit margin, and every potential threat to his empire.

As he worked, his mind wandered back to his early days as a small-time player in the game of cat and mouse with Walt's DEA agents. He had played it cool, always staying one step ahead, but now, as one of the most feared men in the world, he was no longer underestimated.

Olivier Salamanca, the one they called "El Oso," smiled to himself as he thought about his latest move - acquiring Los Pollos Hermanos, Walt's failing fast-food joint. He had manipulated Walt into selling, and now, with the profits pouring in, Olivier had more resources than ever before.

Just then, his assistant knocked on the door. "Olivier Salamanca, the DEA is asking to speak with you," she said, her voice trembling slightly.

Olivier raised an eyebrow, intrigued. He picked up the phone and dialed a number. After a brief conversation, he hung up, a sly grin spreading across his face.

"Bring them in," he said to his assistant.

The door opened, and in walked DEA agents Hank Schrader, Steve Gomez, and Saul Goodman, the smooth-talking lawyer. Olivier Salamanca leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers together.

"So, gentlemen," he began, "I hear you're looking for me."

Hank Schrader's eyes narrowed. "We know it's you, Salamanca. We have proof."

Olivier chuckled, a low, menacing sound. "Proof? Ah, I think not. You see, I've been playing this game for a long time, and I always stay one step ahead."

As the agents looked at each other nervously, Olivier leaned forward, his eyes glinting with amusement. "Tell me, gentlemen... what makes you think you can take down Los Pollos Hermanos?"

The room fell silent, except for the sound of Saul Goodman's nervous coughing in the back.

"You'll find out soon enough," Olivier said, his voice dripping with menace. And with that, he pressed a button on his desk, and the door closed behind him, leaving the agents to ponder their next move.
