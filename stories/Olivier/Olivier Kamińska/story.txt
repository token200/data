Olivier Kamińska was a man consumed by his work. A brilliant architect with a sharp mind and an eye for detail, he spent most of his days poring over blueprints and sketching out new designs. His clients were often high-end developers who valued his expertise above all else.

But Olivier's focus on his craft came at a cost. He had few friends outside of the office, and those he did have seemed to fade into the background as his work life took over. His apartment was a cluttered mess of papers, design books, and half-finished projects. The only sound that broke the silence was the hum of the espresso machine in the corner.

One day, while working late on a new project, Olivier received an unexpected visit from his mother. She had been his rock throughout his childhood, supporting him through the ups and downs of school and encouraging his love of art and design. But as he grew older, she began to fade into the background, content to watch her son become successful.

"Mother," Olivier said gruffly, trying to hide his discomfort. "What brings you here?"

"I heard you were working late," she replied, her eyes scanning the cluttered apartment with a mix of pride and concern. "I thought I'd come and see if everything is all right."

Olivier hesitated, unsure how to respond. His mother had always been supportive, but he felt like he was losing himself in his work. He didn't have time for relationships or social connections anymore.

"Mom," Olivier said slowly, taking a deep breath. "I think I need a change. I've been working non-stop for years, and I'm starting to feel like I'm losing myself."

His mother's expression softened, and she sat down beside him on the couch. "You're still you, Olivier," she said gently. "It's just that you're choosing to hide behind your work for now."

Olivier looked at her, feeling a sense of gratitude wash over him. Maybe it was time to take a step back and re-evaluate his priorities. He nodded, taking another sip of his coffee.

"Let's do this," he said finally. "Let's get you out of here, and we'll go find something new to focus on."

Together, Olivier and his mother began to clean up the apartment, sorting through papers and books and starting anew. For the first time in years, Olivier felt a sense of excitement about the future – not just about his next design project, but about what lay ahead for him personally.
