Olivier Hansen stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station. It had been ten years since he'd last set foot in Paris, and yet the city felt like an old friend. He took a deep breath, inhaling the familiar scent of freshly baked bread and roasting coffee.

As a child, Olivier had spent summers with his grandparents in this very neighborhood. His mother, a artist, would take him to the Musée d'Orsay, where he'd spend hours gazing at Monet's water lilies and dreaming of becoming an artist himself. But life had taken a different turn. His parents divorced when he was young, and Olivier's mother remarried. She encouraged his love of art, but never pursued it herself.

Olivier made his way through the crowded streets, weaving past pedestrians on their lunch breaks. He stopped at a small café, where he ordered a coffee and sat down at a table by the window. The barista recognized him immediately, flashing a warm smile as she poured his drink.

"Bonjour, Olivier! How are you?" she asked, her French accent musical.

Olivier smiled back, feeling a sense of belonging wash over him. "Je vais bien, merci," he replied, taking a sip of his coffee. He spent the next hour people-watching and making sketches in his notebook.

As the sun began to set, Olivier decided to take a walk along the Seine. The city was alive with activity – street performers juggling clubs and playing music, vendors selling handmade crafts from brightly colored stalls. Olivier felt a sense of peace settle over him as he strolled along the riverbank.

He stopped at a small park, where a group of artists were setting up their easels for an impromptu plein air session. Without hesitation, Olivier joined in, his brushes moving swiftly across the canvas as the colors of the city flowed onto the paper. It was like no time had passed at all – he felt free and alive, just as he had all those years ago with his mother.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the city, Olivier stepped back from his canvas, admiring the work he'd created. It was a fragment of himself, a piece of his past that still felt very much alive.
