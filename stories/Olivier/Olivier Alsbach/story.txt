Olivier Alsbach stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It was as if time had forgotten this place. He breathed in deeply, taking in the damp scent of saltwater and decay that clung to everything like a shroud.

This was where he'd grown up, in the sleepy coastal town of Ravenswood-by-the-Sea. His family had left when he was just a child, chasing the promise of a better life in the city. But Olivier's heart remained tied to this place. He'd returned after all these years, seeking answers about his past and the strange occurrences that plagued his dreams.

As he walked through the station, a worn leather satchel slung over his shoulder, the silence was oppressive. The few locals who ventured out of their homes eyed him warily, as if afraid to acknowledge the ghost of Olivier's childhood. He knew this look well – it had become familiar in the months since his return.

A gust of wind whipped through the station, extinguishing the lone streetlamp and plunging Olivier into darkness. He stood there for a moment, waiting for his eyes to adjust, as memories stirred beneath the surface like a slow-burning fire.

He remembered summers spent exploring hidden coves and secret beaches with his siblings, playing tag until the setting sun sent them scurrying back home. There were afternoons spent sitting by his mother's side, listening to stories of Ravenswood's history and legends passed down through generations of Alsbachs.

A chill ran down Olivier's spine as a faint whisper echoed in his mind: "The truth lies beneath." He turned towards the sound, but there was no one – only the echoes of water against stone, or the distant hum of seagulls. It was the language of Ravenswood-by-the-Sea, speaking to him through the ages.

As he stepped out into the darkness, a sliver of moonlight illuminated the worn brick façade of his family's old home. The door creaked beneath his touch, as if inviting him back in. He smiled, knowing that answers awaited – and secrets too – for those willing to uncover them.
