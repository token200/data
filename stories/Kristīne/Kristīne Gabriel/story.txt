Kristīne Gabriel was a name that struck fear into the hearts of those who knew her. A former assassin, she had left a trail of bodies in her wake, and no one was sure how many more lives she would take before she finally met her demise.

As she walked through the crowded streets of Riga, Kristīne's eyes scanned the faces of the people around her with a practiced intensity. She was always on the lookout for potential targets, never knowing when her next victim might be just around the corner.

But despite her reputation as a ruthless killer, Kristīne had a secret: she was also a survivor. Growing up in the streets of Riga, she had learned to rely only on herself, to trust no one and to never let her guard down.

One day, Kristīne received a message from an old acquaintance, inviting her to meet at a secluded cafe on the outskirts of town. The message was cryptic, but Kristīne's curiosity got the better of her. She decided to take a chance and attend the meeting, hoping to learn more about what had brought her friend back into her life.

As she entered the cafe, Kristīne spotted her acquaintance sitting in the corner, sipping a cup of coffee. The woman looked different than Kristīne remembered, with a faint smudge of paint on her cheek and a look of quiet desperation in her eyes. "Kristīne," she said softly, as if speaking to a ghost from another life.

"I've come back," the woman said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I want to tell you something. Something important." Kristīne's eyes narrowed, her mind racing with possibilities. What could this mysterious stranger possibly have to say that would change everything? She leaned forward, her hand resting on the knife at her belt, ready for whatever lay ahead.

"Speak," she growled, her voice low and deadly.

The woman took a deep breath before speaking, her words dripping with a quiet determination that sent shivers down Kristīne's spine. "I know your secret," she said, her eyes locked on Kristīne's face. And with those five simple words, everything changed for Kristīne Gabriel forever.
