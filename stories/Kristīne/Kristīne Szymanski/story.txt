In the bustling streets of Manhattan, Kristīne set up her small studio and began working tirelessly to create a unique brand that would showcase her traditional Lithuanian heritage alongside modern American flair. Her designs were a fusion of bold colors, intricate patterns, and luxurious fabrics that captured the essence of her homeland.

Despite facing many challenges as a young immigrant, Kristīne persevered, relying on her wit, determination, and creative vision to overcome each obstacle. She spent countless hours networking with other designers, attending fashion shows, and learning from mentors in the industry.
