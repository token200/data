Kristīne Polo stood at the edge of the bustling Riga Market, her eyes scanning the vibrant stalls for a glimpse of her next lead. As an intrepid journalist for the Latvian newspaper, Laiks, she had made a name for herself by uncovering the city's darkest secrets.

A petite woman with piercing blue eyes and curly brown hair, Kristīne was known for her tenacity and wit. She navigated the crowded streets with ease, dodging vendors selling everything from traditional folk clothes to fresh seafood.

As she walked, Kristīne's thoughts turned to her latest investigation – a series of bizarre occurrences at the city's abandoned Soviet-era hospital. Rumors swirled that the building was haunted by the ghosts of former patients and medical staff. But Kristīne wasn't one to believe in ghost stories; she was convinced that there was more to the mysterious happenings than met the eye.

She stopped in front of a small, unassuming stall tucked away between two larger vendors. A faded sign above the stall read "Antiques and Curios." The vendor, an elderly woman named Baiba, looked up as Kristīne approached.

"Kristīne! Welcome back," Baiba said with a warm smile. "I see you're on the hunt for something."

Kristīne's eyes widened as she scanned the crowded stall. Amidst the rows of dusty vases and old books, one item caught her eye – an antique medical chart with strange symbols etched into its margins.

"Where did this come from?" Kristīne asked Baiba, her curiosity piqued.

Baiba hesitated before answering. "I found it in my attic, buried beneath a pile of old trunks and boxes. I have no idea what it is or where it came from."

Kristīne's journalist instincts kicked into high gear. She purchased the chart and promised to return for more information. As she left the market, her mind whirled with possibilities – could this ancient document hold the key to unraveling the hospital's mysteries?

With renewed determination, Kristīne Polo set out to uncover the truth behind Riga's most enigmatic case. Little did she know that her investigation would lead her down a rabbit hole of secrets and lies, testing her mettle as a journalist and pushing her to confront the dark forces that lurked beneath the city's charming surface.
