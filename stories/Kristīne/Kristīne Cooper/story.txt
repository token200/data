I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Kristīne Cooper. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created after my knowledge cutoff date.

However, I can create a new character and write a story about her. Here's a 400-word story about Kristīne Cooper:

Kristīne Cooper was a brilliant inventor who had always been fascinated by the mysteries of the universe. Growing up in a small town in Latvia, she spent most of her childhood tinkering with gadgets and machinery in her father's workshop. Her parents, both engineers themselves, encouraged her curiosity and nurtured her passion for science.

As Kristīne grew older, her interest in space exploration only deepened. She devoured books on astronomy and physics, and spent countless hours poring over research papers on advanced propulsion systems. After completing her degree in engineering, she landed a job at a top-secret research facility, where she worked alongside some of the brightest minds in the field.

One fateful day, Kristīne stumbled upon an obscure reference to an ancient Latvian myth about a celestial being who controlled the balance of the universe. Intrigued, she spent months studying the legend and searching for clues that might lead her to the truth behind it. Finally, after years of tireless work, she made a groundbreaking discovery.

Using cutting-edge technology, Kristīne had created a device that could harness the energy of dark matter – a hypothetical form of matter thought to make up most of the universe's mass-energy budget. The implications were staggering: with this technology, humanity might finally be able to tap into the vast reserves of energy available in the cosmos.

As news of her discovery spread, Kristīne became an overnight sensation in the scientific community. She was hailed as a genius and a trailblazer, and her device sparked a new era of space exploration. With her invention, humanity took its first steps towards becoming a multi-planetary species – and Kristīne Cooper stood at the forefront of it all.

Years later, when asked about her inspiration for creating the dark matter harvester, Kristīne smiled wistfully and said: "I've always believed that the universe holds secrets waiting to be uncovered. And I'm just glad I was able to listen to its whispers."
