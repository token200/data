Kristīne Fliesbach stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She had been in Riga, Latvia for only a day, but she was determined to make the most of it. As a historian specializing in Baltic studies, Kristīne had always been fascinated by the rich cultural heritage of this small European country.

As she waited in line to order her coffee, Kristīne's mind wandered back to her childhood, growing up in New York City with a Latvian grandmother who regaled her with stories of her homeland. Her full name, Kristīne Fliesbach, was often met with confusion, but for Kristīne, it was more than just a name - it was a connection to her roots.

When she finally reached the counter, Kristīne ordered a strong black coffee and took a seat at a small table by the window. As she sipped her coffee, she noticed a young woman sitting across from her, scribbling in a notebook. There was something about the girl's intensity that caught Kristīne's attention.

As fate would have it, the girl looked up and locked eyes with Kristīne. "Hello," she said, smiling shyly. "I'm Anna. I couldn't help but notice you're writing in your journal too."
