She lived with her husband, Mikhail, a writer, and their two children, Sasha and Anastasia, in a cozy apartment overlooking Moscow's Tverskaya Street. On weekends, the Kabylbekovas would often take long walks through Red Square, admiring the intricate stone carvings on St. Basil's Cathedral.

The intricate wooden carvings seemed to hold secrets and stories that only Joanna could decipher. She often incorporated elements of this doll into her artwork, using its symbolism to explore themes of identity and belonging.

She was commissioned to create large-scale murals for government buildings and private mansions, earning her a reputation as one of Russia's leading artists. Through it all, she remained committed to her craft, always pushing the boundaries of what was possible with color and form.
