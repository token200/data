Joanna Dabrowski, a brilliant and resourceful young detective, sat at her desk, sipping on a cup of cold coffee, staring at the stack of files in front of her. Her partner, Detective James, walked into the room, a look of determination on his face.

"What's the plan, Jo?" he asked, nodding towards the files.

"I've been going over the case, and I think I found a lead," Joanna replied, her eyes scanning the pages. "It seems our culprit has been leaving clues at each crime scene, but they're not making any sense."

James leaned against the desk, eyeing the stack of files. "What kind of clues?"

"Well, there's this weird symbol etched into the wall near the latest victim," Joanna explained, pointing to a sketch on one of the files. "It looks like some sort of code, but I couldn't crack it."

James raised an eyebrow. "You're sure it's not just random graffiti?"

Joanna shook her head. "No way. This is too precise, too calculated. Our killer wants us to know something."

As they continued to study the files, Joanna's mind began to piece together the evidence. She noticed a small inconsistency in the victim's alibi, which led her to suspect that their killer might be someone close to the victims.

Suddenly, it clicked. "I've got it!" she exclaimed, slamming her fist on the desk. "Our killer is not just any ordinary serial killer – they're someone who knows the victims personally!"

James raised an eyebrow, impressed by Joanna's insight. "How did you come to that conclusion?"

Joanna grinned, feeling a surge of confidence. "It was the symbol, remember? The one that looked like a mix between a Celtic knot and a hieroglyphic. It's not just any code – it's a family crest. And I found a match in our database."

James nodded, his eyes widening in understanding. "The Dabrowski family crest?"

Joanna smiled, her heart racing with excitement. "That's right! Joanna Dabrowski, at your service."
