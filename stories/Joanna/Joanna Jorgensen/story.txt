Joanna Jorgensen stepped into the bustling café, her eyes scanning the crowded room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting in the corner, nursing a cup of coffee and staring intently at his laptop screen. It had been months since they'd last spoken, but Joanna knew she could count on Ryan to be there, waiting for her.

As she approached the table, Ryan looked up, catching her gaze and flashing a warm smile. "Hey," he said softly, closing his laptop and pushing it away from him. "It's good to see you."

Joanna smiled back, feeling a rush of nostalgia wash over her. She'd known Ryan since high school, and despite their differing paths in life, they'd remained close friends. Now, as she sat down across from him, she realized how much had changed. The café was busier than ever, the sounds of chatter and clinking cups filling the air.

Ryan reached out and placed a hand on her arm, his eyes sparkling with curiosity. "What brings you here today?" he asked, leaning in closer. Joanna hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. But there was something about Ryan's understanding gaze that put her at ease.

"I needed to get out of the apartment," she said finally, shrugging her shoulders. "And I saw your face on a friend's post on social media, and...I just wanted to see you." Ryan nodded, his expression softening.

As they chatted, Joanna felt like no time had passed at all. They talked about everything – school, careers, friends – their conversation flowing effortlessly from one topic to the next. It was as if they'd picked up right where they'd left off years ago.

After an hour or so of talking, Ryan suggested they grab some dinner somewhere. Joanna agreed, and together they left the café, strolling through the quiet streets in comfortable silence. They didn't need words to fill the space between them; their friendship was strong enough to carry it.

As they settled into a cozy restaurant nearby, Joanna turned to Ryan with a smile. "Thanks for today," she said quietly. "I needed this." Ryan smiled back, his eyes crinkling at the corners.
