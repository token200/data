Joanna Järvinen, or Jo as she was known to her friends, sat at the small café on the corner of Market Street, nursing a cup of cold coffee. It had been five years since she'd left Helsinki, the city she loved and lost, behind. Five years since she'd fled the memories that still lingered in every corner of her mind.

Jo's eyes wandered to the sketchbook lying open on the table before her. Her pencil moved deftly across the page, capturing the soft light streaming through the café window. She was an artist, a painter, and this was her way of processing the world around her. Of healing herself.

As she worked, memories began to surface - the sound of Sibelius's symphonies wafting from her parents' old radio, the smell of freshly baked karjalanpiirakka wafting from her mother's oven, the feel of snowflakes falling gently on her face as a child.

Her thoughts drifted back to her family, and the tragedy that had torn them apart. The car accident that took her brother's life had left an unfillable void in her heart. Her parents' subsequent silence had been suffocating at times, but it was also the only way they could keep on living without him.

Jo's pencil paused, hovering over a blank space where a figure should be. She'd tried to paint so many things, but nothing seemed quite right. Nothing captured the depth of her emotions. And yet, with every stroke, she felt a tiny bit closer to healing.

As the sun began to set outside, casting long shadows across the café's walls, Jo closed her eyes and let herself drift away on the breeze of memories. She thought about all the things she'd left behind in Helsinki - the old apartment on Västra Töölänkatu, the friends who'd remained loyal despite her departure, the quiet moments spent wandering through the forests of Kaunissaari.

For a moment, Jo felt like she was floating above it all, watching herself as she'd been just five years ago. Watching herself before she left. Before everything changed.

As the silence enveloped her, Jo took a deep breath and picked up her pencil again, ready to begin anew.
