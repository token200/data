Throughout the evening, Joanna found herself drawn back to the installation piece that had sparked her arrival. She noticed a few viewers lingering in front of it, their faces reflecting contemplation and curiosity. A quiet realization dawned on her: this piece might be more than just an art piece – it could be a catalyst for meaningful conversations.
