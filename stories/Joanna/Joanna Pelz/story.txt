Joanna Pelz had always been fascinated by the old, abandoned house on the outskirts of town. Rumors swirled that it was haunted by the ghost of its former owner, a reclusive millionaire who had died under mysterious circumstances. Undeterred, Joanna decided to investigate further.

As she approached the crumbling mansion, a shiver ran down her spine. The once-grand entrance now hung crookedly from its hinges, creaking ominously in the wind. Joanna pushed open the door and stepped inside, her eyes adjusting to the dim light within.

The air was thick with dust and the scent of decay. Joanna's footsteps echoed off the walls as she made her way deeper into the house. She stumbled upon a room that seemed frozen in time – a library filled with leather-bound books and a grand piano, its keys yellowed with age.

As she explored further, Joanna began to uncover clues about the millionaire's life. A letter, penned by his own hand, spoke of a tragic love affair and a deep sense of isolation. The more Joanna learned, the more she felt a connection to the enigmatic figure.

Despite her growing fascination, Joanna couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. She turned a corner to find herself face-to-face with an old mirror, its surface distorted by age and neglect. As she gazed into its depths, a reflection stared back – not her own, but that of the millionaire himself.

Joanna's heart skipped a beat as she felt a chill run down her spine. Was this really just a trick of the light, or was something more at play? She stood frozen for a moment, lost in the mirror's gaze. Then, with a sense of determination, Joanna turned away and continued her exploration. For Joanna Pelz, the mystery of the mansion was too great to ignore – she would uncover its secrets, no matter what lay ahead.
