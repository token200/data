Joanna Singh was a brilliant and fiercely independent engineer who had always been driven by her passion for innovation. Born in Mumbai, India, she had grown up surrounded by the vibrant streets and markets of her hometown, where her curiosity and creativity were nurtured from a young age.

After completing her degree in mechanical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Joanna moved to New York City to pursue her master's degree at Columbia University. It was there that she met her mentor, Dr. Rachel Kim, who would become a lifelong friend and confidant.

Under Dr. Kim's guidance, Joanna worked tirelessly on her dissertation project - designing a sustainable energy system for rural communities in Africa. Her work was groundbreaking, and soon she was invited to present her research at conferences around the world.

Despite her many achievements, Joanna remained humble and grounded, always remembering the struggles of her childhood and the countless hours spent by her mother fixing broken machinery in their small workshop. She believed that technology should be a tool for social change, not just a means to line someone's pockets.

When she received an offer from Google to join their diversity recruitment program, Joanna was thrilled - but also nervous. As one of the first Indian-American women to make it into the company, she felt the weight of responsibility on her shoulders. Yet, with Dr. Kim's encouragement and support, she accepted the challenge.

As a member of the Google Diversity Recruitment Team, Joanna used her unique perspective to identify and nurture talented engineers from underrepresented backgrounds. She helped develop training programs for hiring managers, advising them on how to create more inclusive workplaces. Her efforts led to a significant increase in diversity among the company's ranks.

Joanna's work at Google had a profound impact not just on the tech industry but also on her own life. She met fellow engineers who shared her passion for social responsibility, and together they formed a network of support that went beyond the office walls. For Joanna, there was no greater joy than seeing young girls from underprivileged backgrounds inspired by her story to pursue careers in science and technology.

Years later, when Dr. Kim asked Joanna if she had ever considered starting her own company, Joanna smiled wistfully. She knew that it would be a dream come true, but for now, she was content with making a difference one small step at a time, as part of the Google team.
