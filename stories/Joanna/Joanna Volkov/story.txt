Joanna Volkov was known for her razor-sharp mind and her penchant for solving the unsolvable. As a renowned forensic psychologist, she had spent years studying the most heinous crimes in the world, trying to understand what drove the minds of monsters.

But despite her expertise, Joanna couldn't shake off the feeling that there was one case that had slipped through her fingers – the infamous "Devil's Child" murder case. A series of brutal killings had taken place in a small town just outside of London, leaving behind a trail of death and terror. The killer, dubbed "The Devil's Child," seemed to be always one step ahead of the police, leaving behind only cryptic clues and gruesome trophies.

Years ago, Joanna had been called in as an expert witness to help track down the killer, but she had ultimately fallen short. Her theories and insights were dismissed by her colleagues, and the case was left unsolved.

Now, as Joanna sat in her office, staring at a file that held the memories of countless victims, she couldn't help but wonder if she'd ever truly caught The Devil's Child. She began to sift through old notes and photographs, looking for any clue that might have been missed.

As she delved deeper into the case, Joanna started to notice something strange – each victim had been a child, and the only thing they had in common was their age at the time of death. Suddenly, an unsettling idea crept into her mind: what if The Devil's Child wasn't just a serial killer, but a collector of souls?

Joanna knew she had stumbled upon something groundbreaking, but as excitement washed over her, her phone rang, shrill and insistent. It was a cold caller, claiming to have information on the case – and offering to meet with Joanna in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town.

As she made her way to the meeting spot, Joanna felt a shiver run down her spine. She knew that this could be it – her chance to finally catch The Devil's Child, once and for all. With each step, the darkness seemed to close in around her, and she couldn't shake the feeling that she was walking into a trap.

But something about the caller's words resonated with Joanna - "We have the Devil's Child right where we want him." It was time to see if the past had finally caught up with its most elusive prey.
