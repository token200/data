Janina Shinichi's fingers danced across the piano keys, coaxing out a melancholic melody that echoed through the empty corridors of the Shinichi estate. It was a sound that seemed to hold a world of emotions within it – joy, sorrow, longing.

As she played, Janina's mind wandered back to her childhood, when music had been her solace and confidant. Her parents, high-society figures with sharp minds and quicker wit, had pushed her to excel in every field they deemed worthy. But Janina's true passion lay elsewhere – in the world of sound.

As she grew older, Janina's talent for music became harder to ignore. She was soon recruited by a prestigious conservatory, where she honed her craft alongside fellow prodigies. Her fingers moved with precision and ease, conjuring up masterpieces that left her teachers and peers awestruck.

Yet, despite her success, Janina couldn't shake the feeling of restlessness within her. She began to feel suffocated by the expectations placed upon her – the constant pressure to perform, the rigid structure of her daily routine. Her parents' voices still lingered in her mind, urging her to excel, to be a Shinichi.

One day, Janina stumbled upon an old, dusty record player hidden away in the estate's storage room. It was there that she discovered the music of a forgotten era – the sounds of blues and jazz, raw and untamed. The notes seemed to seep into her soul, awakening a part of her she never knew existed.

As she delved deeper into this new world, Janina began to let go of her rigid structure, allowing herself to explore the unknown territories of sound. Her music took on a life of its own, rich and vibrant as a sunset over the city.

And so, Janina Shinichi made a choice – to follow her heart, rather than the path laid out before her. It wasn't an easy decision, but one that set her free. As she played, lost in the melody of her own creation, Janina knew that she had finally found her true voice.
