Janina Olsen had always been fascinated by the old, abandoned lighthouse on the outskirts of town. As a child, she would often sneak away from her chores to explore its crumbling walls and imagine what it must have been like for the lighthouse keeper all those years ago.

As Janina grew older, her curiosity only deepened. She spent countless hours researching the history of the lighthouse, pouring over dusty old books and talking to the local elderly residents who had known the place since it was still operational. It wasn't until she stumbled upon an old logbook hidden away in the lighthouse's attic that Janina truly felt like she had uncovered a piece of the past.

The logbook belonged to a former lighthouse keeper named Edward, and as Janina delved deeper into its yellowed pages, she discovered a world of secrets and stories that she never could have imagined. There were tales of storms and shipwrecks, of lovers' trysts and family feuds, all written down in Edward's precise hand.

Janina was entranced by the logbook's contents, and she spent every spare moment studying it. She learned about the lighthouse's heyday as a major maritime hub, and about the struggles that came with maintaining such a critical piece of infrastructure. As she read on, Janina felt a deep connection to Edward and to the lighthouse itself, as if she had stumbled upon a long-forgotten family treasure.

One day, as Janina was walking along the coast, she noticed something peculiar - a small, weathered wooden box partially buried in the sand. She picked it up, dusting off the dirt, and to her surprise found that it was an exact replica of the logbook's leather cover. Inside, she discovered a handwritten note from Edward himself, inviting Janina Olsen to visit the lighthouse whenever she pleased.

Janina's heart swelled with excitement as she gazed out at the sea. She knew that this was just the beginning of her journey into the past, and that with each new discovery, she would uncover more secrets about the mysterious lighthouse and its enigmatic keeper, Edward.
