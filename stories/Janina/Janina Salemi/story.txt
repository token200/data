When it came time for Wildflower's hit single "Ghost," the crowd erupted into cheers and applause, Janina feeding off their energy to deliver a performance that was both electrifying and emotionally resonant.

As the final notes of the set faded away, Janina took her place at the microphone once more, this time to thank the audience for their support. "We're so grateful to have you all here tonight," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "It means the world to us."

With that, Wildflower launched into an encore performance of one of their earliest singles, Janina's vocals taking on a new level of intensity as the crowd sang along with every word. As the music washed over them, the audience felt like they were experiencing something truly special â€“ a raw, emotional connection that came from a place of honesty and vulnerability.
