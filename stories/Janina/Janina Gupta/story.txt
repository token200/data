Janina Gupta stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. She had been away for months, working as an expat in Tokyo, but she was finally back home in New Delhi.

As she made her way through the crowded streets, Janina felt a sense of nostalgia wash over her. The city she grew up in was so different now - the air was thick with pollution, the streets were clogged with traffic, and the sounds of horns and vendors filled the air.

Janina's parents had always been supportive of her career goals, but they also worried about her safety as a single woman living abroad. They had begged her to come home for good after the Tokyo stint, and she had agreed, knowing it was time to recharge.

She hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of her family's old bungalow in Connaught Place. As the car hurtled through the city streets, Janina gazed out at the unfamiliar sights - the gleaming skyscrapers, the manicured lawns, and the ornate temples that dotted the landscape.

When they arrived, Janina's mother flung open the door and swept her into a tight hug. "Beta, I've missed you so much!" she exclaimed, tears welling up in her eyes.

Janina hugged her back, feeling a mix of emotions - happiness to be home, but also sadness that she had left behind the adventure and freedom of Tokyo.

Over the next few days, Janina settled back into life in Delhi. She spent hours chatting with her family, catching up on the latest gossip and scandals. Her mother regaled her with stories of her own marriage, and Janina listened attentively, grateful for the opportunity to hear about her parents' love story all over again.

As she wandered through the streets, exploring her old haunts and reacquainting herself with familiar faces, Janina began to feel a sense of belonging. She realized that home wasn't just a physical place - it was a feeling of being grounded, of knowing where you belonged.

And as she sat on her family's porch, watching the sunset over the city, Janina knew that this time, she was truly home to stay.
