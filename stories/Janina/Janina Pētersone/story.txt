Janina Pētersone was a 25-year-old Latvian artist known for her vibrant paintings and intricate designs. Growing up in Riga, she had always been fascinated by color and texture, spending hours as a child playing with crayons and paints.

After completing art school, Janina began to build a name for herself in the local art scene. Her unique style, which blended traditional Latvian patterns with modern techniques, quickly gained attention from collectors and galleries.
