Janina Alsbach stepped out into the crisp morning air, her eyes scanning the crowded streets of Berlin as she made her way to her first appointment of the day. A renowned psychologist with a keen mind and sharp intuition, Janina had built a reputation for herself as one of the most sought-after therapists in the city.

As she walked, Janina's mind turned to her latest patient, a young woman named Sophia who was struggling to cope with the aftermath of a traumatic event. Janina's own experiences as a refugee had given her a unique understanding of the emotional scars that could leave lasting marks on one's life.

She arrived at the office and was greeted by her assistant, who showed her to the conference room where Sophia would be waiting. Janina took a deep breath, preparing herself for what lay ahead.

Sophia was indeed there, looking pale and nervous as she fidgeted with her hands. "Dr. Alsbach," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I don't know how to explain it all."

Janina smiled warmly and took Sophia's hand in hers. "You don't have to explain anything just yet, my dear. Just let your words flow, and we'll take it from there." Sophia nodded, taking a deep breath before launching into a torrent of emotions and memories that Janina listened to attentively.

As the session progressed, Janina began to see patterns emerge - the way Sophia's eyes would dart away whenever she mentioned her mother, the tightness in her shoulders when talking about the accident. It was all part of the delicate dance they were performing together, a dance of trust and vulnerability that only came with time.

Janina's own experiences as a refugee had given her a profound understanding of the power of memory and trauma to shape one's life. She knew that healing wasn't about erasing the past but about learning to live with it, to find meaning in its fragments.

As the session drew to a close, Sophia looked up at Janina with tears in her eyes. "Thank you, Dr. Alsbach," she said, her voice filled with gratitude. "I feel like I can breathe again."

Janina smiled softly and handed Sophia a small piece of paper with her number on it. "Remember, my dear, healing is a journey. And you're not alone in it."
