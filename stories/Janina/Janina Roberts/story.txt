Janina Roberts was a woman with a gift – the ability to see the world through the eyes of others. She had always known she was different, ever since childhood when her parents would tell stories of her playing with dolls and creating entire worlds for them. As she grew older, her unique perspective only intensified, allowing her to understand people's deepest desires and fears.

As a child psychologist, Janina used her gift to help clients overcome their personal struggles. She'd sit in silence, observing as they spoke, and often catch glimpses of underlying emotions that no one else could see. Her methods were unorthodox, but effective; she could put even the most stubborn patients at ease.

One day, a young girl named Sophie wandered into Janina's office, her eyes brimming with tears. She was struggling to cope with the loss of her mother, and Janina knew she had to help. As they sat together, Janina closed her eyes, focusing on Sophie's energy. The room seemed to fade away, replaced by visions of Sophie's childhood – playing in fields, snuggling with her mom, laughing together.

Janina's eyes snapped open as the memories came flooding back to her. She listened intently as Sophie poured out her heart, sharing stories and feelings that no one else was willing or able to hear. With every word, Janina felt a deep sense of compassion for this young girl, who had lost so much already.

Over time, Janina's sessions with Sophie became more than just therapy – they were moments of connection between two souls who understood each other in ways others couldn't. And as the weeks went by, Sophie began to heal, her smile returning as she found solace in their conversations.

But there was one person Janina knew less about – herself. She'd always been fascinated by the mysteries of her own past, wondering what lay beneath the surface. One day, while working late in her office, a faint memory stirred within her – a glimpse of her own childhood, filled with warmth and love.

Janina's eyes welled up as she realized that her gift was not just about helping others but also about healing herself. She smiled softly to herself, knowing that the secrets of her own heart would one day reveal themselves, and that she'd be ready to help another lost soul find their way back home.
