Her parents, Italian immigrants who had settled in America, encouraged her passion, taking her to museums and galleries throughout their city.

As Janina grew older, her love for art only deepened. She began studying fine arts in college, where she honed her skills and discovered a particular talent for portraiture.

Excited by the prospect of sharing her art with an even wider audience, Janina threw herself into the project. She spent weeks researching and planning, sketching out ideas and refining her vision. Finally, she began painting, the colors and shapes flowing from her brush like a river.

As the mural took shape, people began to stop by the community center just to catch a glimpse of Janina's latest masterpiece. They marveled at the vibrant colors and intricate details, many stopping to chat with her about her inspiration and creative process.
