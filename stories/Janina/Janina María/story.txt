One sunny afternoon, Janina María strolled along the scenic Copacabana Beach, lost in thought as she gazed out at the turquoise waters. Her mind was preoccupied with the upcoming exhibition at the iconic Museu de Arte Moderna do Rio, where she would be showcasing her latest collection of vibrant abstract paintings.

As she walked, Janina María noticed a group of street artists setting up their easels and canvases along the beachfront promenade. She watched with curiosity as they began to paint the breathtaking views of the ocean, capturing the ever-changing light and colors of the scene before them. Inspired by their creativity, Janina María decided to join in, pulling out her own paints and canvas from her bag.

For the next few hours, Janina María worked alongside the street artists, laughing and chatting as they brought the beach to life on canvas. Her strokes were bold and expressive, reflecting the energy and passion of the setting sun.
