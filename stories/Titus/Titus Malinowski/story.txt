Titus Malinowski stepped out of the mist-shrouded alleys of Prague's Old Town and into the bright lights of the city square. He lit a cigarette, taking a long drag as he scanned the crowd. His eyes were always on the lookout for someone – or something – that didn't belong.

A former soldier and private investigator, Titus had built a reputation for himself as a man who could find anything, anyone, in this sprawling metropolis. But his skills went beyond mere detection; he was a ghost hunter of sorts, searching for those who preyed on the vulnerable.

Tonight's case was no different. A local woman, Emma, had gone missing. The police were stumped, and her family was at their wit's end. That's when they called Titus – an outsider with a reputation for getting results.

As he navigated the crowded square, Titus spotted a figure watching him from across the way. Tall, lean, with eyes that seemed to suck in light around them, he looked like nothing so much as a shadow person. Titus recognized the type all too well – someone who didn't belong here.

He flicked his cigarette into the gutter and headed toward the stranger, weaving through the crowds. "You're the one they sent," he stated flatly.

The stranger's eyes locked onto Titus', and for an instant, Titus could swear he saw a glimmer of something – sadness? Fear? But it was gone before he could be sure.

"I'm just looking for work," the stranger said, shrugging. "I don't want any trouble."

Trouble was exactly what Emma's family needed – someone to take on the job, to track down their missing loved one and bring her home safe. Titus handed the stranger a small folder containing all he knew about Emma's disappearance.

"You're hired," he said simply. The stranger hesitated for a moment before nodding and turning away into the crowd.

Titus watched him go, knowing that this was far from over. There were threads to unravel, connections to make – but with a job like this, he couldn't afford to be distracted. Not until Emma came home safe.
