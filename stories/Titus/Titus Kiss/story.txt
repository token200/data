Titus Kiss was a man of mystery, shrouded in secrecy and intrigue. His piercing green eyes seemed to gleam with an inner intensity, as if he held secrets that no one else knew. With his sharp jawline and chiseled features, Titus exuded an air of confidence that bordered on arrogance.

But despite his commanding presence, Titus was a man with a dark past. He had spent years working for the highest bidder, taking on jobs that required him to walk a fine line between right and wrong. His skills as a spy and assassin were unmatched, but at what cost?

As he sipped his whiskey, Titus couldn't shake the feeling of restlessness that had been growing inside him for months. He had taken on one too many jobs, pushed himself too far. Now, he felt like a ghost, haunting the shadows of the world he once knew.

Suddenly, a soft knock at the door broke the silence. Titus's head snapped up, his eyes narrowing as he watched the figure enter. It was Sophia, an old acquaintance from his past. Her raven hair and porcelain skin seemed to glow in the dim light of the room, and for a moment, Titus felt like he was staring into the face of his own demons.

"Sophia," he said gruffly, trying to hide the warmth that crept into his voice.

"I've come to talk about your latest job," she said, her eyes locked on his. "The one you took in Berlin?"

Titus's lips curled into a sneer. "You want to know what happened?"

Sophia nodded, her eyes never leaving his face. "I do."

For a moment, Titus hesitated. He had always been careful with the stories he told, keeping only the barest outlines of his adventures. But there was something about Sophia that made him trust her.

"It was a setup," he said finally, his voice low and husky. "A trap, laid by the people who hired me."

Sophia's expression turned somber. "I knew it. I saw the look in your eyes when you came back from Berlin. You were shaken."

Titus shook his head, trying to clear the cobwebs. "It was just a job," he lied.

But Sophia wasn't buying it. She stepped closer, her hand reaching out to touch his arm. For a moment, Titus felt a spark of connection that went beyond words.

"Titus," she said softly, "you need help. You can't keep running from your past forever."

And in that moment, something shifted inside Titus. He looked at Sophia, really looked at her, and for the first time in years, he saw a glimmer of hope. Maybe it was time to turn his back on the shadows and face the light.
