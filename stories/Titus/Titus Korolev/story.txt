Titus Korolev was a man shrouded in mystery. Few people knew much about him beyond his rugged exterior and piercing green eyes. Born into a family of modest means, Titus had grown up on the streets, relying on his wits and cunning to survive.

Despite the hardships he faced, Titus's natural charisma and intelligence had earned him a reputation as a skilled thief and con artist. He moved effortlessly from one mark to the next, always staying one step ahead of his pursuers.

One night, Titus found himself in the wealthy district of Paris, where he had set his sights on a high-stakes heist. The target was a priceless diamond necklace, owned by the city's most influential socialite. With his trusty lockpicks and quick fingers, Titus effortlessly bypassed the security system and made off with the gemstone.

But as he disappeared into the night, Titus couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. He had encountered a mysterious figure, dressed in black, who seemed to be watching him from the shadows. The stranger's piercing gaze sent shivers down Titus's spine, and for the first time, he felt a glimmer of doubt about his own abilities.

The next morning, Titus received an unexpected visit from the socialite herself, demanding that he return her stolen necklace. But as she spoke, Titus noticed something peculiar - a small tattoo on her wrist, shaped like a snake coiled around a crown. It was the same symbol he had seen etched into his own arm years ago, a mark of initiation into a secret society.

Titus's mind reeled as he pieced together the truth. He was not who he thought he was. His true identity was tied to this mysterious organization, and his life of crime was merely a cover for something far more sinister. With this revelation, Titus Korolev knew that his world would never be the same again - and that the road ahead would be fraught with danger and uncertainty.
