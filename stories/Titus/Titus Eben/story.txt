Titus Eben stood at the edge of the dusty town, his worn boots scuffling against the earth as he gazed out into the vast expanse of the Arizona desert. His weathered eyes, like two pieces of rough-cut stone, seemed to hold a depth that few could match.

Few people knew much about Titus, except that he was a man with a past shrouded in mystery. Some said he was a former outlaw, driven out by his own hand after a string of violent robberies left a trail of death and destruction in its wake. Others whispered that he was a former soldier, haunted by the memories of battles fought and won.

But Titus knew that neither story was true. He was something more complex, like a rich tapestry woven from threads of black and grey. He had walked many paths, each one leading him further away from his true self.

As he stood there, lost in thought, a rustling sound came from behind him. He turned to see a young girl, no more than ten years old, her dark hair tied back in a ponytail as she carried a large basket slung over her arm.

"Can I help you?" Titus asked, his deep voice like thunder on a summer day.

"I'm just gathering herbs for my ma," the girl replied, not looking up. "She's sick and needs some medicine."

Titus watched her walk towards him, feeling an inexplicable sense of connection to this young girl and her desperation. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a handful of coins, which he tossed at her feet.

"Take these," he said softly. "For your ma."

The girl looked up, startled by the kindness in Titus's eyes. For a moment, they just stared at each other, two strangers connected by some unseen thread.

"You're a nice man," she said finally, before turning to leave.

Titus watched her go, feeling a pang of longing that he couldn't explain. It was as if something had shifted inside him, like the shifting sands beneath his feet.

As the sun began to set over the desert, Titus Eben walked away from the town, carrying his large saddlebags with him. He knew that his journey was far from over, and that there were still many paths to walk before he found his way home.

But for now, he felt a sense of purpose, like a fire burning deep within his chest. It was a flame of hope, flickering bright in the darkness.
