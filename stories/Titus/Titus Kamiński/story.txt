Titus Kamiński sat at his desk, staring blankly at the canvas in front of him. His latest project, a commissioned portrait of the local mayor, had been sitting untouched for weeks. The pressure to produce something worthy was suffocating him.

As he rubbed his tired eyes, memories flooded his mind like the streets of Warsaw during a spring rain. Growing up, Titus had always been fascinated by art and politics, seeing parallels between the two in their ability to shape reality. He'd spent hours listening to his father's stories about the resistance fighters who'd resisted Soviet occupation.

Titus's own path was one he couldn't shake – that of an artist trying to make a name for himself under the watchful eye of communist authorities. Every piece, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, carried with it a hidden message, encoded in layers like a cipher.

He thought back to his earliest days as an art student, secretly sketching symbols and patterns on scraps of paper, using techniques he'd learned from his father's secret notebooks. Those drawings would eventually become part of his portfolio – but for now, they sat in a box hidden deep within the university's storage rooms.

The knock at the door broke Titus out of his reverie. It was Zuzanna, an acquaintance who'd arranged an introduction with a prominent patroness of the arts. She handed him a letter sealed with her family crest – the first serious offer he'd received since the war ended.

"This is your chance to prove yourself," she said, smiling warmly. "The mayor's portrait won't bring you fortune overnight, but it can lead to real opportunities."

As Titus read over the invitation, his mind began to wander once more. How much freedom did he have in this new role? Would his art be merely a prop to further their own interests, or could he carve out something true?

"I'll need time," he said finally, folding the letter into a neat square. "A few weeks."

Zuzanna nodded understandingly. "I knew you'd see things that way."
