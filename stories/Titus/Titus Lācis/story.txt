Titus Lācis was no ordinary warrior. Born into a long line of Sicilian aristocrats, he had been trained in the art of warfare from a young age by his father, a renowned general. But it wasn't until he encountered the enigmatic sorceress, Arachne, that Titus's life took a drastic turn.

Arachne, rumored to possess powers beyond the understanding of mortal men, revealed to Titus that he was destined for greatness.
