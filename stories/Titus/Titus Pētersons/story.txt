Titus Pētersons was a man with a passion for restoring old machinery to its former glory. As a young boy growing up in Latvia, he would spend hours watching his grandfather, a skilled engineer, tinker with vintage tractors and cars in their backyard workshop.

Years later, Titus had inherited the family workshop from his grandfather's passing, and was determined to keep his legacy alive by restoring classic machines. His workshop, nestled in the heart of Riga, became a haven for car enthusiasts and collectors seeking unique restorations.

One day, a rare 1962 Citroen 2CV rolled into Titus' shop, its condition far from ideal. The owner had found it abandoned in a field, but was unsure how to proceed with restoration. Titus was thrilled at the opportunity to work on such an iconic model and set about meticulously cleaning and repairing every aspect of the car.

As he worked, Titus would often imagine his grandfather standing beside him, offering words of encouragement and guidance. It was as if Grandfathers' spirit still lingered in the workshop, watching over Titus as he carefully reassembled the Citroen's components.

After weeks of tireless work, the restored 2CV rolled out of the shop, its paint gleaming and its engine purring smoothly. The owner was overjoyed, thanking Titus for bringing back a piece of history. Word of Titus' exceptional restorations spread quickly through the local car community, attracting collectors from across Europe.

Titus Pētersons had found his true calling in life, and it was clear that he owed his success to his grandfather's teachings and legacy. As he looked on at the restored 2CV, now proudly on display in a nearby museum, Titus felt a deep sense of pride knowing he was carrying on his family's tradition of restoring old machines to their former glory.

Years went by, and Titus' reputation as a master restorer continued to grow, earning him recognition from across the globe. Yet, it was the memories of his grandfather that remained closest to his heart, reminding him of where his passion for restoration truly began.
