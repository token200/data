Titus Nielsen was a man of mystery, with an air of quiet confidence that commanded attention. As the lead detective on the prestigious Copenhagen Murder Unit, he had a reputation for being unflappable, even in the face of chaos. His colleagues often joked that Titus's calm demeanor was just a ruse, a carefully crafted facade to conceal his razor-sharp mind.

As he sat at his desk, sipping his lukewarm coffee, Titus's eyes scanned the stack of files and case notes before him. He was currently working on a particularly puzzling case - a wealthy businessman had been found dead in his mansion, with no signs of forced entry or struggle. The only clue was a cryptic message left at the scene, scrawled on the wall in red ink: "The truth is hidden in plain sight."

Titus's thoughts were interrupted by the knock at the door. It was his partner, Sarah Thompson, who had been assigned to work with him on this case. Titus nodded curtly, gesturing for her to take a seat.

"So, what have you got?" he asked, as Sarah began to explain the latest developments in the investigation.

Titus listened intently, his eyes narrowing as he digested the information. He was known for his exceptional observational skills, and he noticed that Sarah's demeanor seemed a fraction off - she was usually more ebullient than reserved.

"Sarah, what's going on?" he asked, his voice low and even. "You seem... distracted."

Sarah hesitated before responding, "It's just... Titus Nielsen, I don't want to burden you with this, but I had a weird encounter last night. Someone was following me home from the precinct. They were watching me, but I didn't see their face."

Titus raised an eyebrow, his expression unreadable. He nodded curtly, making a mental note to look into Sarah's alibi further.

"Alright, let's focus on the case at hand," he said, pushing his chair back from the desk. "We've got work to do, and not much time to waste."

As they dived back into the investigation, Titus's thoughts drifted to the cryptic message scrawled on the wall - a phrase that seemed to be mocking him, daring him to unravel its secrets. He was determined to get to the bottom of it, no matter what lay hidden in plain sight.

The game was on, and Titus Nielsen was ready to play.
