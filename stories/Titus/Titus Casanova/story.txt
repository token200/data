Lady Victoria, however, was not one to be easily won over. She had heard rumors about Titus's roguish past and was determined to see if the stories were true. As she watched him glide across the dance floor, his eyes locking onto hers with an unmistakable spark of interest, Lady Victoria felt her resolve begin to crumble.

Before long, Titus Casanova was by her side, charming her with tales of his adventures on the Continent and sharing with her his passion for art and music.
