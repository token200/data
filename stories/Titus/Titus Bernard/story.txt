Titus Bernard stood tall, his piercing blue eyes surveying the crowded room. As a renowned detective, he had seen it all - the highs and lows, the twists and turns that led to solving even the most baffling of cases. Tonight was no exception.

As he sipped his glass of whiskey, Titus Bernard's mind wandered back to the phone call that had brought him here tonight. A wealthy businessman, Mr. Johnson, had reported a stolen necklace worth a small fortune. The police were stumped, and that's where Titus Bernard came in - the best detective in town.

The room fell silent as Titus took his seat at the table. He flashed a charming smile at the assembled guests, all of whom were eager to hear the details of the case. Mr. Johnson cleared his throat and began to explain.

"The necklace was passed down through my family for generations," he said, his voice trembling with emotion. "It holds great sentimental value. I'm counting on you, Detective Bernard, to retrieve it."

Titus Bernard nodded attentively, his eyes never leaving the businessman's face. He had a reputation for being one of the most tenacious detectives in the business, and he intended to prove it tonight.

As the night wore on, Titus Bernard listened intently to each guest's alibi, taking note of every detail. He noticed that Mrs. Smith seemed particularly nervous, fidgeting with her gloves as she spoke. Titus made a mental note to investigate her further.

Finally, just before midnight, the game was afoot. Titus Bernard excused himself and slipped out into the cool night air, his eyes scanning the rooftops for any sign of movement. And then, he spotted it - a glint of gold peeking from behind a nearby dumpster.

With lightning-fast reflexes, Titus Bernard retrieved the necklace and returned to the mansion, where Mr. Johnson's family waited anxiously by the fire. As they gathered around him, their faces lit up with joy, Titus Bernard smiled quietly to himself - it was all in a day's work for Detective Titus Bernard.

The night drew to a close, and as Titus Bernard departed the mansion, he felt a sense of satisfaction wash over him. He had solved another case, proving once again why he was the go-to detective in town. And as he stepped into his waiting car, he couldn't help but think that it was going to be another long night for all those who'd wronged him - Titus Bernard was on the case.
