Titus Trevisan stood alone on the moonlit beach, his eyes gazing out at the vast expanse of ocean. The waves crashed against the shore, sending sprays of saltwater high into the air. He breathed in deeply, feeling the salty mist fill his lungs.

As a child, Titus had spent countless hours exploring the coastline, searching for shells and seaweed to add to his collection. His love of the sea had only grown stronger with time, and now he found himself drawn back to its soothing rhythms. He closed his eyes, letting the sound of the waves wash over him.

Suddenly, a faint cry pierced the air. Titus's head snapped open, his ears straining to locate the source of the sound. It came again, louder this time - a young woman calling out for help. Without hesitation, he sprang into action, racing down the beach to find her.

As he approached the waterline, he spotted a small figure clinging to a piece of debris, struggling against the tide. Titus plunged into the ocean, fighting his way through the waves to reach the girl. With a surge of adrenaline, he pulled her aboard and wrapped his arms around her, holding her close as the waves crashed around them.

Breathless and soaked, the girl looked up at him with gratitude in her eyes. "Thank you," she whispered, her voice barely audible over the sound of the waves.

Titus smiled wearily, his chest heaving with exertion. He helped the girl to her feet, steadying her as the tide pulled back from the shore. As they stood there, the stars twinkling above them, Titus Trevisan felt a sense of peace settle over him. It had been a long time since he'd found such satisfaction in helping someone - and yet, it was a feeling he knew all too well.

As the girl stumbled away from him, a little more steady on her feet, Titus watched her go, his eyes soft with compassion. He returned to the beach alone once more, letting the waves wash over him like a balm.
