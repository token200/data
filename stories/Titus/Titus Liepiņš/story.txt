Titus Liepiņš, or "Titus" as he was known to his friends, stood at the edge of the old wooden dock, gazing out at the waves. He had always felt most alive when he was near water, the rhythmic lapping of the sea against the shore a soothing balm for his weary soul.

As he stared out into the distance, Titus's mind began to wander back to the past. Growing up in the small fishing village of Riga, he had spent countless hours on these very docks, watching the fishermen return with their nets full of fresh catch. His own father, a skilled fisherman, had taught him everything he knew.

But life had other plans for Titus. A talent for mechanics had led him to open his own shop in the nearby town, where he spent most of his days tinkering with engines and fixing broken machinery. It was a far cry from the sea-faring life he had always dreamed of, but it paid the bills.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the water, Titus's thoughts turned to his wife, Elīna. She had been the one who had brought him back to the sea, convincing him to take up sailing in her own small boat. It was a hobby she shared with him, and together they spent many happy hours exploring the coastline.

Titus smiled to himself as he remembered their first voyage together. He had been nervous, but Elīna's calm presence had soothed his doubts, and soon they were gliding across the waves like pros.

As the stars began to twinkle in the night sky, Titus reluctantly made his way back to shore. The shop was quiet, the only sound the creaking of old wooden beams as he worked. He took a deep breath, feeling the familiar smell of oil and engine grease fill his lungs.

For a moment, he imagined himself back on that dock, feeling the sea spray on his face and listening to the calls of seagulls overhead. It was a fantasy he couldn't shake, one that had been with him since childhood.

As he worked, Titus's thoughts strayed to Elīna once more. He knew she would be waiting for him at home, her eyes sparkling with warmth as he walked through the door. And in that moment, all his doubts and worries seemed far away, replaced by a sense of contentment that only came from being near the one person who truly understood him.
