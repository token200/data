Titus Dell stood atop the worn stone steps, gazing out at the twinkling lights of the city below. The wind whipped through his dark hair as he wrapped his coat tighter around him, trying to ward off the chill that seeped into his bones. A private investigator by trade, Titus Dell was no stranger to the darker corners of life.

As a child, Titus had grown up with a sense of restlessness, always feeling like there was something just out of reach. He'd channeled that energy into becoming one of the best detectives in the city's underbelly, earning him a reputation as a fiercely independent and razor-sharp mind. People whispered about Titus Dell in hushed tones, speculating about his troubled past and the secrets he kept hidden.

Tonight was no different. The shadows seemed to writhe around him like living things, their silhouettes cast long by the streetlights. He'd been hired by a mysterious client, one who wanted to know what happened to her sister all those years ago. A case that had gone cold, and yet Titus Dell's gut told him there was more to it.

He descended into the darkness, weaving through alleys and side streets as he followed the trail of clues. Whispers of a long-forgotten love affair hung in the air, whispers that Titus Dell's ears pricked up with interest. He'd heard rumors of a scandalous romance between two of the city's most influential families, one that had ended in tragedy.

As he turned a corner, the faint glow of a streetlamp caught his eye. A name scrawled on the wall, in letters both bold and crude: Emily Wilson. Titus Dell's mind flashed back to the case files, and the fragments of a life he'd never known. This was it â€“ the break he'd been searching for.

He tucked the piece of paper into his pocket and turned away from the streetlamp, disappearing into the night as if swallowed whole by shadows. For Titus Dell, the truth was always just out of reach, but with each step, a little more light spilled into the darkness.
