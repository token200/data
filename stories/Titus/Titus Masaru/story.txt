One sunny afternoon, Titus Masaru received an invitation from the local museum to create a new exhibit on Japanese calligraphy. Excited by the prospect of sharing his passion with the community, he spent hours preparing for the display. He carefully selected a series of rare, antique brushes and fine papers to showcase his mastery of traditional techniques.
