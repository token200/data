Titus Koskinen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. It was as if the entire town had forgotten about him. He shouldn't be surprised - he'd been gone for a long time.

As a child, Titus had grown up in this small Finnish town, surrounded by lakes and forests that seemed to stretch on forever. His father, a fisherman, had taught him how to navigate the waters and identify the medicinal properties of the plants that grew along the shore. But when Titus was just 16, his life changed forever.

A group of loggers had arrived in town, seeking cheap labor for their logging operations. In the chaos that followed, Titus's father was killed in a tragic accident. The trauma he experienced that day would stay with him for the rest of his life.

With no other family to turn to, Titus found himself forced into the harsh world of logging. He learned to survive on his own, but at what cost? The memories of his childhood and the pain of losing his father lingered in his dreams, taunting him every night.

Years went by, and Titus became one of the most skilled loggers in town. But as he approached middle age, he couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more to life than just working in the forest. He began to feel a deep connection with nature - not just as a source of livelihood but also as a source of healing.

One day, while out collecting herbs on the shores of Lake Saimaa, Titus stumbled upon a rare species of bearberry. Its berries had been used for centuries by the indigenous Sami people to treat various ailments. Something about that moment sparked something within him. He realized he no longer just wanted to log; he wanted to use his knowledge to help others.

And so, Titus started collecting and preserving the medicinal plants he found in the forests around town. Word began to spread about a mysterious healer with an uncanny ability to cure even the most stubborn illnesses. Eventually, people from all over Finland came to seek out his expertise.
