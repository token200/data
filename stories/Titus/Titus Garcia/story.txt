One day, a local antique shop owner approached Titus with an unusual request. She had acquired a rare 1960s motorcycle that had been collecting dust on her shelf for years and was willing to pay him handsomely to restore it to its former glory. The project proved to be the most challenging yet rewarding of Titus's career, requiring him to dig deep into his knowledge of motorcycle history and mechanics.

With painstaking attention to detail, Titus Garcia brought the vintage bike back to life, complete with intricate engravings, gleaming chrome accents, and a rich patina.
