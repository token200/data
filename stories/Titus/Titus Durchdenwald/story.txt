Titus Durchdenwald was known for his peculiar occupation â€“ collecting and categorizing antique door handles. While some might find it odd, he took great pride in his work, spending years studying the history behind each handle.

His fascination with door handles began when he was a child, watching as his grandfather, a skilled carpenter, worked on old homes. The intricate designs and craftsmanship that went into creating these small pieces of hardware captivated Titus. As he grew older, his interest only deepened, leading him to pursue a degree in history and museum studies.

Titus's current obsession had started about five years ago when he stumbled upon an antique shop in the city, filled with door handles from various eras. The store owner, noticing his fascination, offered Titus a job as an apprentice. Over time, Titus became an expert on door handles, identifying styles and materials, and even creating detailed models of how they were made.

One day, while examining a rare 19th-century handle at the local museum, Titus met Dr. Emma Taylor, a renowned historian specializing in architectural design. Her extensive knowledge sparked a lively discussion about the significance of door handles in shaping architecture and culture. As their conversation progressed, Titus realized he had found a kindred spirit.

Dr. Taylor was impressed by Titus's comprehensive understanding of door handles and encouraged him to join her on an upcoming expedition to study historical door hardware in remote regions of Europe. The prospect of exploring the world with someone who shared his passion was exhilarating for Titus Durchdenwald, also known as 'the Door Handle Whisperer' among collectors.

Together, they set out on their journey, documenting and analyzing door handles from centuries past. Their findings would eventually contribute to a groundbreaking publication that shed new light on the subject of antique door hardware. As Titus looked back on his life's work, he smiled, knowing that his passion had led him down an incredible path filled with discovery, collaboration, and above all, door handles.
