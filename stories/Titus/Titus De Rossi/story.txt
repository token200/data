But Titus refused to back down, driven by a fierce determination to expose the truth. His colleagues began to notice a change in him, a steely resolve that had previously been absent.

Despite the danger, Titus pressed on, convinced that his reporting could make a real difference. And when he finally published the explosive exposé, it sent shockwaves through the city's elite.

As Titus stood amidst the chaos, surrounded by cheering crowds and well-wishers, he couldn't help but wonder what the future held. Would he continue to shine a light on the darkest corners of power, or would he finally allow himself to be seen? Only time would tell for Titus De Rossi.
