Born into a family of modest means, Titus's journey to becoming one of the most celebrated jurists in the country was far from conventional.

One notable case that showcased his unconventional approach was the "Ferrari Ruling." In it, Titus found himself at odds with the prosecution over the admissibility of a certain piece of evidence. With his trademark bluntness, he declared the evidence inadmissible, stating, "In a just society, we must not be afraid to challenge the powers that be."

The ruling sparked controversy, but also earned Titus widespread recognition for his courage and conviction. Critics praised him for sticking to his guns, even when it meant going against the grain.
