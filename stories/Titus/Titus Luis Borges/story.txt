I couldn't find any information on a famous person named Titus Luis Borges. However, I believe you may be thinking of the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. Here's a story based on him:

In the dimly lit café, Jorge Luis Borges sat alone at a small table, sipping his coffee and lost in thought. As he stared out the window, his mind began to wander to the infinite labyrinths of time and space that he had written about in his famous short stories.

As he pondered the mysteries of existence, a young man approached him and asked for his autograph. Borges looked up, surprised by the request, and signed the book with a flourish. The young man was taken aback by the writer's intensity and insight, and he felt as though he had been granted a glimpse into the depths of Borges' mind.

Just then, a figure appeared at the edge of the café. It was an older version of Borges himself, dressed in a long coat and holding a cigar. The younger man gasped in surprise, but Borges simply smiled and nodded at him.

"You have been given a glimpse into my infinite library," he said to the young man. "But remember that it is not just the books that are infinite, but also the paths we take to get there."

The older Borges sat down beside his younger self and began to speak about the tedium of time and the importance of contemplation. The two Borges conversed in hushed tones, their words weaving a complex web of meaning and symbolism.

As they talked, the café around them grew quiet, as though the very fabric of reality was being rewoven by the words of the writer. The young man watched in awe, feeling himself becoming one with the infinite labyrinths that Borges had created.

In that moment, he knew that he would never see the world in the same way again, thanks to the guidance and wisdom of Jorge Luis Borges.
