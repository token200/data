The woman vanished into thin air, leaving Titus nowakowska to unravel the tangled threads of deceit. As he departed the warehouse, his mind reeled with questions and uncertainties. Who was this mysterious stranger? What were her motives? And what did she want from him? The only thing Titus Nowakowska knew for certain was that he had stumbled upon something much bigger than himself – a labyrinthine web of secrets that would continue to haunt him for the rest of his days.
