Titus Alexander Girard was a man of mystery and intrigue. A French-Canadian private investigator with a sharp mind and a quick wit, he had built a reputation for himself as one of the best in the business. His piercing green eyes seemed to bore into those he met, as if sizing them up for potential weaknesses.

One rainy evening, Titus Alexander Girard stepped out of his office and onto the wet streets of Montreal. The neon lights of the city's bars and clubs reflected off the puddles like a gaudy dance, drawing in passersby with promises of cheap whiskey and warm company. But Titus was not here to socialize – he had a job to do.

A wealthy businessman, Pierre LaFleur, had hired him to investigate the theft of his prized possession: a rare, antique pocket watch. The owner claimed it had been stolen from his mansion on the outskirts of town, and that the thief had left no sign of forced entry or exit. The only clue was a small note, left on the mantlepiece with a single word: "Adieu".

Titus Alexander Girard's mind whirred as he pondered the case. Who could have pulled off such a daring heist? And what did the note mean, exactly? He knew that in his line of work, nothing was ever as it seemed.

As he lit a cigarette and leaned against a lamppost, Titus couldn't help but feel a thrill of excitement. The game was on, and he was ready to play. He pulled out his phone and dialed a number, the voice on the other end answering with a familiar "Bonjour, Monsieur Girard?" It was his trusted informant, René.

"René, I need you to run some numbers for me," Titus said, already knowing what he wanted. René would dig up any dirt he could find on Pierre LaFleur, and Titus would take it from there. The rain continued to fall around him as he listened to the voice on the other end of the line, his mind racing with possibilities.

And so, the investigation began, a complex web of intrigue that would lead Titus Alexander Girard down dark alleys and into the heart of the city's underbelly. Only time would tell if he'd crack the case, but one thing was certain: this was going to be an adventure like no other.
