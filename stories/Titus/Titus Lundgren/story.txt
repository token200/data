Titus Lundgren was a man of mystery, shrouded in secrecy and speculation. Few knew much about his past, but whispers of his extraordinary abilities had long fascinated the international community. A former operative for the Swedish government's top-secret agency, Titus had left behind a trail of intrigue and unexplained events that still lingered in the shadows.

One stormy evening, Titus received an encrypted message from an unknown sender, summoning him to a discreet location in the heart of Stockholm. The message read: "Meet me at Café Kvarn at midnight. Come alone." Intrigued, Titus made his way through the pouring rain, dodging pedestrians and taxis as he navigated the city's streets.

Upon arrival, a figure clad in black emerged from the shadows, their face obscured by a hood. The air was heavy with tension as Titus sensed an ulterior motive behind the meeting. "You're getting old," the figure stated matter-of-factly, handing Titus a small folder containing classified documents. "Time for you to retire."

Titus's instincts kicked in, and he instinctively scanned his surroundings, searching for potential escape routes or hidden threats. But the figure remained stationary, its presence unnervingly calm. "What do these documents mean?" Titus asked gruffly.

The figure hesitated before responding, "They reveal your existence to a global audience. Your skills have been shared among powerful organizations and governments, who now seek to recruit you for their own purposes." The words hung in the air like a threat.

Titus's face hardened as he realized that his anonymity was about to be shattered forever. Without hesitation, he turned on his heel and stormed out of Café Kvarn, leaving the mysterious figure to ponder its next move. As Titus vanished into the night, a faint whisper echoed through the city: "The Wolf is Loose."
