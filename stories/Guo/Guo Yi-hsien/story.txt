Guo Yi-hsien stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, her eyes scanning the crowded market stalls for any sign of trouble. As a renowned detective in modern-day Taiwan, she had seen it all – from petty theft to high-stakes corruption.

A soft voice called out to her, "Ms. Guo Yi-hsien?" She turned to see a young woman with a worried expression and a small package clutched in her hand.

"Can I help you?" Guo Yi-hsien asked, her tone firm but polite.

The woman hesitated before handing over the package. It was a small, intricately carved wooden box adorned with ancient symbols. "This belongs to my sister," she explained. "She was a historian, and she's gone missing."

Guo Yi-hsien took the box, her fingers tracing the intricate carvings. She recognized some of the symbols as belonging to an ancient Taiwanese tribe, thought to be extinct for centuries.

"Tell me more about your sister," Guo Yi-hsien said, leading the woman to a nearby café.

The woman, whose name was Mei, explained that her sister had been researching the tribe's history and cultural practices. She had become increasingly reclusive in the days leading up to her disappearance.

Guo Yi-hsien's mind began to piece together the clues. She knew that the Taiwanese government had made efforts to erase the tribe's existence from historical records, fearing their unique culture would be seen as a threat to modern society.

"This box is more than just a family heirloom," Guo Yi-hsien said, her eyes locked onto Mei's. "It may hold secrets about your sister's disappearance."

Mei nodded, determination etched on her face. Together, they vowed to uncover the truth behind Guo Yi-hsien's missing sister and the mysterious wooden box that held their family's legacy.

As they left the café, Guo Yi-hsien felt a sense of purpose wash over her. She knew that this case would be different – one that required more than just detective work; it demanded justice for an ancient tribe and its people.
