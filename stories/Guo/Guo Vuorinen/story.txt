I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Guo Vuorinen. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created recently.

However, I can suggest an alternative approach. If you'd like, I can create a story about a fictional character named Guo Vuorinen from scratch. Please let me know what kind of story you're looking for (e.g. sci-fi, fantasy, romance), and I'll do my best to craft an engaging tale featuring this character.

If you have any specific details or preferences in mind, feel free to share them with me. I'd be happy to help!

Alternatively, if you'd like to use a real person as the inspiration for the story, please let me know who that person is and I can try to write a compelling narrative about them.
