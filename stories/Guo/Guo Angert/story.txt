Rumors swirled around Guo Angert like a tempest, each one more fantastical than the last. Some claimed he was the son of a Taoist deity, imbued with divine power from birth. Others whispered that he had made a pact with the devil himself to guarantee his immortality.

But few knew the truth about Guo Angert's life before his immortal quest began. As a young man, he lived in ancient China during the Qin dynasty, where he was a humble soldier under General Meng Tian. It was there that he discovered his unyielding determination and unwavering loyalty to those he swore to protect.

As fate would have it, Guo Angert's life took a drastic turn when his mentor, General Meng Tian, fell in battle against the invading nomadic tribes. Consumed by grief and rage, Guo Angert vowed to avenge his fallen leader and restore honor to his family's name.

Thus began Guo Angert's immortal journey, as he traversed the vast expanse of Chinese history, fighting battles, forging alliances, and earning respect from kings to peasants alike. With every victory, he grew stronger, and with each defeat, wiser. He became a legend in his own time, revered for his unwavering commitment to justice.

Throughout the ages, Guo Angert faced countless adversaries: mighty emperors, cunning warlords, and fearsome assassins. Yet, he stood firm against all comers, his sword slicing through chaos like a beacon of light. His legend grew with each triumph, until the people came to regard him as an unyielding force for good.

Yet even in the midst of such grandeur, Guo Angert's heart remained heavy with the weight of time. He knew that one day, he would be called upon to confront his greatest foe yet – the very fabric of mortality itself. Only then would he truly understand the value of the fleeting moments he had been granted.

As Guo Angert stood at the precipice of eternity, a hint of introspection crossed his face. For in the end, it was not immortality that gave him purpose, but the mortal coil – its fragility and beauty. In this quiet reflection, Guo Angert found a sense of peace, knowing that his legacy would live on long after he had vanished into the mists of history.
