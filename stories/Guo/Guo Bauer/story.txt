The rain poured down upon Shanghai, casting a melancholy veil over the city. Amidst this gloomy backdrop, Guo Bauer stood atop the Bund, his eyes lost in thought. His mind was consumed by the memories of the past, like wisps of smoke disappearing into the mist.

Bauer, once a celebrated detective, had seen it all - from the glittering heights of wealth and power to the darkest depths of human depravity. But after solving the infamous "Moonlit Necklace" case five years ago, Bauer's passion for detection began to wane. The thrill was gone, replaced by an unshakeable feeling of emptiness.

As he gazed out at the Shanghai skyline, Bauer couldn't help but think of his mentor, Qian Shui. A legendary detective in her own right, she had taught Bauer everything he knew and more. Her words echoed in his mind: "A good detective must never stop questioning." But Bauer's questions had grown stagnant, like a stagnant pond.

Just then, a gust of wind swept the area, carrying with it a small piece of paper that fluttered down to Bauers feet. It was an invitation, hastily scribbled on the back of a business card. "Meet me at Xintiandi tonight. Come alone." The words were unsigned, but Bauer knew who might have written them.

Without hesitation, Bauer descended from his perch and began to make his way through the crowded streets. He had long since abandoned his life as a detective, but some part of him still yearned for the rush of adrenaline that came with solving a case. As he walked, the rain slowed to a gentle patter, like a lullaby.

Upon arriving at Xintiandi, Bauer was greeted by an enigmatic figure clad in a long coat and fedora. The woman handed him a small package, her eyes gleaming with a hint of mischief. "For you, Guo," she said, before disappearing into the night.

Bauer unwrapped the package to reveal a small notebook, adorned with intricate drawings of Shanghai's streets and alleys. A note was tucked inside, reading: "It seems your questions are not stagnant after all." Bauer smiled, a sense of excitement stirring within him once more. The game was afoot.
