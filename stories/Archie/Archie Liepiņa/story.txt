I couldn't find any information on a person named Archie Liepiņa. It's possible that this is a fictional character or someone who is not well-known.

However, I can suggest some alternative characters:

* Archie Andrews: The main protagonist of the popular comic book series "Archie."
* Arlo Liepiņa: A Latvian actor and singer who has won several awards for his work in film and television.
* Alex Liepiņa: A Lithuanian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder.

If you could provide more context or information about the character Archie Liepiņa, I may be able to help you write a story about him.
