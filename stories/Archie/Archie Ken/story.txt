Archie Kenneth was a man with a mysterious past. He had always been shrouded in secrecy, and those who knew him barely scratched the surface. His colleagues at Smithson & Co., a prestigious consulting firm, were no exception.

As he sat at his desk, sipping his morning coffee, Archie's mind wandered to the countless hours he spent away from the office. Traveling the world, immersing himself in different cultures, and learning new languages. People often assumed he was a globetrotter, but only scratched the surface. In reality, Archie was running from something.

His eyes narrowed as he gazed out the window, watching as people bustled about on the busy street below. He couldn't shake the feeling that someone was following him. It wasn't paranoia; it was intuition. A nagging sense that his past was closing in around him.

Archie's phone buzzed, breaking the spell. His assistant, Emily, had a message for him. "Call from an unknown number," she read aloud. Archie hesitated before answering.

"Hello?" he said into the receiver, his voice firm but guarded.

"I'm looking for you, Archie Kenneth," a low, gravelly voice replied. "I know your true name is Elijah James."

Archie's grip on the phone tightened. Who was this person? And how did they know?

"You're not who I thought you were," Emily interrupted from behind him, confusion etched on her face.

The line went dead. Archie slammed down the receiver, his mind reeling with possibilities. He rose from his chair, pacing around the office as if searching for answers in the walls themselves.

In that moment, he knew he had to be more careful. He couldn't stay in one place for too long. The world was a big place, but Archie's secrets were even bigger.

With a sense of determination, he headed out of the office, disappearing into the crowd below. As he vanished from view, Emily turned to him with a puzzled expression. "Where are you going?" she asked, a hint of unease in her voice.

Archie smiled faintly, his eyes never leaving hers. "Just getting some fresh air," he said, before disappearing into the throngs of people, carrying the weight of his secrets with him like a burden.
