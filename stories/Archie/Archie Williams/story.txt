Archie Williams sat on the edge of his bed, staring blankly at the wall as he replayed the argument with his best friend, Alex, in his head. They had been inseparable since childhood, but lately, it seemed like every conversation ended in a heated exchange.

As he thought back to their latest blowout, Archie couldn't help but feel frustrated. Why did they always have to fight? He and Alex were like two sides of the same coin - one side was optimistic and adventurous, while the other was cautious and reserved.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was his roommate, Mike. "Hey, man, what's up?" Mike asked, noticing Archie's far-off gaze. "You've been pretty quiet all day."

Archie sighed and rubbed his temples. "I just had a huge argument with Alex," he admitted. "We're not speaking to each other right now."

Mike nodded sympathetically. "Yeah, I know how that feels," he said. "But sometimes you gotta take a step back and calm down before things get out of hand."

Archie took a deep breath and nodded in agreement. Mike was always the voice of reason in their group of friends.

As they chatted, Archie's mind began to wander. He had always been the type of person who prioritized his relationships above all else. His full name was Archibald Wilson Williams, and he prided himself on being a good friend and son. But lately, it seemed like he was losing himself in the process.

Just then, Mike interrupted his thoughts. "Hey, want to grab some dinner with us? We can talk about something other than Alex for a change."

Archie smiled, feeling a glimmer of hope. Maybe tonight wouldn't be so bad after all. As they walked out of the apartment and into the warm evening air, Archie felt a sense of peace wash over him.

For once, he wasn't thinking about his argument with Alex or stressing about what was wrong in his life. He just knew that he had good friends by his side, and for that, he was grateful.

As they sat down at the table, Mike raised an eyebrow at Archie's name tag on his jacket. "Hey, Wilson, you're a real charmer," he teased.

Archie rolled his eyes, laughing. "Yeah, yeah, I get it."
