Archie Kozłowski was not your average detective. With his rugged, weathered face and wild gray hair, he looked like he'd been through hell and back again. His piercing blue eyes seemed to bore into those he questioned, as if daring them to lie.

A former cop from Chicago, Archie had traded in his badge for a quieter life in rural Ohio, where the only crime was usually theft of the local farmer's prized prize-winning pumpkins. Still, the itch to solve never really went away, and Archie found himself drawn into the world of amateur sleuthing whenever he could.

One sunny afternoon, as Archie was tinkering with his trusty old Ford pickup in the driveway, a sleek black limousine rolled up, spewing out a cloud of dignified smoke. A harried-looking woman emerged, frantically consulting her phone and muttering something about "time" and "priority."

"What can I do for you?" Archie asked gruffly, wiping his hands on a grease-stained rag.

"I'm looking for the local historian," the woman said, not even glancing at him. "Someone named Henry Wilson. Can you find him?"

Archie's curiosity was piqued. "Who are you and why do you need Henry Wilson?"

"My name is Emily Grant, and I represent a private... organization that requires his expertise. He's been conducting research on local history for years."

As Archie scribbled down some notes on an old notepad, he noticed a piece of paper stuck to the bottom of the limousine's rear tire: "Meet me at Wisteria Drive tonight, midnight. Come alone." A chill ran down his spine.

Emily, oblivious to Archie's growing unease, continued to explain that Henry Wilson had stumbled upon something big – a long-buried secret that threatened to upend the very fabric of their quaint town.

Archie's instincts told him this was more than just a simple mystery. Something fishy was going on in Wisteria Drive tonight.

As he watched Emily drive off, Archie shook his head and muttered to himself: "Looks like I've got myself another case."

With a deep breath, he shouldered the toolbox, fired up the old Ford, and set off for the long ride ahead – into the dark heart of Wisteria Drive.
