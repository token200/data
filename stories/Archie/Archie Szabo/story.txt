Archie Szabo stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit café, shaking the water from her hair. She had just finished a long day of surveillance work for MI6, following a lead on a high-stakes arms deal. Her full name was still etched in her mind - Agnes Szabó - but she preferred to go by Archie.

As she waited for her coffee, her eyes scanned the room, taking in the eclectic mix of patrons. There was the businessman sipping on a latte, his phone buzzing with every text from his assistant; the young artist sketching out her next piece; and the lone figure huddled in the corner, nursing a whiskey.

Archie's gaze landed on the stranger, and she felt a shiver run down her spine. She had been watching him for weeks, tracking his movements through the crowded streets of London. He was always careful, always covered - but there was something about him that didn't add up.

As she waited for her coffee to arrive, Archie pulled out her phone and checked the time. She still had a few minutes before her next contact - a source who claimed to have information on the arms deal. She took a sip of her own lukewarm coffee, feeling the bitter taste in her mouth.

Just then, the stranger stood up from his seat and began to make his way towards Archie. Their eyes met across the room, and for a moment, they just stared at each other. Archie felt a spark of tension, but she kept her cool, her training kicking in.

"Mind if I join you?" the stranger asked, his voice low and smooth. Archie shook her head, taking a seat next to him. "I'm looking for a drink," he said, his eyes locked on hers. Archie knew that look - it was the same one she had seen in her mirror every morning since she joined MI6.

She raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite herself. "What kind of drink?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. The stranger smiled, and Archie felt her heart skip a beat. She knew that smile - it was one of the few things she recognized in this stranger, this mysterious figure who seemed to hold all the cards.

"I'll have what you're having," he said, his eyes never leaving hers.
