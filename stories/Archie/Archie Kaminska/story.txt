Archie Kaminska was known for his mischievous grin and quick wit. As the leader of the group of friends who called themselves "The Wanderers," he had a way of pulling people together like no one else could.

Full name Archie Konstantinov Kaminska, with a dash of Eastern European flair in his surname, Archie was the glue that held The Wanderers' chaotic adventures together.
