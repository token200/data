Lilly Dubois stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. It was a far cry from the high-end hotels she'd grown accustomed to in Paris, but it suited her mood – one of restlessness.

She had left behind the glamour of fashion to pursue a new passion: taxidermy. Lilly's fingers itched to get back to work, to put her own unique touch on the latest specimen. But for now, she needed a break.

The small town of Willow Creek was everything Lilly wasn't – unpolished, genuine, and full of character. She'd heard whispers of the town's eccentric residents and couldn't resist the allure.

As she made her way through the station, Lilly's gaze landed on a small shop tucked away in a corner. "Mae's Oddities" read the sign above the door. Mae, the proprietor, was known for her extensive collection of odd trinkets and – rumor had it – even more unusual specimens.

Lilly pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside, greeted by the scent of old books and dust. The air was thick with curiosity, and Lilly felt a thrill run through her veins.

"Welcome to Mae's," the proprietor said, a wry smile spreading across her face. "I've been expecting you."

Lilly raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "Expecting me?"

Mae nodded toward a shelf lined with glass jars containing an assortment of bizarre creatures: a stuffed owl with mismatched eyes, a deer head perched atop a velvet cushion.

"This is where I keep the ones that need... extra care," Mae said, her voice low and conspiratorial. "I hear you're quite skilled at coaxing life from the dead."

Lilly's cheeks flushed, but she couldn't help smiling. "Perhaps."

Mae chuckled, beckoning Lilly closer. "Well, let's see what we can work with. I've got a few specimens that could use your touch."

And so, Lilly spent the next few weeks in Willow Creek, learning from Mae and experimenting with her own techniques. The town's eccentricities seeped into her skin, and she began to feel at home.

For the first time since leaving Paris, Lilly Dubois felt truly herself – a little rough around the edges, but full of life.
