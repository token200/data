One evening, as Lilly was preparing for a highly anticipated exhibition at a prestigious gallery, she received an unexpected visit from her estranged sister, Sophia. The two had been at odds for years, but Lilly's warm demeanor and genuine interest in Sophia's life quickly put her sister at ease.

As they sipped champagne and admired the latest pieces from Lilly's collection, Sophia revealed that she had recently discovered a hidden talent of her own - photography. Enchanted by the idea of joining forces with her sister, Sophia asked Lilly if she could assist her with her debut show.

Lilly, always one to support her loved ones, enthusiastically agreed and spent the next few days mentoring Sophia through the process. Together, they selected frames, edited prints, and curated a selection of Sophia's most striking images for inclusion in the exhibition.
