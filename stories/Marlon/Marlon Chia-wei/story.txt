Marlon Chia-wei was a man consumed by his work. As the CEO of a small tech firm in Taipei, he spent every waking moment perfecting his company's innovative AI-powered software. His colleagues often joked that Marlon was glued to his chair, never taking a break or leaving the office.

But it wasn't all bad. Marlon's tireless efforts had earned him the nickname "The Whiz Kid" among the startup scene in Taipei. Investors and clients alike revered his genius-level intellect and razor-sharp strategic thinking.

Despite his success, Marlon struggled with loneliness. He had a hard time connecting with people outside of work, too afraid to let anyone get too close. His few friendships were shallow and surface-level, leaving him feeling isolated even when surrounded by others.

One day, while working late on a new project, Marlon received an unexpected visit from his grandmother, Ah-Ma. She had flown all the way from rural Taiwan to spend the night with her grandson. At first, Marlon was resistant to the interruption, but as soon as Ah-Ma sat down in front of him and began to offer steaming bowls of hot rice and noodles, he knew he couldn't shake her off.

Over dinner, Ah-Ma regaled Marlon with stories of her childhood growing up in Taiwan. She spoke of traditional festivals and family gatherings, of the way the sun rose over the rice fields and set behind the mountains. For the first time in years, Marlon felt a pang of nostalgia, a sense of connection to something beyond his high-tech world.

Ah-Ma's presence also brought out a side of Marlon he had long suppressed â€“ his love of traditional Taiwanese music. As they sat together listening to the wailing saxophones and percussion of a local band, Marlon found himself tapping his foot along with the beat.

As the night drew to a close, Ah-Ma gently guided Marlon towards his laptop and encouraged him to put in some work on the project he'd been putting off. As Marlon reluctantly began typing away, he felt an odd sense of peace settle over him. Maybe, just maybe, it was time for him to strike a better balance between work and life.

As Ah-Ma prepared to leave the next morning, she gave Marlon a warm smile and whispered, "Remember, Ah Chia-wei, family is everything. Don't let technology take away from what truly matters."
