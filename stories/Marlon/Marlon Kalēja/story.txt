Marlon Kalēja was a name that whispered tales of adventure and intrigue in the streets of Tokyo. A renowned treasure hunter with an uncanny ability to sniff out hidden riches, Marlon's reputation had grown like a myth among the city's underworld.

Rumors swirled about his exploits: from discovering lost artifacts in ancient temples to unearthing forgotten relics in the depths of the ocean.
