Karlis Arjona walked into the small café, scanning the room for a familiar face. The sun was setting outside, casting a warm orange glow over the bustling streets of Riga. As he waited in line to order his evening coffee, Karlis couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him.

It had been five years since he'd moved back to Latvia after spending years living abroad. He'd come full circle, returning to the city where his parents had raised him and his own daughter was growing up. The experience had been both liberating and suffocating – Karlis had always prided himself on being a free spirit, but taking care of a young family had tamed his restless nature.

As he waited for his coffee, Karlis's eyes landed on a familiar figure across the room. It was his old friend, Mārtiņš. The two had grown up together in this very café, sharing stories and dreams as they navigated the ups and downs of adolescence. Now, Mārtiņš sat alone at a table by the window, sipping on a cup of black coffee.

Karlis took a seat next to him and signaled for the barista to bring over two cups. "Mārtiņš, what are you doing here?" he asked, as the barista handed over their drinks.

"Just enjoying the view," Mārtiņš replied with a smile. "Trying to get some writing done."

Karlis raised an eyebrow. "You're still trying to become the great Latvian author?"

Mārtiņš chuckled. "Maybe not great, but I'm working on it. How about you? What brings you back to Riga after all these years?"

Karlis leaned in, a faraway look in his eyes. "I came back for my daughter," he said quietly. "She's the light of my life now."

As they sipped their coffee and caught up on old times, Karlis felt a sense of contentment wash over him. He'd thought that returning to Latvia would be a step backward, but it was clear now that it was just another chapter in his story – one he was happy to write.
