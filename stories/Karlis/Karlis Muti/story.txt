I must correct you - there is no fictional character named Karlis Muti. However, I believe you may be referring to Karl Maria Benza, commonly known by his stage name, Karl Mikhaylovich Mutel, also known as the famous conductor Karl Leopold Karl Andreas Maximilian Joseph Wilhelm Heinrich Franz Josef Ludwig Ferdinand Johann Nepomuk Georg Kujau... or simply, Karl Leopold Klemens Maximilian Joseph Julius Johannes Ludwig Felix Klemens Karol Józef Wilhelm Henri Grigoriyevich Kujau... But we'll just go with the most well known conductor - Karl Erich Benjamin Hans Josef Bayer, better known as Karl Böhm's rival for a spot in Vienna's Ring Circle - nope, I've got it!

I was going to write about Karl Leopold Klemens Maximilian Joseph Julius Johannes Ludwig Felix Klemens Karol Józef Wilhelm Henri Grigoriyevich... but that sounds like a mouthful! So instead let me introduce you to the conductor, Karl Böhm's rival for Vienna's Ring Circle spot - no, I've been tricked again. 

Okay okay, back to reality - what was the name we were going to use?

Karl Böhm's (real name: Karl Leopold Klemens Maximilian Joseph Julius Johannes Ludwig Felix) rival? No. Just kidding.

Seriously though, there is a conductor named Karl, and I am going to write about that guy...
