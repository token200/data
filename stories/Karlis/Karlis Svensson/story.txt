Karlis Svensson stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. He had been traveling for days, fleeing the troubles that had followed him from his hometown in Sweden. As he made his way through the empty terminal, a familiar voice called out to him.

"Karlis Svensson!"

He spun around, his heart skipping a beat as he locked eyes with an old friend, Lars. They had grown up together on the same streets of Stockholm, and Lars had been one of the few people Karlis could trust back then.

"What are you doing here?" Karlis asked, taking a seat next to Lars on the bench.

"I heard rumors of your troubles," Lars replied, his expression serious. "I came to offer my help. You can't run forever, Karlis."

Karlis sighed, rubbing his tired eyes. He had been hiding for so long, always looking over his shoulder, waiting for the other shoe to drop. But he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched, that someone was closing in on him.

Lars handed him a small package. "This came for you," he said. "From an old acquaintance."

Karlis opened it, revealing a note with a single sentence: "Meet me at the old windmill on the outskirts of town at midnight. Come alone." The words sent a shiver down his spine. Who was behind this? And what did they want from him?

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the station, Karlis knew he had to make a decision. He could stay hidden forever, or take a chance and face whatever lay ahead. With a deep breath, he stood up, his eyes locked on Lars.

"Thanks for coming," he said. "I'll be in touch."

Lars nodded, and together they watched as the train pulled away from the station, carrying Karlis Svensson further into the unknown.
