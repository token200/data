One fateful evening, Karlis Girace strolled into a high-stakes poker game at the luxurious Bellvue Hotel, his tailored tuxedo and slicked-back hair commanding attention from the assembled patrons.

The final hand revealed Karlis Girace's true identity: he was the notorious thief and forger known as 'Le Fantôme' (The Ghost).
