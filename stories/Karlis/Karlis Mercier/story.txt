Karlis Mercier stepped off the train and onto the platform, his bright blue eyes scanning the crowded station. He was in Lyon, France, for a conference on medieval history, and he had spent months preparing for it. As a professor of history at the University of Latvia, Karlis had always been fascinated by the cultural exchange between Europe's East and West during the Middle Ages.

As he made his way through the throng of people, Karlis felt a sense of excitement wash over him. He was looking forward to meeting some of the leading experts in the field, including Dr. Sophia Patel, whose work on medieval trade routes had been influential in his own research. He pulled out his notebook and began to review his presentation for the conference, which he would be delivering later that day.

Karlis's thoughts turned to his wife, Laura, who was waiting for him at a nearby café. They had met while Karlis was teaching at a university in Germany, and she had been a graduate student in art history. After their marriage, she had joined him on the road, accompanying him to conferences and sharing her insights on the cultural artifacts he encountered.

As he walked into the café, Laura looked up from her book and smiled. "Hey, mon amour," she said, using the French term of endearment that Karlis loved. They hugged, and Laura asked about his presentation, listening intently as Karlis discussed his ideas on medieval trade routes. She was always supportive, even when he got too caught up in his work.

After a while, they decided to grab some lunch together, sitting down at a small table by the window. Over sandwiches and coffee, they talked about everything from their research projects to their plans for the future. Karlis felt grateful for Laura's presence in his life, and he knew that she was just as happy to be there for him.

The conference began soon after lunch, and Karlis took his place at the podium to deliver his presentation. As he spoke, he glanced over at Laura, who was watching from the back of the room with a proud smile on her face.
