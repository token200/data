Dev Wagner stepped out of his worn leather jacket, letting the warmth of the Los Angeles sun wash over him. He stretched, arching his back in a languid movement that belied the tension coiled within him.

As a former hitman and assassin, Dev had seen his fair share of darkness. But since leaving the trade, he'd found solace in running his own independent investigation firm. The quiet life was a far cry from the high-stakes world of organized crime, but it allowed him to keep his skills sharp while staying one step ahead of the shadows.

A knock at the door interrupted Dev's reverie. He crossed the room, opening the door to reveal Emily Wilson, a petite woman with piercing green eyes and an untamed mane of curly brown hair.

"Hey, Em," he said, dropping onto the couch beside her. "What brings you here today?"

Emily slid onto the chair opposite him, setting a battered folder on the coffee table. "Dev, I need your help. My sister's been missing for three days, and I've got nothing to show for it."

Dev's instincts twitched into high gear as he took in Emily's worried expression. He'd dealt with his fair share of disappearances in the past, but there was something about this one that didn't add up.

"What makes you think it's connected to your sister's disappearance?" Dev asked, already knowing the answer.

"The police aren't taking me seriously," Emily spat. "They say she probably just ran off on her own or got mixed up with some bad crowd."

Dev raised an eyebrow. He'd seen that line before â€“ always played on the assumption that a missing person was a victim of circumstance rather than something more sinister.

"I'll take it," he said finally, standing up to grab his jacket. "Where is she?"

Emily handed him a driver's license photo of her sister. Dev studied the image, committing every detail to memory before tucking it into his pocket.

"Let's get to work," he said, already mentally preparing for the worst-case scenario.

As they set out into the city, Dev couldn't shake the feeling that this case was going to be different from the rest. There was something about Emily's determination and Emily's sister that resonated with him on a deep level.

The sun beat down on them as they navigated the crowded streets, their eyes scanning for any sign of trouble. Dev knew that in his world, trouble usually showed up sooner rather than later.

But today, he had a feeling, was going to be different.

"Keep your eyes peeled," he whispered to Emily, as they disappeared into the sea of strangers.
