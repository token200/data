In the bustling streets of Renaissance-era Florence, a young woman named Valentina Visconti stood out from the crowd.

Her full name, Valentina Visconti, was whispered in awe by the nobles and merchants who knew her.

Valentina's rise to prominence began when she caught the eye of the handsome and dashing Lorenzo de' Medici. The powerful patron and leader of Florence saw great potential in the young Visconti, and he took her under his wing, teaching her the intricacies of politics and statecraft.
