Valentina Thomas was known for her sharp wit and quick tongue, but beneath her tough exterior lay a heart of gold. As the owner of the popular "Tina's Tavern," a dive bar on the outskirts of town, she had a reputation for being fiercely protective of those she cared about.

It was on one such evening that Valentina found herself in a precarious situation. Her best friend and closest confidant, Rachel, had just walked into the tavern looking pale and shaken. She slumped onto the stool next to Valentina, ordering a whiskey on the rocks without even looking up.

"What's wrong, Rach?" Valentina asked, concern etched on her face. Rachel hesitated before speaking in hushed tones about the strange occurrences that had been happening around town. People had gone missing, and those who returned were...different. As if something was inside them now, watching them with cold, calculating eyes.

Valentina's grip on the stool tightened as she listened intently to Rachel's tale. She knew a thing or two about being watched; after all, it seemed like every shady character in town had an eye on her and hers alone.

As the night wore on, Valentina grew more determined than ever to uncover the truth behind the sinister occurrences. She knew it wouldn't be easy, but she was ready for whatever lay ahead.

With Rachel by her side, Valentina strode into the abandoned mill, ready to face whatever darkness lurked within its crumbling walls. She pushed aside the cobwebs and stepped inside, calling out in a voice that echoed off the steel beams. "Hello? Is anyone here?"

There was no answer.

Valentina's eyes scanned the shadows, her hand resting on the grip of her gun. Suddenly, she felt a presence behind her, watching her with cold, calculating eyes...
