I couldn't find any information on a historical figure with this name. It's possible that you may be thinking of a different person or mixing and matching names from various emperors in Roman history.

However, I can create a fictional story about a character named Valentina Aurelius Fulvus Boionius Arrius Antoninus Pius:

In the scorching desert town of Cenchreae, a young Valentina Aurelius Fulvus Boionius Arrius Antoninus Pius lived a life shrouded in mystery. Her full name was a tongue-twister to locals, who affectionately called her Valentina for short. The name carried weight, however, as it was rumored that she descended from the illustrious Antonine dynasty.

Valentina's eyes sparkled with a fire that rivaled the stars on clear nights. She possessed an uncanny ability to communicate with animals and harness the power of nature. The desert creatures sensed her presence before she even appeared, often gathering around her in anticipation of her daily rituals.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Valentina would venture into the vast expanse of the Cenchreae oasis. She'd weave a gentle melody on her lyre, using the vibrations to awaken ancient energies within the land. The wind would carry her song, luring lost travelers toward her sanctuary.

One fateful evening, a wounded merchant stumbled upon the oasis. His exhausted body trembled with a strange fever, and his visions were beset by dark omens. Valentina took pity on the stranger and listened intently to his tale of ancient artifacts hidden deep within the desert's labyrinthine passages.

As she poured oil onto her lyre strings, Valentina conjured an ethereal aura around herself. The merchant felt a peculiar calm wash over him as he beheld a vision: a glinting path illuminated by starlight, guiding them toward a forgotten temple dedicated to the gods of the past.

Under Valentina's guidance, they traversed treacherous dunes and hidden pitfalls, relying on her intuitive connection with the desert spirits. As they reached the ancient temple, the merchant felt his fever break, replaced by an unsettling clarity – he had been led here for a purpose greater than himself.

Within the temple's hallowed halls, Valentina revealed that she was more than just a guardian; she was the chosen vessel for an ancient legacy. Her music wove together forgotten knowledge and mystical energies, unlocking secrets hidden beneath the desert sands.

With her powers now amplified, Valentina led the merchant on a perilous quest to reclaim the lost artifacts of his people. As they departed the oasis, the wind whispers tales of their legend – the enigmatic Valentina Aurelius Fulvus Boionius Arrius Antoninus Pius, guardian and guide for those willing to listen.
