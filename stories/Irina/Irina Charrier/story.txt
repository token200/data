Irina Charrier stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the crowded station. She had been in Paris for only a few hours, but already she felt like an outsider. As a Russian émigré, she had left behind everything familiar - her family, her friends, her homeland - to start anew.

Irina's thoughts were consumed by the letter she had received from her brother, Anatoly. He was in trouble, and he needed her help. The Soviet government had cracked down on dissent once again, and Anatoly had been caught up in the crackdown. Irina knew that if she didn't act soon, her brother might be lost forever.

She made her way through the station, weaving past suits and businessmen as they rushed to catch their trains. She had no idea where to start, but she knew she needed to get moving. After a few minutes of navigating the crowded streets, Irina arrived at her small apartment, a tiny studio above a café in the Latin Quarter.

She spent the next hour packing a small suitcase and making a list of contacts who might be able to help her find Anatoly. She had always been a bit of a loner, but she knew that in this city, information was power. And if anyone could provide that information, it was her old friend and fellow émigré, the journalist Viktor Kuznetsov.

Irina hailed a taxi and headed to Viktor's office, located on the outskirts of town. As they sped through the streets, she couldn't help but think about her brother. Anatoly had always been the adventurous type, always pushing the boundaries and taking risks. What had he gotten himself into this time?

Viktor greeted Irina warmly and ushered her into his office. Over a cup of strong black coffee, he began to fill in the blanks about what was happening in Russia. It seemed that Anatoly's troubles went far beyond just being caught up in a crackdown on dissent.

"Irina," Viktor said gravely, "your brother is not just in trouble with the authorities. He's also become involved with some very unsavory characters."

Irina's heart sank, but she steeled herself for what lay ahead. She knew that she would do whatever it took to find Anatoly and bring him home safely. With a newfound sense of determination, Irina began her search for answers in the City of Light.
