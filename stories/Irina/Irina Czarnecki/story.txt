Irina Czarnecki was known for her sharp wit and quick tongue, but few people knew that beneath her tough exterior lay a heart of gold. As a successful event planner in her late 20s, she had built a reputation for delivering unforgettable parties and corporate functions.

She sourced the finest champagne, hired a string quartet, and coordinated with catering companies to create a bespoke menu for each guest's dietary needs.
