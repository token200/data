Despite her success, Irina never forgot her humble beginnings. She continued to draw inspiration from her mother's traditional Russian folk art, incorporating elements of pattern and symbolism into her own work. Her paintings were a testament to the power of tradition and innovation, blending the old with the new in a way that was both timeless and cutting-edge.
