Irina Jhih-hao was a force to be reckoned with in the world of high-stakes poker.

From a young age, she was fascinated by numbers and patterns, which led her to pursue a career in mathematics. Her analytical mind and sharp instincts soon made her a standout player among her peers.

As she entered adulthood, Irina turned her attention to poker, drawn by its unpredictability and the rush of adrenaline that came with each pot won.
