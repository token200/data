Irina Boulanger stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station. She had been away for years, and it showed in the familiar yet faded contours of the place. The same worn wooden benches, the same old-fashioned lamps, everything seemed as it should.

As she made her way to the hotel where she would be staying for a few days, Irina couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia wash over her. This was where she had grown up, where she had learned to paint and to love the colors that danced across her palette.

She checked into the small hotel, and after settling in, made her way down to the restaurant for lunch. The menu was simple, but the food was excellent, and Irina felt a sense of comfort as she ate. She ordered a plate of the local specialties, hoping to relive some of the memories that lingered from her childhood.

As she finished her meal, Irina noticed a young artist sitting across from her, sketching in her notebook. There was something about the way she moved, the fluidity of her strokes and the intensity in her eyes that caught Irina's attention.

"May I?" the young woman asked, as she put down her pencil and smiled at Irina.

Irina nodded, and the two began to talk about art and life. The conversation flowed easily, and before long, they had discovered a shared love of color and light.

"I'm Irina Boulanger," she said, extending her hand to the young woman. "And you are?"

"Léa Dupont," the young woman replied, shaking Irina's hand firmly. "I've always admired your work."

Irina's eyes narrowed slightly, unsure what to make of this admiration. She had never been one for praise or attention. But as she looked into Léa's face, she saw a genuine passion for art that resonated deep within her.

Over the next few days, Irina and Léa spent hours talking and laughing together, sharing stories of their journeys as artists. It was as if the years had melted away, and they were both still children again, playing with colors and light.

As Irina prepared to leave, she felt a sense of gratitude towards this young woman who had seen something in her work that she herself had forgotten.
