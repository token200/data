Safiya Bektemirova stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any signs of life. It had been years since she'd returned to her hometown of Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan. As a young woman, Safiya Bektemirova had left this place behind, chasing dreams of art and culture in the bustling cities of Europe.

But now, with her mother's passing, Safiya Bektemirova felt an inexplicable pull to return to the land of her childhood. She had spent countless hours listening to stories of her ancestors, of the ancient Silk Road that once passed through Ashgabat, and of the majestic Neutrality Arch that dominated the city's skyline.

As she made her way through the station, Safiya Bektemirova was struck by how little things had changed. The same vendors sold the same colorful fabrics and spices, while the same men in traditional suits stood guard at the entrance to the station.

She hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of her family's old apartment building. As they drove through the city, Safiya Bektemirova marveled at the grandiose architecture that seemed to stretch on forever. The buildings were a testament to the country's rich history and its leader, President Berdimuhamedow.

When she arrived at the apartment building, Safiya Bektemirova was greeted by her childhood friends and neighbors, who welcomed her back with open arms. Over steaming cups of tea, they reminisced about old times and shared stories of the changes that had taken place since her departure.

As the sun began to set over Ashgabat, Safiya Bektemirova knew that she had made the right decision in returning home. She felt a sense of peace and belonging wash over her, as if the city was finally hers again. And as she looked out at the majestic Neutrality Arch, Safiya Bektemirova knew that she would never leave this place behind again.
