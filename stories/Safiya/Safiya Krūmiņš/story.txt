**Story:**

Safiya Krūmiņš floated through the cramped corridors of the International Space Station, her eyes fixed on the stars streaming past the portholes. As aLatvian astronaut, she had always dreamed of exploring the cosmos, and now, at 25, she was making history.

Born and raised in Riga, Safiya grew up with a passion for science and technology. She spent countless hours building model rockets and studying the works of Galileo and Einstein. After completing her degree in astrophysics, she was selected to join the European Space Agency's astronaut program.

Safiya's latest mission was to conduct research on black holes, one of the most mysterious phenomena in the universe. As she worked tirelessly in the lab, collecting data and running simulations, Safiya felt a sense of wonder that few people could comprehend.

Her colleagues admired her intelligence and work ethic, but also her quirky sense of humor. On long spacewalks, Safiya would often belt out Latvian folk songs, much to the amusement of her crewmates.

As the days passed, Safiya began to notice something strange about the data she was collecting. The readings seemed to be... off. She couldn't quite put her finger on it, but something didn't feel right.

One night, as she gazed out at the stars, Safiya realized that she had stumbled upon something incredible. A hidden pattern, buried deep within the data, hinted at the presence of an unknown celestial body.

Excited by her discovery, Safiya quickly shared her findings with her team. Together, they pored over the data, running simulations and making calculations. Finally, after hours of intense focus, they confirmed it: Safiya had discovered a new planet, hidden in the depths of the galaxy.

As news of the discovery spread like wildfire, Safiya became an overnight sensation in the scientific community. Her name was on everyone's lips, and she found herself at the center of a media storm.

Despite the fame, Safiya remained humble and grounded. She knew that this was just the beginning of her journey, and she was eager to explore the mysteries of the universe.
