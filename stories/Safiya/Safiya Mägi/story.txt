One day, a renowned food critic from Helsinki stumbled upon Safiya's patisserie while exploring the town's culinary scene. He was immediately captivated by the aroma of freshly baked goods wafting from the door and decided to pay her a visit.

Safiya Mägi welcomed the critic with open arms and offered him a taste of her newest creation: a traditional Estonian pastry filled with lingonberry jam and topped with a crumbly pastry crust. The critic was blown away by the flavors and textures, and Safiya's patisserie soon became the go-to destination for foodies from all over Estonia.
