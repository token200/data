When asked about her inspiration, Safiya would often smile wistfully, her eyes clouding over like the Polish skies on a winter's day. "I paint because it is the only way I can honor my past and hope for a better future," she would say, her voice barely above a whisper.

And so, Safiya Wiśniewski continued to create, driven by an unshakeable faith in the transformative power of art. Her legacy would be that of a testament to resilience, a beacon of light in the darkest corners of life.
