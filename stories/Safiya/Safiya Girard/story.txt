Safiya Girard walked into the small café on the outskirts of town, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She had received an email from her old friend, Leila, inviting her to meet up for coffee and catch up on old times. As she waited in line to order, Safiya's mind wandered back to their college days, when they would spend hours discussing everything from literature to music.

When it was finally her turn to order, Safiya greeted the barista with a warm smile and asked for a cappuccino. She took a seat at the small table by the window, watching as the sun cast its golden light on the bustling street outside. Just then, she saw Leila walk in, spotting Safiya immediately and making her way over.

The two friends hugged warmly, laughing as they exchanged stories about their lives since graduation. Safiya filled Leila in on her new job at a local non-profit organization, where she was working to support underprivileged youth. Leila shared tales of her own adventures, having traveled extensively throughout Europe and Asia. As they sipped their coffee and chatted, Safiya felt grateful for the friendship that had endured despite distance and time.

As they talked, Safiya couldn't help but think about how much she had grown as a person since college. She remembered the late-night study sessions and grueling exams, but also the laughter-filled dorm room gatherings and spontaneous road trips with Leila. The memories came flooding back, and for a moment, it felt like no time had passed at all.

As the afternoon wore on, Safiya and Leila decided to take a walk through the park nearby. They strolled hand in hand, enjoying the fresh air and each other's company. It was as if they were reliving old times, minus the stress of exams and deadlines. For Safiya Girard, being back with her dear friend was exactly what she needed – a reminder that some friendships truly do last a lifetime.
