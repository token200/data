Safiya Neumann stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of her ride. As a freelance journalist, she had grown accustomed to living out of a suitcase, but tonight felt different. Tonight, she was headed back to New York City after a two-week assignment in Budapest.

Safiya Neumann took a deep breath, letting the cool Hungarian air fill her lungs as she consulted her notes for what felt like the hundredth time. Her article on the city's underground art scene was due soon, and she still needed to find that elusive interview with the reclusive street artist known only as "V."

As she waited, Safiya Neumann watched as a young couple strolled hand-in-hand through the station, their laughter carrying through the air. She smiled wistfully, remembering her own college days when love had been on her mind every waking moment.

A soft voice interrupted her reverie. "Excuse me, miss? I'm looking for Safiya Neumann?" A tall, lanky man with a kind smile approached her, holding out a folder filled with papers.

Safiya Neumann's journalist instincts kicked in immediately, and she took the folder from him without a word. "V," she mouthed silently, as he nodded and disappeared into the crowd.

The train finally roared to life, and Safiya Neumann boarded, her mind racing with possibilities. What would V reveal to her about Budapest's vibrant art scene? Would it be the scoop of a lifetime?

As the train rumbled on, Safiya Neumann sat down in the empty seat beside her, pulling out her notebook and pen. She began to transcribe the interview, her handwriting flowing across the page as she pieced together V's words.

It wasn't long before Safiya Neumann had written enough to fill her entire laptop, but she knew there was still more to uncover. The game was afoot, and Safiya Neumann was ready to take on Budapest's art world once again, one interview at a time.
