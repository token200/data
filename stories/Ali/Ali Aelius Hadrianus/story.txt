The sun was setting over the rolling hills of Roman Britain, casting a warm orange glow over the bustling town of Londinium. Amidst the throngs of merchants and soldiers, one man stood out - Ali Aelius Hadrianus, a young patrician with a reputation for bravery and cunning.

Ali had grown up in the shadow of his illustrious ancestor, Emperor Hadrian himself, who had ruled Rome with wisdom and strength. But despite the weight of his family's legacy, Ali had forged his own path, earning a place among the Roman legionnaires who marched across the empire.

As he walked through the town, Ali was met with nods of respect from the locals, who whispered stories of his exploits on the battlefield. He had fought against fierce Celtic warriors in the north, and had even earned a reputation for his skill with the gladius.

But Ali's thoughts were not on conquest or glory - they were on the mysterious package he had received earlier that day. A small, intricately carved box adorned with strange symbols had arrived at his lodgings, accompanied by a cryptic message from an unknown sender.

Curious, Ali had opened the box, revealing a beautifully crafted silver amulet inside. As soon as he touched it, he felt a sudden jolt of energy - and a vision flashed before his eyes, like a flickering candle in the wind.

In the vision, Ali saw himself standing on the banks of a great river, with a figure cloaked in shadows waiting for him on the other side. The figure spoke a single word: "Vesper".

Ali's mind was racing as he tried to make sense of the message. What did it mean? And who had sent it?

As he pondered these questions, Ali noticed a figure watching him from across the street. A woman with piercing green eyes and long, dark hair, dressed in fine silks and jewelry that shone like stars.

Their eyes met, and for an instant, they locked gazes. Then, without a word, the woman vanished into the crowd, leaving Ali to wonder if he had just seen what he thought he saw.

But one thing was certain - his life was about to change forever. The mysterious amulet had set him on a path from which there was no return. And as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the town in shadow, Ali felt an excitement building within him that would drive him to the very limits of his courage and wits.
