After her set at the Comedy Cellar, Ali was mobbed by fans who clamored for selfies and autographs. Her manager, a seasoned industry veteran named Rachel, kept a watchful eye as Ali mingled with her adoring public, fielding questions about everything from her favorite comedians to her take on current events.

Despite her newfound fame, Ali remained true to her roots, always seeking out new ways to express herself and push the boundaries of what was possible in comedy.
