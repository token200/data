Ali Kozłowski stepped off the plane and into the warm Florida sun, his bright blue eyes scanning the airport for any sign of life. As a retired Polish spy, he'd grown accustomed to living on the fringes of society, always looking over his shoulder for the ghosts of his past.

It had been five years since Ali left Poland, leaving behind a trail of secrets and lies that would haunt him for the rest of his days. He'd spent years in prison, serving time for espionage and treason, but had managed to keep his true loyalties hidden from even his fellow inmates.

Now, at 65, Ali had retired to this quiet coastal town, where he worked as a mechanic and kept a low profile. But as he made his way through customs, something felt off.

The agent's eyes lingered on him, and for a moment, Ali thought he'd been spotted. He smiled blandly, trying to appear non-descript, but the agent just raised an eyebrow before waving him through.

Ali breathed a sigh of relief as he collected his luggage and made his way out into the bright sunlight. He knew better than to get caught up in this kind of thing again – not now, not ever.

But as he walked down the beach, feeling the sand between his toes, Ali couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching him. He scanned the crowds, but saw nothing out of the ordinary.

It wasn't until he stumbled upon a small antique shop tucked away in a quiet alleyway that the reality hit him like a ton of bricks. The owner, an old woman with piercing green eyes, beckoned him inside and revealed a small leather box adorned with strange symbols.

"Where did you get this?" Ali asked, his mind racing with possibilities.

The old woman smiled, her eyes glinting with amusement. "I think it belongs to someone who's been hiding in plain sight."

Ali's heart skipped a beat as he opened the box and revealed a photograph of himself, taken decades ago. The caption read: "Agent Kozłowski: Retired".

For a moment, Ali felt like he'd been punched in the gut. Who had sent this? And what did they want from him now?

As he stood there, trying to process it all, the old woman vanished into thin air, leaving behind only the faintest hint of her presence – a small note that read: "The past never stays buried for long."

Ali knew then that his life was about to get a lot more complicated.
