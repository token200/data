Ali Wrobel stepped out of the small caf√© on the corner, wiping the condensation from her coffee-stained mug. She had spent the past hour scribbling notes in a battered notebook, trying to make sense of the peculiar dreams that had been plaguing her for weeks.

As she walked down the street, Ali's eyes scanned the crowded sidewalks, searching for any familiar face. Her best friend, Emily, was supposed to meet her at the park at lunchtime, but so far, there was no sign of her. Ali's stomach growled in anticipation as she wondered what they would have for sandwiches.

Just then, a tall figure emerged from the crowd and fell into step beside her. "Hey, Wrobel! Long time no see," their voice called out. Ali turned to find Jack Harris grinning at her, his eyes crinkling at the corners.

Ali's instincts prickled with unease as she replied warily, "Harris, what are you doing here?" They were an old acquaintance from school, but there was something about him that always made her feel on edge. She quickened her pace to put some distance between them, but Jack kept pace with her easily.

As they walked, Ali found herself opening up to Harris in ways she never had before. He asked questions about her writing and listened intently when she talked, his expression softening in response. For the first time in weeks, Ali felt a sense of ease that wasn't tinged with fear or anxiety.

Eventually, Jack fell silent, letting the silence between them hang like a physical thing. When they reached the park, Ali spotted Emily waiting for her by a bench, looking worried. "Hey, I was starting to think you'd stood me up," Emily said, relief written across her face as she threw her arms around Ali.

As they sat down to eat their sandwiches, Ali realized that sometimes it took a little nudge from an unexpected friend to shake things loose and find clarity again. She glanced at Harris watching them with a neutral expression but felt no ill will - only gratitude for the unexpected conversation that had changed her morning in ways she was still discovering.
