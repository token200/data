Her bakery had become an integral part of Willow Creek's identity, and she was grateful to be a part of it. As she locked up the bakery at the end of each day, Ali couldn't help but smile, knowing that she had made a difference in her beloved town.

Years went by, and Ali continued to innovate and push boundaries. Her bakery remained the heart of Willow Creek, and "Rothbauer's Ruby Roulade" became a legendary treat that people came from far and wide to taste.
