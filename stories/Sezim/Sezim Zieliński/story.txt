Sezim Zieliński stepped into the crowded café, her long, curly hair tied back in a ponytail as she scanned the room for a familiar face. She spotted him by the window, sipping on a cup of coffee and gazing out at the rainy street below.

Sezim Zieliński made her way over to the table, exchanging quiet greetings with the other patrons as she passed. She slid into the seat across from him, dropping her own bag onto the floor with a soft thud.

"Hey," she said, forcing a smile onto her face as he looked up at her. "Long day?"

Sezim Zieliński nodded, taking in the look of exhaustion etched on his features. He was always so put together, even when he'd just gotten out of bed. She, on the other hand, was more of a disheveled mess.

They sat in silence for a moment, sipping their coffee and watching the rain come down outside. Sezim Zieliński felt a sense of comfort wash over her as she looked at him - there was something about his easy smile that made her feel like everything would be okay.

"So," he said finally, breaking the silence. "What's new with you?"

Sezim Zieliński shrugged, feeling a pang of embarrassment at how much of a mess her life had become lately. But she knew she couldn't talk to him about it - not yet, at least. She needed some time to figure things out on her own.

The conversation flowed easily from there, with Sezim Zieliński and her friend chatting about everything from books to music to their shared love of old movies. As the hours passed, the rain showed no signs of letting up outside, but inside, Sezim Zieliński felt like she was finally starting to come out of the fog that had been clinging to her for weeks.

As they finished up their coffee and prepared to leave, Sezim Zieliński reached out and touched his hand. It was a small gesture, but it spoke volumes about how much she appreciated having him in her life - even if he didn't know exactly what was going on behind those piercing green eyes of his.
