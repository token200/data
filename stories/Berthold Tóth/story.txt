Berthold Tóth, a man in his late fifties with a rugged face and a thick grey beard, stood at the edge of the village, gazing out at the vast expanse of the Carpathian Mountains. He had been standing there for what felt like an eternity, lost in thought as the wind rustled through the trees and the sun began to set.

Berthold was a man with a complicated past. Born into a family of poor farmers, he had grown up working from dawn till dusk on their small plot of land. But it was not just his physical labor that defined him; Berthold was also a deeply spiritual person, who felt a deep connection to the natural world.

As a young man, he had been drawn to the local monastery, where he spent many hours studying the teachings of Saint Sava and contemplating the mysteries of the universe. The monks there recognized his gifts and encouraged him to pursue a life of contemplation and service.

But Berthold's journey was not without its challenges. His family needed him on the farm, and he felt a sense of duty to support them. So, after completing his novitiate, he returned to his village and took up the mantle of being a simple farmer once more.

It was during this time that Berthold met his future wife, Kata. She was a young woman from a neighboring village, who had come to live with her aunt in Berthold's village while recovering from a serious illness. The two of them fell deeply in love, and eventually married in a small ceremony surrounded by friends and family.

Berthold and Kata built a happy life together, working on the farm and raising three children of their own. But as they grew older, the demands of farming began to take its toll. Berthold's health started to decline, and he was forced to rely more and more on his son, Mihály, to help with the work.

And yet, even in his old age, Berthold felt a sense of peace wash over him as he stood at the edge of the village, lost in thought. He remembered the words of his favorite monk, Father Silas: "The earth is our mother; we must care for her and honor her in all that we do."

Berthold's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps approaching behind him. It was Mihály, who had been working on a nearby plot of land. He approached his father with a concerned expression.

"Bácsi, what are you doing out here?" he asked, using the affectionate term for "uncle" that was reserved for Berthold's generation.

Berthold turned to face his son, a look of sadness etched on his face. "Just thinking, Mihály," he replied softly. "Wondering about the state of our world."

Mihály nodded sympathetically. He had heard this conversation before – many times, in fact. But he knew that it was not just about politics or economics; Berthold's concerns ran deeper than that.

As they stood there together, watching the sun dip below the horizon, Mihály felt a sense of pride and respect for his father. Berthold may have been old and frail, but his spirit remained unbroken – still connected to the land, still committed to doing what was right.

The two men stood in silence for a few moments longer, until Berthold finally spoke up again. "I want you to take over the farm, Mihály," he said, his voice firm but gentle. "You're the one who's been taking care of it all these years; it's only right that you should be the one to carry on."

Mihály looked at his father in surprise. He had expected this conversation to happen eventually – but not yet. Not when Berthold was still so much a part of their lives.

"Bácsi, I don't know if I'm ready for that," he said hesitantly.

Berthold's eyes sparkled with a hint of mischief. "Nonsense, Mihály! You're more than ready. And besides, it's not just about farming – it's about taking care of our family and our community."

As the stars began to twinkle in the night sky, Berthold leaned on his son for support, feeling the weight of years bearing down upon him. But even as he let go of the reins, he knew that his legacy would live on through Mihály – a young man with a kind heart and a deep love for the land.

Together, they walked back to their home, surrounded by the silence of the mountains and the memories of generations past.
