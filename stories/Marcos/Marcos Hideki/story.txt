Marcos Hideki was a man with a mysterious past, shrouded in secrecy and intrigue. Few people knew much about him beyond his striking features and piercing gaze. He moved through life with an air of confidence that commanded respect, yet remained elusive.

As he walked into the crowded café, the patrons couldn't help but notice Marcos Hideki. His dark hair was perfectly styled, framing his angular face, while his sharp jawline seemed chiseled from granite. The way he carried himself exuded an aura of power and control.

The barista, accustomed to dealing with people who wanted to be seen, barely looked up as Marcos Hideki ordered a black coffee. "Just the usual," she muttered, handing him a steaming cup.

As Marcos Hideki sipped his coffee, his eyes scanned the room, taking in the lively atmosphere. People were laughing and chatting, oblivious to the quiet observer watching from the shadows. He seemed to be waiting for something – or someone – but no one knew what that might be.

Suddenly, a woman with bright pink hair and a bold smile caught his eye. She was seated at a nearby table, typing away on her laptop. Marcos Hideki's gaze lingered on her for several moments before he turned back to his coffee.

The barista chatted with him again, asking about his day. Marcos Hideki smiled wryly, "Just waiting," he replied, before nodding and taking another sip of his coffee.

The woman in pink walked into the café a few minutes later, scanning the room as if searching for someone. Her eyes landed on Marcos Hideki, and she flashed him a warm smile. He returned it, ever so slightly, but remained expressionless.

As she approached his table, he rose to greet her. "Hideki," the woman said, with a hint of familiarity. "It's been too long." They chatted quietly for a while, exchanging small talk and pleasantries. Marcos Hideki listened intently, his eyes never leaving hers, as if searching for something hidden beneath the surface.

The pink-haired woman departed as suddenly as she had arrived, leaving Marcos Hideki alone once more. He finished his coffee in silence, lost in thought. Who was this enigmatic woman, and what did she want with him? Only time would tell, but one thing was certain – Marcos Hideki would be watching, always waiting for the next move to unfold.
