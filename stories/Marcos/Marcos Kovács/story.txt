Marcos Kovács stepped out of his worn leather satchel and surveyed the dimly lit café. The smell of stale coffee and yesterday's cigarettes hung heavy in the air, but it was home to him. He took a seat at the small wooden table by the window, where he could watch the rain-soaked streets of Budapest.

As he ordered his usual – a black coffee with a dash of sugar – a young woman with piercing green eyes walked in, shaking the rain off her coat. She scanned the room, locking eyes with Marcos for a brief moment before moving on. He barely registered her presence, too caught up in his own thoughts.

Kovács was no stranger to the city's underbelly. A former detective turned private investigator, he had seen it all – the corruption, the crime, and the desperation that lurked beneath the surface. His latest case had been a particularly nasty one – a high-society businessman accused of embezzlement.

The woman with green eyes slid into the seat across from him, her gaze never leaving his face. "Mind if I join you?" she asked, her voice husky and confident. Marcos raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself.

"I suppose not," he replied, his Hungarian accent thick and rough around the edges.

As they ordered their coffee, Kovács learned that her name was Szilvia – a journalist investigating the same businessman's dealings. The more she talked, the more Marcos realized that they had been working towards the same goal all along. He offered to help her dig deeper into the case, and in return, she agreed to provide him with some much-needed insight into the city's social elite.

Their conversation flowed easily, like a river meandering through the city streets. Kovács found himself drawn to Szilvia's fire and determination, even as he sensed the danger lurking beneath her surface. As the rain outside intensified, they delved deeper into the case, their partnership forging a tentative bond that would change everything.

For Marcos Kovács, this was just another day in Budapest – one where the city's secrets threatened to swallow him whole. But with Szilvia by his side, he felt a glimmer of hope – that together, they might just uncover the truth behind the businessman's crimes, and expose the darkness that lurked beneath the surface of their beloved city.
