Marcos Wróbel was a man with a mysterious past. Few people knew much about him, and even fewer had seen him smile. He walked into the small café on a rainy afternoon, his long coat dripping water onto the floor. The patrons looked up as he approached the counter, sizing him up.

"Coffee," he said to the barista, his deep voice rumbling through the quiet room. "Black."

The barista nodded and began brewing a pot of coffee. Marcos Wróbel took a seat at the back of the café, watching the rain-soaked pedestrians outside with an air of detachment.

He was known for being elusive, always disappearing without warning when people tried to get close to him. Some said he had connections in the underworld, while others claimed he was hiding from something. The truth remained a mystery.

As the barista handed him his coffee, Marcos Wróbel took a sip and closed his eyes, letting the bitterness wash over him. He didn't say much, but when someone finally broke the silence, he spoke up.

"I'm not looking for trouble," he said to no one in particular. "But I'll take it if it comes."

The patrons exchanged uneasy glances, unsure what to make of Marcos Wróbel's enigmatic words. Some wondered if he was just trying to provoke a reaction, while others thought he might be genuinely afraid.

Regardless, the air in the café shifted ever so slightly as Marcos Wróbel took another sip of his coffee and continued to sit there, watching the rain with an unblinking gaze. People began to lose interest, their conversations dying down as they focused on their own thoughts.

When it was time for him to leave, Marcos Wróbel stood up without a word and walked out into the rainy evening, disappearing into the crowd like always. Some said he was a ghost, while others just shook their heads in amazement at his ability to remain elusive.

Marcos Wróbel's past remained shrouded in mystery, but one thing was certain: this man was not someone you wanted to mess with.
