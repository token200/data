Marcos Virtanen sat alone in his dimly lit apartment, staring at the worn photograph on the coffee table. It was a picture of him as a young man, beaming with pride alongside his siblings and parents during their family's summer vacation to the Finnish wilderness.

The memories came flooding back - the endless days spent exploring the forests, the nights huddled around a crackling campfire, the warmth of his mother's cooking wafting through the cabin. It was a simple life, one that seemed to have vanished like the mist in the morning sun.

Marcos's eyes wandered to the current photograph on his phone - a grainy selfie taken during his last family gathering before he'd left Finland. His siblings were all grown now, their faces etched with lines and wrinkles from years of hard work and laughter. He smiled faintly at himself, wondering what the future held for him.

As a young man, Marcos had always been drawn to music - the melodies that flowed through his veins like the rivers in the Finnish heartland. But after moving abroad, he'd struggled to find his place within the industry. Jobs came and went, but none of them ever truly resonated with him.

The silence was palpable, a physical weight that pressed against Marcos's chest. He felt lost, disconnected from the world around him. His phone buzzed, breaking the stillness - a text from an unknown number: "We need your talent, Marcos."

His heart skipped a beat as he hesitated, unsure if it was just another scam or an authentic opportunity. Slowly, his fingers hovered over the screen, then landed on the reply button.

It seemed that a small record label in Finland had taken notice of his online presence and wanted to sign him to a recording contract. The details were sparse, but something about it felt right - like coming home after years of wandering.

As Marcos sat amidst the silence, he closed his eyes and allowed himself to be transported back to those summer nights spent listening to his mother's stories by the campfire. He smiled softly, envisioning what could come next. With a newfound sense of purpose, he picked up his phone and began crafting his response, one that would set the wheels in motion for an uncertain but promising journey ahead.

The silence was broken once more, this time as the words flowed onto the screen - "Yes".
