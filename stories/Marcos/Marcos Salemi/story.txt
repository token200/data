Marcos Salemi stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of saltwater and creosote oil wafting up from the water's edge. He had returned to his hometown of Santa Marta, Colombia, after years spent wandering the streets of Manhattan.

As a child, Marcos had always been drawn to the ocean. His abuelo, a fisherman, would tell him stories of the sea and its secrets. When he was old enough, Marcos had followed in his footsteps, sailing the Caribbean and learning the ins and outs of the trade. But as he grew older, he found himself restless, yearning for something more.

In New York City, Marcos had become a successful businessman, making a name for himself on Wall Street. He had earned a good living, but it came at a cost. The city's fast-paced rhythm had drained him, leaving him feeling empty and disconnected from his roots.

Now, as he walked through the streets of Santa Marta, Marcos felt a sense of peace wash over him. The air was thick with humidity, and the sounds of laughter and music filled the air. He passed by vendors selling fresh fruit and handicrafts, their colors vibrant against the dull grey buildings.

Marcos made his way to his family's old house on the beach, its wooden porch creaking beneath his feet. His abuela, who had raised him after his parents passed away, was waiting for him in the kitchen, a warm smile spreading across her face.

"Welcome back, m'ijo," she said, embracing him tightly. "I've missed you so much."

Marcos spent the next few weeks adjusting to life in Santa Marta, reconnecting with old friends and making new ones. He began to help out at his family's restaurant, where he had grown up watching his parents cook for customers.

As he worked alongside his abuela, Marcos realized that this was where he belonged. The ocean, the food, the people â€“ it all felt like home. For the first time in years, he felt a sense of purpose and belonging.

Marcos's journey was far from over, but as he watched the sun set over the water, he knew that he had finally found his way back to where he belonged.
