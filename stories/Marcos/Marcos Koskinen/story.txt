Marcos Koskinen, a retired FBI agent, sat in his rocking chair, sipping coffee and staring out at the lake. It was a tranquil scene, one he often escaped to during his time off from the agency.

As a young agent, Koskinen had worked on some of the most high-profile cases in the country, earning him a reputation as one of the best profilers in the business. His keen eye for detail and unparalleled understanding of human psychology made him an invaluable asset to the FBI.

One case that still haunted Koskinen was the infamous "BTK Killer" – Dennis Rader, a serial murderer who had evaded capture for over 30 years. It was on this very lake where Koskinen had spent countless hours studying the killer's letters and taunting notes, trying to unravel the mystery behind his crimes.

Koskinen's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of children playing in the distance. His granddaughter, Emma, had come to visit him for the summer, and he was thrilled to spend time with her. As a single father after his daughter passed away a few years ago, Koskinen cherished every moment with Emma.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the lake, Koskinen stood up and walked down to the water's edge. He dipped his hand into the cool water, feeling the familiar sensation of the ripples beneath. It was moments like these that reminded him of the beauty in life – a stark contrast to the darkness he had faced as an agent.

Just then, Emma appeared at his side, her eyes shining with excitement. "Grandpa, look!" she exclaimed, pointing to a family of ducks swimming in the distance. Koskinen smiled, feeling a sense of peace wash over him.

In that moment, Marcos Koskinen was more than just a retired agent – he was a grandfather, a husband in spirit, and a man who had found solace in the simple pleasures of life. As he watched the ducks glide effortlessly across the lake, he knew he had finally found his true refuge.
