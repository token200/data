Marcos Piatek was a 25-year-old artist who had always been fascinated by the world of street art. Growing up in the vibrant city of New Orleans, he was exposed to the rich cultural heritage of graffiti and murals that seemed to sprout up on every available surface.

After completing his degree in fine arts from the University of New Orleans, Marcos set out to make a name for himself as a street artist.
