Marcos Abelardo "Marcos" Aber was a man of mystery and intrigue. A skilled thief and con artist, he had made a living out of swindling the wealthy elite in the city of Azura. With his chiseled features and piercing green eyes, Marcos had an air of confidence that could charm even the most skeptical of individuals.

Despite his questionable profession, Marcos had a certain code of honor. He only targeted those who had amassed their wealth through dishonest means, making him a sort of vigilante in the shadows. His methods were unorthodox, but he always managed to get away with his scams, leaving behind a trail of confusion and frustration for his marks.

One night, Marcos received an offer from a wealthy socialite named Lady Victoria, who wanted him to steal a valuable diamond necklace from her mansion. She promised a handsome sum of gold and jewels, but Marcos suspected she was trying to test his skills or perhaps set a trap for him.

Intrigued by the challenge, Marcos accepted the job. He spent days casing the mansion, gathering information about Lady Victoria's schedule and security guards. On the night of the heist, he snuck in through a ventilation shaft, avoiding detection as he made his way to the display case.

As he worked to disable the alarms and unlock the case, Marcos couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and liberation. He had always enjoyed the thrill of the chase, and this was his chance to prove himself once again. Finally, he slipped on the necklace and turned to leave, knowing that Lady Victoria would be none the wiser.

With the diamond secure in his pocket, Marcos Aber melted into the night, already planning his next move. He knew it wouldn't be easy, but he was ready for whatever came next. After all, a man with his skills and cunning could always find work in the shadows of Azura's elite.
