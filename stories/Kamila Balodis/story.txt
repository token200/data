Kamila Balodis sat at her desk, staring blankly at the spreadsheet in front of her. As a financial analyst for a large corporation, she was used to crunching numbers and making sense of complex data sets. But today, something felt off.

Just the day before, she had received an email from her mother, revealing that she had been diagnosed with a rare form of dementia. The news hit Kamila like a ton of bricks - her mother was only 60 years old, and this disease could change everything.

Kamila's mind wandered back to her childhood memories of playing in the woods behind their house. Her mother would take her on long walks, teaching her about the different types of trees and flowers that grew there. The sound of her mother's laughter still echoed in her ears.

But as she gazed at the spreadsheet, Kamila felt a sense of disconnection. She was supposed to be working on this report, not lost in memories of her childhood. With a sigh, she refocused on the task at hand.

As she worked, Kamila's thoughts kept drifting back to her mother. What would it be like for her when her mother needed care? Would she even recognize her? The questions swirled in her head like a vortex, pulling her under with their complexity and uncertainty.

Just then, Kamila heard the door to her office open. It was Sarah, her colleague from accounting, who had stopped by to ask for some input on a report. As they chatted, Kamila's mind began to clear, and she found herself smiling at the familiar rhythms of adult conversation.

Sarah noticed that something was off, though. "Hey, are you okay?" she asked softly. "You seem distracted."

Kamila hesitated before answering. She wasn't ready to share her news yet, not with anyone but her immediate family. But there was something about Sarah's kind eyes and gentle tone that made Kamila feel like she could trust her.

"I'm just... thinking a lot today," she said finally, using vague language to hint at the truth without revealing too much.

Sarah nodded sympathetically, understanding that sometimes words weren't enough. As they continued to chat, Kamila felt a sense of gratitude toward this coworker who didn't need explanations or proof - she simply listened with compassion and care.

As the afternoon wore on, Kamila's work slowly took shape again. She finished the report, still lost in thought about her mother's diagnosis, but no longer feeling completely consumed by it. For the first time all day, she felt like herself again.
