Ilze Alsbach stepped into the crowded tavern, her piercing green eyes scanning the room for any sign of her target. As a skilled assassin, she had been hired to eliminate a rival merchant who had been poaching Ilze Alsbach's clients.

She spotted her quarry, Marcellus, sitting at a table in the corner, sipping a mug of ale. Ilze Alsbach's gaze narrowed as she observed his relaxed demeanor, trying to gauge whether he was aware of the danger lurking nearby.

With a quiet whisper, Ilze Alsbach dispatched one of her trained henchmen, who slipped out unnoticed and took up position behind Marcellus. Meanwhile, Ilze Alsbach made her way to the bar, ordering a cup of wine with a practiced smile.

As she waited for her drink to arrive, Ilze Alsbach covertly observed Marcellus, studying his every move. She noticed that he was taking more than usual risks, which suggested that he may have discovered her presence.

Ilze Alsbach's trained ears picked up the faint sound of horse hooves outside, followed by the soft creaking of leather as a nearby patron dismounted and made his way to the tavern door. Her instincts told her that this was a ruse, designed to distract her from Marcellus's location.

Without hesitation, Ilze Alsbach dropped a few coins on the bar and swiftly made her way to the corner where Marcellus sat. As she approached, Ilze Alsbach discreetly signaled to her henchman, who stepped forward to take out Marcellus silently.

Ilze Alsbach stood over Marcellus's unconscious form, taking a moment to survey the aftermath of the scene. The tavern patrons seemed oblivious to the danger that had just unfolded before them. With a practiced air of nonchalance, Ilze Alsbach tucked a small pouch of gold coins into her belt and turned to leave.

As she vanished into the night, Ilze Alsbach knew that this was just another successful mission for one of the most feared assassins in the land - Ilze Alsbach. Her reputation as a deadly and efficient operative had earned her both admiration and fear from those who knew of her skills.
