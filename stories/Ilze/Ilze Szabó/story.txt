Ilze Szabó stepped into the crowded café, scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee and staring out the window. As she approached, he looked up, catching her eye.

"Hey," he said with a nod, gesturing to the empty chair across from him. Ilze Szabó slid into the seat, feeling a sense of comfort wash over her as his eyes crinkled at the corners in a warm smile.

They had met by chance six months ago, bonding over their shared love of old books and long walks in the park. Since then, they'd become inseparable, exploring the city together and sharing secrets with each other. Ilze Szabó couldn't remember the last time she'd spent a night without him by her side.

As they chatted, Ilze Szabó noticed the look of distraction on his face. He was usually so present, so engaged in whatever conversation they were having. But today, he seemed lost in thought.

"What's wrong?" she asked, reaching out to take his hand.

He squeezed it gently. "Just thinking about my past," he said softly. "There are some things I've been trying to forget."

Ilze Szabó nodded understandingly. She knew that look – the one that spoke of hidden scars and unresolved emotions. But she also knew that with him, she could face anything.

She leaned in closer, her voice barely above a whisper. "You don't have to hide from me," she said, her eyes locking onto his. "I'm here for you, no matter what."

Ilze Szabó's gaze softened, and he pulled her into a gentle hug. As they sat there together, wrapped in the quiet of the café, Ilze Szabó felt a sense of peace wash over her. She knew that with him by her side, she could face anything life threw their way.

As they finished their coffee and left the café, hand in hand, Ilze Szabó smiled to herself. She knew that she'd found her person in this stranger-turned-love-of-her-life – someone who made her feel seen and understood, even on the toughest of days.
