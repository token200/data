Ilze Novak sat alone in her small apartment, staring blankly at the wall as the rain poured down outside. A former professional tennis player, Ilze had given up on her dreams of competing at the highest level after a series of disappointing losses and injuries left her unable to bounce back.

Now, at 32, Ilze was trying to find a new sense of purpose in life. She spent most of her days volunteering at a local youth center, coaching young tennis players and sharing her knowledge with the next generation. It wasn't the same thrill as competing on the big stage, but it gave her a sense of fulfillment.

As she sat there, lost in thought, Ilze's mind began to wander back to her tennis career. She remembered the rush of adrenaline as she stepped onto the court, the roar of the crowd, and the feeling of competition that drove her to push herself to be better. But those days were behind her now, and Ilze was determined to make the most of this new chapter.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was one of the young players from the youth center, eager to show off his latest serving technique. Ilze smiled, putting aside her melancholy mood, and welcomed him into the apartment. As they sat down to practice, Ilze couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her. She remembered when she was once in his shoes, full of hope and dreams.

Ilze Novak, the tennis player who had given up on her dreams, watched with pride as the young player's skills improved with each passing minute. She knew that one day he would be competing at the top level, just like she had. And even though Ilze was no longer a part of the game, she took comfort in knowing that her legacy lived on through the next generation.

As the afternoon drew to a close, Ilze walked the young player out of the apartment and back into the rain-soaked streets. She smiled at him, feeling a sense of purpose wash over her. Being an old pro wasn't about being retired; it was about paying it forward, and helping others achieve their own dreams.
