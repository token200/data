Ilze Salamanca was not your typical heroine. She didn't have a sunny disposition or a talent for baking. Instead, she was a force to be reckoned with - a whirlwind of dark hair and piercing green eyes that seemed to see right through you.

As the only daughter of Don Pedro Salamanca, one of the most feared men in Madrid's underworld, Ilze had grown up surrounded by guns, knives, and the constant threat of violence. But despite her father's reputation, Ilze was an outcast among her own kind. She preferred books to guns, and spent more time poring over dusty tomes in the local library than learning the art of combat from her father.

Ilze's love of literature was a source of shame for her family, who saw it as a weakness. But Ilze couldn't help herself - she devoured everything from Tolstoy to Dickens, losing herself in the words and worlds they created.

One day, while exploring the city, Ilze stumbled upon a small, mysterious bookstore tucked away in a forgotten alleyway. The sign above the door read "Libros Olvidados" (Forgotten Books), and Ilze felt an inexplicable pull towards it.

As she browsed the shelves, her eyes landed on a rare edition of Goethe's Faust. Something about the worn leather binding and yellowed pages drew her in, and Ilze knew she had to have it.

Back at her father's mansion, Don Pedro scoffed when Ilze told him of her discovery. "A bookstore for forgotten books?" he sneered. "You'd do better with a rifle, my daughter."

But Ilze refused to be swayed. She spent the rest of the evening surrounded by dusty tomes and crumbling manuscripts, feeling like she had finally found a place where she belonged.

As the night wore on, Ilze's passion for literature grew stronger. For the first time in her life, she felt truly seen - not as Don Pedro's daughter, but as Ilze Salamanca, bookworm and dreamer.

From that day forward, Ilze dedicated herself to collecting forgotten books and sharing their stories with the world. It was a journey that would take her down dark paths and into the heart of danger, but also one that would set her free from the expectations of those around her.

As she vanished into the night, clutching her prized volume of Faust tightly in her hand, Ilze smiled to herself - for once, her family saw her for who she truly was: a keeper of secrets, and a weaver of tales.
