Ilze Kaminska's eyes scanned the dimly lit caf√©, her fingers drumming an impatient rhythm on the tablecloth. She had been waiting for what felt like hours for her contact to arrive, and now she was starting to think it might be a setup.

As a former KGB agent turned freelance journalist, Ilze Kaminska knew how to spot a trap from a mile away. But this one seemed different, almost...personal.

The door swung open and a figure slipped inside, their eyes scanning the room before locking onto Ilze's table. It was Viktor, an old acquaintance from her KGB days.

"Ilze," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "I see you're as cautious as ever."

Ilze raised an eyebrow. "What do you want, Viktor?"

Viktor took a seat across from her, his eyes never leaving hers. "I have information about the Novy Fund scandal," he said, his words dripping with intrigue.

Ilze's ears perked up. The Novy Fund was a massive corruption scheme involving some of Russia's most powerful officials, and she had been sniffing around it for weeks.

"What kind of information?" she asked, her pen poised over her notebook.

Viktor leaned in, his voice barely above a whisper. "I have documents, Ilze Kaminska. Documents that implicate the President himself."

Ilze's heart skipped a beat. This was big. Very big.

She pulled out her phone and dialed a number, her eyes never leaving Viktor's face. As she waited for someone to answer, she couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement. This could be the story of a lifetime.

The person on the other end of the line listened intently as Ilze relayed the information, her voice filled with anticipation. And when they finally hung up, Ilze turned back to Viktor, a smile spreading across her face.

"Thank you, Viktor," she said, her eyes glinting with determination. "You've just given me the scoop of a lifetime."

Viktor nodded, a small smile playing on his lips. "Just be careful, Ilze Kaminska. You're not the only one who's been watching you."
