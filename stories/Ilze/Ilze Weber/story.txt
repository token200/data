Ilze Weber stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the sleepy town for any sign of life. As the last child of a large Estonian family, she had grown accustomed to traveling alone, but this trip felt different. It was 1920, and the world beyond her rural homeland seemed full of promise.

Ilze Weber had always been fascinated by the stories of her grandmother, who spoke of a time when women could vote and own property in their own right. It was a foreign concept to Ilze's generation, but one that she was determined to explore further. She had saved up enough money from her part-time job at the local bakery to attend a summer school for women's rights in Berlin.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Ilze noticed the way people looked at her - with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. Women traveling alone were not common, especially not Estonians. But Ilze Weber was determined to prove herself, to show that even in this patriarchal society, women could make their own decisions.

She arrived at the summer school's headquarters, a small but vibrant community of women from all over Europe. Ilze Weber was immediately swept up in the lively discussions and debates, feeling like she had finally found her place among like-minded individuals. For the first time in her life, she felt truly seen and heard.

Over the next few weeks, Ilze Weber immersed herself in the world of feminism, attending lectures on everything from suffrage to social justice. She met women who had fought for their rights, women who had overcome incredible obstacles to achieve their goals. And she began to see a different future for herself - one where she could vote, own property, and make her own decisions.

Ilze Weber's time in Berlin was short-lived, but its impact on her life would be lasting. She returned home with a newfound sense of purpose, determined to spread the message of women's rights to her community. And though it wouldn't be easy, she knew that she had found her calling - as an advocate for change, and as a beacon of hope for generations to come.
