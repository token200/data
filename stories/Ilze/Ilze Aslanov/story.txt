A brilliant engineer by training, Ilze had always been drawn to the world of technology, where she could unravel the intricacies of machines and find order in chaos.

Despite her impressive skills, Ilze had always struggled with the expectations placed upon her. As a child, she was expected to follow in the footsteps of her family's illustrious legacy, but Ilze had other plans. She rebelled against the traditional roles assigned to women in her community, opting instead for a career that allowed her to think creatively and push boundaries.
