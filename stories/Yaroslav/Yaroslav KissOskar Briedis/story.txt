Yaroslav KissOskar Briedis was a man with a mysterious past. He moved from place to place, never staying in one spot for too long. His occupation as a writer and artist made it easy for him to blend into the crowd, but there were always those who noticed him.

People would often approach him on the street, asking for autographs or stories about his work. But Yaroslav was wary of getting too close to anyone. He kept his emotions locked away behind a mask of calmness and professionalism.

One day, while sitting in a café, sipping a cup of coffee, Yaroslav noticed a young girl staring at him from across the room. She couldn't have been more than 10 years old, with big brown eyes and a mop of curly hair. For a moment, their gazes met, and something strange happened.

Yaroslav felt a spark of recognition, as if he had seen her before. But it was just an illusion. He stood up to leave, but the girl ran over to him, shyly clutching a sketchbook in her hand. "I drew you," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

The sketch was of Yaroslav KissOskar Briedis himself, sitting in a café, with a cup of coffee in front of him. It was almost...accurate. He couldn't help but smile at the girl's enthusiasm and talent.

As the days went by, Yaroslav found himself returning to that café more often, just so he could see her again. The girl would draw him again, each time adding more details and shading to her artwork. She didn't seem to be trying to uncover any secrets about his past, but rather simply enjoying his company.

For the first time in a long while, Yaroslav felt a connection with someone. It was as if he could shed his mask and let his guard down, just for that one person. He began to wonder if maybe, just maybe, he had been running from himself all this time.
