Born into a family of modest means, Yaroslav's natural talent and work ethic quickly earned him a place at the prestigious TechnoTech Institute, where he honed his skills under the guidance of some of the world's top engineers. After graduating at the top of his class, he landed a coveted position at the esteemed construction firm, NovaSpire.

It was here that Yaroslav's true genius began to shine through.
