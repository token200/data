Yaroslav Girard stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the familiar streets of Montreal. He had just returned to Canada after years abroad, and the humid air hit him like a slap in the face. As he walked through the station, he spotted a woman with long, curly brown hair waiting for him by the exit.

"Yaro?" she called out, using his nickname.

He smiled, dropping his bag onto the floor. "Hey, Élise."

Élise Girard was the only person who knew about Yaroslav's complicated past. She had been his best friend since childhood, and now, as a journalist, she was determined to uncover the truth behind his years of wandering the world.

Yaroslav followed her out of the station, into the bright sunlight. They walked side by side through the city streets, passing familiar landmarks: the old church where he used to play hockey, the coffee shop where they shared countless nights talking about their dreams.

"So, what brings you back?" Élise asked, once they reached a quiet corner café.

Yaroslav took a deep breath. "I need a fresh start," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "The past is catching up to me."

Élise raised an eyebrow. "What are you talking about?"

He hesitated, unsure if he should trust her. But something in her eyes told him she was listening, not judging.

"I was involved with some... unsavory people," he began, his words spilling out like sand between his fingers. "Organizations that were supposed to help refugees but ended up exploiting them."

Élise's expression changed from curiosity to concern. "What did you get out of it?"

Yaroslav shook his head. "I didn't realize what I was getting myself into until it was too late."

He took a sip of his coffee, feeling the bitter taste wash over him.

"I'm trying to leave that life behind," he said finally, looking at Élise with pleading eyes. "Can you help me?"

She nodded, her face set in determination. "I'll do everything I can, Yaro."

Yaroslav's heart swelled with gratitude. With Élise by his side, maybe he could finally put the ghosts of his past to rest and start anew.

As they left the café, Yaroslav knew that this was just the beginning. The road ahead would be long and hard, but with Élise as his ally, he felt a glimmer of hope for the first time in years.
