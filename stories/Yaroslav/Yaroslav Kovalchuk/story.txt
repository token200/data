Yaroslav Kovalchuk stepped out of the Moscow Metro, his eyes scanning the crowded platform as he checked his watch for what felt like the hundredth time. He was late for his meeting with the KGB.

As a former KGB agent turned freelance investigator, Yaroslav had a reputation for being one of the best in the business. But tonight's mission was different. Tonight, he was taking on the most powerful and ruthless man in Russia: Viktor Kuznetsov, a former oligarch with a trail of dead bodies and disappeared associates in his wake.

Yaroslav made his way through the crowded station, weaving past pedestrians and avoiding the gaze of the zealous security guards who seemed to be everywhere. He had been watching Viktor's movements for weeks, tracking every move he made, every phone call he took.

Finally, he reached the designated meeting point: a cramped, smoke-filled bar in the depths of the city. Yaroslav spotted Viktor sitting at a table in the corner, his eyes narrowed and his expression sour.

"You're late," Viktor growled, his voice like gravel underfoot. "That's going to cost you."

Yaroslav slid into the chair across from him, his eyes locked on Viktor's face. "I had reason to believe you were involved in a murder," he said, his tone even and detached.

Viktor chuckled, the sound sending shivers down Yaroslav's spine. "You think I'm some kind of monster? You're just a foolish little man, playing hero."

Yaroslav smiled wryly. He had heard that one before. But Viktor was a different story altogether. A ruthless pragmatist who would stop at nothing to get what he wanted.

"You see, Yaroslav," Viktor said, leaning forward, "I have something you want. Something that will make all your problems disappear."

Yaroslav raised an eyebrow. What did Viktor mean? He leaned in, his heart racing with anticipation.

"I have information about a major scandal within the Kremlin," Viktor hissed, his eyes glinting with triumph. "Information that could bring down several high-ranking officials. And I'm willing to share it... for a price."

Yaroslav's mind was racing. This was it â€“ the break he had been waiting for. But at what cost? He knew that once he got involved with Viktor, there was no turning back.

The game was on.
