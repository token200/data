Yaroslav Fernández had always been fascinated by the ancient art of traditional Spanish flamenco music. As a child, he would spend hours listening to his abuela's vinyl records, mesmerized by the passionate foot-stomping and hand-clapping rhythms that seemed to transport him to another world.

As the months passed, Yaroslav's star continued to rise, with performances at major festivals and sold-out tours around the world.
