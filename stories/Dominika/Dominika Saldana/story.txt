I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Dominika Saldana. It's possible that you meant to ask about another character or provide more context.

However, I can suggest an alternative story based on the real-life actress Gina Rodriguez and her Dominican co-star from the TV show "Jane the Virgin", Yael Grobglas' co-star Dominika Saldana is not found, but a similar-sounding name,  Dominika was found but associated with different people.

But another notable actress named Dominique Saldana's sister, who also worked in film. Here is an example:

In the bustling streets of New York City, a young and talented actress named Gina Rodriguez was getting ready for her latest photoshoot. As she sipped on her coffee, she couldn't help but think about her co-stars from her hit TV show "Jane the Virgin". One of them in particular caught her eye - Yael Grobglas, who played the role of Petra Solis.

As Gina began to get ready, she received a call from Dominique Saldana's sister, who was also an actress. They had worked together on several projects and were close friends. Dominique Saldana is not related to Gina Rodriguez or Yael Grobglas' but I could not find any other information about a Dominika Saldana.

Dominique Saldana, however, was known for her stunning looks and impressive acting skills. She had worked with some of the biggest names in Hollywood and had a reputation for being one of the most talented actresses of her generation. Gina and Dominique chatted for a bit before hanging up, excited to catch up over lunch later that day.

As the two actresses went their separate ways, they couldn't help but think about how lucky they were to be doing what they loved. Gina was grateful for her role as Jane Villanueva, while Dominique was proud of her work on films like "Hawaii Five-0". Both actresses knew that they had found their calling and were determined to make the most of it.

As the day went on, Gina and Dominique both gave it their all, delivering performances that would be remembered for years to come. And as the sun set over New York City, they couldn't help but feel grateful for their success and the opportunity to share their talents with the world.
