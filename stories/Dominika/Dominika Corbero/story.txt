Her latest exposé on government corruption had sent shockwaves through the capital, and Dominika was basking in the glory of her success.

As she sat at her desk, typing away on her next big story, her phone rang. It was her editor, demanding to know why she hadn't yet published her findings on the corrupt dealings of a high-ranking official. Dominika smiled sweetly, knowing that her sources were still confirming the evidence they had gathered.

"I'll have it out soon," she promised over the phone, before hanging up and returning to her work. Her assistant poked his head into the room, looking frazzled. "Dominika, there's a problem with the security cameras at the scene of the crime. The footage keeps getting tampered with."

Dominika's eyes narrowed. This was exactly what she had feared – the people in power were desperate to cover their tracks, and they would stop at nothing to do so. She nodded to herself, already thinking of ways to salvage the situation.

As the day wore on, Dominika's determination only grew stronger. She spent hours pouring over the evidence, making connections and asking questions that others might not even think to ask.
