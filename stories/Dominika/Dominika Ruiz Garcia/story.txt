Dominika Ruiz Garcia stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the city skyline as the sun dipped below the horizon. The sounds of car horns and chatter faded into the distance as she let the cool evening breeze wash over her.

As a successful event planner, Dominika was no stranger to chaos, but tonight was different. Tonight was a night for reflection. She had just celebrated her 30th birthday with close friends and family, and now, surrounded by the city lights, she couldn't help but feel like turning back the clock.

Dominika's thoughts drifted to her childhood, growing up in a small town where everyone knew everyone else's business. Her parents, though loving and supportive, had always pushed her to pursue her dreams, no matter how daunting they seemed. And pursue them she did, eventually landing at the top of her field as an event planner.

But with success came pressure, and Dominika found herself juggling work, relationships, and a growing sense of restlessness. She felt like she was losing touch with the things that truly mattered: art, music, the thrill of exploring new places.

As she stood there, lost in thought, Dominika heard the soft sound of footsteps approaching her. Her best friend, Sofia, appeared beside her, bearing a tray of drinks and snacks.

"Hey, girl! I knew you'd be up here somewhere," Sofia said with a grin. "I brought some snacks to help take your mind off things."

Dominika smiled weakly as Sofia handed her a glass of wine. For a moment, they just sat there, watching the stars come out. Then, without a word, Dominika stood up and wrapped her arms around Sofia, holding on tight.

"I'm just feeling really lost right now," she admitted into Sofia's shoulder. "Like I've forgotten what it means to truly live."

Sofia hugged her back. "You haven't forgotten anything, Dominika Ruiz Garcia. You're just growing, that's all."
