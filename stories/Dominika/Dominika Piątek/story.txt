Growing up in a small town in Poland, Dominika's creative outlet was often seen as a necessary escape from the monotony of daily life. Her parents, though not artistic themselves, encouraged her passion for painting and drawing, recognizing the importance of self-expression in their daughter's life.

As she entered adulthood, Dominika's art gained attention from local galleries and collectors. However, it was her bold style and willingness to tackle difficult subjects that truly set her apart.
