One rainy evening, Dominika received an anonymous tip about a high-ranking government official with ties to organized crime. The source claimed that this individual was behind a string of corrupt business deals and embezzlement schemes that spanned across multiple continents.

Dominika's curiosity was piqued, and she decided to pay a visit to her trusted source.
