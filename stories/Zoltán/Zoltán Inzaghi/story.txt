As the evening drew to a close, Zoltán Inzaghi stood before his guests, his chest swelling with pride. He knew that he had found his true home in Budapest, among the people and the food he loved. And as the last diners departed, he smiled to himself, knowing that tomorrow would bring another day of cooking, creating, and sharing the beauty of his culinary art with those who mattered most.
