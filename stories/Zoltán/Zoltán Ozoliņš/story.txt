Zoltán Ozoliņš sat alone in his dimly lit apartment, surrounded by the detritus of a life unlived. The once-promising politician had long since abandoned his ambitions, opting instead to spend his days lost in a haze of booze and regret.

As he gazed out the window, Zoltán's mind wandered back to the early days of his career, when he was a rising star in Latvian politics. He had been the darling of the opposition, speaking truth to power with a fire that seemed to match the passion of the crowd. But that was all so long ago.

Now, as he stared out into the rain-soaked streets, Zoltán felt like a shadow of his former self. His eyes, once bright and full of conviction, had dimmed to a dull gray. His smile, which had once lit up a room, now seemed forced and artificial.

As if sensing his gaze, the wind picked up outside, rustling the leaves on the trees. Zoltán shivered, feeling a chill run down his spine. He remembered the countless times he had promised himself that things would be different tomorrow, but tomorrow never came.

Suddenly, a faint knock at the door interrupted Zoltán's reverie. He rose from his chair, groaning in anticipation of another unwanted visitor. But to his surprise, it was an old friend from his university days, Viktorija.

"Zoltán, my god," Viktorija exclaimed, as she entered the apartment. "You look like you've lost your last marble."

Zoltán shrugged, feeling a twinge of embarrassment. "Just another day in paradise," he replied wryly.

Viktorija laughed, taking a seat on the couch beside him. "I brought something to cheer you up," she said, producing a small box from her bag.

Inside the box was a photograph of Zoltán and Viktorija on their university graduation day, grinning from ear to ear. Zoltán's eyes welled up with tears as he gazed at the image.

"You know what?" Viktorija said, putting a hand on his shoulder. "I think it's time you took that old flame – politics – for another spin."

Zoltán raised an eyebrow, feeling a spark of interest ignite within him. Maybe, just maybe, this was the wake-up call he needed to rekindle the fire that had once driven him.

With Viktorija's words still echoing in his mind, Zoltán Ozoliņš slowly got up from his chair, determination etched on his face for the first time in years. The night had just begun, and it was going to be a long, winding road to redemption – but with Viktorija by his side, he felt ready to take on whatever lay ahead.
