Zoltán Chun-yi stepped into the dimly lit tavern, the familiar scent of smoke and ale wafting up to greet him. He nodded at the bartender, a gruff but kind-hearted man named Gus, as he made his way to the bar.

"Vodka, please," Zoltán said, tossing a few coins onto the counter.

Gus raised an eyebrow. "You know I only give you that much when you're buying."

Zoltán chuckled and slid onto a stool beside the fire crackling in the hearth. The tavern was quiet tonight, with only a handful of patrons scattered about. He recognized most of them - there was Jax, the local blacksmith, sipping on a mug of ale; Elara, the village healer, nursing a cup of tea; and a lone figure huddled in the corner, hood up and face obscured.

The newcomer's eyes flicked towards Zoltán as he took a seat beside him. The air was heavy with tension, but Zoltán barely noticed. He'd seen his fair share of suspicious characters over the years, and it didn't take long to size people out.

"You new around here?" Gus asked, wiping down the bar with a dirty rag.

The hooded figure hesitated before responding in a low, gravelly voice. "I'm looking for information."

Zoltán's ears perked up, intrigued despite himself. He signaled Gus for another round and leaned in closer to the stranger. "What kind of information?"

"Rumors," the figure replied, eyes darting around the room before settling on Zoltán once more. "Whispers of a powerful artifact hidden somewhere in these hills."

Gus snorted. "You mean that old legend about the Dragon's Eye? Ain't nobody got any idea where it is or what it does."

The stranger's gaze snapped back to Gus, a glint of determination flashing in their eyes. Zoltán sensed a fire burning beneath their surface - someone driven by desperation and possibly obsession.

"I'm willing to listen," Zoltán said quietly, the vodka warming his throat as he leaned in closer to the hooded figure.

The stranger's lips curled into a faint smile, before they vanished behind their veil of shadows. "Then I'll tell you this," they whispered. "I've seen it with my own eyes - the Eye is hidden deep within the Dragon's Spine mountains, guarded by an ancient evil and treacherous paths."

Zoltán nodded thoughtfully as Gus served him another shot. This was just the beginning of a long, winding tale, but one thing was certain: he'd be following this stranger's breadcrumbs, no matter where they led.
