Zoltán Ken was a man of mystery and intrigue. A former spy turned private investigator, he had built a reputation for himself as one of the best in the business. His sharp mind and quick reflexes made him a formidable opponent, capable of taking down even the most cunning foes.

As Zoltán Ken walked into the dimly lit bar, he was immediately struck by the air of unease that hung over the patrons. The bartender, a gruff old man with a thick beard, looked up at him and nodded in acknowledgement. "The usual?" he asked, his voice low and gravelly.

Zoltán Ken took a seat at the end of the bar, ordering a whiskey on the rocks as he surveyed the room. He was here to meet someone, but he didn't know who or why. That's when he spotted her - a petite woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She sat alone at a table in the corner, sipping a glass of red wine.

As Zoltán Ken made his way towards her, he couldn't help but feel a sense of intrigue. Who was this mysterious woman, and what did she want from him? He took a seat across from her, ordering another drink as they began to converse.

"My name is not important," the woman said, her voice husky and confident. "What I do is. And I have information that could put you in grave danger."

Zoltán Ken raised an eyebrow, his interest piqued. He had dealt with plenty of femme fatales in his line of work, but there was something about this woman that set him apart. Maybe it was the way she seemed to know exactly what he was thinking, or maybe it was the way her eyes sparkled when she smiled.

"What kind of information?" Zoltán Ken asked, leaning back in his chair as he steepled his fingers together.

The woman leaned forward, her eyes locked intently on his. "I have evidence that could take down some very powerful people," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "But I need someone with your... particular set of skills to help me get it to the right person."

Zoltán Ken raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the challenge. He had dealt with plenty of high-stakes cases before, but this one seemed different. Maybe it was the way the woman seemed to trust him instinctively, or maybe it was just his own curiosity getting the better of him.

Whatever the reason, Zoltán Ken knew that he was in. "I'm in," he said, extending his hand across the table.

The woman took it, her handshake firm and decisive. "Welcome to the team, Zoltán Ken," she said, a hint of a smile playing on her lips.
