Julien Kentaro was a man of mystery and intrigue. His piercing green eyes seemed to hold secrets, and his chiseled features made him look like he belonged on the cover of a high-end fashion magazine. But despite his polished exterior, Julien had a rough past that he kept hidden from the world.

As a child, Julien had grown up on the streets of Tokyo, surviving by his wits and his fists. He had learned to navigate the dark alleys and cramped alleys of the city with ease, always keeping one eye out for potential threats. But despite the hardships he faced, Julien's spirit remained unbroken.

As he grew older, Julien began to make a name for himself in the world of high-stakes art dealing. He had an uncanny ability to spot rare and valuable artwork, and his keen eye and quick wit made him a formidable player in the cutthroat world of art dealers.

Despite his success, Julien's past continued to haunt him. Old enemies still lurked in the shadows, waiting for their chance to strike. And Julien knew that if he ever let his guard down, they would be there to pounce.

One night, as Julien sat sipping whiskey at a high-end bar in Shibuya, he received an unexpected visit from his old friend, Akira. Akira was a fellow artist and troublemaker, who had once shared Julien's rough-around-the-edges lifestyle. But while Julien had long since left the streets behind, Akira still walked that fine line between creativity and chaos.

"What have you been up to, Kentaro?" Akira asked, his eyes glinting with mischief as he spotted Julien. "Still dealing in art and secrets?"

Julien raised an eyebrow, intrigued by Akira's sudden interest. But as they chatted through the night, it became clear that there was more at play than just small talk.

"You know I've been watching you, Kentaro," Akira said, his voice low and conspiratorial. "And I think it's time we worked together again."

Julien felt a shiver run down his spine as he listened to Akira's words. What did his old friend really want from him? And what lay in store for Julien Kentaro in the shadows of Tokyo's underbelly?
