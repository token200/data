Julien Junko was known for his eccentric style and unwavering passion for art. A French-Canadian painter, he spent most of his days holed up in his Montreal studio, lost in a world of vibrant colors and swirling brushstrokes.

Sophie was both intimidated and inspired by the enigmatic artist before her. She watched for hours, transfixed by Julien's creative process, as he seamlessly transitioned from dark blues to swirling oranges and yellows. When she finally mustered up the courage to introduce herself, Julien Junko turned to her with a warm smile, his eyes twinkling behind thick-rimmed glasses.

The two artists struck up an unlikely friendship, bonding over their shared passion for art and life.
