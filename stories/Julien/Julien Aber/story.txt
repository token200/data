Julien Étienne Aber was a man with a passion for art and music. Growing up in the French countryside, he spent most of his childhood exploring the rolling hills and villages, soaking up the culture and inspiration that surrounded him.

As he grew older, Julien's interests shifted from nature to the creative arts. He began studying painting and photography, and soon found himself lost in the world of art, experimenting with different techniques and styles. His parents, though not artists themselves, encouraged his passion and supported his dreams, recognizing the joy it brought him.

After completing his studies, Julien Étienne Aber set out to make a name for himself as an artist. He traveled the world, capturing its beauty and diversity through his lens. From the bright colors of Indian street life to the muted tones of rural Japan, Julien's photographs told stories of the people and places he encountered.

But Julien's love of music was not limited to taking pictures. As a child, he had been fascinated by the piano, spending hours practicing Chopin's nocturnes and Debussy's preludes. Now, as an adult, he found solace in playing the violin, using the instrument to express emotions and moods that words couldn't convey.

One day, while exhibiting his work at a gallery in Paris, Julien met a fellow artist who shared his passion for music and art. The two struck up a conversation, bonding over their love of creative expression. As they talked, an idea began to take shape – to collaborate on a project that combined painting, photography, and music.

Julien Étienne Aber was thrilled at the prospect of working with someone who understood his vision. Together, he and his new partner set out to create something truly special – a multimedia exhibit that would showcase their shared love of art and music. And as they worked, Julien felt a sense of joy and fulfillment that he had never known before, knowing that his passions were being brought together in a way that made him feel truly alive.
