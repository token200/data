Julien Sundlof stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. As a private investigator, she had spent countless hours in places like this, waiting for leads or information to trickle in. Tonight was no exception.

Julien had been hired by the wealthy businessman, Marcus Wellington, whose daughter had gone missing six months prior. The police had given up on the case, but Julien was determined to find Sarah and bring her home.

As she waited, a figure emerged from the shadows, their face obscured by a hoodie. "You're Julien Sundlof," they stated, their voice low and gravelly.

Julien nodded, her hand instinctively reaching for her gun. "Who are you?"

The figure pulled back its hood, revealing a woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. "My name is Ava," she said, her gaze locked on Julien. "I've been watching you, Julien Sundlof. I know what you're looking for."

Julien's instincts told her to trust no one, but there was something about Ava that seemed...off. "What do you mean?" she asked, her voice cautious.

Ava smiled, a small, enigmatic smile. "I have information about Sarah Wellington," she said, producing a small folder from her jacket pocket. "Information that could help you find her."

Julien's eyes widened as she took the folder, feeling a surge of hope. This was it – this was the break she had been waiting for.

As Ava turned to leave, Julien called out, "Wait." She pulled out her phone and dialed a number, her heart pounding in her chest. "Marcus Wellington," she said, when the voice answered on the other end. "It's Julien Sundlof. I have something."

The line went dead, and Julien looked up to see Ava watching her from across the platform. A small smile played on Ava's lips, and Julien knew that this was just the beginning of a long, winding road – one that would lead her closer to finding Sarah Wellington, no matter what it took.

With renewed determination, Julien Sundlof set off into the night, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
