Julien Jhih-hao stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of life. As the sole passenger on this deserted route, he was used to feeling like a ghost drifting through the crowds. His long black hair fell across his face, framing his sharp features as he checked his watch for what felt like the hundredth time.

A gentle rain began to fall, casting a misty veil over the station and rendering the world outside even more indistinct. Julien's thoughts turned inward, his mind consumed by the familiar melancholy that had become all too companionable in recent years. He wondered if this journey was simply another detour on a life he'd never quite mapped out for himself.

As he walked through the deserted streets, the patter of raindrops on pavement echoed like a solitary heartbeat. The buildings seemed to loom over him, their windows like empty eyes watching his every move. Julien felt like a stranger in this place, even though he knew its secrets and hidden corners like the back of his hand.

He thought about all the people he'd left behind – friends, family, acquaintances who'd once mattered so much. Their faces blurred together in his mind, their voices reduced to hushed whispers on the wind. Julien couldn't shake the feeling that he was abandoning a part of himself with each step, leaving behind a trail of dust and forgotten dreams.

And yet, despite this sense of disconnection, there was something about the rain-soaked streets that called to him – a melancholy beauty that spoke directly to his soul. It was as if the city itself was weeping for what had been lost, its ancient stones bearing witness to a thousand midnights and secret regrets.

As Julien disappeared into the shadows, the station lights seemed to fade with him, plunging the world into an uncertain darkness. Yet even in that void, he felt a glimmer of peace – the quiet acceptance that sometimes it was necessary to let go, to surrender to the rain and the wind and the whispers of a forgotten heart.
