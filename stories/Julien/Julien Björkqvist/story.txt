Julien Björkqvist stepped into the dimly lit bar, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of familiarity. She had been on the run for what felt like an eternity, and the last place she expected to find herself was in a small, out-of-the-way bar in rural Sweden.

As she made her way to the counter, the bartender looked up and raised an eyebrow. "Julien Björkqvist?" he asked, his voice laced with skepticism.

She nodded, feeling a flutter of anxiety in her chest. How did he know?

The bartender leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. "You're quite the celebrity among certain circles, you know."

Julien's eyes widened as she took in the strange looks from the other patrons. She had always known that her...abilities, for lack of a better term, made her a target.

As a child, Julien had been diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder that allowed her to manipulate energy and matter at will. It was a gift, or so they said. But in reality, it was a curse. People saw her as a freak, a monster.

She downed the shot of liquor the bartender had handed her, feeling the burn all the way down. She had been living on the run for years, always looking over her shoulder, waiting for the other shoe to drop.

But Julien Björkqvist was not one to be easily intimidated. She had built a life for herself, one that was hidden from the prying eyes of the public. Or so she thought.

As she turned to leave, the bartender called out after her. "You might want to watch your back, Miss Björkqvist."

Julien's heart skipped a beat as she spun around, her eyes locked on the stranger who had spoken. Who was he? And how did he know her name?

She took a deep breath and stepped back into the night, her senses on high alert. She knew that in this world, you could never be too careful.

For now, Julien Björkqvist disappeared into the shadows, her secrets safe...or so she hoped.
