Julien "Jules" Liepins was known for his sharp wit and quick tongue, which often got him into trouble at the local bar where he held court on Tuesday nights. As the owner of a struggling art gallery in the trendy part of town, Jules had found himself with more time to indulge in his love of scotch and sarcastic remarks.

Despite his rough exterior, Jules was a hopeless romantic, always on the lookout for someone who could see past his gruff demeanor and appreciate the complexities beneath. His latest conquest, Sophie, was no exception – she was an art student at the local university, with a passion for contemporary art that rivaled her own.

As they sipped their drinks and discussed everything from Pollock to Proust, Jules found himself smitten. But he wasn't about to let his guard down just yet – after all, he'd been burned before by someone who turned out to be more interested in his art collection than his feelings. Sophie, however, seemed different; she was genuine and charming, with a wicked sense of humor that left Jules in stitches.

As the night wore on, Jules found himself opening up to Sophie in ways he never thought possible. They laughed together, shared stories, and even managed to stumble through a few awkward dance moves on the bar's makeshift floor. By the time the night drew to a close, Jules knew that he wanted to spend more time with this captivating woman.

The next morning, as he sipped coffee at his gallery, Jules couldn't help but think of Sophie and the way she had left him feeling – lightheaded and hopeful. He smiled wryly to himself; who would have thought that someone like him would fall for someone so radiant? But as he gazed out at the city, watching the sun rise over the rooftops, Jules knew that he was ready to take a chance on love again.

As the days turned into weeks, and Sophie became a regular fixture in his life, Jules began to realize that this time around, it felt different. Maybe it was the scotch – or maybe it was the art student's infectious enthusiasm for life – but whatever it was, Jules knew that he'd found someone special in Sophie, and he was determined to make her happy.
