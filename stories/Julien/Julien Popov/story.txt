Julien Popov stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. He had been in Paris for hours, but he still couldn't shake the feeling of unease that settled in the pit of his stomach.

As a former KGB agent turned freelance security consultant, Julien was used to dealing with danger. But this mission felt different. This one was personal. His sister, Tatiana, had gone missing in the city months ago, and he had been tracking down leads ever since.

The station attendant, a gruff-looking man with a thick French accent, looked at him with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. "Can I help you, monsieur?"

"I'm looking for information about my sister," Julien replied, flashing his diplomatic ID card. "She was last seen in this city, about six months ago."

The attendant's expression softened slightly, but he still seemed hesitant to reveal anything. "I don't know what you're talking about, sir," he said.

Julien smiled wryly. He had dealt with people like this before. People who thought they were above the law, or simply didn't want to get involved. He leaned in closer, his voice taking on a more menacing tone. "Listen, I don't have all day. If you know anything about Tatiana Popov, I need to know now."

The attendant swallowed hard, glancing nervously around the station before finally speaking up. "I...I think I saw her arguing with someone," he stammered.

Julien's ears perked up. This was what he had been waiting for. He pulled out his phone and dialed a number, waiting for his contact to answer on the other end of the line. As he listened to the voice on the other end, his eyes locked onto the attendant's face, searching for any sign of deception.

After what felt like an eternity, the attendant nodded slightly, as if understanding that something was about to change. He scribbled down a piece of paper and handed it to Julien, who tucked it into his pocket without looking up.

With a sense of grim determination, Julien turned and walked out of the station, ready to face whatever lay ahead in his quest to find his sister and uncover the truth behind her disappearance.
