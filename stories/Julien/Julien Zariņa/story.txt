Julien Zariņa was a man of mystery, with an aura that commanded attention without ever having to say a word. A skilled photographer and filmmaker, he had spent years honing his craft, traveling the world in search of stories that needed to be told.

Born in Riga, Latvia, Julien's love affair with photography began at a young age, watching his grandfather develop film in their small apartment. As he grew older, his fascination with the medium only deepened, and he spent countless hours learning from other artists, experimenting with different techniques and styles.

Despite his quiet demeanor, Julien had an insatiable curiosity about the world around him. He was always on the lookout for people who were hiding in plain sight – individuals whose stories needed to be told, but were often overlooked by society. These were the people he wanted to capture, to share with the world.

One day, while working on a project in the streets of Havana, Cuba, Julien met Maria. A young Afro-Cuban woman with piercing green eyes and skin that shone like polished mahogany, she was struggling to make ends meet as a street artist. Julien saw something in her that no one else did – a fire that burned bright, even in the darkest of places.

He began to follow Maria on her daily rounds, capturing images of her artistry, her resilience, and her unwavering hope for a better future. As he delved deeper into her world, Julien discovered that Maria's story was not just about survival – it was about defiance, about resistance against the forces that sought to silence her.

Together, Julien and Maria created something special – a body of work that spoke to the soul of anyone who saw it. Their collaboration sparked a global conversation about racism, oppression, and the power of the human spirit. And for Julien, there was no greater reward than seeing his art bring people together, sparking empathy and understanding where once there had been only silence.

Years later, when asked about Maria's influence on his life, Julien would smile softly, his eyes taking on a faraway look. "She taught me that the most powerful stories are those of those who refuse to be forgotten," he would say.
