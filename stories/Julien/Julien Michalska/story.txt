Julien Michalska was a man consumed by his passion for photography. Born and raised in Warsaw, Poland, he had always been fascinated by the world around him – the way light danced through streets, the colors of the city's fading communist architecture, and the stories hidden behind every face.

As a child, Julien would spend hours poring over his father's old cameras, marveling at the mysterious workings of film development. He began taking his own photographs as soon as he could hold a camera, capturing the world with an unbridled sense of wonder. After completing art school, he moved to Berlin to hone his craft, surrounded by the city's vibrant street art scene and avant-garde photographers.

Years went by, and Julien Michalska's name began to gain recognition in the photography community. His gritty, documentary-style shots of everyday life resonated with audiences worldwide. People saw themselves in his photographs – the hopes, fears, and quiet struggles that defined their own lives.

One day, while working on a project capturing the lives of Berlin's elderly population, Julien met an enigmatic woman named Helena. Her striking features and piercing green eyes captured his attention, but it was her story that truly left him spellbound. A widow in her late sixties, Helena had lost her husband to illness just a year prior. She had since devoted herself to caring for her ailing daughter, sacrificing her own dreams and aspirations.

Julien Michalska was deeply moved by Helena's courage and resilience. He decided then and there that he would tell her story – and the stories of others like her – through his lens. Together, they embarked on a journey capturing the lives of the elderly in Berlin, documenting their triumphs and struggles with empathy and compassion.

As Julien Michalska continued to create, his passion for photography only grew stronger. He poured his heart into each frame, capturing not just images but also the people behind them – stories like Helena's that would forever change his perspective on life.
