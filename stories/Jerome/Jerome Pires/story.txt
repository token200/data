Born on a sweltering summer day in 1975, Jerome grew up surrounded by music. His parents, both passionate musicians themselves, encouraged his early interest in piano playing. As he honed his craft, Jerome Pires became increasingly influenced by the greats – Miles Davis, Bill Evans, and Charlie Parker.
