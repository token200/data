Jerome Zawisza stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for any signs of recognition. As a renowned psychologist with a specialization in treating patients with anxiety disorders, he had built a reputation on being one of the best in the business.

As he made his way to the counter, the barista greeted him with a warm smile. "Jerome Zawisza, the doc's here," she said, raising an eyebrow at the mention of his full name, which he preferred people not use so often.

Jerome chuckled and nodded, taking his usual seat by the window. He had always been particular about his personal space, but it was a quirk that set him apart from other professionals in his field. His colleagues often joked that only a handful of people knew how to address him without resorting to "Dr." Zawisza.

Just then, a young woman sat down across from him, her eyes red-rimmed and tears brimming on the edges. Jerome's instincts kicked in; he had seen this look before – it was the telltale sign of someone struggling with anxiety.

"Can I help you?" he asked softly, his voice low and reassuring.

The young woman hesitated before speaking, her words tumbling out in a rush. "I-I'm so scared," she stammered. "I keep thinking about all the things that could go wrong, and I don't know how to stop it."

Jerome nodded sympathetically, pulling out his notebook and pen. He listened attentively as she poured out her fears and worries, his expression empathetic but detached. It was a skill honed from years of practice; he knew exactly when to intervene.

As the session drew to a close, Jerome leaned forward, his eyes locking onto hers. "You are not alone," he said firmly, his voice unwavering. "I'm here to help you navigate these treacherous waters."

The young woman looked up at him, a glimmer of hope flickering in her eyes. Jerome smiled gently and stood, handing her a business card with his full name on it – Jerome Zawisza, Ph.D.

"Call me when you're ready," he said softly, as she left the café, looking a little more grounded than she had when she arrived.
