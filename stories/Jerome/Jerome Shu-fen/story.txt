One fateful night, Jerome Shu-fen received an intriguing message from an unknown source.

With precision, Jerome Shu-fen bypassed the alarms and reached the heart of the facility: a room containing sensitive information about a corrupt government official. The data revealed the official's involvement in embezzlement and human trafficking, leaving Jerome with no choice but to take action.

Discreetly, Jerome downloaded the incriminating evidence onto a small device before disappearing into the night.

Whatever the truth may be, one thing is certain: Jerome Shu-fen remains an elusive figure, always one step ahead of his adversaries. His legend continues to grow, as whispers of "The Phantom" echo through the shadows. For now, Jerome disappears into the night, ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead, ever vigilant and committed to his crusade against corruption.

As the night wears on, Jerome's name becomes synonymous with bravery and cunning, cementing his place in history as a champion of justice for those who have been silenced by the powerful.
