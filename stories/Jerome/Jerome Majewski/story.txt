Jerome Majewski stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit bar, shaking the water from his long coat. As a private investigator in New Haven, he had seen it all - the rich and powerful, the poor and desperate. But tonight, Jerome Majewski was on the hunt for something more.

He spotted her across the room, a striking woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She seemed out of place among the rough-around-the-edges patrons, but there was an air of confidence about her that commanded attention. Jerome Majewski made his way through the crowd, his eyes fixed on hers as he took a seat at the bar.

"Whiskey," he told the bartender, his voice low and gravelly. "And make it a double."

As the bartender poured him a drink, Jerome Majewski's gaze never wavered from the mysterious woman. She was sipping a cocktail, her eyes scanning the room with an air of caution. He could tell she was waiting for someone, but he had no idea who.

Just then, a tall, imposing figure emerged from the shadows. The man was dressed in a tailored suit, his face chiseled and handsome. Jerome Majewski recognized him as Victor LaGraine, a wealthy businessman with a reputation for ruthlessness.

"Jerome," LaGraine said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "What brings you to my establishment tonight?"

Jerome Majewski raised an eyebrow, his mind racing with possibilities. He knew LaGraine was involved in some shady dealings, and he had received a cryptic tip that something big was about to go down.

"I'm just looking for information," Jerome Majewski replied, taking a sip of his whiskey. "You know how it is."

LaGraine smiled, his eyes glinting with amusement. "Oh, I think I do," he said. "But I'm afraid you'll have to pay for the privilege of knowing what I know, Jerome Majewski."

Jerome Majewski nodded, his mind racing with strategies and counter-strategies. He was in this game now, and he would stop at nothing to uncover the truth.
