Jerome Nachtnebel was a man with a shrouded past. Few people knew much about him beyond his striking features and enigmatic smile. He had a way of making others feel at ease, even when they didn't know what he was thinking.

As a child, Jerome grew up on the streets of Berlin, surviving by his wits and stealth. His parents were never seen again, but rumors swirled that they had been involved in some shady dealings. Whatever the truth may have been, Jerome learned early to rely only on himself.

Years later, Jerome found himself in a small café, nursing a cup of black coffee. He was sipping alone, lost in thought, when a young woman stumbled in, shaking with fear. She claimed that her brother had gone missing and she needed help finding him. Jerome's instincts told him to walk away, but something about the girl's desperation stayed his hand.

He agreed to take on the case, and soon found himself following leads through Berlin's underbelly. From seedy bars to abandoned warehouses, Jerome dug deeper, determined to uncover what had happened to the young man. His eyes scanned every alleyway, searching for any sign of trouble.

As night fell, Jerome finally received a tip about his brother's whereabouts. He led the girl to an old warehouse on the outskirts of town, where they found him bound and gagged. Jerome swiftly freed the boy, who was shaken but alive.

In the aftermath, the girl thanked Jerome profusely for saving her brother. As she turned to leave, he caught a glimpse of himself in a nearby window reflection – a faint scar above his left eyebrow, a glint in his eye. Who was this man, really? Only Jerome knew the answer: Jerome Nachtnebel, guardian of secrets and protector of those who needed him most.

As the girl disappeared into the night, Jerome watched her go with a mixture of satisfaction and melancholy. He had saved another soul, but at what cost to himself? His gaze lingered on his reflection for a moment before he turned away, vanishing into the shadows like a ghost.
