Aurel Perez Sanchez was a 25-year-old graphic novelist who had always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and mythology. Growing up in a small town in Mexico, he spent countless hours poring over his abuela's old VHS tapes of ancient legends and folklore, imagining the fantastical worlds that lay beyond the boundaries of reality.

As a child, Aurel would spend hours sketching the creatures from these tales: dragons, phoenixes, and griffins, their scales and feathers rendered in exquisite detail. His parents encouraged his artistic talents, and soon he was selling his drawings to local shops and galleries.

After completing high school, Aurel enrolled in a prestigious art program at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. It was there that he met his closest friend and confidant, a fellow student named Luna. Together, they formed a tight-knit clique of artists, writers, and musicians who pushed each other to create something truly innovative.

One day, while browsing through an online forum for graphic novels, Aurel stumbled upon a fascinating article about the mythology of the Aztecs. He was particularly drawn to the legend of Coatlicue, the goddess of life and death, whose symbol was the intricate pattern of serpents and stars that adorned many ancient artifacts.

Inspired by this discovery, Aurel began working on his magnum opus: a graphic novel that would explore the intersection of technology and Aztec mythology. He spent countless hours researching, sketching, and writing, fueled by his passion for the subject matter. Luna, sensing his excitement, offered to be his collaborator, bringing her own skills as a writer and illustrator to the project.

As Aurel Perez Sanchez sat at his desk, surrounded by papers, pencils, and the faint scent of VHS tapes, he knew that he was on the cusp of something special. His graphic novel would challenge the boundaries between myth and reality, transporting readers to a world where technology and ancient magic coexisted in breathtaking harmony. With Luna's help, Aurel was ready to unleash his creation upon the world, hoping to capture the imagination of anyone who dared to venture into this enchanted realm.
