Aurel Abdi stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the sprawling cityscape below. The neon lights of the skyscrapers reflected off the wet pavement, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the darkening sky.

As a detective with the city's homicide unit, Aurel had seen her fair share of darkness and despair. But tonight was different. Tonight, she was on the hunt for answers about a case that had haunted her for weeks.

The victim was a young woman named Sophia, found dead in an alleyway just a few blocks from here. The police had collected evidence, but so far, they had nothing to go on. No leads, no suspects, no motive. It was as if Sophia had vanished into thin air.

Aurel took a deep breath and mentally prepared herself for the long night ahead. She had spent hours poring over the case files, talking to witnesses, and reviewing the security footage. But tonight, she wanted to take it to the streets.

"I need you to show me where Sophia's body was found," Aurel said, her eyes scanning the rooftops as she waited for Rashid to arrive.

The sound of footsteps echoed through the night air, followed by the rustle of clothes and the creaking of backpack straps. Aurel smiled, knowing that with Rashid on her team, she had a fighting chance of cracking the case.

This time, however, she saw something new – a small piece of paper caught in the rusty grate beneath Sophia's body. She carefully plucked it out and tucked it into her pocket, feeling a spark of hope ignite within her.

As they walked back up onto the rooftop, Aurel turned to Rashid with a determined look on her face. "I think I've got something," she said, holding out the crumpled paper for him to see.

Rashid's eyes widened as he scanned the scribbled words – a message that seemed to point directly to Sophia's killer...
