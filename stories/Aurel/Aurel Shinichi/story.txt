A brilliant and enigmatic figure, Aurel Shinichi had spent years mastering the art of alchemy, delving deep into the mysteries of the universe.

His dedication paid off when he finally stumbled upon a breakthrough formula that allowed him to transform base metals into gold.

But Aurel Shinichi's achievements didn't go unnoticed.
