Aurel Mercier stepped into the dimly lit tavern, her eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As a skilled mercenary, she had seen her fair share of battles and bloodshed, but there was something about this particular mission that didn't sit right with her.

Her employer, a wealthy merchant named Marcellus, had hired her to escort a valuable shipment of rare spices from the coastal town of Ravenshire to the bustling city of Argentum. It wasn't a job she would normally take on, but the promise of a hefty sum and the thrill of adventure had won her over.

As Aurel made her way to the bar, a hooded figure caught her eye. They sat in the corner, sipping a mug of ale and watching her with an intensity that made her skin crawl. She pushed aside her unease and ordered a drink, her hand resting on the hilt of her sword as she waited for Marcellus to arrive.

Just then, Marcellus appeared, flanked by two burly guards who eyed Aurel's sword with suspicion. "Ah, Mercier," he said, his voice dripping with condescension. "I see you're still in one piece."

Aurel smiled sweetly and nodded at the hooded figure. "Just making sure everyone is accounted for, Marcellus. Who's your... friend?"

Marcellus hesitated before answering. "Just a fellow traveler. Nothing to concern yourself with."

But Aurel wasn't fooled. She had dealt with men like that before - smooth talkers and charlatans who hid their true intentions behind a mask of charm. As they set out on the journey, she kept a close eye on the hooded figure, her hand never far from her sword.

As the sun began to set, Aurel knew it was time to make her move. She had a feeling that something wasn't quite right about this mission, and she was determined to get to the bottom of it - no matter what it took. With a quiet confidence, Aurel led Marcellus's guards out of the tavern, ready to face whatever lay ahead as Aurel Mercier, seasoned mercenary extraordinaire.
