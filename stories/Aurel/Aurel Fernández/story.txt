Aurel Fernández sat alone in the dimly lit café, nursing a lukewarm coffee as she stared out the rain-soaked window. Her long, dark hair fell in tangled locks down her back, and her eyes seemed to hold a world of sorrow within them. Aurel Fernández had always been the type to keep people at arm's length, but on nights like these, she found it difficult to push away the emotions that threatened to consume her.

As she sat there, lost in thought, the door swung open and a familiar figure strode in. It was his brother, Mateo, who had just returned from a year abroad. The two siblings had always been close, but their paths had diverged after high school, with Aurel Fernández opting to pursue a career in art and Mateo choosing medicine.

Mateo spotted Aurel Fernández sitting by the window and made his way over to her, dropping into the chair across from her. "Hey, cuz," he said softly, using the nickname only she allowed him to use. "How's it going?"

Aurel Fernández turned to face him, a faint smile on her lips. "It's been better," she replied, her voice barely above a whisper. Mateo nodded sympathetically and ordered a cup of coffee from the barista.

The two siblings sat in silence for a moment, watching as raindrops slid down the windowpane like tiny tears. Aurel Fernández finally spoke up, her words spilling out in a rush. "I had a show last week, but it didn't go as planned. I'm feeling stuck and unsure if I'll ever make it as an artist."

Mateo listened attentively, his eyes never leaving hers. When she finished speaking, he reached across the table and took her hand in his. "You're talented, Aurel Fernández," he said firmly. "It's okay to take time and figure things out. You'll get there, I promise."

Aurel Fernández felt a lump form in her throat as she looked at her brother, his eyes filled with unwavering support. For the first time all day, she allowed herself to feel a glimmer of hope, knowing that no matter what lay ahead, Mateo would be there to offer a listening ear and a comforting smile. As they sat together in the rainy night, Aurel Fernández felt a sense of peace wash over her, one that she hadn't experienced in weeks.
