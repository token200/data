As Aurel grew older, his interest in art only deepened. He attended the esteemed Escuela de Artes Plásticas de Oaxaca, where he honed his skills as a painter and sculptor.

One day, Aurel received an offer from a prominent museum in New York City to create a large-scale installation piece. The exhibit would be dedicated to the cultural heritage of Oaxaca, and Aurel was thrilled at the opportunity to share his people's story with the world. He spent months planning and preparing for the show, pouring his heart and soul into every detail.

Finally, the night of the exhibition arrived, and Aurel Sariñana stood nervously in front of his creation.
