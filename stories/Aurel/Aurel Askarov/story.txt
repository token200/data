Aurel Askarov stood at the edge of the frozen lake, his eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of movement. As a former Spetsnaz operative turned freelance security consultant, he had seen his fair share of combat and chaos. But this mission was different. This one was personal.

It had been five years since Aurel's younger sister, Sofia, went missing in Chechnya during the Russian-Georgian war. The government had denied any involvement, but Aurel knew the truth. He had received a cryptic message from an unknown source claiming that Sofia was alive and being held by a rogue faction within the Georgian army.

Aurel's search had taken him to every corner of the former Soviet Union, from the snow-capped mountains of Azerbaijan to the bustling streets of Moscow. But it seemed like he was getting closer now, with a tip that led him to this remote lake in northern Georgia.

As he gazed out at the frozen landscape, Aurel's mind flashed back to those long days spent searching for Sofia. He had lost count of how many leads had gone cold, how many dead ends he had followed. But something about this feeling told him it was worth it.

Suddenly, his phone buzzed in his pocket. Aurel pulled it out and answered, his eyes locking onto a figure emerging from the trees nearby. The man was dressed in a thick winter coat, his face obscured by a scarf.

"You're the one they call Askarov," the man said, his voice low and gravelly.

Aurel nodded, his hand instinctively reaching for the knife sheathed at his belt.

"I've been watching you," the man continued. "I know what you're looking for."

Without another word, he turned and walked back into the trees. Aurel followed, his senses on high alert. They walked in silence for several minutes before stopping at a small cabin nestled among the pine trees.

The door creaked open, revealing a dimly lit interior that seemed to belong to a different era altogether. A woman sat huddled on a couch, her eyes sunken and tired. Aurel's heart skipped a beat as he took in the familiar shape of his sister's features.

"Sofia?" he whispered, his voice barely audible.

The woman slowly looked up, a glimmer of recognition crossing her face before fading away into despair.

"Brother," she croaked, her eyes filling with tears. "I'm so sorry... I was taken by men who promised to keep me safe. They told me they were part of the government's effort to protect me from the rebels."

Aurel's grip on his knife tightened as understanding dawned on him.

"Who are they?" he demanded, his voice cold and deadly.

Sofia shook her head, a faint smile playing on her lips.

"You'll have to kill them yourself, brother," she said.
