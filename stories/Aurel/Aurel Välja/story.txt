Was it true that Aurel Välja was actually a pseudonym, masking the identity of someone far more complex? Some claimed to have spotted glimpses of the truth in their performances – fleeting moments of vulnerability that hinted at a deeper reality. Others simply couldn't resist the allure of the enigma.
