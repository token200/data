Aurel Gauthier stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar smell of saltwater and seaweed filling their lungs. It was a sensation they had grown to love over the years, one that always seemed to clear their mind and soothe their soul.

As they made their way through the station, Aurel's eyes scanned the crowded waiting room, searching for a glimpse of their friend, Leo. They had known Leo since childhood, and despite his rough exterior, he had a heart of gold.

After a few minutes of searching, Aurel spotted Leo lounging against a bench, his eyes fixed intently on some point beyond the horizon. Aurel smiled to themselves, feeling a sense of relief wash over them. It was good to have found their friend.

"Aurel!" Leo called out, his deep voice carrying across the room as he pushed himself up from the bench. "Glad you're here! I was starting to think I'd never see your face around here again."

Aurel laughed and clapped Leo on the back, feeling a sense of camaraderie wash over them. They had always been close friends, despite their vastly different backgrounds and personalities.

As they made their way through the station, Aurel couldn't help but think about how far they'd come since leaving home. From struggling to make ends meet in the city, to finding success as a writer in the small coastal town, it was a journey that had taken them on countless twists and turns.

But no matter where life took them, Aurel knew that they could always count on Leo to be there for them. And as they walked out into the bright sunlight, feeling the warm breeze ruffling their hair, Aurel felt grateful for this chance to reconnect with an old friend.

Together, they strolled along the beach, watching the waves crash against the shore and listening to the seagulls crying overhead. It was a moment of perfect peace, one that Aurel Gauthier would always treasure.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the ocean, Aurel turned to Leo with a smile. "Thanks for having me, buddy," they said, their voice low and sincere.

Leo clapped them on the back once more, his eyes twinkling with amusement. "Anytime, Aurel. You know that."
