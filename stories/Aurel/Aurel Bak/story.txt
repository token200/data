Aurel Bak's latest mark was a wealthy collector named Marcus, who had made a fortune on the backs of struggling artists. Aurel Bak saw this as the perfect opportunity to right a wrong, and set his sights on pulling off the biggest heist of his career.

As the night of the heist approached, Aurel Bak was a whirlwind of activity. He spent hours casing the museum, studying the security guards' routines and timing the alarms. But despite his meticulous planning, nothing seemed to go according to plan.

Just as Aurel Bak was making his escape, he found himself face-to-face with Marcus's personal bodyguard. The two engaged in a fierce stare-down, each waiting for the other to blink. It was a standoff that could have gone either way, but Aurel Bak had one last trick up his sleeve.
