Aurel Petrov stepped into the dimly lit café, his piercing green eyes scanning the room for any sign of his contact. As he waited, he sipped on a cup of black coffee, his mind focused on the task at hand.

Aurel Petrov was a former Spetsnaz operative turned private investigator, with a reputation for being one of the best in Moscow. He had been hired by a mysterious client to investigate a string of high-profile hacks that had left several major corporations reeling.

As he waited, Aurel's thoughts wandered back to his childhood, growing up in the sprawling metropolis of Odessa. His parents had been intellectuals, and from a young age, Aurel had been drawn to the world of espionage. He had joined the Spetsnaz as soon as he was old enough, quickly rising through the ranks due to his exceptional skills.

But after a particularly messy operation went sour, Aurel had opted to leave the military life behind and start anew. It wasn't long before his unique set of skills caught the attention of private investigators, and he had opened up his own agency.

Just as Aurel was starting to get anxious, a figure emerged from the shadows. A woman with short, spiky hair and piercing blue eyes walked over to him, nodding discreetly.

"Aurel Petrov," she said, her voice low and husky. "I'm here about the hack job you're investigating."

Aurel nodded, standing up as he followed her to a small table in the corner of the café.

"So, what do you know?" Aurel asked, his eyes locked on hers.

The woman pulled out a folder from her bag, releasing a faint whisper of rustling papers. "We have reason to believe that this is just the tip of the iceberg," she said, handing Aurel the folder. "Someone – or something – is targeting major corporations across Russia."

Aurel's eyes widened as he scanned the contents of the folder, his mind racing with possibilities.

"Who hired you?" he asked, his voice low and even.

The woman smiled, a small, enigmatic smile. "Let's just say we have our sources," she replied, standing up to leave.

As Aurel watched her disappear into the night, he couldn't help but wonder what other secrets lay hidden in the shadows of Moscow. He knew one thing for sure: Aurel Petrov was ready to dig deeper and uncover the truth, no matter where it led.
