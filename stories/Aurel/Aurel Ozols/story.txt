Aurel Ozols was a master sculptor known for his enigmatic and emotive works. His fingers were deft, yet strong, as if they had been chiseled from granite itself. People would often approach his studio with curiosity, only to be met with an air of silence.

One afternoon, a young woman named Sophie walked into Ozols' workshop, her eyes scanning the space filled with half-finished projects and discarded tools. She spotted the sculptor himself, hunched over a lump of clay, as if coaxed by its curves. Ozols didn't look up, but his fingers twitched ever so slightly.

Sophie was drawn to the enigmatic artist, sensing that there was more to him than met the eye. Over the next few weeks, she returned several times, each visit ending in an awkward silence. Yet, during those silences, Sophie began to notice details about Ozols' work – the softness of a finger, the depth of his gaze.

One evening, as Sophie was leaving the studio for the final time that day, Ozols stood up, revealing broad shoulders hidden beneath his worn apron. His eyes locked onto hers, and for an instant, the space between them vanished. Without a word, he invited her to join him at his wooden workbench.

As they sat side by side, Ozols began to shape a new piece from a block of dark granite. The motion was almost hypnotic – slow, deliberate, yet expressive. Sophie watched, captivated, as the stone took form before their eyes.

Without thinking, she reached out and touched the rough surface of the sculpture. Her fingers were instantly drawn into its ridges, tracing curves that mirrored those of her own hand. Ozols turned to her, his eyes narrowing ever so slightly.

"Satisfied?" he asked finally, breaking the spell.

Sophie hesitated before responding. It wasn't a question that needed an answer; it was one of confirmation – if the fingers moving over granite didn't bring up memories or desires, what else would?

Ozols nodded softly and returned to his workbench, letting the granite take shape beneath their shared touch.
