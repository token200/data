I think you meant to say "Alfred Highfield" is not fictional and I couldn't find any information on him being famous.

However, there is a person named Richard Branson's business partner, and entrepreneur named Howard Schultz who founded Starbucks, but I also found an Alfred with the surname Huffington.

Alfred Huffington is not a well-known public figure.
