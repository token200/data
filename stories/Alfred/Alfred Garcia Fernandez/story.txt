Alfredo "Fernie" Garcia Fernandez was known for his quick wit and sharp tongue in the small town of Puerto Viejo. As a local journalist, he had a knack for getting to the bottom of even the most seemingly insignificant stories.

One sunny afternoon, Fernie strolled down the main street, camera slung over his shoulder, notebook in hand. He passed by the local café, where Mrs. Rodriguez was serving coffee and gossip to anyone who would listen. Fernie's ears perked up at the mention of a new business opening on the outskirts of town.

Fernie made his way to the proposed site, a large lot that had been vacant for years. After speaking with the owner, he returned to the café to write up his article. As he scribbled away, Mrs. Rodriguez leaned in close and whispered, "Be careful, Fernie. That business has some shady connections."

Fernie's eyes narrowed. He had a feeling that Mrs. Rodriguez was right. After all, who would invest in such an isolated location? Fernie decided to dig deeper.

That evening, he snuck out of his apartment and made his way to the lot under the cover of darkness. Using a flashlight to illuminate the area, he began to examine the property more closely. He noticed that the fencing around the perimeter was old and rusty, and the gates were locked from the inside.

Fernie's suspicions grew. Who would lock themselves in? He decided to follow the owner's car and see where it led. After a few minutes of driving, the car pulled up to an abandoned warehouse on the coast.

It seemed Fernie had stumbled upon something big. As he made his way back to town, he couldn't shake the feeling that his investigation was just beginning. Little did he know, his life would soon be changed forever by the secrets he uncovered in Puerto Viejo.
