Alfred Yang was a man with a mysterious past. He had no memories of his childhood, and his parents had vanished when he was just a teenager. The only clue to his identity was a small tattoo on his wrist - a stylized "AY" in Chinese characters.

Despite the lack of familiarity with his own history, Alfred had grown into a skilled and resourceful individual. He possessed an uncanny ability to adapt to new situations, often relying on his intuition to guide him. His sharp mind and quick wit made him a valuable asset to those who knew him.

As he walked through the bustling streets of Hong Kong, Alfred's eyes scanned the crowds with a mixture of curiosity and caution. He had always felt like an outsider, someone who didn't quite fit in with the rest of society. But despite this feeling, he had built a network of friends and acquaintances who appreciated his unique perspective.

One evening, as he sipped a cup of tea at a small caf√©, Alfred received a cryptic message from an unknown sender. The note read: "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone."

Intrigued, Alfred decided to investigate further. He had always been drawn to mysteries and puzzles, and this seemed like the perfect challenge. As he made his way to the clock tower, the air grew thick with anticipation.

At midnight, Alfred arrived at the appointed spot, his heart pounding in anticipation. A figure emerged from the shadows - a woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair.

"You're the one they call the 'Lost Boy'," she said, her voice husky and confident. "I've been searching for you for years."

Alfred's instincts told him to be cautious, but there was something about this stranger that put him at ease. He nodded slowly, inviting her to continue.

The woman smiled, revealing a hint of mischief in her eyes. "I have information about your past," she said, pulling out a small folder from her bag. "Are you ready to uncover the truth?"

As Alfred opened the folder, his eyes widened with wonder. The documents revealed a shocking revelation - he was, in fact, the long-lost son of a wealthy businessman who had been presumed dead for years.

Alfred's mind reeled as he absorbed this new information. His past, once shrouded in mystery, was finally beginning to unravel. He felt a sense of belonging that he had never experienced before - like he had finally found a piece of himself that he thought was lost forever.
