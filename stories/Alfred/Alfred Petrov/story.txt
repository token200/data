Alfred Petrov stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a private investigator, he had seen his fair share of shady characters and seedy deals, but there was something about this place that didn't sit right with him.

He spotted a figure in the corner, huddled over a mug of ale, and made his way over. "Mind if I join you?" Alfred asked, nodding towards the empty chair across from them.

The figure looked up, revealing a pair of piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into Alfred's soul. "Not at all," they said, their voice low and gravelly. "I've been expecting you, Alfred Petrov."

Alfred raised an eyebrow. How did this person know his name? He took a seat, signaling the bartender for a drink. "What can I do for you?" he asked, trying to keep his tone neutral.

The figure pushed back their chair, revealing a woman with long, curly brown hair and a collection of tattoos on her arms. "My name is Sophia," she said, extending a hand. "And I have information about your sister."

Alfred's eyes narrowed. He had lost contact with his sister years ago, and he had never heard from her again after a falling out. What did Sophia want? "What kind of information?" he asked, his grip on his glass tightening.

Sophia leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. "I have evidence that your sister is alive, Alfred Petrov. And she's been in trouble."

Alfred's mind was racing. Alive? Trouble? What did it all mean? He took a deep breath, trying to process the information. Sophia seemed genuinely concerned, but he couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more to this story.

"Tell me," Alfred said finally, his voice firm. "What kind of trouble?"

Sophia hesitated, glancing around the room before leaning in closer. "I'll tell you outside," she whispered. "But we need to get out of here, now."

Alfred nodded, standing up and following Sophia out of the tavern into the night air. As they walked, he couldn't help but wonder what lay ahead for his sister â€“ and for him, Alfred Petrov.
