Alfred Lehtonen trudged through the snow-covered streets, his eyes fixed on the old wooden door of the Helsinki café where he worked as a part-time bartender. As the night wore on and the patrons began to dwindle, Alfred found himself lost in thought, wondering what could have been if he had pursued a career in music like he always dreamed.

A decade ago, Alfred Lehtonen had traded his guitar for a shaker and a jigger, and though it was a comfortable life, he couldn't shake the feeling that he'd made the wrong choice. He'd always been drawn to the stage, his voice soaring through songs he wrote himself, but after graduating from music school, he'd decided to prioritize stability.

As he polished a mug with a white cloth, Alfred's mind began to wander back to those days on stage, when everything had felt possible. He remembered the rush of adrenaline as he belted out his lyrics, the roar of the crowd as they sang along, and the sense of belonging that came from being part of something bigger than himself.

Just then, a harried-looking young woman stumbled through the door, shaking snowflakes from her coat and plopping down on a stool. "Kuumikörsia" – hot chocolate – she demanded, her voice husky with fatigue. Alfred smiled sympathetically, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he mixed up a rich, frothy drink.

As he handed her the steaming cup, their hands touched briefly, and for an instant, Alfred felt that familiar thrill of possibility. Maybe, just maybe, this was where his true path lay – not behind the bar, but in front of it, pouring drinks and stories into people's lives.

But as he went back to work, mixing cocktails with a practiced ease, Alfred couldn't shake the feeling that he'd been given a second chance. And so, while he poured beer for the patrons and spun tales about Helsinki's old-school jazz scene, his heart whispered a quiet melody – one that would one day become music again.
