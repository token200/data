Alfred Li wiped the sweat from his brow as he surveyed the chaotic kitchen. His mother, Mrs. Li, was frantically trying to finish the preparations for dinner while also refereeing an argument between their two daughters.

"Stop fighting over the chicken, Xiaoming!" Mrs. Li scolded, her voice stern but loving.

Alfred sighed and rubbed his temples. He had always been the voice of reason in their household, but sometimes he felt like he was drowning in a sea of drama and expectations.

As the eldest child, Alfred had taken on a lot of responsibility for managing the family's restaurant, Li's Kitchen, since his father passed away a year ago. His mother relied on him to keep everything running smoothly, from taking orders to mediating disputes between the staff.

But today was not like any other day. Their youngest daughter, Ling, had just announced that she wanted to take over the kitchen and create her own menu, much to Alfred's dismay. He knew his mother would support her, but he couldn't bear the thought of losing control over the restaurant he had worked so hard to build.

"Mother, I think we should discuss this further," Alfred said, trying to intervene.

Mrs. Li turned to him with a warm smile. "I'm sorry, Alfred. I know how much you care about the kitchen, but your sister needs an opportunity to grow and explore her creativity."

Alfred nodded reluctantly, knowing his mother was right. He had always been too focused on the business side of things, neglecting his own passions. Maybe it was time for him to step back and let Ling take the reins.

As he watched his daughters haggle over the chicken, Alfred felt a sense of pride and nostalgia wash over him. This was what family was all about – supporting each other's dreams and imperfections alike.

"Okay, okay," Alfred said, holding up his hands in surrender. "Let her make her own dish. I'll even help her with it."

Mrs. Li beamed at him. "Thank you, Alfred. You're always the calm in our stormy weather."

As he joined Ling at the stove, Alfred felt a sense of hope and renewal. Maybe this was the start of something new – not just for the restaurant, but for himself.
