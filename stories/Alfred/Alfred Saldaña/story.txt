Alfredo "Al" Saldaña was a man with a passion for history and a love for the stories that brought it to life. As a museum curator in his late 30s, he spent most of his days surrounded by artifacts and relics from the past, trying to recreate the experiences of those who came before him.

One day, while examining an ancient map, Al stumbled upon an intriguing passage about the Spanish conquest of South America. The more he read, the more fascinated he became with the life of Hernán Cortés, a man who had left his mark on history. He spent countless hours studying Cortés' accounts, imagining what it must have been like to be part of that era.

As Al delved deeper into his research, he discovered an old letter written by one of Cortés' soldiers, detailing the events leading up to the fall of Tenochtitlán. The words on the page seemed to come alive, transporting him to a time long forgotten. He felt as though he was walking alongside Alvaro Mendoza, the soldier who wrote the letter.

"Alfredo 'Al' Saldaña," his colleagues would often tease, "you're living vicariously through history." But for Al, there was no difference between reality and fantasy. He saw himself as a part of that world, connected to the people and events that had shaped it.

One evening, while working late in the museum, Al's phone rang. It was his best friend, Juan. "Hey, Al," Juan said, "I just got back from Mexico City. I visited the ancient ruins at Teotihuacán."

"Did you find anything interesting?" Al asked, curiosity getting the better of him.

"I saw a exhibit about the Aztecs," Juan replied. "It was amazing. They have so much to learn from us today."

The conversation drifted into a discussion about Cortés and his legacy. Al shared some of his findings with Juan, who listened intently. The two friends talked long after the night wore on, lost in their own worlds.

As the night drew to a close, Al looked up at the stars twinkling outside his window. He felt connected to the past, as though the stories and events that had shaped it still lived on through him. And in that moment, Alfredo "Al" Saldaña knew he was exactly where he belonged – among the artifacts of history, reliving the moments that made them come alive.
