Alfred María stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the small station with a mix of familiarity and disorientation. It had been years since he'd set foot in his hometown of Puerto Escondido, Mexico, and yet the layout of the station seemed unchanged. The same worn benches, the same vibrant mural on the wall, the same smell of diesel fuel and saltwater.

As he made his way through the station, Alfred's thoughts turned to the reason for his return. His abuela had passed away a few months ago, leaving behind a small estate that Alfred was determined to restore to its former glory. He'd always been close to her, and the thought of losing her was still painful.

The train station was quiet now, with only a handful of locals lingering in the shade. Alfred spotted his cousin, Juan, waiting by the exit, a look of concern on his face.

"Alfredo! ¡Qué sorpresa!" Juan exclaimed, rushing over to hug him tightly. "I wasn't expecting you back so soon."

"I had to come," Alfred replied, squeezing Juan's shoulders. "Abuela left me everything, and I need your help getting things sorted out."

Juan nodded, leading Alfred out of the station and into the bright sunlight. The streets were bustling with activity as the town prepared for the upcoming festival.

As they walked, Alfred noticed the changes that had taken place over the years. New businesses had opened, old buildings were being torn down to make way for new ones. But despite the progress, the town still held a familiar charm that drew him back in.

Their first stop was Abuela's house, a beautiful colonial-era mansion with intricate stone carvings and lush gardens. Alfred felt a lump form in his throat as he stepped inside, remembering afternoons spent playing hide-and-seek among the candelabras, listening to tales of their family's history.

Juan helped him sort through Abuela's belongings, sorting donations from family members into boxes for auction and dividing up the remaining items – antique furniture, artwork, cookbooks – between Alfred and himself. As they worked, Alfred realized that this return was not just about reviving a lost piece of his past, but also about forging a new path forward.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the town, Alfred felt a sense of purpose settle within him. He knew it wouldn't be easy, but with Juan's help and Abuela's legacy guiding him, he was ready to take on this new chapter in his life.
