Alfred Sundlof was no stranger to chaos. As the chief of security at the prestigious Bellvue Manor, he had seen his fair share of midnight strolls and ghostly apparitions. But on this particular evening, Alfred was in for a surprise.

As he patrolled the manor's corridors, his earpiece crackled with an urgent message from his boss, Mrs. White. "Alfred, we have a situation," she whispered urgently. "One of our guests has gone missing."

Without hesitation, Alfred set off to find the missing person, his eyes scanning every room and shadowy corner of the manor. He checked the library, where he spotted one of the guests, Mrs. Jenkins, engrossed in a book. Next, he searched the dining hall, where he found Mr. Smith arguing with another guest.

As Alfred continued his search, he stumbled upon a hidden passageway behind a bookshelf. His heart quickened as he made his way down the narrow corridor, the air thickening with an eerie atmosphere. Suddenly, he heard footsteps echoing through the hallway.

"Who's there?" Alfred called out, his hand on his gun.

The reply sent shivers down his spine: "Alfred Sundlof, I've been waiting for you." The voice was low and menacing, sending a chill through Alfred's veins.

Without hesitation, Alfred drew his gun and approached the source of the sound. As he turned a corner, he was met with an unexpected sight - none other than Mrs. White herself, her eyes gleaming in the dim light.

"What are you doing here?" Alfred demanded, trying to keep his voice steady.

Mrs. White's smile sent chills down Alfred's spine. "I wanted to see if my new security chief could handle himself," she replied, before disappearing into thin air.

Alfred Sundlof stood frozen, gun still trembling in his hand. Had he just been outsmarted by the very person he was trying to protect? As he called for backup, Alfred couldn't shake off the feeling that this case would be one for the books - and his reputation as chief of security at Bellvue Manor.
