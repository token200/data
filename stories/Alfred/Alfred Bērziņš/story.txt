I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Alfred Bērziņš. It's possible that you may have misspelled the name or that this character is not well-known.

However, if you'd like, I can create a short story about a fictional character with this name. Please let me know what kind of character Alfred Bērziņš should be and what genre of story you would like him to be in (e.g. science fiction, fantasy, historical, etc.).

If you'd prefer, I could also suggest some real-life characters with Latvian names that might inspire the creation of a fictional character. For example, Alfreds Bērziņš is a Latvian politician who has served as the Mayor of Riga.

Let me know how I can assist you further!
