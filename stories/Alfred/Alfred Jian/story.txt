As a renowned historian and archaeologist, he spent most of his career uncovering hidden secrets and piecing together fragmented stories. His passion for discovery drove him to travel the world in search of new knowledge, often leading him down treacherous paths and unexpected detours.

One day, while exploring the depths of an ancient temple, Alfred Jian stumbled upon a mysterious artifact that seemed to hold the key to unlocking a long-lost civilization. The small, intricately carved stone caught his eye as he carefully brushed away the dust and debris that had accumulated over centuries.
