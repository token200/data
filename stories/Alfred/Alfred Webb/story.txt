Alfred Webb had always been the quiet type. As a brilliant and resourceful detective in his late thirties, he preferred to observe rather than speak up, often relying on his instincts and keen mind to solve cases that stumped others.

One rainy evening, as Alfred Webb sat at his desk, pouring over the latest file from an unknown source, his phone rang. It was an old acquaintance, Lucy Rose, a journalist who had covered some of the most notorious crimes in the city. She had a tip for him - a cryptic message that read: "Look again at the Ravenswood case."

Alfred Webb's eyes narrowed as he recalled the Ravenswood case from years ago. A young girl had gone missing, and despite an extensive investigation, her whereabouts remained a mystery. Theories abounded, but Alfred Webb knew better than to dismiss anything without concrete evidence.

He arrived at Lucy Rose's office, his long coat clinging to him in the drizzle, and she handed him a folder filled with old case files. As they pored over the documents together, Alfred Webb noticed a small notation on one of the pages that caught his eye - "Interview with Sarah Jenkins, December 1995".

The more he thought about it, the more convinced he became that there was something here that needed revisiting. He thanked Lucy Rose for her help and set out to track down Sarah Jenkins, now a reclusive artist living on the outskirts of town.

At her small cottage, Alfred Webb found an intriguing mixture of old photographs and new art pieces. As they chatted, he noticed an uncanny resemblance between one of the pictures and the Ravenswood family crest. This, combined with Sarah's hesitant responses about that fateful night, led him to believe that she might be hiding more than just a secret.

As the rain continued to fall outside, Alfred Webb left Sarah Jenkins' house with a newfound determination to unravel the truth behind the Ravenswood case. He knew it wouldn't be easy - only time and hard work would prove if he was right - but one thing was certain: Alfred Webb's reputation as a detective rested on his ability to solve it.

With renewed focus, Alfred Webb made a mental note of every detail from their conversation, knowing that the puzzle pieces were finally starting to fall into place.
