Alfred Horváth was a man with a penchant for the peculiar and unknown. A retired librarian, he spent most of his days surrounded by dusty tomes and forgotten knowledge. His colleagues often referred to him as the "keeper of secrets," due to his uncanny ability to uncover obscure facts and figures.

One day, while rummaging through an old catalog, Alfred stumbled upon a mysterious volume bound in black leather. The title, "De Verbis Antiquis" (Of Ancient Words), seemed to whisper to him, drawing him in like a moth to flame. As he opened the book, a faint scent of sandalwood wafted up, transporting him to a world beyond his wildest imagination.

As Alfred delved deeper into the text, he discovered that it was written by a 19th-century scholar, thought to be long deceased. The words themselves seemed to dance on the page, carrying a message that only Alfred could decipher. He became obsessed with uncovering the secrets hidden within the book's yellowed pages.

As his friends and family grew concerned about his newfound fixation, Alfred couldn't shake off the feeling that he was onto something momentous. His colleagues would often catch him whispering to himself, "The language of the ancients holds the key," or "Horváth's theories will change everything." They began to refer to him as "the sage" behind closed doors.

One fateful evening, as Alfred pored over the book in his dimly lit study, he stumbled upon a cryptic passage that shed new light on an ancient myth. The words seemed to leap off the page, illuminating the very fabric of reality. Horváth's eyes widened with excitement as he scribbled notes furiously, knowing that he had unlocked a piece of the puzzle.

The mysterious book became his all-consuming passion, driving him to unravel the mysteries hidden within its pages. As Alfred delved deeper into the unknown, those around him couldn't help but feel that they were witnessing something extraordinary – a man's obsession had become an all-out quest for truth.
