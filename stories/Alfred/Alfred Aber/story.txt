Alfred Aber was a man of peculiarities, with an affinity for antiquarian books and a penchant for getting lost in the pages of history. His colleagues at the university where he worked often joked that he could spend hours poring over dusty tomes in the library, uncovering secrets that had been hidden for centuries.

Despite his love of solitude, Aber was a brilliant scholar who had made significant contributions to the field of ancient history. His dissertation on the lost city of Zerzura had earned him tenure and a reputation as one of the leading experts in his field.
