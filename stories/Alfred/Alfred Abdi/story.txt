Alfred Abdi sat at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of files in front of him. As a former CIA operative, he had seen his fair share of danger and intrigue, but lately, it seemed like the excitement had faded away.

He was now a freelance consultant, taking on small cases for clients who couldn't afford the big agency fees. It wasn't glamorous work, but Alfred liked the quiet, methodical pace of it.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was his client, a nervous-looking businessman named Marcus.

"Alfred, I need your help," Marcus said, glancing around the room nervously. "I've been getting these strange letters. They're always signed with a single letter: 'V'."

Alfred raised an eyebrow. "What kind of letters?"

"They're just random words and symbols. But the thing is, they always seem to be connected to me. I feel like someone is watching me all the time."

Alfred leaned back in his chair. This sounded like a classic stalking case, but something about it didn't sit right with him.

"I'll look into it," he said finally. "Can you tell me more about these letters?"

Marcus hesitated before pulling out a folder full of copies. Alfred began to scan the pages, his eyes scanning for any patterns or clues.

As he worked, Alfred's mind began to wander back to his old life with the CIA. He had seen some dark stuff in his time, but this...this was different.

It wasn't just the letters that bothered him - it was the feeling of being watched. It was a creeping sense of dread that Alfred couldn't shake.

Finally, after what felt like hours, Alfred sat back and looked up at Marcus. "I think I know who might be behind this," he said quietly.

Marcus's eyes widened in alarm. "Who?"

Alfred hesitated before speaking the words out loud: "V for Viktor Kuznetsov."

The name sent a shiver down Marcus's spine, but Alfred just nodded grimly. "He's an old enemy of mine from the CIA days. We've been on opposite sides of the conflict before."

Marcus's face went white. "What do you mean?"

Alfred stood up, his eyes scanning the room for any signs of danger. "Let's just say that Viktor Kuznetsov isn't someone to be trifled with. I'll take care of this for you, Marcus. But you need to promise me one thing: stay out of it."

Marcus nodded hastily, but Alfred could see the fear in his eyes. He knew that once he got involved, there was no turning back.

With a heavy heart, Alfred Abdi steeled himself for what was to come.
