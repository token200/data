Alfred Chia-wei was a man with a passion for botany and horticulture. He spent most of his days tending to the gardens at the local community center, where he had worked as a volunteer for over five years.

As Alfred Chia-wei went about his daily routine, pruning the roses and watering the vegetables, he couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. It was moments like these that reminded him why he loved his job so much – the gentle touch of the trowel in his hand, the smell of damp earth, and the quiet contentment of watching life grow.

But despite his love for gardening, Alfred Chia-wei's personal life had been struggling lately. His mother had fallen ill, and his father was away on business, unable to care for her himself. Alfred Chia-wei had taken it upon himself to be her primary caregiver, sacrificing his own needs in the process.

One day, as he was working in the garden, a group of children from the community center arrived, eager to learn about the different plants and flowers that grew there. Alfred Chia-wei was more than happy to oblige, spending hours with them, teaching them about the medicinal properties of certain herbs and the art of pollination.

As the afternoon wore on, one of the children approached him with a curious expression on his face. "Mr. Chia-wei," he said, "I've been wondering – why do you like gardening so much?" Alfred Chia-wei looked at him for a moment before smiling wistfully. "It's just that it makes me feel connected to the world around me," he explained. "And to the people I care about."

The child nodded thoughtfully, and Alfred Chia-wei couldn't help but feel a sense of pride. He knew that his love for gardening wasn't just about growing plants – it was about nurturing life, and finding meaning in the simple things.

As the sun began to set, Alfred Chia-wei bid farewell to the children and returned to his mother's bedside. He took her hand in his, feeling a sense of peace wash over him as he looked at her tired face. "I love you, Mom," he whispered softly. "And I'll be here for you, every step of the way."
