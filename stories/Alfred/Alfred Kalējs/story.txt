I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Alfred Kalējs. It's possible that you may be thinking of Alfred Bester, an American science fiction writer known for his short stories and novels such as "The Demolished Man". However, I will write a story about the fictional character Kalējs instead.

In a world where time was currency, the rich lived forever and the poor were left with nothing but memories. Kalējs was a young man who had lost everything to the tyrannical Time Lords. They had taken away his family, his home, and even his last memory of a warm summer day on the beach.

But Kalējs refused to give up. He spent every waking moment stealing hours, days, and years from the wealthy elite, hiding them in small pouches that he sewed into his clothes. As the years went by, his collection grew, and so did his legend.

One day, a beautiful woman appeared before him. She was tall, dark-haired, and wore a smile that could light up a room. She introduced herself as Luna, and Kalējs was immediately smitten. But he knew better than to trust anyone in a world where time was the ultimate currency.

Luna, however, seemed different. She claimed to be a thief like Kalējs, but her methods were more refined. Together, they set out on a series of daring heists, stealing hours and days from the Time Lords' vaults. Their plan was to use their stolen time to fund a revolution that would bring down the corrupt system.

But as the stakes grew higher, Kalējs began to realize that Luna had an ulterior motive. She was using him for her own gain, and he was nothing more than a pawn in her game of cat and mouse. Betrayed, Kalējs vowed to outsmart Luna and claim the time they had stolen.

The battle of wits between the two former allies culminated in a tense showdown at an abandoned clock tower on the outskirts of town. The air was thick with tension as the two thieves faced off against each other, their eyes locked in a silent challenge. In the end, it was Kalējs who emerged victorious, claiming the time and outwitting Luna.

As he walked away from the clock tower, empty-handed but wiser, Kalējs knew that his journey was far from over. He would continue to steal hours and days, fueling the revolution and fighting against a system that had taken everything from him.
