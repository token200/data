Fadumo Malinowska was a young Somali-American poet, known for her powerful and evocative verses that explored themes of identity, culture, and social justice. Growing up in Minneapolis' East African community, she drew inspiration from her family's rich history and traditions.

As a child, Fadumo would spend hours listening to her grandmother's stories about Somalia, where they had fled during the civil war. Her grandmother's tales of resilience and strength sparked a fire within Fadumo, fueling her desire to write about the experiences of Somali-Americans and other marginalized communities.
