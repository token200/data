She began writing her own poetry at the age of 10, using it as a way to express her feelings and opinions about the world around her.

As she grew older, Fadumo became increasingly involved in the Somali feminist movement. She attended conferences and workshops, where she met like-minded individuals who shared her passion for creating positive change. Her poetry became a powerful tool for activism, inspiring women to stand up for their rights and challenge patriarchal norms.

Despite facing opposition and persecution from some quarters, Fadumo continued to write and speak out. Her poetry was published in various publications, both within Somalia and internationally, earning her recognition as one of the leading voices of her generation.

Fadumo Müller's work extended beyond the realm of poetry, however. She was also a fierce advocate for education and women's empowerment. She worked tirelessly with organizations to promote literacy programs and support women-led initiatives.

Throughout her life, Fadumo remained committed to using her words as a force for good. Her legacy continues to inspire new generations of Somali women and activists around the world.
