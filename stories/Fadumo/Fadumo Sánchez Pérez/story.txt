Fadumo Sánchez Pérez sat in her small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and forgotten trinkets. She stared out the window, lost in thought as the sun set over the city below.

As a renowned scholar of Somali literature, Fadumo's mind was always whirling with ideas and theories. But tonight, she felt stuck. Her latest research project, focused on the works of Somalia's famous poet, Piri Rehes, had hit a roadblock.

Fadumo sighed, rubbing her temples in frustration. She had spent years studying the poetry of her ancestors, pouring over ancient texts and seeking out every manuscript she could find. But no matter how hard she tried, she just couldn't seem to crack the code on one particular poem.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was her friend, Amal, who had stopped by with a plate of freshly baked injera bread and a steaming cup of tea.

"Ah, Fadumo, I heard you were having some trouble," Amal said, setting down the tray on the kitchen table.

Fadumo looked up, a hint of surprise on her face. "Amal, how did you know?"

"I've been watching you from afar, my friend," Amal replied with a smile. "You're as stuck as ever."

The two women sat down to eat and chat, discussing everything from politics to pop culture. As they talked, Fadumo began to feel her mind clearing. She realized that she had been so focused on the poem that she had forgotten to enjoy the process of research itself.

With newfound clarity, Fadumo closed her eyes and let Amal's words wash over her. She felt a sense of peace settle in, like a warm breeze on a summer day.

As the night wore on, Fadumo opened her eyes and picked up a pen. She began to write, letting her thoughts flow onto the page. The words flowed effortlessly, like water over smooth stone.

When she finally put down her pen, Fadumo felt exhilarated. She had solved the mystery of the poem, and in doing so, had discovered something new about herself.

"Thank you, Amal," she said, smiling gratefully at her friend. "I think I've finally found my way again."

Amal smiled back, happy to have helped. "You're always finding your way, Fadumo. You just need a little push sometimes."
