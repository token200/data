Fadumo "Fae" Schulz was a 25-year-old Somali-American artist known for her vibrant street art and unapologetic social commentary. Growing up in Minneapolis's North Side, Fae often felt like an outsider, but her experiences shaped her unique perspective on identity, culture, and community.

As a child, Fae spent hours watching traditional Somalian films with her grandmother, learning about the rich history and customs of their ancestral homeland. These early influences sparked a passion for art that would eventually lead her to pursue a degree in fine arts from the University of Minnesota.

After college, Fae began to make a name for herself on Minneapolis's thriving street art scene. Her bold murals and wheatpasted posters tackled topics like police brutality, immigration reform, and social justice. People took notice of the 5'8" firecracker with the bright smile and infectious energy, often approaching her to discuss the meaning behind her work.

One evening, as Fae was preparing for an upcoming show at a local gallery, she received a phone call from a friend – a Somali refugee who had been forced to flee their homeland due to war. The friend invited Fae to join them for dinner, hoping to connect with someone who understood the complexities of living between two worlds.

Over plate after plate of injera bread and lentil stew, Fae listened intently as her friend shared stories of struggle and resilience. She realized that her art wasn't just about expressing herself – it was also a way to amplify the voices of those often silenced or marginalized. This epiphany solidified Fadumo "Fae" Schulz's commitment to using her platform to uplift and educate others.

As she returned home, Fae felt a renewed sense of purpose. With every brushstroke, she knew that she was carrying the torch for the countless Somalis and Somali-Americans who had paved the way before her. Her art would continue to be a reflection of her experiences, as well as a testament to the power of community and identity.
