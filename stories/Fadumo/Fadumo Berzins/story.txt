Fadumo Berzins stepped off the plane and onto the dusty tarmac, her worn leather boots making a soft scuffling sound on the ground. She had been traveling for days, and the exhaustion was starting to catch up with her. As she made her way through customs, Fadumo Berzins's mind began to wander back to her life in Mogadishu.

She had grown up on the streets of Somalia's capital city, surviving by her wits and her fists. Her early years were marked by poverty and hardship, but Fadumo Berzins had always managed to find a way out. She had learned to speak multiple languages, including English and Arabic, and had even taught herself how to fix cars.

As she emerged from the airport, Fadumo Berzins was greeted by her sister, Amina, who had come to meet her at the other end of the plane. The two sisters hugged tightly, both of them trying to contain their tears of joy.

Fadumo Berzins had been invited to speak at a conference in Cairo, where she would be sharing her story with a crowd of young women from across Africa. She was nervous about the speaking engagement, but she knew that it could be a game-changer for her life back home.

As they drove through the desert landscape, Amina asked Fadumo Berzins about her plans for the future. Fadumo Berzins thought for a moment before responding. "I want to start a business," she said finally. "Something that will bring women like me out of poverty and into the workforce."

Amina smiled, her eyes shining with pride. "You'll do it, Fadumo Berzins," she said. "You're one of the smartest and most resourceful people I know."

Fadumo Berzins smiled back, feeling a sense of determination wash over her. She knew that the road ahead would be tough, but she was ready for the challenge. With her sister by her side, Fadumo Berzins felt like she could conquer anything.
