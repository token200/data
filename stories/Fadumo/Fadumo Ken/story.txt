In the heart of Mogadishu, Somalia, a young girl named Fadumo Ken grew up with a passion for music and dance. Born to a family of modest means, Fadumo's parents encouraged her creative spirit, providing her with access to traditional instruments and instruction from local musicians.

Her peers looked up to her as a talented young artist, and soon, word of her talent spread throughout the city.

Fadumo Ken's big break came when she was discovered by a local music producer, who offered her a record deal.
