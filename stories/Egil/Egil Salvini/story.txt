Egil Salvini stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his piercing green eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As a notorious mercenary, he had seen his fair share of battles and had earned a reputation for being one of the most feared warriors in the land.

The patrons parted as Egil Salvini made his way to the bar, their whispers and nods of respect filling the air. The bartender, a gruff old man with a thick beard, looked up at him with a mixture of curiosity and wariness.

"What can I get you, Egil Salvini?" he asked, using the mercenary's full name as if it was a badge of honor.

"Just a pint of your finest ale, please," Egil Salvini replied, his deep voice rumbling through the room.

As he waited for his drink to arrive, Egil Salvini took in his surroundings. The tavern was a seedy little place, the kind of establishment that catered to the underworld crowd. He spotted a group of rough-looking men huddled in the corner, their faces lit only by the flickering flames of their lanterns.

Egil Salvini's gaze lingered on them for a moment before he turned his attention back to the bartender. "I'm looking for information," he said, his voice low and even.

The bartender raised an eyebrow, clearly intrigued. "What kind of information?"

"I'm searching for a man named Grimgar Ironfist," Egil Salvini replied, his eyes narrowing as he waited for the bartender's response.

The bartender leaned in close, his voice barely above a whisper. "I don't know what you're talking about, mercenary."

Egil Salvini smiled, a cold glint in his eye. "Don't play dumb with me, bartender. I've heard rumors of a man matching that description, and I aim to find out if they're true."

The bartender nodded, seeming to come to a realization. "Alright, Egil Salvini. I'll give you the information you seek. But be warned: Grimgar Ironfist is not someone to be trifled with."

Egil Salvini's expression remained stoic, but his eyes sparkled with interest. He knew that he was on the cusp of uncovering a valuable secret, one that would cement his reputation as one of the most formidable warriors in the land.
