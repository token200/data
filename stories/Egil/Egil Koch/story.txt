Egil Koch was a man with a reputation. A former hitman, he had built a name for himself in the shadows of organized crime, striking fear into the hearts of those who dared to cross him. But after years of living on the wrong side of the law, Egil had finally decided it was time to retire.

He left the game behind and started fresh in a small town on the outskirts of Germany, where no one knew his true identity. He took up a quiet life as a baker, specializing in traditional German pastries and breads that quickly gained a loyal following from the locals.

Egil's new life was peaceful, almost serene. He spent his days mixing dough and kneading bread, surrounded by the comforting smells of yeast and flour. His nights were spent reading books by the fire, lost in the pages of a Dickens novel or the poetry of Goethe.

But despite the tranquil surface of Egil's existence, there were whispers that followed him everywhere he went. Whispers that hinted at a past life filled with bloodshed and betrayal. Some said he was still involved in the underworld, using his skills to manipulate and control from behind the scenes.

Egil knew these rumors, and he took them with a grain of salt. He had long since burned his bridges, leaving behind the only life he knew for a chance at redemption. Still, the old habits died hard, and on occasion, when the moon was full and the night air carried an eerie chill, Egil would catch himself twitching like a man on edge.

One evening, as he was closing up his bakery, a young woman approached him with a worried look on her face. "Mr. Koch," she said softly, "I've heard so much about you. I'm one of your customers, and I have to say, your bread is incredible."

Egil smiled warmly, grateful for the distraction from his troubled thoughts. As they chatted, he noticed something peculiar - this young woman seemed different from the others who came into his shop. She had a sense of quiet confidence about her that put Egil on guard.

"What's your story?" he asked, curiosity piqued.

The woman smiled enigmatically and leaned in close. "Let's just say I've got a few secrets of my own, Mr. Koch."

As she turned to leave, Egil caught a glimpse of something glinting at her wrist - a silver locket with an image etched onto its surface that sent a shiver down his spine.

For the first time in years, Egil felt a thrill of uncertainty. Could it be true? Was this young woman more than just another innocent customer? He watched as she disappeared into the night, feeling an old itch stirring beneath his skin once again.
