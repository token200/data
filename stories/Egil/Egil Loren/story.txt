Egil Loren stepped into the dimly lit tavern, the smell of stale ale and sweat hitting him like a slap in the face. He had been traveling for days, and the thought of another night on the road was starting to wear thin. The sign above the bar creaked in the wind, reading "The Black Swan Inn" in letters that seemed to be mocking him.

As he made his way through the crowded room, Egil's eyes scanned the patrons with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. He had heard rumors about this place - whispers of dark magic and ancient rituals performed in secret chambers beneath the inn. The locals would smile and shake their heads when asked, but Egil knew better than to believe everything he was told.

He spotted a lone figure sitting at the bar, huddled over a mug of ale that seemed to be slowly disappearing into nothingness. There was something about this person that caught his eye - perhaps it was the way they seemed completely out of place in this seedy tavern, or maybe it was just the aura of quiet intensity that surrounded them.

Egil ambled over to the bar, his boots scraping against the wooden floorboards. "Ale," he said, dropping a coin onto the counter.

The bartender, a gruff old man with a thick beard and sunken eyes, looked up at him with a mixture of curiosity and hostility. "What's your business here?" he growled.

Egil hesitated for a moment before answering. There was something about this place that made him want to tread carefully, like walking on hot coals without looking down. "Just passing through," he said finally, his voice low and neutral.

The bartender nodded, but his eyes narrowed slightly as if he wasn't quite convinced. Egil took another look at the figure sitting alone at the bar - it was a woman, her long black hair cascading down her back like a waterfall of night. She seemed to be staring into space, lost in some private world that only she could see.

Without thinking, Egil found himself drifting towards her, his footsteps silent on the wooden floorboards. The bartender raised an eyebrow as he approached, but didn't intervene when Egil slid onto the stool beside the woman.

She turned to him, their eyes meeting for a moment before glazing over into something else entirely. "Who are you?" she asked finally, her voice barely above a whisper.

Egil smiled wryly. "Someone who's been around," he said, his voice low and mysterious.
