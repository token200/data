Egil Pelz stepped out of his small, cluttered office and into the bright morning sunlight. He was a man of few words, with a reputation for being one of the most cunning and ruthless traders in all of Scandinavia.

As he made his way through the bustling streets of Oslo, Egil's mind was already focused on the day's agenda: meeting with his rival, Gunnar Nordhagen, to negotiate a deal that would secure Pelz's position as the dominant player in the region's fur trade.

Egil had built his empire from scratch, using every trick in the book to outmaneuver and outbid his competitors. He was a master of the art of negotiation, able to talk his way into (and out of) almost any situation.

As he walked, Egil's thoughts turned to his own family. His wife, Helga, had passed away just a year ago, leaving him to care for their young daughter, Astrid. He had done everything in his power to provide for her, but it was a constant struggle.

Despite the demands of running his business, Egil always made time for his daughter. He would often take her on long walks through the forest, teaching her about the importance of perseverance and cunning in the pursuit of success.

As he arrived at the agreed meeting point with Gunnar, Egil could feel the tension between them. These were two men who had a long history of rivalry, and today's meeting was no exception.

"Ah, Pelz," Gunnar said, his voice dripping with disdain. "I see you're still as slippery as ever."

Egil smiled, a cold, calculating smile. "I'm here to make business sense, Nordhagen. Not to engage in personal vendettas."

The two men spent the next several hours haggling over prices and terms, but Egil remained steadfast, always keeping his eye on the prize.

In the end, they reached an agreement that would benefit both parties, and Egil left the meeting feeling triumphant. He had outmaneuvered Gunnar once again, solidifying his position as the dominant player in the region's fur trade.

As he walked back to his office, Egil couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. He may not have had much success with women, but he was a master of the business world. And that was all that truly mattered.

He arrived at his office, took off his hat and sat down behind his desk, then picked up the phone and dialed Astrid's number. "Hello, my dear," he said, his voice filled with warmth. "I have a deal to tell you about..."
