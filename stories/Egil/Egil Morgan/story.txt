Egil Morgan stepped out of his worn leather jacket and surveyed the dimly lit bar. The air reeked of stale cigarettes and yesterday's whiskey, but to him, it was home. He slid onto a stool at the end of the counter, next to a gruff-looking bartender with a scruffy beard.

"Eggy," he rasped, without looking up from polishing a mug. "What can I get you?"

"Just a whiskey, neat," Egil replied, his deep voice rumbling like thunder on a summer night. He'd been coming to this dive for years, and the bartender knew him better than anyone else in town.

The bartender grunted and poured Egil a generous shot. As he handed it over, Egil tossed a crumpled twenty-dollar bill onto the counter. "Keep change," he said with a smirk.

Egil took his drink and slid down the stool to the end of the bar. He leaned against the wall, letting the cool night air seep into his bones. The patrons were rowdy, laughing and shouting over rounds of pool or the latest sports game on TV. But Egil just sat there, nursing his whiskey like it was the only thing that mattered.

He'd always been a loner, preferring the quiet darkness to the chaos of everyday life. Growing up in foster care had made him wary of people – their smiles were like promises he knew would break eventually. As an adult, he'd built walls around himself, and few dared to try and breach them.

But sometimes, when the whiskey was flowing and his defenses were down, Egil's thoughts turned to his past. He remembered playing guitar in a traveling band, feeling alive for the first time in years. Or the night he met Rachel – a fiery redhead who'd laughed at him like nobody else ever had, until her smile was lost behind a sea of tears.

The bartender refilled Egil's glass as he gazed into his drink, lost in memories. People came and went, their stories as fleeting as summer sunsets. But Egil Morgan remained – steadfast, unmoving, like the shadows on the walls that never chased him away. When night fell, he found solace in this bar, surrounded by strangers who'd become temporary friends.

The music faded into silence as Egil's thoughts returned to the present. He took another sip of his whiskey, letting it warm his chest before saying, "Thanks for the drink, Gus."

Gus scowled but poured himself a shot from the shelf behind him. "You know you're welcome, kid."
