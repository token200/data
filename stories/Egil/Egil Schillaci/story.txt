With lightning speed, Egil snatched the diamond from its pedestal and slipped into the shadows. The auctioneer's voice boomed through the hall, none the wiser to the theft. Egil smiled to himself as he vanished into the night, the Starlight Diamond safely in his possession.

Back at his hideout, Egil Schillaci carefully examined the gemstone under a jeweler's loupe. He marveled at its beauty and historical significance, knowing that this prize would set him up for life.

Egil leaned back in his chair, sipping champagne as he surveyed his kingdom of stolen treasures. The Starlight Diamond sat proudly on his mantle, a symbol of his unparalleled skill and cunning. And as he smiled to himself, the sound of shattering glass echoed from outside - the next target was already within reach.
