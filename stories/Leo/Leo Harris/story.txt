Leo Harris stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the glittering city below. The neon lights of skyscrapers reflected off his sunglasses, and the cool night breeze whipped through his dark hair. He was a man on a mission, always chasing his next thrill.

As a former Special Forces operative turned private investigator, Leo had seen it all. From high-stakes heists to murder investigations, he'd dealt with it all. But tonight, he was on the hunt for something more personal - answers about his sister's disappearance five years ago.

Leo's eyes scanned the rooftops, searching for any sign of movement. His gut told him she was close, that her kidnapper had left a trail too faint to follow. He checked his phone for what felt like the hundredth time, the screen casting an eerie glow over the cityscape. No messages from anyone - not even his old handler at the Agency.

A flicker of light caught his eye - a black SUV parked on the adjacent rooftop, its engine purring softly. Leo's instincts screamed danger. He crept closer, phone at the ready, as he scanned for security cameras and potential escape routes.

The vehicle's side door slid open with a hiss, revealing two men in black tactical gear. They were heavily armed and looked like they hadn't slept in days. One of them caught Leo's eye - his jawline was sharp, his eyes a piercing blue that seemed to bore into Leo's very soul.

"You're the one who's been following me," Leo growled, hand on the grip of his gun.

The man smirked, voice low and menacing. "We've been watching you for months, Harris. You're getting close."

Leo's grip tightened on his pistol as he backed away from the SUV. He knew this was it - either he took them down or they took him out. The stakes were too high to back down.

Without hesitation, Leo lunged at the men, using every trick in the book to take them down one by one. Sweat dripped down his face as he fought for control of the rooftop, the sounds of gunfire echoing off the skyscrapers.

When it was over, and the last man lay still, Leo leaned against a ventilation unit, chest heaving with exhaustion. He pulled off his sunglasses, gazing out at the city with newfound determination. The night had revealed nothing concrete, but for the first time in years, Leo felt like he was on the right track.

With phone clutched tightly in hand, Leo began to dial - this time, it was going to be different. This time, he wouldn't stop until he found his sister and brought her home.
