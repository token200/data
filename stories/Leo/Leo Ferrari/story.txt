Born into a family of modest means, Leo's early life was marked by hardship and struggle. Despite these challenges, his parents encouraged his artistic inclinations, providing him with makeshift studios and materials to hone his craft. This self-taught education served Leo well, allowing him to develop a unique style that blended elements of surrealism and abstract expressionism.
