Borys Wiśniewska stepped into the old antique shop, his eyes scanning the dusty shelves for any sign of life. The store's owner, an elderly man with a bushy white beard, looked up from behind the counter and nodded in greeting.

"Ah, Borys Wiśniewska, welcome back," he said, his voice low and raspy. "I see you're still searching for that rare violin."

Borys nodded, his eyes locked on a small, intricately carved music box sitting atop a nearby shelf. "Yes, I need it to finish the commission I'm working on."

The old man smiled, his eyes twinkling with knowledge. "Ah, yes. That's a rare piece, indeed. Made by one of the finest craftsmen of the 19th century."

Borys carefully made his way over to the music box, examining it from every angle. The intricate carvings seemed to dance in the faint light filtering through the dusty windows.

"How much?" he asked, knowing that this item would be a significant addition to his collection.

The old man leaned forward, his voice barely above a whisper. "I'll let it go for...500 złotys."

Borys hesitated for a moment before nodding, reaching into his pocket to produce the required cash. As he handed over the money, the old man pressed a small, hidden compartment open on the music box, revealing a delicate silver key nestled inside.

"For you," he said with a smile, winking at Borys Wiśniewska.

Borys beamed with delight, carefully taking the music box and tucking it into his pocket. He knew that this was going to be the crowning jewel of his collection, one that would cement his reputation as a master restorer of rare instruments.

With the music box safely in hand, Borys left the shop, feeling a sense of satisfaction wash over him. It had been a long and arduous search, but he knew that it was all worth it in the end. And now, with this new addition to his collection, he was one step closer to achieving his dream.

As he walked away from the shop, Borys Wiśniewska couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. He had outsmarted the system, found the elusive music box, and proved himself once again as a master of his craft.

The old man watched him go with a knowing smile, happy to have made a sale to one who truly appreciated the beauty of art and craftsmanship.
