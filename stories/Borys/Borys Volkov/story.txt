Despite his reputation as a thief, Borys Volkov was not without his motivations. He had a code, one that dictated that he only target those who were truly deserving of his particular brand of justice. His latest mark was a corrupt businessman who had been embezzling funds meant for the city's poor. Borys Volkov saw this as the perfect opportunity to strike.

As he watched from the shadows, the businessman left his mansion, unaware that he was being followed by a man with a taste for revenge.

As he vanished into the night, Borys Volkov couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. It was moments like these that reminded him why he did what he did. He was a force for change in a city that often seemed too dull and mundane. And with his next mark already in sight, Borys Volkov set off into the unknown, ready to weave another spell of intrigue and deception.
