Borys Esquivel stepped into the crowded café, his bright blue eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. As a freelance writer, he had grown accustomed to working from eclectic coffee shops and bustling bookstores. But today, he was on a mission to meet with an old friend.

As he waited in line, Borys Esquivel checked his watch for what felt like the hundredth time. He had promised Maria that they would meet at 2 pm sharp, and he wasn't one to keep people waiting. When it was finally his turn to order, he asked for a black coffee and took a seat by the window.

Just as he was about to check his phone, a figure emerged from the crowd and spotted him. "Borys Esquivel!" Maria exclaimed, her dark hair bobbing up and down as she hurried towards him. The two friends shared a warm hug, exchanging whispered promises of what they would discuss over their coffee.

Over steaming cups, Borys Esquivel and Maria delved into topics both personal and professional. As a writer, he was always eager to hear about her latest endeavors – be it research for an upcoming novel or the intricacies of teaching creative writing classes at the local community college.

As they chatted, Borys Esquivel found himself reminiscing about their late-night conversations in college, where they had first discussed the merits of existentialism and social justice. It was comforting to see that some things remained unchanged – Maria's quick wit, her infectious laugh, and her unwavering passion for storytelling.

As their time together drew to a close, Borys Esquivel knew he would have to return to his own work soon. He scribbled down a few notes in his journal, inspired by Maria's tales of adventure and growth. With renewed energy and inspiration, he felt ready to tackle the challenges ahead – armed with the knowledge that some friendships could transcend time and distance.

As Borys Esquivel left the café, he took one last look at Maria before disappearing into the bustling streets, promising himself to stay in touch and share more of his own stories soon.
