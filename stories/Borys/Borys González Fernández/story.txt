Borys González Fernández was a man with a passion for music that took him to the streets of Rio de Janeiro. As a young boy growing up in the favelas, he would often sneak out to listen to the samba bands playing in the alleys, mesmerized by the rhythm and energy of the drums.

Years later, Borys González Fernández had become one of Brazil's most renowned percussionists, known for his infectious beats and dynamic stage presence. He had spent years honing his craft, studying under some of Rio's greatest musicians, and performing with top bands.

One day, while walking through the city streets, Borys González Fernández stumbled upon a small community center where a group of kids were gathered, eager to learn music from their idol.

As the days turned into weeks, Borys González Fernández found himself spending more and more time at the community center, sharing his knowledge and passion with the next generation of musicians. He saw in them a spark that reminded him of himself when he was younger, full of fire and determination to make music.

The children were fascinated by Borys González Fernández's stories of performing for thousands at festivals like Carnaval, but they were equally captivated by his humble beginnings. They asked questions about the struggles he faced growing up in the favelas, and how music became his escape.

As the weeks passed, Borys González Fernández watched as the children grew more confident behind their drums, their rhythms becoming stronger and more complex. He saw the fire that had once burned within him ignite within them, and he knew that he was doing something right.
