I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Borys Kalniņš. However, I found that there is a Latvian professional footballer named Borys Kalniņš. He was born in 1986 and played for several clubs including Latvija and Dinaburg.

If you would like, I can create a fictional story about the Latvian footballer Borys Kalniņš. Please let me know if that's what you're looking for. Here is a 400-word story:

Borys Kalniņš laced up his cleats, feeling the familiar weight of his football boots on his feet. He had played the sport since he was a child, and now as a seasoned professional, he felt most at home on the pitch.

As he took to the field for Dinaburg's match against their arch-rivals, Latvija, Borys couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. This was where it all began for him - his love of football, his passion for the game that had brought him so much joy and fulfillment.

The whistle blew, and the match was underway. Borys sprinted down the wing, his feet pounding the earth as he chased after the ball. He dodged opponents with ease, his quick reflexes allowing him to make impossible plays.

As the match wore on, Dinaburg found themselves trailing behind Latvija by a goal. But Borys was determined to change that. With a burst of speed, he broke free from his defender and shot the ball into the net, leveling the score at 1-1.

The crowd erupted in cheers as Borys celebrated with his teammates. This was what it meant to be a footballer - to give everything you had on the pitch, to leave it all out there for your team.

As the match drew to a close, Dinaburg emerged victorious, thanks in large part to Borys's crucial goal. As he left the field, exhausted but elated, he knew that this was just one of many victories still to come. He had come a long way since his childhood days playing on makeshift fields in Riga, and he wouldn't stop until he had brought home every championship for Dinaburg.

Borys's passion for football burned brighter than ever, and he knew that no matter what lay ahead, he would always be ready to put it all on the line for his team.
