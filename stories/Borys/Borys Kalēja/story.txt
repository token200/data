Undeterred by the risks, Borys Kalēja plunged headfirst into his research, pouring over financial records and conducting interviews with whistleblowers. He was driven by a sense of justice and a desire to expose those who were taking advantage of others.

One evening, as he was leaving the office, Borys received a cryptic message from an anonymous source. The note read: "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight if you want to uncover the truth." Intrigued, Borys decided to take a chance and headed to the location.

At midnight, he arrived at the clock tower, where he was greeted by a figure shrouded in shadows. As they spoke, it became clear that this mysterious source was none other than a former business partner of one of the city's most powerful tycoons.
