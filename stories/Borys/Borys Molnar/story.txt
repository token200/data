Borys Molnar stepped into the small café, his eyes scanning the room for any familiar faces. He spotted her in the corner, sipping a cup of coffee and staring out the window. Borys Molnar made his way over to her, his worn leather boots scuffling against the floor.

As he approached, she looked up and caught his eye. "Hey," she said, a hint of a smile playing on her lips.

Borys Molnar sat down across from her, ordering a cup of black coffee as they chatted. They talked about nothing in particular – just the usual – but it was enough to fill the silence between them.

It had been months since Borys Molnar last saw his friend, and he couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt for not being more involved in her life lately. But he'd been busy with work, trying to make ends meet after losing his job at the factory. Borys Molnar knew that wasn't an excuse, though.

As they talked, the café began to fill with more patrons. The sounds of clinking dishes and murmured conversations created a warm background hum. Borys Molnar felt his worries begin to fade away, replaced by the simple pleasure of being in her presence.

After a while, she glanced at her watch and stood up. "I should probably get going," she said, her voice firm but friendly.

Borys Molnar walked her out, taking a deep breath of the cool evening air as they stepped onto the sidewalk. They stood there for a moment, looking at each other in the fading light. Borys Molnar felt a sense of gratitude wash over him – he was lucky to have friends like this one.

As she turned to leave, he called out, "Hey, take care, okay?"

She nodded and smiled before disappearing into the crowd. Borys Molnar watched her go, feeling a small sense of peace settle over him. He knew that life could be unpredictable, but moments like these made it all worth it.

He stood there for a moment longer, his eyes drifting back to the café. Borys Molnar knew he'd see her again soon – maybe not today, but eventually. And when he did, they would pick up right where they left off.
