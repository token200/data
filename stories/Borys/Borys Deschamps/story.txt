One day, a young girl wandered into Borys Deschamps's studio, her eyes wide with wonder as she took in the vibrant colors and swirling patterns on the walls. She introduced herself as Sophie, and Borys was taken by her innocence and curiosity. He spent hours talking to Sophie, sharing his stories and teaching her the secrets of art.

As the days turned into weeks, Sophie became like a daughter to Borys Deschamps. She would sit for hours at his easel, watching as he brought his visions to life on canvas. And when she finally left to continue her own journey, Borys felt a sense of loss that he had never felt before.
