One fateful day, Publius Nielsen found himself at the center of a major controversy when it was discovered that he had secretly met with an enemy of Rome.

Despite the scandal, Publius Nielsen emerged from the affair with even greater stature than before. His reputation as a shrewd politician and master strategist was cemented, and he continued to play a major role in shaping Roman policy for many years to come. As Publius Nielsen looked out over the bustling streets of Rome, he knew that his name would be remembered for generations to come.
