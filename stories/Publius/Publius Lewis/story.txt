Publius Lewis smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "Indeed, I have. Your spices have been said to possess extraordinary properties. I would be honored to sample them further." The old man handed him a small pouch filled with fragrant herbs, and Publius Lewis took a deep sniff, savoring the complex aromas.
