Lukas Esquivel was a man with a mysterious past. Born to a family of nomads who traveled through the vast deserts and mountains of South America, he grew up surrounded by the rugged beauty of the wilderness. As Lukas Esquivel, he had always felt a sense of restlessness, as if there was more to life than the endless journeys of his youth.

After years of traveling with his family, Lukas Esquivel set out on his own, determined to make a name for himself in the world beyond the nomadic lifestyle. He settled in a small town, where he worked as a blacksmith and began to build a new life for himself.
