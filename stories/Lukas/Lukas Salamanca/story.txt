Lukas Salamanca sat at his desk, sipping on a cup of strong coffee as he stared out the window at the bustling streets of Albuquerque. As the youngest son of Gus Fring's former partner, Hector Salamanca, Lukas had grown up with a sense of entitlement and a desire to prove himself.

Lukas was a ruthless and cunning individual, always looking for ways to increase his power and influence in the city's underworld. He had built a reputation as a skilled manipulator and player, always staying one step ahead of his enemies and allies alike.

Despite his tough exterior, Lukas had a soft spot for those in need, particularly children and the poor. This sense of compassion was rare among his peers, who saw him as nothing more than a ruthless opportunist.

One day, as he was reviewing a stack of financial reports from one of his many businesses, he received an unexpected visit from an old friend - Walter White. The former high school chemistry teacher turned meth kingpin had been out of the picture for some time, but Lukas knew that Walter's skills and knowledge would be invaluable to him.

"Hey kid," Walter said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "I hear you're looking to get into the game big time."

Lukas raised an eyebrow. "And I hear you've got a few tricks up your sleeve, too."

Walter chuckled, taking a seat in the chair opposite Lukas. "You know me, Salamanca. Always willing to lend a hand... for a price."

As they talked, it became clear that Walter was looking for a way out of his current situation - a spot of trouble had led him to believe he was going down and needed someone to help him cut his losses.

Lukas listened intently as Walter outlined his plan. He saw an opportunity - a chance to gain the upper hand in Albuquerque's underworld by helping Walter take care of his enemies.

"Alright, kid," Lukas said with a smile. "I'm in. What do we need to do?"

Walter grinned back at him. "Leave that to me, Salamanca. You just follow my lead."

As they shook hands, a plan was born. Together, Lukas and Walter set out on a journey of revenge and retribution, seeking to destroy the enemies who had wronged them both.

Their partnership would change the face of Albuquerque's underworld forever, but it wouldn't be without its costs - some were bound to get hurt along the way...
