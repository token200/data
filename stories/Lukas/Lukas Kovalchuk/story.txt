Lukas Kovalchuk wiped the sweat from his forehead as he walked off the ice. Another grueling practice session in the books, and his team still wasn't quite where they wanted to be. As captain of the New Jersey Devils, it was his job to push them to be their best.

As he made his way back to the locker room, Lukas couldn't help but think about how far they'd come since last season. They'd lost a string of close games and had struggled to find consistency in front of goal. But this year, he could see the spark in their eyes - a determination to prove themselves.

Lukas flopped down onto his stall, kicking off his skates and letting out a sigh of relief. His assistant coach, Tom Fitzgerald, poked his head into the room. "Hey, Cap, you want some advice?"

Lukas raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "What is it?"

Fitzgerald nodded towards Lukas' phone, which was still ringing from the pre-practice call with their GM. "He wants to talk to you about making a trade."

Lukas' mind went blank for a moment before he snapped back into focus. The Devils were in desperate need of another top-six forward, and if someone was willing to send over a quality player... it just made sense.

"What do I say?" he asked, already knowing the answer.

"Tell him we're open to listening," Fitzgerald replied with a smile. "But don't make any promises."

Lukas nodded, making a mental note to have Fitzgerald draft out some possible scenarios. It was time for the Devils to start winning - and Lukas Kovalchuk had a feeling that this season might just be it.

As he picked up his phone and began scrolling through messages from their GM, Lukas couldn't help but think about how far they'd come as a team. There were ups and downs, of course - injuries and losses - but when the dust settled, there was one thing that always stayed constant: the fire in their bellies.

Lukas took a deep breath and answered his GM's call, ready to take on whatever this season had in store for him and his team. Bring it on, he thought with a grin. We're ready.
