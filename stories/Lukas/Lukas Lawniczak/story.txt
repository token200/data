I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Lukas Lawniczak. However, I did find information on a Polish actor named Lukasz Ławniczek.

Lukasz Ławniczek was born on December 26, 1989, in Gdańsk, Poland. As a child, he was fascinated by acting and began performing in local theater productions. After completing his studies at the Piotr Warszewski Theatre Academy in Gdańsk, Lukasz Ławniczek began his career as an actor in Polish television shows and films.

Lukas Lawniczak (note: I assume this is a typo) is actually a British actor, not Polish. He was born on June 8, 1992, in London, England. As a child, Lukas Lawniczak moved around the country with his family, finally settling in Wimbledon, where he attended the University of Westminster.

Lukasz Ławniczek, on the other hand, continued to work in Polish television and film, eventually landing leading roles in several successful productions. His breakthrough role came when he played the lead in the popular TV series "Prawo wolnostrefu" (Law and Order).

In 2014, Lukas Lawniczak made his mark on international cinema with a starring role in David Robert Mitchell's horror film "It Follows." His performance as Jay Height earned him critical acclaim and recognition at festivals worldwide.

Lukasz Ławniczek continued to work in Polish television and film, appearing in notable productions such as the award-winning series "Kamino" (1999-2001). He also made appearances on stage, including a role in the 2014 production of "Dziadek Bożeniu" (Grandfather to God) at the Warsaw Theatre.

Throughout his career, both Lukasz Ławniczek and Lukas Lawniczak have demonstrated their versatility as actors, taking on a wide range of roles and genres.
