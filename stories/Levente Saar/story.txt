Levente Saar trudged through the snow-covered streets, his boots making soft crunching sounds as he walked. He was late for work again, and his boss would have his head on a platter if he knew that Levente had spent the entire morning sipping coffee and browsing the latest online memes.

As he turned onto his street, Levente noticed something peculiar. The windows of his apartment building were all dark, except for one - number 314. A faint light flickered from within, casting an otherworldly glow on the snowy ground below.

Curiosity piqued, Levente quickened his pace and entered the building. He rode the elevator to the third floor, getting off just in front of apartment 314. The light emanating from within seemed stronger now, and he could hear muffled humming coming from inside.

Levente hesitated for a moment before knocking on the door. There was no response, but the humming grew louder, almost deafening. He knocked again, harder this time, but still nothing. A shiver ran down his spine as he realized that the light and the noise seemed to be coming from somewhere inside the apartment, rather than emanating from a lamp or TV.

The building's management had been complaining about strange noises and smells wafting from number 314 for weeks now. Levente's neighbor, Mrs. Bíró, had told him about some weird rituals she'd overheard being performed late at night by the occupant of that apartment.

Levente knew he shouldn't be snooping around, but something compelled him to investigate further. He slipped his phone into his pocket and carefully tried the door handle. To his surprise, it swung open easily.

"Hello?" Levente called out, taking a step inside. The humming had grown louder still, vibrating through every cell in his body.

He walked through the darkened apartment, stumbling over discarded boxes and piles of old clothes. Everything seemed disheveled and chaotic, as if someone had been frantically packing or unpacking without much care.

Levente's eyes adjusted to the dim light, revealing an unrecognizable space. The once-white walls were now covered in a tangled web of black cables and strange symbols scrawled in marker or crayon. In the center of the room, Levente spotted his neighbor - a young woman named Réka, with sunken eyes and wild-looking hair.

Réka stared back at Levente, her gaze unfocused. She seemed lost in some sort of trance, oblivious to the world around her.

"Réka?" Levente asked gently, trying not to startle her. "What's going on here?"

The woman didn't respond, but instead let out a low moan that harmonized with the pulsing noise filling the room. Her hands floated above the scattered cables and symbols as if attempting to connect or dislodge something.

Levente watched in confusion as Réka started moving around the room, her fingers dancing over the strange markings on the walls. She seemed... channeling? A phrase from an old TV show echoed through his mind - some sort of dark energy was manifesting here.

Without thinking, Levente took a step closer to Réka, trying to make sense of what he saw. His phone slipped from his pocket and clattered onto the floor as Réka's hands suddenly froze mid-air.

Levente turned to retrieve it but found himself facing something truly bizarre: Réka had now stopped humming altogether, her eyes snapping open with a look that sent shivers down Levente's spine. It was almost as if she was regarding him not as a neighbor or acquaintance, but as an outsider who'd stumbled into some dark and forbidden realm.

"What... what do you want here?" Réka stammered, voice shaking between gasps for breath.

Levente hesitated, unsure of how to answer. He knew nothing about Réka's mysterious rituals or strange powers, but something in her words struck a chord within him - perhaps the raw fear or confusion they shared.

With that realization came an unexpected calmness. Levente explained his late arrival and accidental discovery of the apartment. To his surprise, Réka slowly relaxed into a semblance of normalcy, apologizing profusely for disrupting their conversation.

Over steaming cups of coffee brought from the kitchen, Levente listened as Réka talked about ancient practices and lost knowledge. They spoke long after nightfall, Levente learning that Réka was but one conduit for something greater - an unnameable energy seeking release through her art, rituals, or however it chose to manifest.

As the hours slipped away, Levente began to grasp the complexities of this hidden world within their mundane lives. A world where magic and reality blurred into an ever-shifting landscape.

He eventually made his way out into the snow-covered streets once more, leaving Réka to whatever secrets lay hidden in her now-calm apartment. The hum had stopped; the light had dimmed.

But the experience lingered on, like a half-forgotten dream that refused to fade from memory. And Levente knew he'd caught glimpses of an undercurrent - one that would haunt him for days, weeks, maybe even forever.

This strange new understanding changed his perspective on life in Budapest; the shadows took on depth and texture as he navigated its crowded streets.
