Mikołaj Askarov stepped out of the misty Moscow morning, his eyes scanning the streets as if searching for something. The city was always alive, but today it seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for him to make a move.

As a former KGB agent turned freelance journalist, Mikołaj had seen his fair share of intrigue and deception. His latest investigation had led him to a small café on the outskirts of town, where he hoped to meet with a source who claimed to have information about a high-ranking government official involved in embezzlement.

The café was bustling with activity, but Mikołaj's eyes locked onto a figure sitting alone at a corner table. The woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair seemed out of place among the throngs of people rushing to start their day. As he approached her, she nodded subtly in greeting.

"Mikołaj Askarov," she said, her voice low and husky. "I've heard a lot about you."

"Kasia," he replied, taking a seat across from her. "It's an honor to finally meet you. You have information I need."

Kasia produced a small USB drive from her bag and slid it across the table. Mikołaj plugged it into his laptop, and as the files began to load, his eyes scanned the documents.

The evidence was damning: receipts for lavish spending, memos detailing secret deals with foreign governments, and more than enough to bring down an entire administration. But as he delved deeper, Mikołaj realized that Kasia's role went beyond mere informant – she was a mole within the government itself.

Their conversation was interrupted by the arrival of two men in suits, who eyed Kasia with suspicion before turning their attention to Mikołaj. He recognized the warning signs: this was no ordinary inquiry.

"I think it's time we parted ways," Kasia whispered, grabbing her bag and standing up. "You're getting close, but you don't know what you're dealing with."

As they made a hasty exit, Mikołaj couldn't shake the feeling that he'd just scratched the surface of something much bigger than himself. The Askarov code – an ancient protocol used by KGB agents to identify trusted allies – flashed in his mind: 1-4-8-5-3.

This was more than a simple investigation; it was a dance with fate, and Mikołaj was about to become the key player.
