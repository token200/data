Growing up in rural Poland, he had always been fascinated by the lively rhythms and colorful costumes of the local folk ensembles. As a young man, Mikołaj spent countless hours studying the works of his predecessors, pouring over dusty tomes and listening intently to the tales of elderly villagers who had learned their songs and dances from their own grandparents.

As he delved deeper into his research, Mikołaj became increasingly convinced that there was more to Polish folk culture than met the eye. He spent years traveling across the country, collecting rare recordings and conducting interviews with local musicians and dancers.
