Mikołaj Moore stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, stretching his long frame after the journey. His messy brown hair bobbed with each movement as he looked out at the small town of Ravenswood. He had come to this place seeking answers, and he hoped to find them among its quaint streets and ancient buildings.

As a historian specializing in Eastern European folklore, Mikołaj Moore had spent years studying the myths and legends of his native Poland. But it was a particular tale that had sparked his interest - one of a hidden society of witches living just beyond the edge of Ravenswood. According to local lore, these witches possessed powers beyond the understanding of mortal men.

Mikołaj Moore made his way through the quiet streets, taking in the sights and sounds of the town. He passed by a small bakery filled with the scent of freshly baked bread and pastries, and nodded in greeting to the proprietor as he went. The townsfolk seemed friendly enough, but Mikołaj knew better than to trust too easily.

After asking around, he found himself at the local tavern, where he was greeted by the bartender's knowing smile. "What brings you to Ravenswood, Mr... Moore?" the man asked, his eyes glinting in the firelight.

Mikołaj leaned back on the stool and ordered a beer, eyeing the room with interest. The patrons were mostly farmers and laborers, but he noticed one individual - an elderly woman sitting alone at a table near the fire. Her long silver hair cascaded down her back like a river of moonlight, and Mikołaj could have sworn he saw her glance his way as she turned to leave.

For a moment, their eyes locked in a silent understanding. Then the woman vanished into the night, leaving Mikołaj Moore with more questions than answers. He drained his beer, feeling a sense of determination wash over him. This was just the beginning of his search for the truth about Ravenswood's hidden witches - and he would follow every lead to uncover their secrets.
