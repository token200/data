Mikołaj Kenji stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the sounds of the city washing over him like a familiar wave. He had been away for months, traveling through Asia with his camera slung over his shoulder, but this was his first homecoming in years.

As he made his way through the bustling streets of Krakow, Mikołaj's mind wandered back to the memories etched into the worn wooden door of his family's old apartment building. His eyes landed on the small café across the street, where his aunt, Halina, was already seated at a table by the window.

The smell of freshly brewed coffee and the sound of gentle chatter welcomed Mikołaj like an old friend. He slid onto the stool beside him, and Halina smiled warmly as she handed him a steaming cup.

"Mikołaj, mojny syn" (my son), she said, her voice soft with emotion. "I've missed you so much."

Mikołaj wrapped his hands around the warm mug, feeling the comforting ritual of the café wash over him like a balm. He had been traveling for months, chasing the light and the stories, but he knew that no place was home without the people he loved.

Over steaming cups of coffee and plates of Halina's famous pierogi ruskie (potato and cheese dumplings), Mikołaj shared tales of his adventures with Halina. He spoke of the bustling streets of Tokyo, the mist-shrouded mountains of New Zealand, and the temples of Cambodia, each story weaving a thread into the tapestry of his journey.

Halina listened intently, her eyes sparkling with curiosity, as Mikołaj shared with her the stories he had collected along the way. He spoke of the people he had met, the moments that had moved him, and the lessons he had learned about himself.

As the afternoon wore on, the sun began to set over the city, casting a warm glow over the cobblestone streets. Mikołaj knew that no matter where his travels took him next, a part of him would always be here in Krakow, among the people and places that made this city feel like home.

"I'm not sure what I'll do now," he said to Halina, as they sat together on the stool, watching the stars begin to twinkle above.

Halina reached out and placed her hand on his arm. "You don't need a plan, mojny syn," she said softly. "Just be here."
