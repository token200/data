Mikołaj Lāce stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the quaint station for any sign of life. It was as if the entire town had forgotten he was coming, or perhaps it was just a small, rural place where people knew each other's names but rarely spoke them aloud.

Mikołaj Lāce sighed, shouldering his backpack and beginning to make his way through the deserted streets. He had been away for so long, studying in the city and working as an accountant, that he felt like a ghost haunting his own childhood home.

As he walked, the trees grew taller and the houses closer together, their wooden facades worn smooth by generations of laughter and tears. Mikołaj Lāce's thoughts turned to his parents, who had passed away when he was just a teenager. He remembered the smell of freshly baked pierogi wafting from their kitchen, and the way his mother used to make him help with the gardening.

He approached the old family cottage, its door creaking ominously as he pushed it open. The interior was musty and dark, but Mikołaj Lāce's eyes adjusted slowly, taking in the familiar layout. His grandfather's wooden rocking chair sat quietly in the corner, a faded photograph of his great-grandmother on the mantle.

Mikołaj Lāce dropped his backpack onto the floor and let out a deep breath, feeling the weight of years bearing down upon him. He had left this place to make a life for himself, but now he wasn't so sure. The world outside these wooden walls seemed vast and overwhelming, full of people and expectations and responsibilities.

As he wandered through the cottage, running his fingers over the worn surfaces, Mikołaj Lāce felt a sense of peace begin to seep in. This was where he belonged – not among the steel skyscrapers and noise of the city, but among the ancient trees and whispering leaves of this quiet town. For now, at least, he was home.

Mikołaj Lāce sat down in his grandfather's chair, feeling the soft give of the cushion beneath him. He closed his eyes, letting the silence wash over him like a warm bath, and let himself drift into the familiar rhythms of his childhood. This time, when he woke, it would be different.
