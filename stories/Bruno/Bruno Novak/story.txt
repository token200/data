Bruno Joseph Novak was a man with a reputation for being one of the most feared and respected hitmen in the city. With his chiseled features and piercing blue eyes, he exuded an aura of calm confidence that belied the deadly profession he had chosen.

As Bruno sat in the dimly lit café, sipping on a cup of black coffee, he couldn't help but think about how far he'd come. From growing up on the streets of Brooklyn to becoming one of the most sought-after killers in the world, Bruno's journey was nothing short of remarkable.

He had started out as a young punk, looking for a way to prove himself and make some quick cash. But it wasn't until he met his mentor, Vinnie "The Bull" LaRosa, that Bruno discovered his true calling. Vinnie saw something in Bruno that no one else did – potential. And with Vinnie's guidance, Bruno quickly rose through the ranks of the hitman world.

Now, as Bruno sat in the café, he couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching him. He glanced around, taking in the other patrons, but they all seemed to be going about their business. Shrugging it off, Bruno returned to his coffee, lost in thought.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows and slid into the seat across from him. It was a woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair – a looker if Bruno had ever seen one. "You're Bruno Joseph Novak," she said, her voice husky and confident. "I've heard a lot about you."

Bruno raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "And who might you be?" he asked, his voice low and smooth.

"My name is Sophia," she replied, a sly smile spreading across her face. "And I have a job that requires your particular set of skills."

Bruno's interest was piqued. He leaned forward, his eyes locked on Sophia's. "What kind of job?" he asked, already knowing the answer.

Sophia smiled again, this time with a hint of mischief in her voice. "Let's just say it involves a certain wealthy businessman who needs...persuading."

Bruno's eyes narrowed, his mind racing with possibilities. He knew that this was going to be a job worth taking. And as he stood up, Sophia's smile grew wider, knowing that she had found the right man for the task.
