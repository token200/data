The Fox, caught off guard by Bruno Sten's quick thinking and bravery, slunk away into the shadows, defeated. The museum's security team, alerted by Bruno Sten's actions, quickly arrived to take The Ghost into custody.

As the evening drew to a close, Bruno Sten stood victorious, his reputation as one of the best in the business solidified. His full name, Bruno Alexander Sten, echoed through the halls of the Bellvue Museum, a reminder of his unwavering dedication to protecting its most precious treasures.
