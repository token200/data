Bruno Wozniak was an enigmatic figure known for his razor-sharp wit and uncanny ability to read people. As a renowned private investigator in New Haven, he had built a reputation for being one of the best in the business.

One drizzly afternoon, Bruno received a cryptic message from a mysterious client who claimed to have information about a high-profile case involving a prominent businessman named Richard Langley. Bruno's curiosity was piqued, and he agreed to meet with the client at a dingy café on the outskirts of town.

Upon arrival, Bruno spotted his contact – a petite woman with piercing green eyes. She introduced herself as Sophia Grant, a former employee of Langley's company, and handed Bruno a stack of incriminating documents. As they sat down at a table by the window, Bruno couldn't help but notice the faint tremble in Sophia's hand.

"Who are you really working for, Sophia?" Bruno asked, his eyes locked onto hers.

Sophia hesitated before responding, "I'm working for someone who knows about Langley's shady dealings. They want to bring him down."

Bruno raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the depth of her words. He began to dig into the documents, uncovering a web of deceit and corruption that stretched far beyond Langley's company.

As they sipped their coffee, Bruno couldn't help but think about his late grandmother, who had always told him that "the truth is like a good cigar – it takes time to burn." This case seemed to fit that description perfectly. The more he dug in, the more he realized that Sophia was hiding something from him.

"Who's behind this?" Bruno pressed on, his voice low and measured.

Sophia glanced around the café nervously before leaning in close. "Bruno Wozniak, I have a feeling you're not who you say you are either," she whispered, her words sending a shiver down Bruno's spine.

With that, Sophia disappeared into the rain-soaked night, leaving Bruno to ponder the meaning behind her enigmatic statement and wonder if he was in over his head.
