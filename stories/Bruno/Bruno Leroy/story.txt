Bruno Leroy was a man with a unique profession - he was a professional Mourner. Yes, you read that right. For as long as anyone could remember, Bruno had been hired to attend funerals and other solemn occasions, dressed in a black suit and sporting a suitably somber expression.

It wasn't always this way for Bruno, though. Growing up, he had dreamed of being an actor, but after a string of unsuccessful auditions, he found himself at a dead end - literally. Or so it seemed.

One day, while waiting in line at the local funeral home to register as a potential candidate for the esteemed position of Mourner, Bruno was approached by a kindly old man who offered him the job on the spot. "I've been watching you," he said, his eyes twinkling with amusement. "You've got the look, my friend. The 'tragic figure' about you."

And so, Bruno Leroy was born - a professional Mourner, tasked with bringing a touch of gravity and pathos to the most solemn of occasions.

As the years went by, Bruno honed his craft, perfecting his sobs, his wails, and his suitably anguished expressions. He became a regular fixture at weddings and birthdays alike, always ready to break out into tears on cue.

But Bruno's true calling came when he was hired to attend the funeral of a deceased business partner. The poor guy had died suddenly, leaving behind a bereft family and a mountain of debt. Bruno threw himself into the role with gusto, weeping uncontrollably as the mourners laid flowers on his grave.

His performance earned him an offer from a prominent funeral director who wanted to sign him up as a regular with her firm. And so, Bruno Leroy found himself at the height of his profession - the most sought-after Mourner in town.

Despite his profession's peculiarities, Bruno had a secret life - one that few people knew about. At night, when the funerals were all over and the mourners had gone home, Bruno would slip away to the local comedy club, where he'd perform stand-up routines under an assumed name.

It was here that he found his true calling - making people laugh, not cry. But even this was a secret, known only to a select few. For in the world of professional Mourners, it was a delicate balancing act between grief and glee - and Bruno Leroy had mastered it all.
