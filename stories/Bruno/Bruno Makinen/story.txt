Bruno's thoughts turned to the victim of the latest heist – a wealthy socialite who had been left with nothing but a handful of stolen diamonds. The police were baffled by the thief's lack of motive, but Bruno Makinen knew better. He sensed that there was more to this case than met the eye.

As he turned a corner onto Kalasatama Street, Bruno spotted a suspicious character lurking in the shadows. His eyes narrowed as he watched the person quickly disappear into the night. It was a lead – and one that Bruno was determined to follow.

With his instincts on high alert, Bruno Makinen set off after the suspect, navigating the dark streets with ease. He knew Helsinki like the back of his hand, and tonight, he had a sense of purpose that drove him forward. Little did he know, this case would be the most challenging of his career – but Bruno Makinen was ready to take on whatever came his way.
