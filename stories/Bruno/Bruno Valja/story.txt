Bruno Valja's fascination with music began at a young age, when his mother would play the piano for him on Sundays. He was particularly drawn to the way the melodies seemed to transport him to another world. As he grew older, Bruno Valja's passion for music only intensified, and he went on to study the art of horology.

Years of practice and experimentation had honed Bruno Valja's skills, allowing him to create intricate timepieces that not only kept perfect time but also played enchanting melodies.
