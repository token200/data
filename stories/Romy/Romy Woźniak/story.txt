Romy Woźniak stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. She had been in Krakow for only a few days, but already felt like she was getting lost in its winding streets and ancient history.

As a photographer, Romy had always been drawn to the city's beauty – from the majestic Wawel Castle to the vibrant street art that seemed to pulse through its alleys. But it was more than just the scenery that drew her to this place; it was the stories that lingered in every stone and brick.

Romy had inherited a small apartment from a great aunt she'd never met, but whose name echoed throughout the city – Helena Woźniak. It was said that Helena had been a Polish Resistance fighter during WWII, using her photography skills to document the atrocities of the war and smuggle anti-Nazi propaganda into the occupied territory.

As Romy made her way through the station, she felt a sense of connection to the woman who came before her. She had always been fascinated by Helena's story – the bravery, the heartache, the resilience in the face of overwhelming oppression.

Romy began her daily photo walk, camera slung over her shoulder as she navigated the city's streets. She captured images of crumbling buildings, ornate fountains, and the ever-changing faces of Krakow's residents. But it was the hidden corners – the secret gardens tucked away behind medieval churches, the family-run cafes with their ancient photographs on display – that really spoke to her.

As the sun began to set, Romy made her way back to the apartment, the worn wooden floor creaking beneath her feet. She poured herself a glass of wine and sat at the small table, scrolling through the images she'd taken that day. And then, just as she was about to start editing, her phone buzzed with an incoming message from a stranger.

"Hi Romy," it read. "I saw your work online and wanted to reach out. I think you might be interested in something. Meet me at Wawel Castle tomorrow?"

Romy's heart skipped a beat as she read the words, feeling the same thrill of connection that she'd felt since arriving in Krakow. She knew that her great aunt Helena would want her to keep searching for answers – and this mystery might just hold them all together.
