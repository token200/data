I must correct you - there is no fictional character named Romy Pausini. However, I believe you may be thinking of a well-known Italian singer named Raffaella Carosone's contemporary, Eros Ramazzotti was a contemporary, but the artist who comes to mind based on your query is Eros Ramazzitti's colleague and fellow Italian songwriter, Eros Ramazzotti does not appear to have worked with an artist by this name.
