Romy Lehtonen was known for her fearless attitude and sharp instincts as a detective in the Helsinki Police Department. With her short, dark hair and piercing green eyes, she cut through crowds with ease, never failing to notice the smallest detail that could crack a case.

Born to Finnish parents in a small town in Sweden, Romy's early life was marked by tragedy when her father passed away in a car accident. Her mother, though grieving, instilled in Romy a strong sense of justice and determination to make a difference in the world. This mantra would guide Romy Lehtonen throughout her career as a detective.

One stormy night, a 911 call came in about a possible murder at an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of Helsinki. Without hesitation, Romy Lehtonen jumped into action, assembling a team of officers to accompany her to the scene. As they approached the warehouse, the howling wind and flashes of lightning illuminated the dark shape looming before them.

Romy's trained eyes scanned the perimeter, taking in every inch of the structure. She noticed an open window on the second floor and quickly signaled for her team to follow her up. Inside, she found evidence of a violent struggle: broken furniture, shattered glass, and signs of a desperate fight for survival.

With each new discovery, Romy's gut told her that this was more than just a simple murder – it was a carefully planned scheme. She spent hours gathering clues and piecing together the events leading up to the tragedy. As the night wore on, she became increasingly convinced that the killer was still in the vicinity, watching them from the shadows.

Just as Romy Lehtonen was about to wrap up her investigation, a sudden gust of wind knocked over a nearby vase, sending shards flying everywhere. In the chaos, Romy spotted something glinting in the dim light – a small piece of torn fabric caught on a broken shard of glass. With an icy calm, she plucked it from the scene and examined it closely. The fabric matched the material of her own coat.

Romy Lehtonen's eyes locked onto the window above her, where a shadowy figure was watching her every move. She knew in that moment that she had finally caught up with the killer – and she wasn't letting them get away.
