Romy Ivanov sat alone in her small apartment, staring blankly at the walls as she tried to shake off the feeling of emptiness that had been plaguing her for weeks. Her friends had all moved on with their lives, finding new jobs and making new connections, but Romy couldn't seem to catch a break.

As a freelance writer, Romy had always prided herself on being independent and self-sufficient, but lately, it felt like she was just drifting aimlessly through life. She thought back to her childhood, when her parents had encouraged her to pursue her passion for writing, and how far she'd come since then. But now, it seemed like that same drive that had once propelled her forward was dwindling.

Romy's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her phone buzzing on the coffee table. She picked it up, hoping against hope that it might be a call from someone - anyone - who could offer her some kind of guidance or support. But it was just an automated message from the job board she'd been using to find work.

Feeling defeated, Romy slumped back onto the couch and buried her face in her hands. Why was this happening to her? She had so many talents and skills - why couldn't anyone see that?

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was her neighbor, Mrs. Jenkins, who had taken a liking to Romy despite their vastly different ages and backgrounds. "Hey kiddo," she said, peering around Romy's closed curtains. "I saw your light on and figured you might need some company."

Romy opened the door, feeling a mixture of gratitude and embarrassment at being interrupted. But as Mrs. Jenkins came in and began to chat with her, something strange happened. For the first time in weeks, Romy felt like she was able to breathe again.

Maybe, just maybe, Mrs. Jenkins could see something that Romy had been missing all along - a way forward from this dark place.
