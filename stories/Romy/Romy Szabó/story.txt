Romy Szabó stepped off the crowded bus and onto the worn pavement of New Haven Street. She had been walking for hours, her feet screaming in protest as she gazed down at the faded street signs that seemed to whisper secrets of the past. The smell of freshly baked bread wafted from the nearby bakery, drawing her in with its enticing aroma.

Romy's thoughts were a jumble of emotions as she made her way through the crowded streets. She had just received news that her grandmother, the one person who truly understood her, had passed away. It felt like a part of Romy herself had been ripped away.

As she pushed open the door to the bakery, the bell above it rang out, and the baker's wife, Mrs. Keszthelyi, looked up from behind the counter. "Romy! Darling, I'm so sorry to hear about your grandmother," she said, her voice warm with compassion.

Romy smiled weakly, taking a seat at the small table by the window. She ordered a cup of coffee and sat in silence for a moment, watching as Mrs. Keszthelyi expertly layered dough into intricate pastries. The baker's hands moved with a precision that Romy had always admired – it was like magic.

As she waited, memories began to surface. Afternoons spent listening to her grandmother's stories of the old country; the way her eyes sparkled when she laughed; and the comforting scent of fresh-baked bread that always seemed to soothe her soul. Tears pricked at the corners of Romy's eyes as she realized just how much she would miss her grandmother's wisdom and love.

When Mrs. Keszthelyi returned with a steaming cup, Romy took it gratefully, inhaling the aroma as she raised it to her lips. The coffee was strong and rich, just like her grandmother's personality – full of depth and character. As she sipped, Romy felt a small sense of peace settle over her.

"Thank you, Mrs. Keszthelyi," she said, smiling up at the baker's wife. "This is exactly what I needed."

The old woman smiled back, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "Anytime, Romy. Your grandmother may be gone, but her love and spirit live on in this town – and especially in you."
