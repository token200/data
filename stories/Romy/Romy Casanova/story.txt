Romy Casanova stepped off the train and onto the bustling platform of Paris's Gare du Nord. The French capital was her new home, or so she told herself. Her real name was actually Ryker Cassandra Casanova, but Romy had left that behind in the States years ago.

As she made her way through the crowded station, Ryker – or Romy, depending on who you asked – pulled out her phone to scan for any messages from her new "colleague." She had landed a job at an art gallery in Montmartre, and was excited to start exploring the city's vibrant creative scene.

The next morning, Romy (or Ryker) arrived at the gallery, sipping on a strong espresso as she set up for the day. Her boss, a charming Frenchman named Henri, greeted her warmly and showed her around the studio. They discussed everything from art movements to market trends, and Romy found herself quickly becoming immersed in the world of 20th-century painting.

As the hours passed, Romy discovered that she was working alongside an eclectic group of artists, each with their own unique style and story. There was Jacques, a quiet, enigmatic painter whose works seemed to capture the essence of the city; Marie, a free-spirited sculptor who created stunning pieces from found materials; and Pierre, a charismatic photographer whose images told tales of love, loss, and redemption.

As the day drew to a close, Romy (still Ryker in her mind) took a moment to gaze out over the rooftops of Montmartre. She felt a sense of belonging here, among these creative souls who understood the importance of taking risks and pushing boundaries.

In that moment, she knew she had made the right decision in leaving behind her old life. Romy Casanova was more than just a name – it was an identity she had forged on this continent, where art and passion flowed through every vein like blood. And as she walked back to her small apartment, phone in hand, scanning for any new messages from Henri or the gang, she felt a sense of freedom and possibility that only Paris could offer.
