Romy Koskinen stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of her contact. It had been weeks since she'd received the cryptic message, and she was starting to get nervous. As a freelance journalist, Romy Koskinen had made a name for herself by digging up dirt on high-profile figures, but this latest assignment felt different.

She spotted a figure in the corner, dressed in a black coat that seemed out of place among the café's eclectic crowd. Romy Koskinen took a seat at the bar and ordered a coffee, her eyes never leaving the mysterious figure.

The man got up and approached her, his eyes locked on hers. "You're Romy Koskinen," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "I've heard a lot about you."

Romy Koskinen raised an eyebrow. "What do you want?"

"I represent a...source," the man said, his eyes darting around the café before focusing on hers again. "Someone who needs to be protected."

Romy Koskinen's journalist instincts kicked in, but she hesitated. Something about this didn't feel right. She'd dealt with plenty of fake leads and discredited sources over the years.

"I'll listen," she said finally, taking a sip of her coffee.

The man handed her a folder filled with documents and photographs. Romy Koskinen flipped through them quickly, her eyes widening as she realized what she was looking at – evidence of a high-stakes corruption scandal that went all the way to the top.

This could be big, she thought. This could be the story of a lifetime. And as she looked up at the mysterious figure, she knew she had no choice but to take it on.

"Okay," she said, her voice firm. "I'm in."

The man nodded and turned to leave, disappearing into the crowd as suddenly as he'd appeared. Romy Koskinen sat back down, her mind racing with possibilities. She knew that this assignment would put her career – and her life – on the line. But she was ready for it.
