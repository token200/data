Rihards Wagner was a man consumed by music. As a child, he would spend hours huddled in his small apartment, his ears plugged into his father's old gramophone, listening to the melodies that filled his heart with joy. His love for music only grew stronger as he grew older, and by the time he was 16, Rihards had already formed his first band.

With a passion that bordered on obsession, Rihards poured his soul into every note he played. He spent hours practicing, perfecting his craft until his fingers were stained with ink from the sheet music in his hands. His friends and family marveled at his dedication, but also worried about the toll it was taking on him.

As Rihards entered adulthood, he began to make a name for himself in the local music scene. He formed a band with a few like-minded musicians, and they quickly gained a following. But despite their success, Rihards couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. The stage, which had once been his sanctuary, now felt empty.

One fateful night, as he was setting up for a gig at a dingy bar on the outskirts of town, Rihards noticed a strange woman lingering by the door. She was dressed in black and her hair was pulled back into a tight bun. Her eyes seemed to bore into his soul, but Rihards couldn't help feeling drawn to her.

As he began to play, the woman crept closer to the stage. He caught glimpses of her out of the corner of his eye - her movements fluid and deliberate. It was as if she was conducting an invisible orchestra, drawing Rihards' music into a world beyond their own.

When the set ended, Rihards was left reeling. The woman vanished into the crowd, but he couldn't shake the feeling that she had been watching him all along. He began to notice strange occurrences in the days and weeks that followed - his instruments would move on their own, and the sheets music would turn up in places where no one else had touched them.

It became clear that Rihards was not alone. A presence had taken up residence within him, guiding his fingers across the strings of his guitar like an invisible hand. He began to compose with a fervor he had never experienced before - melodies poured out of him like water from a fountain.

As word of his newfound talent spread, Rihards became one of the most sought-after musicians in town. People would come from all over just to hear him play. And though the strange woman was still a mystery, Rihards knew that he owed it all to her.
