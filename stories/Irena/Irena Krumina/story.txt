Irena Krumina stepped into the crowded café, scanning the room for her friend's familiar figure. It wasn't long before she spotted them, sipping on a cappuccino in the corner with their laptop open.

As Irena approached, her friend looked up and smiled, closing their laptop with a click. "Hey, Irena Krumina! Long time no see!" they exclaimed, standing up to give her a hug.

Irena laughed, feeling a surge of warmth towards her friend's affectionate greeting. They introduced themselves as Jax, and the two quickly settled into their favorite booth by the window. Over steaming cups of coffee, they caught up on each other's lives.

Jax, an aspiring writer, had been working on their latest novel for months, pouring their heart and soul into the pages. Irena Krumina listened intently as Jax shared snippets from their work-in-progress, offering insightful feedback and suggestions to help them improve.

As they chatted, Irena couldn't help but notice the way the morning light streaming through the window highlighted Jax's features. Their eyes sparkled with creativity, and their hair was styled in a messy, endearing way that made Irena feel all fluttery inside.

After some time, Jax pulled out a small notebook from under the table and began flipping through its pages. "I want to show you something," they said, their voice filled with excitement. And then, with a flourish, they revealed a series of sketches – rough drafts of characters, settings, and plotlines for their novel.

Irena's eyes widened as she took in the artwork, marveling at Jax's talent and imagination. "You're so talented, Irena Krumina," she said, genuinely impressed. Jax blushed, looking pleased with themselves, and the two friends spent the rest of the afternoon brainstorming ideas and offering support to one another.

As they prepared to part ways, Irena Krumina felt grateful for the chance encounter with her friend Jax. It was always wonderful to spend time with someone who understood her quirks and shared her passions. And as she walked out of the café, feeling energized and inspired, she knew that this chance meeting would be one to remember.
