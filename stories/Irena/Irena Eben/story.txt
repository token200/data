Irena Eben was a woman with an air of mystery that followed her wherever she went. Her piercing green eyes seemed to see right through people, and her raven-black hair fell in loose waves down her back like a dark waterfall. She moved with a quiet confidence, her long legs eating up the distance as she navigated the crowded streets of Prague.

It was a chilly autumn evening when Irena walked into the dimly lit café on Old Town Square. The smell of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the sound of soft jazz music drifting from the speakers. She slipped onto a stool at the bar, her eyes scanning the room as she waited for the bartender to notice her.

The man behind the counter was a friend of Irena's, someone who had known her since before she'd left the countryside to make a name for herself in the city. He raised an eyebrow as he took in her worn leather jacket and the small backpack slung over her shoulder.

"What brings you here tonight?" he asked, wiping his hands on a towel as he leaned against the counter.

Irena smiled wryly, taking a sip of the coffee that appeared in front of her without being ordered. "Just passing through," she said. "I needed to get out of there for a bit."

"Somewhere new, then?" the bartender pressed, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he tried to guess what was going on behind those enigmatic eyes.

Irena hesitated, her gaze drifting around the room as if searching for an escape route. "Not exactly," she said finally. "More like... I'm running from a ghost."

The bartender raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. "A ghost, eh? What kind of ghost?"

But before he could get any more out of her, Irena was standing up, her eyes scanning the room as if searching for someone – or something.

"I have to go," she said abruptly, shoving a few coins onto the bar and grabbing her backpack in one swift motion. "Thanks for the coffee."

She left the café as quickly and quietly as she'd entered it, disappearing into the crowds of Old Town Square like a specter herself. The bartender watched her go with a mixture of curiosity and concern.

What was Irena running from? He had no idea, but he knew that if anyone could handle whatever was after her, it would be this mysterious woman.

Irena walked for hours, losing herself in the winding streets of Prague's Jewish Quarter. She'd always felt at home here – among the ancient synagogues and forgotten cemeteries, where secrets seemed to lurk around every corner.

Eventually, she ducked into a small alleyway between two dilapidated buildings. It was narrow and poorly lit, but Irena moved through it with ease, her eyes adjusted to the darkness.

At the end of the alley stood a crumbling synagogue, its stone façade worn smooth by time and weather. Irena approached the entrance, hesitating for just a moment before pushing open the creaky door and slipping inside.

The air within was thick and heavy, redolent with the scent of old incense and forgotten rituals. Irena breathed it in deeply, feeling a strange sense of peace settle over her.

She wandered through the empty pews, her footsteps echoing off the stone walls. As she reached the altar, a small piece of paper slipped from between its stones and fluttered to the floor. Irena picked it up, recognizing the handwriting as belonging to an old friend – someone who'd been murdered years ago, under circumstances that had never been fully explained.

A shiver ran down her spine as she read the words scrawled on the note: "I'm still here."
