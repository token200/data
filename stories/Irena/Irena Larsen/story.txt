Irena Larsen stood at the edge of the small town's lake, her eyes fixed on the water's surface. The late afternoon sun cast a golden glow over the surrounding trees, but she barely noticed. Her mind was elsewhere, lost in memories of summers spent here as a child.

As a young girl, Irena had been fascinated by the stories her grandfather told about this very lake. He spoke of ancient legends and mythical creatures said to dwell within its depths. Some claimed to have seen a dragon-like beast with scales that shone like polished copper, while others whispered tales of mermaids who sang lullabies beneath the surface.

Irena had always been skeptical, but as she grew older, she began to wonder if there was truth to the stories. She spent countless hours exploring the lake's shores and waters, searching for any sign of the magic her grandfather claimed existed.

Now, as an adult, Irena found herself back in this same place, haunted by a dream from the previous night. In it, she had been standing on the lake's edge, feeling the familiar call of the water, when suddenly – just as abruptly as it began – everything vanished.

Fractured memories flooded her mind: flashes of moonlit nights, eerie silences, and whispered promises made to an unseen force. Irena couldn't shake the feeling that she was being pulled back into this mystical world, one where the boundaries between reality and myth blurred like ripples on the lake's surface.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a silver glow over the water, Irena took a deep breath and let her feet carry her forward. She plunged into the lake, letting the cool liquid envelop her like a shroud. The world around her melted away, leaving only the gentle lapping of the water against the shore.

And then – just as suddenly as it began – everything shifted. The ripples ceased, the stars appeared in the sky above, and Irena saw it: the dragon-like beast from her childhood stories, its copper scales glistening in the moonlight.
