The older woman had flown in from Mexico just to be there for her granddaughter's big moment, and Irena couldn't help but feel a surge of emotion at the sight of her loved one.

"Estoy tan orgullosa de ti, m'ija," Abuela said, her eyes shining with pride. "You've worked so hard to get here, and it's clear that you're meant for great things."

Irena smiled, feeling a sense of calm wash over her. She knew that she still had one more challenge ahead of her - the final round of the competition. But with Abuela by her side and her own determination driving her forward, Irena felt like she could conquer anything.
