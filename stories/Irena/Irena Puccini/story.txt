Without hesitation, Irena pushed open the door and stepped inside.

The proprietor, an eccentric old man named Max, greeted her with a warm smile. As they sipped tea and engaged in conversation, Irena Puccini discovered that Max was not only a collector of rare art pieces but also a keeper of secrets.
