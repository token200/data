I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Tanaka Järvinen. Could you provide more context or details about who Tanaka Järvinen is or what he represents? 

If you have a brief description of Tanaka Järvinen, I'd be happy to help write a 400-word story around him.

Alternatively, if you're looking for suggestions on creating a fictional character, I can provide some ideas and guidance.
