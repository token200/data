One evening, Tanaka Meier received an unexpected phone call from a local brewery, requesting her assistance in planning their 10-year anniversary celebration. The brewer, a friend of hers since college, explained that they wanted to recreate the exact party they had thrown when their beer first hit the market – but with all the nostalgic charm and modern twists.
