Tanaka Altmann, or "Alto" as he was known to his friends, had always been an enigmatic figure. A Japanese-German musician with a passion for experimental soundscapes and avant-garde performances, Alto had built a reputation as one of the most innovative artists in Berlin's underground music scene.

Born in Tokyo to a Japanese father and German mother, Alto grew up surrounded by the diverse sounds of his parents' cultures. He began playing piano at age five and later switched to saxophone, developing a distinctive blend of traditional Japanese instrumentation with modern electronic elements.

After completing music school in Hamburg, Alto moved to Berlin, where he became fast friends with fellow musicians like Can's Damo Suzuki and Faust's Hannes Fischer. The three formed a loose collective, dubbed "Die Dritte Schicht" (The Third Layer), pushing the boundaries of free improvisation and noise music.

Alto's performances were as much an experience as they were music. He'd create immersive environments, using anything from theremins to prepared pianos to generate eerie soundscapes. His eyes locked onto his audience, as if daring them to confront their own perceptions.

One fateful night in 1975, Alto received a cryptic letter from the Berlin avant-garde collective, Die Blauwesten. They invited him to join an experimental performance piece called "Transdimensional Ritual." The project's true purpose remained unclear, but Alto was intrigued by the prospect of exploring the unknown.

On the appointed night, Alto arrived at the abandoned warehouse on Kreuzberg's Friedrichstraße. A haze of fog enveloped the audience as Die Blauwesten members began to set up their equipment. Alto, donning a long white coat and wearing his signature black beret, took center stage.

As the performance unfolded, Alto channelled an otherworldly energy. His saxophone wailed like a lost soul, conjuring visions of burning deserts and starry skies. The audience was transfixed, as if witnessing a threshold between worlds. Die Blauwesten's visuals – strobing lights, pulsing patterns – mirrored Alto's sonic odyssey.

The performance concluded abruptly, leaving everyone shaken but exhilarated. Rumors spread that Alto had tapped into an ancient spiritual realm, channeling the vibrations of the cosmos through his music. Though he never spoke publicly about "Transdimensional Ritual," the legend lived on. For those who had experienced it, the memory remained as elusive and captivating as the sounds themselves.

To this day, fans whisper stories of Alto's extraordinary night in 1975. Some claim to have seen him reappear at underground concerts and avant-garde gatherings across Europe. Others assert that his music still holds the power to unlock hidden dimensions. For Tanaka Altmann, or "Alto" as he prefers, those whispers are merely a reminder of the transcendent force that lies at the heart of creative expression.
