Isla Vuorinen stepped out of the dimly lit café and onto the rain-soaked streets of Helsinki. The city was alive with the sound of dripping water and muted conversations, but Isla's attention was focused on the figure waiting for her by the corner of the street.

It had been months since they'd last spoken, but Isla knew that Lasse would never forget about her. She had promised him something in return for his help, and now she had to deliver. As she approached, Lasse looked up from his phone, a hint of curiosity etched on his face.

"Isla Vuorinen," he said, his voice low and smooth. "It's been too long."

Isla smiled, her eyes locking onto his. "Lasse," she replied, her voice barely above a whisper. "I've got what you wanted."

Lasse nodded, his expression unreadable. He had been searching for this information for years, and now it was finally in his hands. Isla handed him a small USB drive, containing the data she had gathered from her time as an undercover agent.

As Lasse took the drive, a spark of recognition flickered across his face. "Isla Vuorinen," he said again, this time with a hint of gratitude. "Thank you."

Isla shrugged, her gaze drifting away from him. She wasn't sure what to expect from their encounter. Had she done the right thing in helping Lasse? And what would be the cost of her actions?

Lasse took another step closer, his eyes burning with an intensity that made Isla's skin prickle. "You're a remarkable woman, Isla Vuorinen," he said, his voice dripping with sincerity. "I knew I could count on you."

For a moment, Isla felt a sense of pride and satisfaction wash over her. Maybe this had been the right decision after all. But as she looked into Lasse's eyes, she saw something that gave her pause – a calculation, a weighing of options.

"I'm glad we met again, Lasse," Isla said finally, turning to leave. "But I think our business is done here."

As she walked away from the corner of the street, Isla couldn't shake the feeling that she had just stepped into something much larger than herself – and that Lasse was still watching her, waiting for his next move.
