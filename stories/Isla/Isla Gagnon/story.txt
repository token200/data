As she grew older, Isla's interest only deepened. She began to study the occult, attending secret ceremonies and workshops where she learned the art of divination from a mysterious woman known only as "The Seer."

One night, under the light of a full moon, Isla stumbled upon an ancient text in a long-abandoned library. The words on the page spoke directly to her, revealing a shocking truth about her family's past.

Isla Gagnon's eyes widened as she read the words: "You are the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe." Suddenly, everything clicked into place. Her fascination with the supernatural wasn't just a quirk – it was a calling. With this newfound understanding, Isla felt a sense of purpose that she had never known before.
