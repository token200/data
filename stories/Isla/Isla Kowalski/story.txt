Isla Kowalski stepped off the last train of the night, her eyes scanning the deserted platform. She had been traveling for hours, but the familiar scent of salt and seaweed still lingered on her skin. The ferry to Skye was just a short walk from here.

As she walked, Isla's mind wandered back to the past few months. She had left her job in London, and her family's expectations behind, to find herself lost at sea – figuratively, of course. Her true passion was photography, but no one seemed to care about that anymore. Not even her own father.

Isla turned a corner, and the rugged outline of the Isle of Skye came into view. The island had always been her sanctuary, where she could escape the weight of expectation and focus on what truly mattered – art. Her grandmother, Babka, had been a photographer too, before the war. Isla's fingers twitched with longing as she thought about her latest project: capturing the eerie landscapes of Skye through black and white.

As she reached the ferry terminal, a figure emerged from the shadows. "Hey, Izzy," It was Tadg, an old friend from school. He had stayed on in Skye after Isla left, to help his family with their hotel business. They'd grown up together, exploring the island and sharing secrets.

The ferry chugged along, its engines purring softly. Isla settled into a seat by the rail, watching as the mainland receded into the distance. She felt her heart begin to heal – it still held scars from the past few months – but with each passing moment, she knew that Skye was where she belonged.

Tadg joined her on deck, and they sat in silence for a while, taking in the views of the islands scattered across the loch like a handful of stones. The moon rose higher, casting a silver glow over the waves. Isla felt it in her bones – this was home.

As they approached Skye's shores, Isla knew that she'd found more than just a place to hide. She'd discovered her own path – one that wound through rugged landscapes and eerie skies. The camera slung around her neck seemed like an extension of herself now, capturing not just the world outside, but her own sense of purpose.

The ferry docked with a gentle clunk, and Isla took her first steps on Skye in months. She breathed in deeply – the sea air was alive with possibility – and smiled, knowing that this time she wouldn't be alone for long.
