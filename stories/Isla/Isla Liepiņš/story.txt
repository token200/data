Isla Liepiņš stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the crowded station for any sign of familiarity. She had arrived in Riga, Latvia on a whim, hoping to escape the chaos of her life back home. As she made her way through the throngs of people, Isla Liepiņš felt a sense of disconnection from the world around her.

A small, leather-bound book clutched tightly in her hand, Isla Liepiņš had been traveling for weeks, trying to outrun the memories that haunted her. Her name, once synonymous with talent and potential, now seemed like a cruel joke. She was an artist, but her paintings were met with indifference and criticism.

As she walked through the station, Isla Liepiņš noticed a small café tucked away in a corner. The sign above the door read "Tēja" - Grandmother - and something about it resonated with her. She pushed open the door and stepped inside, feeling a sense of peace wash over her.

The café was dimly lit, but the atmosphere was cozy and inviting. Isla Liepiņš took a seat at the bar and ordered a cup of coffee. As she waited for her drink to arrive, she noticed an old woman sitting in the corner, staring intently at a book of sketches by local artists. There was something about the woman's eyes that drew Isla Liepiņš in - a sense of kindness and understanding.

As Isla Liepiņš finished her coffee, the old woman looked up and caught her eye. "You are an artist," she said, her voice low and soothing. "I can see it in your eyes." Isla Liepiņš felt a lump form in her throat as tears pricked at the corners of her eyes. For the first time in months, she felt seen.
