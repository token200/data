Isla Lewis stepped out of the misty dawn air and into the quiet café, her eyes scanning the room for the familiar face of her best friend, Emily. She spotted her sitting at a corner table, sipping on a steaming cup of coffee, her nose buried in a worn copy of Wuthering Heights.

Isla smiled as she made her way over to join her friend. "Rough night?" she asked, dropping into the seat across from Emily.

Emily looked up, her eyes red-rimmed and puffy. "Just had a bit too much wine at that book club meeting," she admitted, wincing as she set down her cup.

Isla chuckled sympathetically. "Well, you've certainly earned it after putting up with Mr. Johnson's analysis of Heathcliff's tortured soul for the umpteenth time."

Emily rolled her eyes good-naturedly. "I know, I know. He can be a bit much sometimes."

The two friends sat in comfortable silence for a moment, sipping their own coffee and watching as the café came to life around them. It was moments like these that Isla cherished – just being with Emily, surrounded by the soft hum of conversation and the aroma of freshly baked pastries.

As they chatted, Isla couldn't help but think about her own latest project – a novel she'd been working on for months, a sweeping romance set in the rugged landscapes of Scotland. She was still struggling to find the perfect ending, but with Emily's encouragement, she felt like she was getting closer to cracking it.

After a while, Emily glanced at her watch and stood up. "I'm so sorry, Isla, but I promised my mom I'd take her out for lunch today."

Isla nodded understandingly. "It's okay, go have fun! Just don't forget to tell me all about it when you get back."

As Emily left the café, Isla settled in to finish writing, feeling grateful for the quiet moments she got to spend with her friend. She pulled out a fresh sheet of paper and began typing, the words flowing easily onto the page as she let the misty dawn air wash over her like a balm.

For now, all was right with the world.
