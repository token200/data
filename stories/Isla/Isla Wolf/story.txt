Isla Elara Wolf's passion for art was palpable, and she spent most of her days teaching classes, exhibiting her own work, and inspiring others to find their voice.

One day, a young girl named Sophie wandered into Isla's studio, searching for inspiration. Sophie had always been fascinated by art, but her parents had discouraged her from pursuing it as a career.
