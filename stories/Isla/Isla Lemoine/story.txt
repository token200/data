Isla Lemoine stepped off the worn wooden dock and onto the sandy beach, her eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of life. The small fishing village was deserted, except for the occasional seagull wheeling overhead.

As a child, Isla had spent countless summers at her family's seaside cottage, playing in the waves and exploring the tide pools. But as she grew older, her parents' expectations weighed heavier - her mother, a renowned chef, had envisioned a future for Isla in the culinary world, not among the nets and lines of fishermen.

Isla's father, a rugged fisherman himself, had encouraged her love of the sea, teaching her how to tie knots and navigate by the stars. But when she turned 16, he'd vanished on a solo voyage, leaving behind only his fishing boat and a cryptic note that read: "The tide is stronger than I am."

Years passed, and Isla's mother had all but given up hope of finding her beloved husband. The small village whispered stories of strange occurrences around the time of his disappearance - equipment would go missing or turn up in odd places, as if someone was trying to send a message.

As she settled into her usual spot on the beach, Isla felt an inexplicable pull, like the ocean itself was calling to her. She closed her eyes, letting the salty air fill her lungs, and began to recite the lullaby her father used to sing: "The tide is stronger than I am..."

Suddenly, a gust of wind swept across the beach, sending sand swirling around her feet. When she opened her eyes again, Isla saw it - a small wooden chest, half-buried in the sand, with her father's name etched onto its lid.

Without thinking, she dug deeper, uncovering a collection of trinkets and mementos: shells, sea glass, and a silver pendant shaped like a wave. As she picked up the pendant, Isla felt an electric jolt run through her veins - it was her father's necklace, one he'd given her on her last birthday.

She knew then that the tide had been stronger than anyone thought, pulling her closer to the truth about her family's past and the secrets hidden beneath the waves.
