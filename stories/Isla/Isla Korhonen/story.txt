Isla Korhonen stood at the edge of the small wooden dock, her feet dangling above the murky waters of the lake. The sunlight danced across her skin as she gazed out at the reflection of the trees, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching for the sky.

As a child, Isla had spent countless hours exploring these woods with her grandfather, who taught her about the ancient traditions and myths of their Finnish heritage. He'd told her stories of the spirits that dwelled within the forest, of the väärykset - mischievous creatures said to play tricks on travelers.

Now, as an adult, Isla found herself drawn back to these woods, seeking solace from the chaos of modern life. She'd inherited her grandfather's cabin, nestled deep in the forest, where she spent her days tending to a garden of wild herbs and berries.

Isla closed her eyes, breathing in the scent of pine and damp earth. The air was filled with the songs of birds and the rustle of leaves as the wind whispered secrets through the trees.

Suddenly, a twig snapped beneath her foot, and Isla's heart skipped a beat. She'd grown accustomed to the quiet, but it never failed to startle her. As she stood up, brushing off her jeans, she noticed a figure watching her from the underbrush.

For a moment, their eyes locked - Isla's bright blue, the stranger's piercing green. The man took a step forward, his features still indistinct in the fading light. Isla felt a shiver run down her spine as he approached.

"Who are you?" she asked, trying to keep her voice steady.

The stranger smiled, revealing crooked teeth and a hint of mischief in his eyes. "I'm just a traveler," he said, his voice low and smooth. "I've been walking these woods for days, searching for something."

Isla raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean?"

The man hesitated, then pulled out a small wooden box from his backpack. Inside lay a handful of dried herbs - the same ones she grew in her garden.

"I thought I saw it here," he said, his eyes locked on Isla's. "In this forest."

Isla felt a jolt run through her chest as she took the box from him. The air seemed to vibrate with an otherworldly energy, and for an instant, she felt like she was standing at the edge of something much bigger than herself.

Without a word, Isla nodded, and the stranger vanished into the trees, leaving her alone with the whispers of the forest.
