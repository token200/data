Zhao Salamanca, the infamous ruthless and cunning warlord, sat on his throne-like chair in his grand palace. He had just received news that his arch-nemesis, the Emperor himself, was planning to march against him with a massive army. Zhao's cold, calculating eyes narrowed as he listened to the messenger.

"So, you're telling me that the Emperor thinks he can defeat me?" Zhao asked, his voice dripping with disdain.

The messenger trembled in fear, "Y-yes, my lord. The Emperor has heard of your treachery and believes that with his army's strength, he can crush your rebellion once and for all."

Zhao Salamanca chuckled to himself, the sound echoing through the halls like a menacing laugh. He knew that the Emperor was no match for him. For years, Zhao had been secretly gathering allies and resources, biding his time until the perfect moment to strike.

As he sat in his palace, surrounded by his loyal guards, Zhao began to think of new strategies to outsmart the Emperor once again. He called for one of his most trusted advisors, a clever old man named Zhang.

"Zhang, I need you to find out everything we can about the Emperor's army," Zhao instructed, his voice low and urgent. "I want to know their numbers, their tactics, and their weaknesses."

Zhang bowed respectfully and set off on his mission immediately. In the days that followed, he returned with valuable information about the Emperor's plans.

"Zhao Salamanca," Zhang began, his eyes locked on his master, "the Emperor is planning to use a new formation called the 'Nine-Sided Formation.' It's said to be nearly unbreakable."

Zhao's expression turned thoughtful. He knew that if he could devise a counter-formation, he would have the upper hand in the battle ahead.

"Very well," Zhao decided finally. "We will not engage the Emperor directly with his army. Instead, we will lure him into our trap."

And so, over the next few weeks, Zhao carefully orchestrated a series of skirmishes and raids along the border of his territory. He deliberately pushed the Emperor's soldiers back time and again, but always just short of victory.

Finally, the day arrived when the Emperor himself rode onto the battlefield to confront his arch-nemesis once more. As he gazed out at the enemy forces arrayed before him, Zhao gave a subtle signal to his generals.

With a fierce battle cry, the two armies clashed, and the Nine-Sided Formation proved no match for Zhao's cunning tactics. The Emperor's soldiers were decimated as they struggled to withstand the relentless onslaught ofZhao Salamanca's warriors.

As the dust settled on the battlefield, Zhao stood victorious once more, his dominance over the land now unchallenged. The Emperor himself approached him, his head bowed in defeat.

"I...I underestimated you," the Emperor stammered, unable to hide his fear.

Zhao Salamanca smiled, a cold, mirthless smile that sent shivers down even his most loyal subjects' spines.

"You should have done more than underestimate me," he whispered, before turning away to let his enemies depart.
