Gabriel Nieminen walked into the dimly lit café, scanning the room for a familiar face. He spotted her sitting by the window, sipping on a cup of black coffee. Lena, his long-time friend and confidant, caught his eye and smiled.

"Hey, Gab," she said, using the nickname only he seemed to deserve.

Gabriel chuckled and made his way over to her table. "Lena, you're as lovely as ever."

As they chatted, Gabriel couldn't help but think about how much Lena had changed since their college days. She was now a successful journalist, always chasing down the next big story. He admired her tenacity and dedication.

Their conversation flowed easily, like it always did. They talked about everything from politics to pop culture, never shying away from each other's opinions. Gabriel felt grateful for their friendship, one that had withstood the test of time.

Just as they were getting into a heated discussion about social justice, Lena's phone rang. She glanced at the screen and groaned. "Sorry, Gab, I have to take this."

Gabriel nodded understandingly and sipped on his own coffee while waiting for her to finish the call. When she returned, he asked if everything was okay.

"It's just a client," she replied, "but I'm really close to getting an exclusive interview with someone big."

Gabriel smiled, knowing how much this meant to Lena. He was always happy to see her succeed, even when it meant putting in long hours.

As they left the café, Gabriel turned to Lena and said, "You know, Gab Nieminen may not be a journalist like you, but I'm proud to be your friend."

Lena playfully rolled her eyes. "Don't get too sentimental on me, Gab."

Gabriel just laughed, knowing that their friendship was one for the ages.
