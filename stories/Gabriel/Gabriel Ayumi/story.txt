The music swirled around him, building in intensity until it reached a crescendo that left the crowd breathless. Gabriel raised his arms, allowing the energy of the moment to wash over him like a wave. And then, with a final, whispered note, he vanished into the night, leaving behind an audience forever changed by the encounter.
