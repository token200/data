Gabriel Xia sat alone at the dimly lit café, nursing a cup of cold coffee as he stared out the window. It had been months since his last memory of his past life had faded away, and with it, any hope of reconnecting with his loved ones.

Gabriel Xia's thoughts drifted back to his family, who had long since given up searching for him. He wondered if they ever thought of him at all, or if the pain of losing their son had dulled over time. The ache in his chest was a constant reminder that he was a stranger to himself, a ghost haunting the shadows of his own life.

As he sipped his coffee, a young woman walked into the café, her eyes scanning the room as she searched for someone. Gabriel Xia's instincts kicked in, and he watched with interest as she approached the barista, ordering a coffee in hushed tones. There was something about her that seemed familiar, yet he couldn't quite place it.

The woman's eyes locked onto his, and for a fleeting moment, Gabriel Xia felt a jolt of recognition. It was as if she had seen him before, but he couldn't remember where or when. He smiled wistfully, hoping to spark some connection, but the woman merely returned her gaze, unfazed.

The encounter left Gabriel Xia feeling both intrigued and frustrated. He had grown accustomed to being a mystery to himself, but it was exhilarating to feel like someone might finally understand him. As he finished his coffee and prepared to leave, the woman approached him once more, this time with a hesitant smile.

"Hi," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I think I saw you around before."

Gabriel Xia's heart skipped a beat as he took in every detail of her face. Could it be? Was this stranger his key to unlocking the memories that had been lost to him for so long?

He smiled back at her, feeling a glimmer of hope that he hadn't felt in years. "I think you might be right," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

The woman's eyes lit up with curiosity, and Gabriel Xia knew that this chance encounter could be the start of something incredible – or devastatingly heartbreaking. Whatever lay ahead, Gabriel Xia was ready to face it head-on, one uncertain step at a time.
