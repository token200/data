Gabriel Szabó was a man with a passion for music and a heart full of love. As the lead singer of the Budapest-based rock band, "Midnight Sky," he had spent years honing his craft, pouring his emotions into every lyric and melody.

Born in the charming streets of Pest, Hungary, Gabriel grew up surrounded by the sounds of Eastern European folk music. His parents, both musicians themselves, encouraged his love for music from a young age. As a teenager, Gabriel began writing his own songs, inspired by the likes of Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen.

After years of gigging around Budapest, Midnight Sky finally caught a break when they were booked to play at the famous Sziget Festival in 2018. The sold-out show was a defining moment for the band, and Gabriel's powerful vocals and poignant lyrics resonated with the audience.

As the lead singer of Midnight Sky, Gabriel Szabó brought a unique energy to their performances. His commanding stage presence and raw emotional depth inspired his fans, who sang along to every word of their anthemic songs.

But Gabriel's love for music was not just about performing – it was also about creating something meaningful. When he wasn't on tour or in the studio, he spent his downtime working on solo projects, experimenting with different sounds and styles.

One day, while exploring the streets of Budapest, Gabriel stumbled upon a small, quirky record shop that became his new favorite haunt. The owner, a kind-hearted old man named István, took Gabriel under his wing and introduced him to a world of obscure vinyls and rare LPs.
