Gabriel Sandstrom was a man of few words, but when he spoke, people listened. As a former CIA operative turned private investigator, Gabriel had seen his fair share of dark alleys and backroom deals. But nothing could have prepared him for the case that walked in on a rainy Tuesday afternoon.

A young woman, no more than 25, stood outside his office building, her eyes scanning the sidewalk as if searching for something - or someone. She was shivering, despite the warmth of the summer air, and Gabriel's instincts told him she needed help. He ushered her inside, offering a warm smile and a seat by the fire.

"I'm Gabriel Sandstrom," he said, extending a hand. "What brings you to my neck of the woods?"

The woman hesitated, her eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape route. "I... I think someone's following me," she stammered.

Gabriel nodded sympathetically, his mind already racing with possibilities. He pulled out a notebook and began to scribble notes, his pen moving swiftly across the page. "Tell me everything," he urged, his eyes locked on hers.

As the woman poured out her story - of secret meetings, suspicious phone calls, and an increasing sense of dread - Gabriel's grip on his pen tightened. He had seen this before, of course, but there was something about this young woman that resonated with him. Maybe it was the way she spoke, like a child who'd lost her voice, or maybe it was the desperation in her eyes.

Whatever it was, Gabriel Sandstrom knew he was hooked. He vowed to uncover the truth behind her troubles, no matter where it led. As he listened, his mind whirled with possibilities - from cyberstalking to corporate espionage. But one thing was certain: he would not rest until this young woman was safe.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Gabriel sat back in his chair, his eyes never leaving hers. "Don't worry, kid," he said softly. "Gabriel Sandstrom is on the case."
