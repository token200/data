He had built a network of loyal allies and acquaintances, each of whom owed him a debt of gratitude for their place in the art world. His vast fortune and unparalleled connections allowed him to pull strings and shape the course of artistic history.

One such acquaintance was the brilliant artist, Sofia Rodriguez. A rising star in the art world, Sofia had caught Gabriel's eye with her bold and innovative style. He saw potential in her work and decided to offer her a lucrative commission to create a series of pieces for his private gallery.
