Gabriel Roux's eyes scanned the dimly lit alleyway, his gaze lingering on the small figure huddled in the corner. The rain poured down around him like a relentless curtain, shrouding the city in an impenetrable veil of mist. His presence was always felt, but often unseen.

As he approached, the figure slowly rose to its feet, revealing a young woman with skin as pale as alabaster and hair as black as the night itself. Her eyes locked onto his, filled with a mixture of fear and desperation. Gabriel's expression remained impassive, a mask he wore with ease.

"What do you want?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Gabriel didn't respond, instead extending a hand to guide her towards the nearby café. The woman hesitated for a moment before following him, her eyes darting nervously about as if searching for an escape route. Gabriel's presence was both calming and unnerving, leaving her in a state of suspended uncertainty.

As they entered the café, the warm glow of the lamps enveloped them like a haven from the storm outside. The woman ordered a coffee, her hands shaking as she handed over the money. Gabriel sat across from her, his eyes never leaving hers.

"You're looking for someone," he stated, his voice low and even.

The woman's gaze faltered, a fleeting glimmer of tears welling up in her eyes. "My sister... she disappeared six months ago. I've been searching for her everywhere, but no one seems to know anything."

Gabriel nodded sympathetically, his expression betraying nothing. He took a sip of the coffee, his eyes never leaving hers.

"I think I can help you," he said finally, his words dripping with an understated confidence.

The woman's face lit up with hope, her shoulders sagging in relief. For the first time in months, she felt like someone was truly listening to her, truly caring about her plight.

Gabriel Roux was a man of few words, but when he spoke, people listened. And right now, this young woman needed someone to listen – and help her find what she so desperately sought: answers about her sister's disappearance.
