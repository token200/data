Adam Étienne Poirier was a 25-year-old freelance writer and photographer who had always been drawn to the darker side of life. He spent most of his free time exploring abandoned buildings and capturing their eerie beauty through his lens.

One stormy night, Adam received a call from an old acquaintance, inviting him to visit an infamous mansion on the outskirts of town that was rumored to be haunted. The mansion had a reputation for being one of the most haunted places in the country, and Adam couldn't resist the opportunity to investigate.

As he approached the mansion, the wind howled and the trees creaked ominously. Adam shivered, but his curiosity kept him moving forward. He took out his camera and began snapping photos of the mansion's decaying facade.

Inside, the air was thick with dust and the stench of rot. Adam wandered through the empty halls, his footsteps echoing off the walls. Suddenly, he heard a faint whisper in his ear. "Get out while you still can." Adam spun around, but there was no one there.

He shrugged it off as mere trickery, but his skin prickled with unease. He continued to explore, documenting every detail of the mansion's crumbling grandeur. As the night wore on, he began to feel a creeping sense of dread. It was as if the mansion itself was watching him.

Just as Adam was about to leave, he stumbled upon a hidden room deep in the basement. Inside, he found a series of cryptic messages scrawled on the walls, seemingly written by the previous occupants. The words sent shivers down his spine: "They're coming for you."

Adam's heart racing, he quickly gathered his belongings and made a hasty exit. As he emerged from the mansion, the storm had subsided, leaving behind an unsettling stillness. He knew he would never set foot in that accursed place again.

Breathless and shaken, Adam returned to his small apartment, his camera still clutched in his hand. He began to review the photos he had taken, searching for any evidence of what had transpired. That's when he noticed something peculiar - a figure standing just behind him in one of the photos.

Adam Étienne Poirier's eyes widened as he realized that the whispers and warnings hadn't been mere tricks after all. Something was indeed coming for him, and it would stop at nothing to claim its next victim.
