Legend had it that the temple held the secrets of an ancient civilization, one that had possessed technology and knowledge beyond anything Adam Wolf could have imagined. And he was determined to uncover those secrets.

With a deep breath, Adam Wolf stepped forward, his eyes adjusting to the dim light within the temple. The air was thick with dust and the scent of aged stone. He walked cautiously, his trained eyes scanning every inch of the temple's interior.
