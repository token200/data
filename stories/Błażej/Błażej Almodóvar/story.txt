I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Błażej Almodóvar. It is possible that you may be thinking of Alfred Hitchcock's famous friend, actor and producer, José Ferrer was not associated with this name either.

However I can try writing a short story about someone who is an expert in 18th-century history, however the character Błażej Almodóvar seems unfamiliar to me.
