Błażej Trevisan was a man shrouded in mystery. A former member of the Polish Special Forces, he had left his country to escape the ghosts of his past and start anew. His rugged good looks and brooding nature only added to the enigma that surrounded him.

As a freelance journalist, Błażej Trevisan had built a reputation for himself as one who could get close to even the most hardened subjects. He was fiercely intelligent, with an uncanny ability to piece together seemingly unrelated facts into a coherent narrative.
