Błażej Stensson stepped out of his small apartment, taking a deep breath of the crisp Stockholm air. As a freelance journalist, he spent most of his days scouring the city for stories and interviewing anyone who would talk to him.

Tonight was no different. Błażej had received an anonymous tip about a possible scandal involving one of the city's wealthy business owners, and he was determined to get to the bottom of it.

He made his way through the crowded streets, weaving past tourists and locals alike as he headed towards the upscale neighborhood where the businessman resided. The streets were lined with expensive boutiques and restaurants, each one a testament to Stockholm's reputation for luxury and excess.

As Błażej approached the businessman's mansion, he noticed that it was shrouded in darkness. The lights were out, and the curtains were drawn tight, like someone was trying to hide something.

He hesitated for a moment, wondering if he should press on or call it a night. But his curiosity got the better of him, and he pulled out his notebook and pen.

With a sense of trepidation, Błażej knocked on the door. The silence that followed was oppressive, like the air was heavy with secrets. He waited for what felt like an eternity before finally hearing footsteps coming from inside.

The door creaked open, revealing a gaunt figure in his mid-50s, his eyes sunken and his skin pale. Błażej's instincts told him that this was the man he had been searching for – or at least, the man who might be able to lead him to it.

"Can I help you?" the businessman asked gruffly, his voice like gravel underfoot.

Błażej smiled wryly, his eyes locked onto the man's. "I think we can help each other," he said, pulling out a small recorder from his pocket. "You see, I've been investigating some irregularities in your business dealings. Care to explain?"

The businessman's face went white, and for a moment, Błażej thought he saw a flicker of fear in his eyes.

"I don't know what you're talking about," the man stammered, but Błażej knew better. He knew that when people like this were cornered, they always tried to deny it.

With a satisfied smile, Błażej stepped forward, ready to listen as the game began.
