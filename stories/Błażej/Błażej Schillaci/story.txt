Growing up in a small village in Eastern Europe, Błażej spent most of his days exploring the surrounding woods and fields, collecting peculiar items he found along the way.

As he grew older, Błażej's fascination with the unusual only intensified. He became an apprentice to a local taxidermist, where he honed his skills in stuffing and mounting animals. It was there that he developed his signature style – combining traditional techniques with his own unique flair.

One day, a prominent museum approached Błażej with an offer to exhibit his work. The curator was particularly taken by a piece titled "The Forest's Symphony," featuring a taxidermied owl perched atop a piano adorned with vines and leaves. Błażej Schillaci accepted the offer, knowing that this opportunity would allow him to share his art with a wider audience.
