Logan Ruiz García stepped into the crowded café, scanning the room for his friend. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee enveloped him as he made his way to the counter. He ordered a latte and took a seat at a small table by the window.

As he sipped his drink, Logan couldn't help but think about the job interview he had that morning. He was nervous about how it would go, especially after being rejected from several other positions in the past few months. But something about this one company felt different. Maybe it was the way they spoke about innovation and creativity, or maybe it was just a gut feeling.

Logan's phone buzzed, breaking his reverie. It was his best friend, Sophia, calling to check in. "Hey, how'd the interview go?" she asked, her voice full of concern. Logan took a sip of his latte before responding. "It went okay, I guess. I'm waiting to hear back tomorrow."

Sophia's tone softened. "That's all you can do, right? Keep your fingers crossed." Logan chuckled. "Yeah, I'll try not to get too anxious."

As they chatted, a waitress approached their table with a tray of pastries. "Freshly baked croissants," she said, setting the tray down in front of them. Logan and Sophia dug in, savoring the flaky layers and sweet fillings.

After finishing their snack, Logan glanced at his watch. He had a few more hours to kill before his next class. Sophia suggested they grab some lunch together, and Logan agreed. As they walked out of the café, Logan felt a sense of gratitude for friends like Sophia who knew how to calm his nerves.

As they strolled through campus, Logan couldn't help but feel hopeful about the interview. Maybe this one would be different. Maybe he'd finally find a job that aligned with his passions and values. He took a deep breath, letting the uncertainty wash over him. Either way, he knew he'd face it head-on as Logan Ruiz García, ready to take on whatever came next.
