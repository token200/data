One day, Logan received a cryptic message from an unknown source, requesting a meeting at an abandoned church on the outskirts of town. Curiosity getting the better of him, he made his way to the location, where he found a figure cloaked in shadows.

The figure revealed himself to be an old friend, one who had known Logan since their days as students at university. He told Logan that he had discovered a web of corruption that went all the way to the top of Florence's government, and he needed Logan's help to expose it.

Logan's eyes narrowed as he listened, his mind racing with the implications. This was the break he had been waiting for, the chance to finally make a real difference in the world. He nodded, and together they set out on a perilous journey to bring justice to those who had been wronged for so long.
