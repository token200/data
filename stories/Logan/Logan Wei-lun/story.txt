Logan Wei-lun sat on the rooftop, his eyes fixed on the glittering cityscape below. The stars twinkled like diamonds scattered across the velvet expanse, and for a moment, he felt small yet connected to something much greater.

As a child, Logan had always been fascinated by the night sky. He would often sneak out of his family's apartment to gaze up at the stars, feeling an inexplicable sense of belonging to the universe. As he grew older, that sense only deepened.

Logan was a brilliant astronomer, with a mind that devoured complex equations and theoretical models like they were candy. His colleagues at the prestigious New Horizons Institute marveled at his insights, which often shed new light on long-standing mysteries of the cosmos.

But Logan's work came with a price. He had always felt like an outsider among his peers, his Taiwanese heritage setting him apart in a predominantly white, male-dominated field. Despite this, he persevered, driven by an insatiable curiosity and a desire to unravel the secrets of the universe.

Tonight was no exception. Logan sat on the rooftop, lost in thought as he pondered a recent breakthrough: the discovery of a hidden pattern in the galaxy's rotation curves. It was a finding that could rewrite the textbooks on astrophysics, but also raised more questions than answers.

Logan's mind whirled with possibilities, his thoughts dancing across the stars like fireflies on a summer night. He saw visions of distant worlds, each one spinning to its own beat, their rhythms weaving together in an intricate dance.

As the first light of dawn crept over the horizon, Logan finally emerged from his reverie. The city was stirring below, its inhabitants emerging from their nests like insects from the earth. Logan smiled to himself, feeling a sense of peace settle over him.

For in that moment, he knew he was exactly where he belonged â€“ among the stars, lost in the infinite expanse of possibility. And when the world around him returned to normal, he would be ready, his eyes fixed on the horizon, searching for the next great mystery to unravel. The universe was full of secrets, and Logan Wei-lun was determined to uncover them all.
