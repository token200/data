Logan Dell trudged through the pouring rain, his eyes fixed on the small café in front of him. He had been running for hours, and the exhaustion was starting to catch up with him. As he pushed open the door, a warm glow of light enveloped him, immediately making him feel more alive.

 Inside, the café was cozy and quiet, with only a handful of patrons scattered about. Logan's eyes landed on an empty table by the window, where he made his way to take a seat. The waitress, a bright smile plastered on her face, came over to take his order.

"Just coffee, please," Logan muttered, not having the energy to muster up a greeting.

As he waited for his drink, Logan's eyes wandered around the café, taking in the eclectic decor and the soft hum of conversation from the patrons. It was a place that seemed to exist outside of the chaos of the world, a sanctuary where people could come to escape the noise.

Just as he was starting to relax, a figure caught his eye across the room. A woman with piercing green eyes and long, curly brown hair sat at the bar, sipping on a glass of wine. There was something about her that drew Logan in, a sense of calmness and confidence that seemed to radiate from her very being.

As he watched, she turned to face him, their eyes locking in a fleeting moment of connection. For a brief instant, Logan felt like he had been transported to another world, one where the only thing that mattered was this woman and the connection they shared.

But the spell was broken as quickly as it had begun, and Logan looked away, feeling a pang of disappointment. He knew that he couldn't stay here forever, but for now, he was content to sit in silence, nursing his coffee and watching the woman from across the room.

As the rain continued to pour outside, Logan felt his worries start to seep away, replaced by a sense of peace and contentment. Maybe, just maybe, this café was exactly where he needed to be right now.
