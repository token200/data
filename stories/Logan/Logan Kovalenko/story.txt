Logan Kovalenko, known to his friends and family as "Kov," was a man with a past shrouded in mystery. His eyes, an unnerving shade of grey, seemed to hold secrets he refused to share. With chiseled features and broad shoulders, Kov exuded an aura of quiet confidence that made people take notice.

After serving time for a string of high-profile robberies, Kov had been released from prison under mysterious circumstances. He claimed to have been in witness protection, but few believed him. As he navigated the treacherous landscape of his past, Kov knew one thing: he needed to keep moving.

A sleek black SUV pulled up beside him as he walked down a rain-soaked street. The tinted windows refused to reveal their occupants, fueling Kov's wariness. He nodded curtly at the driver before entering the vehicle. As they sped away from the curb, Kov checked his rearview mirror. A figure in a fedora stood watching them from across the street.

"This is not good," Kov muttered to himself.

The SUV hurtled through city streets, weaving past startled pedestrians and swooping cars. Kov's eyes locked onto the driver, whose features remained obscured behind shades. He wondered what he had gotten himself into this time.

Suddenly, the vehicle screeched to a halt beside an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. The driver gestured for Kov to exit, his movements fluid and calculated. As Kov stepped out of the SUV, a sleek black van hurtled towards him, tires screeching in protest.

Kov's hand instinctively went to the gun he'd "accidentally" stashed away before leaving prison. He watched warily as two men, their faces obscured by ski masks, leapt from the van. They were his old associates – those who had helped him escape and now wanted a piece of him for themselves.

Without hesitation, Kov reached into his jacket pocket and produced a silver lighter. He flicked it open, its bright flame illuminating the dark corners of the warehouse. With an air of quiet determination, he lit the van's tires before turning to face his former partners.

For a fleeting moment, Kov relished the opportunity for revenge. But something in their demeanor – a mixture of desperation and exhaustion – made him hesitate. He knew this wasn't about recouping old debts or exacting vengeance; it was about survival.
