Logan Zawisza sat in the dimly lit bar, nursing his whiskey on the rocks as he watched the patrons filter in and out of the door. A private investigator with a reputation for being one of the best in the city, Logan had seen it all - from high-stakes corporate espionage to murder-for-hire schemes.

As he sipped his drink, Logan's mind wandered back to his early days as an investigator. Growing up on the wrong side of the tracks, Logan had learned to rely on his wits and intuition to get by. He had worked his way up through the ranks, earning a reputation for being fiercely independent and unafraid to take risks.

Logan's eyes landed on a familiar figure across the room - Rachel Morse, a fellow investigator and former colleague. They had worked together on several cases over the years, but their partnership had ended acrimoniously a few years ago when they disagreed on how to handle a particularly tricky case. Still, Logan couldn't help but feel a spark of curiosity as he watched her expertly navigate the crowded bar.

As fate would have it, Rachel caught his eye and raised an eyebrow in recognition before turning back to her conversation with a potential client. Logan decided to take a chance and make his move, slipping out of the bar and following her at a distance. He trailed behind her for several blocks, watching as she expertly dispatched the client and disappeared into the night.

Curiosity got the better of him, and Logan found himself back in Rachel's apartment a few hours later, sipping on another whiskey as he waited for her to return from one last meeting. When she finally walked through the door, flanked by two imposing bodyguards, Logan raised an eyebrow - it seemed Rachel had taken on some heavy hitters.

"What brings you here tonight?" Logan asked, setting his glass down as Rachel dropped into the armchair opposite him. "And what's with the new security detail?"

Rachel smirked, taking a seat next to Logan on the couch. "Just doing some old business, Zawisza," she said, with a sly grin. "You know how it is."

Logan chuckled, running a hand through his dark hair. It seemed that old habits died hard - and so did his interest in staying out of Rachel Morse's orbit.
