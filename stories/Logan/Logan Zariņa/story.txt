As she worked, Logan's mind wandered back to her past, to the small town in Latvia where she had grown up. It was a world away from the cybercrime underworld she now inhabited, but it was where she had first developed her skills and learned to rely on herself.

Despite the risks, Logan felt most alive when she was hacking. There was something exhilarating about outsmarting her enemies and uncovering secrets that were meant to remain hidden. She reveled in the thrill of the chase, the rush of adrenaline as she navigated the complex web of digital deceit.

As she worked, the hours blurred together in a haze of code and circuitry. Logan Zariņa's eyes never left the screen, her focus fixed on the prize that lay ahead – the next big score, the next challenge to be conquered.
