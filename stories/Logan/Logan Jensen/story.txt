Logan Jensen stared out at the rain-soaked streets, his mind a thousand miles away. He had always been the type to keep his emotions locked away, but lately, it seemed like they were threatening to spill out all over the place.

As a detective with the city's Homicide Unit, Logan had seen some dark things in his time. But nothing could have prepared him for the case that was currently occupying his every waking moment - the murder of a young mother just 10 years ago.

Logan had been assigned to re-open the cold case, and he couldn't shake the feeling that something didn't add up. The original detective on the case had concluded that it was an isolated incident, but Logan's gut told him there was more to it.

As he sat at his desk, pouring over the file, a knock came at the door. It was Emily, the new intern assigned to his team. She was bright and eager, with a smile that could light up a room. But as she handed him the latest forensic report, Logan couldn't help but notice the faint tremble in her hand.

"Hey, boss," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I've been going over the evidence, and I think I found something."

Logan's eyes narrowed. What was this kid thinking? He pushed the file across the desk, his mind racing with possibilities. As he scanned the report, a name caught his eye - a minor suspect that had been dismissed as insignificant by the original team.

"Emily," Logan said, his voice low and urgent. "Tell me more about this witness."

As Emily explained her findings, Logan's gut began to churn with anticipation. This could be it - the break they needed to finally solve the case. He patted the chair beside him, inviting Emily to sit down.

For the first time in months, Logan felt a spark of hope ignite within him. Maybe, just maybe, this cold case wouldn't remain forever closed after all. With renewed determination, he leaned forward, his eyes locked on the horizon, ready to take on whatever lay ahead.

"I think it's time we paid our witness a visit," Logan said, a hint of excitement creeping into his voice. "Are you with me, Emily?"
