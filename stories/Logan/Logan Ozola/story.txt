Logan Ozola stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit bar, shaking the water off her worn denim jacket. She had been driving for hours, trying to escape the memories that haunted her. As a former detective with the Cleveland Police Department, Logan had seen her fair share of darkness, but nothing could have prepared her for what happened that fateful night.

She spotted Jack, an old friend and fellow cop, sitting at the bar, nursing a whiskey. He raised his glass as she approached, and Logan couldn't help but smile. "What's in your drink?" she asked, sliding onto the stool beside him.

"Just the usual," Jack replied with a wink. "It'll put some hair on your chest."

Logan chuckled, taking a sip of her own beer. They talked for hours, catching up on old times and sharing stories about their lives since leaving the force. Logan had taken a break from law enforcement to focus on her art â€“ painting was her therapy, her escape.

As the night wore on, Logan found herself opening up to Jack about her struggles. She spoke of the PTSD she struggled with, the nightmares that still plagued her at night, and the fear that gripped her every time she looked in the mirror. Jack listened attentively, offering words of encouragement and support.

For the first time in months, Logan felt like she was being heard, truly understood. It was a feeling she hadn't experienced in years, since leaving the police department. She realized that maybe it was time to face her demons head-on, rather than running from them.

As they left the bar and walked into the rain-soaked night, Jack put a hand on Logan's shoulder. "You're not alone, Ozola," he said softly. "We all are." Logan nodded, feeling a sense of peace wash over her for the first time in a long while. Maybe, just maybe, she was ready to start healing.
