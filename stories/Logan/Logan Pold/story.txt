Logan Pold had always been fascinated by the supernatural and the unexplained. As a child, he spent hours poring over dusty tomes in his father's library, devouring tales of ghosts, demons, and otherworldly creatures. This curiosity only grew stronger with age, leading him to become a renowned paranormal investigator in his own right.

Logan Pold's latest case was particularly intriguing - a series of bizarre occurrences at an abandoned asylum on the outskirts of town.

His voice was swallowed by the silence, but then, faintly, he heard a whisper - a soft, raspy voice that seemed to be coming from all around him. "Get out while you still can," it hissed.
