Growing up in a small town in Wisconsin, she had always been fascinated by the stories behind the headlines, and her passion only grew stronger as she honed her craft in college.

After graduating at the top of her class with a degree in journalism, Logan landed an internship at a major metropolitan newspaper, where she quickly proved herself to be a talented and fearless reporter.
