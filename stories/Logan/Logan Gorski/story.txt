Logan Gorski was known for his unorthodox approach to detective work. With a background in art history and a knack for observing even the smallest details, he had solved some of the city's most baffling cases. But it was the latest case that had everyone stumped - the theft of a priceless painting from the museum.

As Logan Gorski sat at his desk, pouring over the security footage, he noticed something peculiar. A figure in a black hoodie seemed to be lurking around the gallery just before the painting went missing. He couldn't make out their face, but something about the way they moved caught his attention.

Logan Gorski decided to pay a visit to the museum's security team, armed with his newfound theory. As he walked through the galleries, he stopped in front of the empty wall where the painting once hung. He ran his fingers over the frame, feeling the slight vibrations of the glass.

"Detective Logan Gorski," he said to the security chief, "I think I've found our thief."

The chief looked at him skeptically. "How so?"

Logan Gorski pointed to a small scratch on the wall near the gallery's ventilation system. "This was here before the painting went missing. It looks like someone climbed up there and took it down. And look - the black hoodie has a strange smell to it."

The chief's eyes widened as he examined the scratch more closely. Suddenly, the pieces clicked into place. They had been looking at this from the wrong angle.

Within hours, they had apprehended the thief - a disgruntled former employee of the museum who had used their knowledge of the ventilation system to get away with the painting. Logan Gorski watched as the suspect was led away in handcuffs, feeling a sense of satisfaction wash over him. Another case closed, thanks to his keen eye and unorthodox methods.

As he walked out of the museum, Logan Gorski couldn't help but think about how his art history background had helped him crack this particularly tricky case.
