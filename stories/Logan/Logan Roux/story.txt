Logan Roux stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of saltwater and seaweed filling his lungs. As he gazed out at the small coastal town, a sense of nostalgia washed over him. It had been years since Logan Roux last set foot in this quaint little place, but it still felt like home.

As he made his way through the station, Logan Roux's eyes scanned the crowd for a familiar face. He spotted her just as she was exiting the ticket counter – his old friend, Sophia Patel. The two had grown up together, exploring these very same streets and sharing secrets beneath the pier.

Sophia's bright smile lit up the drizzly afternoon as Logan Roux approached her. "Logan! It's been ages!" she exclaimed, opening her arms for a warm hug. Logan Roux returned the gesture, feeling a sense of ease he hadn't experienced in years.

The two spent the rest of the day catching up and reminiscing about old times. Sophia filled him in on the latest news from the town – the new restaurant that had opened up, the upcoming festival, and even the rumored sighting of a mermaid in the harbor. Logan Roux chuckled along with her, his eyes twinkling with mirth.

As they walked along the beach, watching the sun set over the ocean, Logan Roux felt a sense of peace wash over him. He realized that, despite his travels and adventures, this small coastal town would always be home – at least for him. It was where he could lay his hat and truly be himself.

The sound of seagulls filled the air as they sat down on the sand to share a bag of chips and watch the stars come out. Sophia turned to Logan Roux with a curious expression. "So, what brings you back to Ravenswood?" she asked, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. Logan Roux smiled wistfully, his eyes drifting out to sea. "Just passing through," he said quietly, but Sophia knew better – she knew that Logan Roux was exactly where he needed to be: in the place where his heart had always felt at home.
