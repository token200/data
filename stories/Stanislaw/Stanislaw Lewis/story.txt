Stanislaw Lem was born on December 12, 1921, in Lw√≥w, Poland (now Lviv, Ukraine). He studied philosophy at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow, where he developed an interest in science fiction. During World War II, Lem served in the Polish Army and was wounded several times.

After the war, Lem began to write science fiction stories and novels, often combining elements of philosophy, psychology, and social commentary. His most famous works include "Cyberiad" (1965), a collection of short stories that explore the intersection of technology and humanity, and "Solaris" (1961), a novel about a psychologist who is sent to investigate strange occurrences on a space station.

Throughout his career, Lem was known for his unique writing style, which blended science fiction with philosophical and psychological themes. He was also a prolific critic and essayist, writing on topics such as the nature of reality and the role of science in society.

Stanislaw Lem's work has been widely acclaimed and translated into many languages. He won numerous awards, including the Hugo Award for Best Novel for "Solaris" (1961) and the Nebula Award for Best Novel for "Cyberiad" (1967).
