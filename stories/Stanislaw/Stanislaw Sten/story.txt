Sten carefully extracted the gemstone from the rock face, admiring its beauty and intricate patterns. He knew that this find would be a major breakthrough for the scientific community, and he couldn't wait to share his discovery with the world. As he made his way back to camp, the Arizona Ruby safely nestled in his pocket, Sten felt a sense of pride and satisfaction that only came from uncovering a long-lost secret.

As he settled into his tent that night, surrounded by maps and samples, Sten couldn't help but feel grateful for his life's work.
