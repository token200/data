But those who knew him whispered of his remarkable skills as a detective, earning him a reputation as one of the greatest investigators in Warsaw's underworld.

It was a drizzly autumn evening when Krzysztof Bauer received a cryptic message from an anonymous source, hinting at a gruesome murder that had taken place on the outskirts of town. The victim was a young woman named Elżbieta, with a promising future ahead of her.
