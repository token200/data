Krzysztof Yusuf was known for his enigmatic smile and piercing green eyes that seemed to see right through you. A Polish photographer by trade, he had a knack for capturing the beauty in the mundane, often using his camera as a tool to tell stories of the marginalized.

Born into a family of artists, Krzysztof Yusuf's creative gene was evident from an early age.
