One day, while on a solo mission in Eastern Europe, Krzysztof Dufresne received a cryptic message from an old acquaintance, requesting his presence at a meeting in Berlin. The note was brief, but the words seemed to hold a weight that commanded immediate attention.

As he arrived at the agreed location, a nondescript café on the outskirts of the city, Krzysztof Dufresne sensed a sense of unease in the air. His contact, a middle-aged woman with piercing green eyes, greeted him with a nod and led him to a secluded corner table.

"I have information about your sister," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "She's in danger, Krzysztof Dufresne. The people who took her are not what they seem."
