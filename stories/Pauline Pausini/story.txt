I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Pauline Pausini. It's possible that you may be thinking of a different person or character.

However, I can suggest some options to help me better understand your request:

1. Provide more context: Can you please provide more background information about the character Pauline Pausini? For example, is she a main character in a book, movie, or TV show? What genre does her story belong to?
2. Describe the character: If you don't have any prior knowledge about Pauline Pausini, can you describe her personality, appearance, and background to help me get started?

Assuming you would like to create a new character, I'd be happy to assist you in writing a 450-word story.

Please let me know how I can proceed.
