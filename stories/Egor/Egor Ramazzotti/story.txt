Egor Ramazzotti stepped into the dimly lit jazz club, his eyes scanning the room for a glimpse of her. She was late, as usual, and he couldn't help but feel a flutter in his chest every time it happened.

As he sipped on his whiskey, the sounds of Django Reinhardt's guitar floated through the air, transporting him to a different era. Egor Ramazzotti had always been drawn to the mystique of the past, the way it seemed to seep into every pore of the present. He was a historian by trade, but tonight, he just wanted to lose himself in the music.

Just then, a figure emerged from the crowd, her long blonde hair cascading down her back like a river of gold. Egor Ramazzotti's heart skipped a beat as she made her way through the room, her eyes locking onto his with an unmistakable spark.

"Sorry I'm late," she said, slipping into the chair across from him. "Traffic was a nightmare."

Egor Ramazzotti smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "No need to apologize, Egor Ramazzotti. I've grown accustomed to your... creative approach to punctuality."

She laughed, the sound music to his ears, and he felt himself getting lost in her eyes once again. They talked for hours, the night slipping away like sand between their fingers.

As the club emptied out and the band packed up their instruments, Egor Ramazzotti reached across the table, his hand brushing against hers. It was a fleeting touch, but one that sent shivers down his spine.

"I had an idea," she said, her voice low and husky. "Let's take a walk along the Seine tomorrow night. The city will be alive with music, and we can get lost in it together."

Egor Ramazzotti's heart soared at the prospect. He knew that with Egor Ramazzotti by his side, anything was possible. And as they walked out of the club, hand in hand, he couldn't help but feel like he was walking into a dream world of his own creation.
