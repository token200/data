Egor Clarke stepped out of the misty London evening and into the warm glow of his favorite pub, The Red Lion. He had just finished a long day of work as a detective with Scotland Yard, and all he wanted was a pint of his favorite ale and some quiet conversation.

As he slid onto a stool at the bar, the bartender raised an eyebrow. "The usual, Egor?" he asked, nodding towards the glass of amber liquid in front of him.

Egor smiled wryly. "Make it two," he said, sliding a few notes across the counter. The bartender chuckled and began pouring another pint for his friend, Detective Inspector Emily Taylor.

Just as Egor was about to take a sip, the door swung open and a tall, imposing figure strode in. It was Marcus Blackwood, a notorious gangster with a reputation for ruthlessness. He scanned the room, his eyes locking onto Egor's familiar face.

"Mind if I join you?" he asked, his voice dripping with menace. Egor hesitated, but Emily stepped forward to intercept Blackwood. "I think we've made it clear, Marcus," she said firmly. "You're not welcome here."

Blackwood sneered at her, but Egor was intrigued. He slid off the stool and followed Emily as she led Blackwood outside, into the chilly night air.

"What do you want, Marcus?" Egor asked, his eyes fixed on the gangster's face. Blackwood smiled, a cold, calculating smile.

"I have information," he said, his voice low and conspiratorial. "Information about a murder that took place five years ago. A murder that was never solved."

Egor raised an eyebrow. He had worked on many cases over the years, but none of them had ever led to this kind of revelation.

"Tell me more," he said, his eyes locked onto Blackwood's.

And with that, Egor's mind went into gear. He knew that solving the case would require all of his skills and expertise, but he was ready for the challenge. After all, as a detective, it was cases like this that made him feel alive.

"I'll listen," he said finally, his eyes never leaving Blackwood's face. "But you'd better be telling me something I need to hear."
