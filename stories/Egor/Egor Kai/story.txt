Egor Kai stood at the edge of the city, his eyes fixed on the vast expanse of ocean stretching out before him. The wind whipped through his dark hair as he breathed in deeply, feeling the salty air fill his lungs. He was a man of few words, but his gaze spoke volumes.

A former member of an elite special forces unit, Egor had left it all behind after a traumatic mission went awry. He'd been haunted by the ghosts of his past, and the memories that lingered in every crevice of his mind. The sea was his sanctuary, a place where he could find solace in its vastness.

As he gazed out at the waves, Egor's thoughts turned to the package in his hand. A small, unmarked box containing a single item – a photograph. It was an image of a young woman, her eyes bright and full of life. She'd been taken from him far too soon, and the pain still lingered.

Egor's phone buzzed in his pocket, breaking the silence. He hesitated before answering, unsure if he wanted to face whoever was on the other end. But something compelled him to take the call, to hear the words that might finally bring him closure.

"Kai," a voice said on the other end, "I know it's been years since... I'm sorry."

Egor raised an eyebrow, intrigued. Who was this person, and how did they know his name? The line went silent for a moment before the voice continued, "My name is Rachel. Your friend from the unit – we were there on that mission together. We lost you in the chaos... but I never gave up hope."

Tears pricked at Egor's eyes as he listened, his grip on the box tightening around the photograph. A spark of curiosity flared to life within him, and for the first time in years, he felt a glimmer of purpose.

Rachel's voice came back online, more urgent now. "Kai, I need your help. We've received intel about something big – something that could put us all at risk. Can you meet me at the old warehouse on 5th and Main?"

Egor hesitated for a moment before nodding to himself. The sea might have been his sanctuary, but it was time to face the world again.

He tucked the phone into his pocket, his eyes never leaving the horizon as he turned and walked back towards the city, ready to take on whatever lay ahead.
