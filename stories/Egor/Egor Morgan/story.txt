Egor Ivanovich Morgan stepped into the dimly lit jazz club, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. As he made his way through the crowded space, the smooth sounds of the saxophone floated through the air, drawing him closer to the bar.

Egor Ivanovich Morgan, former lead singer of the infamous rock band "Electric Storm," had traded in his microphone for a solo career as a jazz pianist. It was a decision that had left many fans scratching their heads, but Egor Ivanovich Morgan knew it was the right one.

As he ordered a whiskey at the bar, a figure emerged from the crowd and made their way towards him. It was Lena, his ex-wife and former bandmate. They had been married for five years before the breakup, but Egor Ivanovich Morgan knew that Lena still held a piece of his heart.

"Hey, Eg," she said, using the nickname only a few people were allowed to use. "What brings you here tonight?"

Egor Ivanovich Morgan raised an eyebrow, intrigued by her question. "Just passing through," he replied, sipping his drink. "I needed a change of scenery."

Lena nodded sympathetically. "I know the feeling. Sometimes I feel like I'm stuck in a rut too."

The two former bandmates chatted for a while, catching up on old times and sharing stories about their current projects. Egor Ivanovich Morgan told Lena about his latest jazz album, which had been getting rave reviews from critics and fans alike.

As the night wore on, the conversation turned to music. Lena mentioned that she was working on a new song, one that she wanted to get feedback on. Egor Ivanovich Morgan listened intently as she played him a rough demo of her latest composition.

The melody was hauntingly beautiful, and Egor Ivanovich Morgan found himself tapping his foot along with the beat. When it was finished, he applauded politely, trying not to give too much away.

"You're still got it," he said finally, a smile spreading across his face. "But maybe you should work on adding more tension and release."

Lena laughed, her eyes sparkling with gratitude. "Thanks, Eg. I appreciate the feedback."

As the night drew to a close, Egor Ivanovich Morgan realized that some things never changed. Even after all these years apart, he still had a connection with Lena, one that went beyond music.

With a nod, he handed her his business card. "If you ever need any more feedback," he said, "don't hesitate to reach out."

And with that, the two former bandmates parted ways, each returning to their own journey, forever changed by the chance encounter in the dimly lit jazz club.
