Egor Petrenko was a man with a troubled past, one that he kept hidden behind his piercing blue eyes. A former soldier, he had seen and done things that would haunt him for the rest of his life. The scars on his face and arms were just the beginning – they told only part of the story.

Egor's journey began in the streets of Moscow, where he grew up fighting for survival alongside his siblings. His parents had been killed in a brutal gang fight when he was just a teenager, leaving him with no choice but to fend for himself. He quickly learned to adapt and to trust no one.

Years later, Egor enlisted in the Russian army, hoping to find a sense of purpose and belonging. But the trauma of his past followed him everywhere, and he eventually deserted after witnessing atrocities that would change him forever.

Now, at 35, Egor was living on the fringes of society. He worked as a janitor at a local hospital, a job that allowed him to be close to children without having to reveal his true self. His nights were filled with whiskey-fueled nightmares and cold sweats.

One fateful evening, while exploring the city's underground art scene, Egor stumbled upon an exhibition of raw, edgy paintings by a young artist named Lena. Her work spoke directly to him – it was as if she had seen through his façade and still chose to create something beautiful out of it.

For the first time in years, Egor felt like he could breathe again. He began attending Lena's exhibitions regularly, always sitting at the back, observing without being observed. But one night, after a particularly moving performance, Lena caught his eye, and for the first time in centuries, he saw something resembling human connection.

Over the next few weeks, Egor and Lena started to talk – not about art or life but about their dark pasts and inner demons. The ice around her heart began to thaw, and Egor found himself falling deeply in love with this strange, talented woman.

Though their paths were fraught with danger, they continued to meet in secret, sharing their stories and healing each other's wounds. It was a fragile hope – one that could be crushed at any moment – but for the first time in his life, Egor felt like he had found someone who understood him. And maybe, just maybe, she would help him find redemption.
