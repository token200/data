Egor Sarinana stepped out of the rain and into the warm glow of the café, shaking the water from his coat. As a private investigator, he'd spent countless nights like this one, waiting for leads to dry up. But Egor Sarinana had seen better days.

He took a seat at the bar and ordered a whiskey, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. The kind that came with being Egor Sarinana, a man who'd made more enemies than friends in his line of work.

As he sipped his drink, a woman slid onto the stool next to him, her eyes locked on his reflection in the mirror behind the bar. "Mind if I join you?" she asked, her voice husky and confident.

Egor Sarinana raised an eyebrow but said nothing, simply gesturing for her to take a seat. The woman introduced herself as Sophia, and Egor Sarinana listened intently as she spun a tale of missing persons and corporate espionage. It sounded like the work of his client, billionaire CEO Julian Blackwood.

Egor Sarinana's ears perked up at the mention of Blackwood's name – a man with ties to every shady deal in town. He nodded for Sophia to continue, his mind racing with possibilities.

As they talked, Egor Sarinana couldn't help but notice the way Sophia watched him, her gaze lingering on his face as if searching for something. It was a trick he knew all too well – people often underestimated Egor Sarinana's vulnerability by underestimating his rough exterior.

The night wore on, and the conversation turned darker, more sinister. Egor Sarinana's instincts told him that Sophia was hiding something, but he couldn't quite put his finger on what it was. Still, he was intrigued – this case had all the makings of a wild ride, and Egor Sarinana was always up for a challenge.

As they parted ways outside the café, Egor Sarinana couldn't shake the feeling that Sophia was connected to something much bigger than herself. He made a mental note to look deeper into her past, to uncover the secrets she kept so closely guarded. The game had just begun, and Egor Sarinana was ready to play.
