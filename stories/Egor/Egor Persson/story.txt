Egor Viktorovich Persson was a man of simple tastes and modest means. He lived in a small apartment above his family's bakery, where he spent most of his days kneading dough and helping his parents with the day-to-day operations.

Despite the demands of running the bakery, Egor had always been fascinated by music. As a young boy, he would spend hours practicing the violin in secret, much to the dismay of his parents who preferred traditional folk songs over modern melodies. However, Egor's passion for music only grew stronger as he grew older, and he began to dream of one day forming his own band.

Egor's friends at school were all about sports and parties, but not him. He would spend his free time attending local concerts and jam sessions, where he met fellow musicians who shared his vision of creating something new and exciting in the Russian music scene. It wasn't long before Egor found himself part of a group called "The Red Note", a collective of musicians from all walks of life who shared a common goal: to bring Russian folk music into the 21st century.

As Egor's talents became apparent, he began to take on more responsibilities within The Red Note. He wrote songs and arranged melodies that blended traditional folk themes with modern beats, creating a unique sound that captivated audiences from Moscow to St. Petersburg. His parents, who had always been supportive of his music, couldn't be prouder of their son's success.

Despite the long hours spent touring and recording, Egor never lost sight of his roots. He continued to live above the bakery with his family, where he would often take breaks from performing to help out with the day-to-day operations. When asked about his secret to balancing music and family life, Egor simply smiled and said, "It's all about finding harmony". And in that moment, it was clear that Egor Viktorovich Persson had truly found his place in the world â€“ at the intersection of music, love, and family.
