After a falling out with The Order's leadership, Egor Bierhals found himself on the run from his former employers. With a price on his head and a reputation for being one of the best spies in the business, he knew he had to lay low for a while.

He settled into a small flat on the outskirts of Berlin, where he could keep a low profile and focus on rebuilding his life. Egor Bierhals spent most of his days sipping coffee and brooding about his past mistakes, but as the weeks turned into months, he began to feel restless.

The itch for adventure soon became too much to ignore, and Egor Bierhals set out to uncover a mysterious plot that had been simmering in the shadows. He scoured the city's underworld, following leads and gathering intel from shady characters and underground informants.

As he dug deeper, Egor Bierhals realized that this was more than just another job – it was personal. The plot threatened not only his own life but also the lives of those he cared about most.

With his reputation as a master spy still intact, Egor Bierhals knew he had to move quickly if he wanted to stay one step ahead of his enemies. He assembled a team of trusted allies and set out on a perilous mission to expose the truth behind the sinister plot.

As the stakes grew higher, Egor Bierhals found himself once again in the midst of a high-stakes game of cat and mouse. But this time, he was playing for more than just victory – he was fighting for his very existence.
