Egor Kovács was a man with a passion for old books and forgotten knowledge. He spent most of his days scouring the dusty shelves of local libraries and antique shops, searching for rare volumes that few others had ever laid eyes on.

As he wandered through the narrow streets of Prague, Egor's eyes would scan the facades, taking in the intricate carvings and ornate details that seemed to whisper secrets of a bygone era. He was particularly drawn to buildings with old-world charm, where the weight of history hung heavy in the air.

One drizzly afternoon, as he turned a corner onto Hradčanské náměstí, Egor spotted a small, almost-overlooked bookstore tucked away between two larger establishments. The sign above the door read "Antiquarian Editions" in elegant, cursive script.

With a thrill of excitement, Egor pushed open the door and stepped inside. The air was thick with dust and the scent of old paper. Shelves upon shelves of books seemed to stretch up to the ceiling, each one carefully arranged to showcase its contents.

The proprietor, an elderly man with spectacles perched on the end of his nose, looked up from behind the counter as Egor entered. "Welcome, young sir," he said in a warm, measured voice. "I see you have an eye for the rare and unusual."

Egor smiled, running his fingers over the spines of several nearby books. "I'm Egor Kovács, by the way. I've been searching for a very specific volume – 'De re metallica' by Georgius Agricola. Have you seen it?"

The proprietor nodded thoughtfully. "Ah, yes. A fine choice, indeed. That one's a rare find, even among our collection." He disappeared into the back room and emerged with a slim, leather-bound volume. Egor's eyes widened as he took in the contents – a treasure trove of information on mining and metallurgy.

As he carefully tucked the book under his arm, Egor felt a sense of satisfaction wash over him. Another piece of forgotten knowledge had been added to his collection, courtesy of the proprietor's keen eye and vast knowledge.
