Egor Smith was a man with a passion for fixing anything that broke. Growing up in a family of inventors and tinkerers, he learned how to repair engines, replace gears, and even build his own machines from scratch. As he grew older, Egor's skills only improved, and he became known among his friends and community as the go-to guy for any broken item.

One sunny afternoon, as Egor was walking down the street, he heard a faint whining noise coming from a nearby bicycle shop. Curious, he walked inside to find an old man struggling to fix his beloved bike. The old man explained that he had been trying to repair the chain for hours but couldn't seem to get it right.

Without hesitation, Egor introduced himself as Egor Smith, inventor and repair expert, and offered his services. He quickly examined the bike and diagnosed the problem - a loose bolt that needed to be tightened. With his trusty toolbox by his side, he set to work, carefully tightening the bolt until the chain was running smoothly.

The old man was overjoyed with Egor's expertise and thanked him profusely for his help. As they chatted, Egor discovered that the old man was a retired engineer who had spent most of his life designing innovative solutions for complex problems. Egor was fascinated by the old man's stories and eagerly asked if he could learn more about engineering.

The two men spent the rest of the afternoon discussing everything from gears to pulleys, with Egor soaking up as much knowledge as possible. As he left the shop, the old man handed him a small toolbox with a note that read: "For Egor Smith, the next great inventor." Egor beamed with pride, knowing that his passion for fixing things was not just a hobby but a calling.

From that day on, Egor Smith continued to build on his reputation as a master repairman, always eager to share his knowledge and skills with others. And whenever someone asked him how he became so good at fixing things, he would smile and say it was all thanks to the wisdom of his new friend, the retired engineer who had taught him that sometimes the best solutions come from fixing what's broken.
