Egor Leblanc stood at the edge of the moonlit lake, his eyes fixed on the ripples disturbing the otherwise glassy surface. A former soldier, he had traded in his rifle for a fishing rod and now spent his days reeling in the occasional pike.

As he waited for a bite, Egor's mind wandered back to the war. The memories still lingered, etched into his psyche like the scars on his hands. He thought of his comrades, lost to the brutal conflict that had ravaged their homeland.

A gentle tug on the line snapped Egor back to reality. He pulled in his catch, a sleek pike with shimmering scales, and smiled wryly. It was moments like these that reminded him why he'd chosen this life: to escape the demons that haunted him.

Egor began to clean his fish, his hands moving with precision as he removed the innards and washed it down the drain. His thoughts turned to his sister, Sophie, who had been a constant source of comfort during the war. She was now a nurse in a nearby hospital, tending to wounded soldiers like Egor himself.

As he finished preparing the fish for dinner, Egor gazed out at the lake's tranquil expanse, feeling the weight of his past slowly lifting. He'd learned to channel his emotions into this quiet life by the water, where time seemed to stand still and the world outside receded.

With a practiced hand, Egor lit the stovetop burner and set the fish sizzling over medium heat. The aroma of charred flesh mingled with the scent of damp earth, carrying him back to his village childhood. His stomach growled in anticipation as he slid the cooked pike onto a wooden plate.

The first bite was like a symphony on his tongue – the snap of the scales giving way to tender flesh and the subtle sweetness of the water lilies growing along the lake's shoreline. Egor closed his eyes, allowing himself to be transported by this fleeting moment of peace.

As he devoured the meal, he realized that this quiet existence was not a rejection of his past but an acknowledgment of its significance. In the stillness of the night, surrounded by the sounds of nature and the faint echoes of memories, Egor Leblanc had found a sense of redemption – one that allowed him to live with the ghosts of war rather than letting them define him.
