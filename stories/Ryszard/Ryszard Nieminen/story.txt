I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Ryszard Nieminen. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created recently.

If you'd like, I can create a new story about a character with a similar-sounding name. Alternatively, if you have more context or details about the character Ryszard Nieminen, I may be able to help you better.

However, I did find information on a person named Ryszard Niemenen (note the slight spelling difference), who was a Polish gymnast. He competed in the 1972 Summer Olympics and won two bronze medals in men's floor exercise and parallel bars events.
