Ryszard Ming stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his piercing green eyes scanning the room for any sign of life. As a former Polish spy, he had spent years operating in the shadows, taking on missions that few dared to accept. But after a decade of living off the grid, Ryszard had grown restless.

The bartender, a grizzled old man with a thick beard, nodded at him from behind the counter. "Ryza, I see you're back," he said, using the nickname only a handful of people knew to call him by.

Ryszard slid onto a stool, ordering a whiskey as he took in his surroundings. The tavern was a dingy, cramped place, but it was home. He had been drawn here after receiving a cryptic message from an old acquaintance, hinting at a job that required his particular set of skills.

As he sipped his drink, Ryszard's gaze fell upon a figure sitting in the corner, hood up and face obscured. There was something about the way they sat, like they were waiting for him specifically, that piqued his interest.

The bartender followed his stare and nodded discreetly. "That one's been asking questions," he said, his voice barely audible over the murmur of conversation. "Thinks you might be the man for a little job we've got lined up."

Ryszard raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. He finished his drink, slid off the stool, and made his way to the corner table.

The figure looked up as he approached, revealing a woman with piercing blue eyes and jet-black hair. "Ryszard Ming," she said, her voice low and husky. "I've heard a lot about you."

Ryszard smiled wryly, taking a seat across from her. "And I've heard nothing about you, I presume?"

The woman chuckled, a small smile playing on her lips. "Not yet, anyway." She leaned forward, her eyes locking onto his. "Let's just say we have mutual interests."

Ryszard's instincts told him to be cautious, but there was something about this woman that drew him in. He knew he should keep his guard up, but for the first time in years, he felt a spark of excitement.

"Tell me more," he said, his voice low and even, as he leaned forward to hear her pitch.
