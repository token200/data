Ryszard Rothbauer stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the cold spring air enveloping him like a damp shroud. He had come to this forgotten corner of Poland, a place where time seemed to have lost all meaning, in search of something. A piece of himself, perhaps.

As he walked through the deserted streets, Ryszard couldn't help but feel a sense of disconnection. He had left behind the world he knew, with its expectations and obligations, for this isolation. It was a desperate attempt to reclaim his lost innocence, to rediscover the man he once was before life had beaten it out of him.

Ryszard's eyes scanned the dilapidated buildings, the crumbling facades, the once-vibrant colors faded like memories on old photographs. This was where he would spend his days, wandering aimlessly, searching for a reason to be alive. The streets were empty, save for the occasional lost soul who passed by, casting curious glances in Ryszard's direction.

He had come with nothing but a small suitcase and an open mind, driven by whispers of this place's mystical properties. Supposedly, it held healing energies that could mend even the most grievous wounds. Ryszard didn't need proof; he just needed a chance to reboot his system, rewire his thoughts.

As dusk began to set, casting long shadows across the streets, Ryszard spotted a figure standing by the river's edge. An old woman with wispy silver hair and eyes that seemed to hold the weight of centuries watched him from afar, her expression an unreadable mix of curiosity and wariness.

Without thinking, Ryszard approached her, drawn to the mysterious aura surrounding this stranger. The air was heavy with unspoken questions as they stood facing each other on opposite banks of a frozen riverbed.

"You're searching for something," she said in a voice that rustled like dry leaves, her eyes piercing through his very soul. "I can feel it."

Ryszard didn't need to say anything; the silence spoke louder than words ever could. In that moment, he knew he had found what he was looking for â€“ not healing energies or lost innocence, but understanding.

The old woman nodded once, a hint of a smile on her lips. "Come with me," she said.
