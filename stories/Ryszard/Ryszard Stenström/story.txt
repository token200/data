Ryszard Stenström trudged through the snow-covered streets of Helsinki, his eyes fixed on the small café in front of him. He had been searching for this place for weeks, ever since he received a cryptic message from an old acquaintance hinting that it might be the only lead he had left to uncover the truth about his father's disappearance.

As he pushed open the door, a warm glow enveloped him, and the scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air. Ryszard Stenström took a seat at the bar and ordered a black coffee, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of recognition.

The bartender, an elderly woman with a kind smile, greeted him warmly and asked how she could help. "I'm looking for information," Ryszard replied, his voice low and even. "My father was a... businessman. I think he might have been involved in something big."

The bartender's expression changed from curiosity to caution, but she leaned in closer. "You mean Ryker Stenström? I think we might know some things about him."

Ryszard's heart skipped a beat as he nodded eagerly. The bartender handed him a small notebook with a single entry: a phone number and the words "Meet me at the old warehouse at midnight." Ryszard's mind was racing – this had to be it, the break he had been waiting for.

As he thanked the bartender and left the café, Ryszard couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He quickened his pace, his eyes darting back and forth across the street, searching for any sign of danger.

Finally, he reached the old warehouse on the outskirts of town, its crumbling walls looming like a specter in the moonlight. With a deep breath, Ryszard Stenström pushed open the door and stepped inside, ready to face whatever lay ahead.

The darkness swallowed him whole, but he was determined to uncover the truth about his father's disappearance, no matter what secrets lay hidden within those walls.
