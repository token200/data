Ryszard Korhonen sat alone in his small, cluttered apartment, staring at the photograph on his mantle. It was a picture of him and his wife, Ewa, taken on their honeymoon to the Amalfi Coast ten years ago. She was smiling, her eyes sparkling with happiness, while he looked stern, as always.

Ewa had been his partner in every sense of the word. They met while studying abroad, bonding over their shared love of philosophy and science fiction. As they delved deeper into their studies, so did their feelings for each other grow stronger. After completing their degrees, Ryszard landed a job at a prestigious research institute, while Ewa pursued a career in environmental conservation.

Their lives were filled with academic pursuits, traveling, and exploring new ideas. They shared everything with each other - thoughts, dreams, fears, and desires. But as the years went by, Ryszard began to feel suffocated by his responsibilities. The weight of expectations from his colleagues, mentors, and even Ewa, grew heavier on him.

One day, without warning, Ewa announced that she had found a new passion - painting. She wanted to leave her job at the institute and focus on her art full-time. Ryszard was torn between supporting his wife's dreams and keeping their financial stability intact. He made the difficult decision to let go of his own aspirations and stay in a high-pressure research environment.

Ewa, sensing Ryszard's unease, sat down with him one evening and revealed a shocking truth - she had been secretly working on her art all along, using the research institute as cover for her late-night sessions. She showed him the sketchbook, filled with vibrant colors and bold strokes, depicting scenes of nature, wildlife, and abstract shapes.

Tears welled up in Ryszard's eyes as he gazed at the pages, realizing how much his wife had been hiding from him. Ewa's smile faltered for a moment, but then she wrapped her arms around him, holding him close. "I was always here with you," she whispered.
