I couldn't find any information on the character Ryszard Põld. It's possible that they are not a well-known or public figure, or maybe they don't exist in the first place.

However, if you would like, I can generate a story about a fictional character with the name Ryszard Põld. Here it is:

Ryszard Põld was a brilliant and eccentric scientist who lived in a small village on the outskirts of Tallinn, Estonia. He spent most of his days locked away in his laboratory, tinkering with gadgets and machinery that few people could understand.

Despite his reclusive nature, Ryszard was a kind and gentle soul, loved by all who knew him. His colleagues at the university would often joke about his wild hair, which stuck out in every direction like a bird's nest, but they couldn't deny his brilliant mind.

One day, Ryszard Põld received an unexpected visit from the President of Estonia herself. She had heard rumors of his latest invention - a machine that could turn thoughts into reality - and she was determined to see it for herself.

Ryszard was nervous but proud as he showed her his creation. The President was amazed by its complexity and beauty, and she promised to support Ryszard's research financially.

As the days passed, Ryszard Põld worked tirelessly to perfect his machine. He spent long hours in his laboratory, fine-tuning every detail and testing every possibility. And finally, after months of hard work, he succeeded in turning one of his own thoughts into reality - a beautiful, shimmering crystal that seemed to glow with an inner light.

The President returned to visit Ryszard again, this time with a delegation of scientists from around the world. They were all amazed by his invention and eager to learn more about it. And Ryszard Põld, surrounded by his peers and admirers, felt like he was on top of the world.
