Ryszard Corbero stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a former spy and current private investigator, he had seen his fair share of shady characters, but there was something about this place that didn't feel right.

He made his way to the bar, ordering a whiskey as he surveyed the patrons. The air was thick with tension, and Ryszard's instincts were screaming at him to leave. But something about the mysterious woman sitting in the corner caught his attention - her piercing green eyes seemed to bore into his very soul.

As he approached, she beckoned him over with a slender finger. "Mind if I join you?" she asked, her voice husky and confident.

Ryszard shook his head, taking a seat beside her. "Not at all," he replied, his Polish accent neutral.

The woman's gaze roamed over him before returning to his face. "I'm Elara Vex," she said, extending a hand.

"Ryszard Corbero," he replied, shaking it firmly. Their hands lingered for a fraction of a second longer than necessary, sending a spark through Ryszard's veins.

As they sipped their drinks in silence, Ryszard couldn't shake the feeling that Elara was hiding something. He asked her about her line of work - what kind of secrets she kept behind those enigmatic eyes? She smiled, the corners of her mouth twitching up, and leaned in close.

"I do freelance security consulting," she whispered, her breath tickling his ear. "And sometimes...I take on more unusual projects."

Ryszard's ears pricked up at this. "Unusual?" he repeated, curiosity piqued.

Elara leaned back in her chair, a sly smile spreading across her face. "Let's just say I have a talent for getting out of tight spots. And sometimes...I need someone with your particular set of skills to help me wriggle free."

Ryszard raised an eyebrow - the mention of his past as a spy sent a shiver down his spine. He knew he should be wary, but something about Elara Vex drew him in like a moth to flame.
