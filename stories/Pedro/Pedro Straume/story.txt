Pedro Straume walked alone through the deserted streets, his eyes fixed on the fog that clung to the pavement like a damp shroud. A former detective with the Oslo police department, he had seen it all - the worst of humanity's depravity and the best of its resilience. But after the tragic loss of his partner in the line of duty, Straume had hung up his badge and abandoned the city that had once been his home.

Years later, Straume found himself back in Oslo, drawn by a mysterious phone call from an unknown number. The voice on the other end was low and gravelly, speaking only two words: "Come back."

At first, Straume thought it was a prank, but something about the tone stayed with him. He couldn't shake the feeling that this was more than just a joke. The voice had known his partner, Kjetil - they had been partners on countless cases, and Straume still felt a pang of guilt for not being able to protect him.

Straume arrived at the agreed meeting spot - an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town - his heart racing with anticipation. The fog swirled around him like a living thing, and he hesitated for a moment before stepping inside.

That was when he saw her - a woman with piercing green eyes and skin as pale as the mist that clung to the city's streets. She introduced herself only as "The Collector," and revealed that she had evidence of Kjetil's murder. Straume listened, numb, as The Collector outlined a web of corruption that reached to the highest echelons of the police department.

Straume's eyes narrowed - he knew this was more than just a simple case. He saw it now for what it was: a twisted revenge plot, orchestrated by someone with connections far beyond his wildest imagination. And at its center, The Collector.

As Straume turned to leave, The Collector spoke once more. "You've come back for Kjetil," she said, her voice dripping with an unsettling intensity. "But are you prepared for what comes next?"

Straume hesitated - he knew the truth now. This case was his ticket into a world of darkness and corruption that went far beyond his own troubled past. With a sense of foreboding that settled in the pit of his stomach, he nodded once.
