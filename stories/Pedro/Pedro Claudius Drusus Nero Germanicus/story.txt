It was a sweltering summer day in Rome, and Pedro Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus, known to his friends as Dru, was lounging on the sun-drenched couch in his opulent villa. The scent of fresh citrus wafted through the air as he lazily tossed a grapefruit peel aside, watching it roll down the marble floor.

As he relaxed, Dru's thoughts drifted back to his life before Rome – the wild woods and untamed lands of Germania, where he had grown up among the fierce warriors of his people. The memories still lingered in his mind like an open wound, but he had long since learned to channel them into a fiery passion for justice.

A soft knock at the door broke Dru's reverie. "Enter," he called out, and his loyal attendant, Marcus, stepped inside with a small, discreet package.

"What is it?" Dru asked, intrigued.

"A message from the Emperor himself, master," Marcus replied, bowing low. "It seems that your... extracurricular activities in Germania have not gone unnoticed."

Dru's eyes narrowed as he accepted the package, his mind racing with possibilities. He had indeed led raids against rival tribes and subjugated their territories under Roman rule – actions that had earned him both admiration and scorn from different quarters.

With a quiet smile, Dru tore open the parchment to reveal a hand-written note from Claudius himself. The Emperor praised Dru's bravery and cunning, but also cautioned him against letting his pride get the better of him.

As Marcus took his leave, Dru unfolded the paper once more, reading the words aloud: "Veni, Vidi, Victoria" – I came, I saw, I conquered.

He chuckled to himself, feeling a thrill of excitement course through his veins. It seemed that even Claudius knew when not to poke the bear.

With a mischievous glint in his eye, Dru set about responding to the Emperor's letter, hinting at just how much more there was to conquer – and who would be next on the Roman Empire's conquest list...
