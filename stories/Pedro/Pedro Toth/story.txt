Pedro Toth was known for his sharp wit and even sharper tongue. A native of Budapest, Hungary, he had made a name for himself as a ruthless businessman with a heart of stone. Few dared to cross him, and those who did often found themselves on the receiving end of a scathing verbal assault.

Despite his tough exterior, Pedro had a soft spot for his niece, Sophie. She was the only family member he allowed himself to be sentimental about, and he would go to great lengths to protect her from harm. Sophie's mother had passed away when she was just a baby, leaving her in Pedro's care.

One fateful evening, as Pedro sat at his desk sipping a glass of fine scotch, the door burst open and his business partner, Viktor, strode in. "Pedro, we've got a problem," Viktor announced, his voice laced with panic. "Our largest client has threatened to pull out unless we meet their demands."

Pedro's expression didn't change, but his mind was racing. He knew that losing this client would be disastrous for his business. After a few moments of contemplation, he stood up and strode over to the phone. "Get me the CEO on the line," he barked at Viktor.

As Pedro waited for the call to connect, he thought back to Sophie's last visit. She had been so full of life and laughter, and it was moments like those that made him realize there was more to life than just making money. He took a deep breath, steadying himself before answering the phone.

"Hello?" The voice on the other end was familiar but firm. Pedro listened intently as the conversation unfolded, his expression growing darker by the minute. When he finally hung up the phone, Viktor looked at him in awe. "You handled that like a pro, Pedro Toth," he whispered.

Pedro smiled to himself, feeling a sense of satisfaction wash over him. He had protected his business and his family's reputation once again. And as he turned back to his desk, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of pride in being the rock for those who needed him most â€“ Sophie, Viktor, and even Viktor himself.
