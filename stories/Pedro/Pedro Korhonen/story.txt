Pedro Korhonen was a man with a passion for the unknown. As a renowned archaeologist, he had spent his entire career uncovering the secrets of the past. With his wild grey hair and bushy eyebrows, Pedro Korhonen looked like a man who had seen it all.

But despite his rugged appearance, Pedro Korhonen had a soft spot for lost civilizations. He was particularly fascinated by the mythology of ancient cultures, spending countless hours pouring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in search of hidden knowledge.

One day, while excavating a recently discovered site in Egypt, Pedro Korhonen stumbled upon an ancient text that caught his eye.
