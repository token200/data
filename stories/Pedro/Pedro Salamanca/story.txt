His brother, who had long been his partner in business, was exposed as a key player in the company's misdeeds. The fallout was devastating for Pedro, and his carefully constructed facade began to crumble.

As the dust settled, Pedro Salamanca faced a choice: come clean and risk everything or continue down the path of silence and complicity? In the end, it was too late â€“ the truth had already been revealed, and Pedro's reputation was left in tatters. The once-mighty Wolf in White Sheep's Clothing had finally been exposed, his empire crumbling to dust.
