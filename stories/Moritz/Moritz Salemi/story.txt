Moritz Salemi stepped out of his sleek, black sedan and onto the sun-drenched streets of Milan. As a renowned art consultant, he had seen it all – from the avant-garde masterpieces that sold for millions to the priceless relics hidden away in private collections.

With his tailored suit and slicked-back hair, Moritz cut an imposing figure among the fashionable crowds. He carried himself with confidence, his piercing green eyes scanning the room as if searching for something – or someone.

Tonight was a night to remember, as he had been invited to a private viewing of the enigmatic artist, Alessandro De Luca's latest work. Rumors swirled that De Luca's masterpiece, "The Memory Eater," would fetch a record-breaking price at auction.

As Moritz entered the luxurious penthouse apartment, a wave of anticipation washed over him. The room was abuzz with some of Milan's most influential art collectors and dealers, all gathered to witness De Luca's latest creation.

Moritz made his way through the crowd, shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries with familiar faces. He spotted none other than the enigmatic collector, Marcello Bianchi, who had a reputation for buying only the rarest of pieces.

As Moritz approached the central display, he felt an inexplicable shiver run down his spine. Before him lay "The Memory Eater," a hauntingly beautiful sculpture that seemed to defy explanation. De Luca's work was always provocative, but this piece took it to a new level – it was as if the very fabric of memory itself had been woven into the metal and glass.

Marcello stepped forward, his eyes locked intently on the artwork. "This is it," he whispered, his voice barely audible over the murmur of the crowd. "This is what we've all been searching for."

As Moritz watched Marcello's eyes gleam with excitement, he felt a thrill run through him. He knew that this piece would shatter all records and redefine the boundaries of modern art. And he was ready to be the one to break them – for himself, if not for anyone else.

With "The Memory Eater" in hand, Moritz set out to forge his own legacy as a dealer and art historian. He knew that this piece would change everything – his career, his reputation, and perhaps even the course of art history itself.
