Moritz Varga stepped out of his office and onto the misty streets of Berlin, his eyes scanning the crowded sidewalk. As the founder and CEO of NovaTech, he was accustomed to being in control, but tonight he felt restless.

It had been six months since NovaTech had unveiled its revolutionary AI-powered technology, dubbed "Echo". The response had been overwhelming, with investors and clients clamoring for a piece of the action. But Moritz knew that beneath the surface, something was off.

He spotted his assistant, Anna, waiting by the curb, her eyes fixed on him. "Moritz, you have a meeting with the board in 30 minutes," she said, as he approached.

"Thanks, Anna." He took the briefcase from her hands and slung it over his shoulder. As they walked towards the office building, Moritz couldn't shake off the feeling that he was losing control of Echo.

The boardroom was a sea of faces, each one more suited to corporate jargon than cutting-edge tech. But Moritz was undeterred, outlining the benefits of the AI system in meticulous detail. He could see the skepticism etched on their faces, but he remained confident.

As the meeting drew to a close, Moritz made his request: a vote of confidence to invest more funds into Echo's development. The room fell silent, before the CEO spoke up. "Moritz, we need to discuss this further... outside of the boardroom."

Moritz knew where this was going. He followed the CEO to a private room deep within the office building, his gut twisting with unease.

"What do you know about Echo?" he asked gruffly, as the CEO pulled out a folder from beneath the table.

"It's not just AI-powered tech, Moritz," the CEO said, her voice dripping with malice. "It's a tool for control."

Moritz's eyes widened as he realized the true intentions behind NovaTech's latest innovation. Echo was not meant to augment human potential â€“ it was designed to manipulate it.

He knew then that he had made a grave mistake in letting Echo unfold without proper oversight. The consequences of his ambition were beginning to sink in, like cold water into his chest.

As the meeting concluded and Moritz returned to his office, he felt a sense of foreboding settle over him. He had unleashed a power he couldn't control, and now, it was up to him to tame it before it was too late.
