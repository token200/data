Moritz Bocelli was not actually born in Tuscany. His mother, Cecilia Barrozo, is Brazilian and his father, Mauro Bocelli, is Italian. However the surname 'Bocelli' does have a strong Tuscan background.

The family moved to Parma when Moritz was five years old, because of his father's career as an opera singer with La Scala in Milan
