Moritz Leroy stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station. As he waited for his connection to arrive, he pulled out his phone and sent a quick text to his best friend, Sophie. They had planned to meet up with their old colleagues from college that evening, and Moritz was running a bit behind schedule.

As he checked the time, a figure emerged from the crowd of people rushing to catch their trains. It was Marcel, their mutual friend who had always been a bit of a wild card. "Hey, Moritz! I see you're still running late," Marcel said with a grin, falling into step beside him.

Moritz chuckled and shook his head. "I told you, Sophie is keeping me busy tonight. We're going to need some strong drinks to catch up." He glanced around the station, taking in the familiar sights of old friends and colleagues. Moritz had always loved these reunions – it was like no time had passed at all.

The connection arrived, and Moritz collected his luggage before following Marcel onto the next platform. As they waited for their train to arrive, they chatted about everything from their latest projects to their personal lives. Moritz couldn't help but feel grateful for friends who knew him so well – people like Marcel who could see right through him.

When the train finally pulled in, Moritz and Marcel claimed a seat by the window and began to catch up on lost time. As they talked, Moritz's mind wandered back to his plans for the future. He had big ambitions, both personal and professional, and he knew that having friends like Marcel around would be crucial in helping him achieve them.

The train rumbled on, carrying Moritz Leroy and his friends into a night of laughter and memories. As they settled in for the ride, Moritz smiled to himself – tonight was shaping up to be just what he needed: a dose of fun, friendship, and maybe even a few new ideas to get him moving forward.
