Moritz Jasinska's latest find was nothing short of remarkable – a beautifully crafted, 18th-century clockwork automaton that seemed to defy explanation.

As he carefully lifted the automaton from its velvet cushion, Moritz Jasinska couldn't help but feel a thrill of excitement.

With some deliberation, Moritz Jasinska agreed to sell the automaton to Dr. Taylor.
