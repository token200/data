Moritz Mendes was known for his unparalleled skill in the art of photography. Born into a family of artists, he had always been drawn to the world behind the lens.

One such project took him to the remote villages of rural Africa, where he captured stunning portraits of people who had never been photographed before.

As he walked through the dusty streets, his camera slung over his shoulder, Moritz Mendes felt like he had finally found his calling.

The young man wrote about how Moritz Mendes's photographs had encouraged him to pursue his own dreams, and he thanked him for being such a role model.

And as he looked out at the crowd gathered around his photographs, he smiled, knowing that he had truly found his place in the world.
