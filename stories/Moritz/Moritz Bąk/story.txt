As he surveyed the area, Bąk noticed a faint scent of cigarette smoke lingering in the air. He followed the smell to a nearby trash can, where he found a crushed cigarette pack bearing an unfamiliar brand. His curiosity piqued, Bąk called in a forensic expert to analyze the evidence.

Meanwhile, Bąk's team worked tirelessly to gather witness statements and piece together the events leading up to the murder.
