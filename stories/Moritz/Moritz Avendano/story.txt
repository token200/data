Moritz Avendano stepped out of the rain and into the small caf√©, shaking the water from his coat. He was a man of few words, but as he waited for his coffee to arrive, he couldn't help but think about the events that had led him here.

A former private investigator turned private consultant, Moritz's services were in high demand by those who needed discretion and expertise. His reputation for being one of the best in the business had spread far and wide, and people came from all over to seek his advice.

As he waited, Moritz's mind wandered back to his childhood. Born to a wealthy family, Moritz had always been drawn to the darker side of life. He had studied criminology and law enforcement, determined to use his skills for good. But after years of working as a cop, he found that the system was broken, and he couldn't make a difference.

That's when he made the switch to private consulting. It gave him the freedom to take on cases that truly mattered to him, rather than just following procedure. Moritz had built a reputation for being ruthless in his pursuit of justice, but fair.

Just then, the barista handed him a steaming cup of coffee, and Moritz took a sip, feeling the warmth spread through his body. He was about to leave when a woman sat down across from him, her eyes scanning the room before locking onto his.

"Moritz Avendano," she said, her voice low and husky. "I've heard a lot about you."

Moritz raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "And what can I do for you?"

The woman smiled, a small, enigmatic smile. "I have a case that requires your expertise. One that could change everything."

Moritz's interest was piqued. He leaned forward, his eyes locked onto hers, ready to hear her story and see if he was the right man for the job.
