His full name, Moritz Nachtnebel, seemed to whisper an air of foreboding, as if the very darkness itself had taken human form.

As he walked through the crowded streets of Berlin, the city's noise and chaos seemed to fade into the background, replaced by the soft hum of his thoughts. His eyes scanned the crowd with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion, ever vigilant for signs of deception or hidden motives.
