Alessandro Li stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the crowded station. He had been away for months, and the familiar scent of damp earth and saltwater was like a warm hug on a chilly day. His return to Sant'Erasmo, the small fishing village where he grew up, was met with curiosity and whispered conversations.

As he made his way through the throng of people, Alessandro's gaze lingered on each face, searching for a glimpse of recognition. He had left this place four years ago, chasing a dream that seemed more like an illusion in the end. Now, at twenty-five, he was back, with a worn suitcase and a hint of doubt etched on his forehead.

Alessandro's thoughts drifted to his family, who had always been his rock. His mother, Maria, had passed away two years ago, but her memory lingered like a gentle breeze on a summer day. He remembered the way she used to smile at him, the way her eyes sparkled when he told her about his dreams. His father, Giovanni, was still fishing, just as he always had.

As he walked through the village, Alessandro noticed the changes that time had brought. New buildings stood where old ones had once stood, and the once-quaint streets were now lined with tourists' shops and restaurants. The air was thick with the smell of fresh seafood and tourists' perfume. He felt a pang of sadness for the loss of his childhood home.

But amidst the chaos, Alessandro spotted a small stall tucked away in a corner of the station. A faded sign read "Casa Li". His heart skipped a beat as he pushed open the door, revealing a cozy room filled with photographs and mementos from his past. A vase on the table held a single rose, its petals softly glowing in the fading light.

Alessandro sat down beside it, running his fingers over the creased pages of an old book. It was his mother's favorite novel, one she had read to him countless times as a child. Tears pricked at the corners of his eyes as he remembered those laughter-filled afternoons, feeling safe in her loving arms.

The door creaked open behind him, and Alessandro turned to find his father standing in the doorway, a small smile playing on his lips. "Welcome home, Alessandro," Giovanni said, his voice low and gentle. For the first time since leaving, Alessandro felt like he was home, surrounded by memories, love, and a place that would always be his.
