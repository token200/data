One rainy evening, a young woman named Sophia walked into Alessandro Kazuo's office, her eyes brimming with tears. She had received a mysterious letter threatening to expose a deep-seated family secret unless she complied with an outrageous demand. Desperate for help, she had heard whispers of the enigmatic detective who could solve even the most baffling mysteries.
