Alessandro Ozolina stood at the edge of the Grand Canal, his eyes fixed on the golden light of the setting sun casting ripples across the water. As a renowned Venetian architect, he had spent years studying the intricate patterns of the city's ancient canals and bridges. But tonight, Alessandro Ozolina felt restless, as if there was still something missing from his life.

As he gazed out at the tranquil scene before him, a faint memory stirred in his mind - the smell of freshly baked biscotti wafting through the narrow streets of his childhood neighborhood. His mother, Giovanni's wife, would often leave a plate of the sweet treats on the windowsill for Alessandro Ozolina to find upon waking.

He had long since abandoned his hometown in search of fame and recognition as an architect, but now he couldn't shake the feeling that he was meant to be back here, among the mist-shrouded piazzas and winding canals. As the stars began to twinkle overhead, Alessandro Ozolina took a deep breath and turned away from the water's edge.

Without a destination in mind, he set off on foot, wandering through the narrow alleys of Venice with a sense of purpose he hadn't felt in years. The city seemed alive beneath his feet, as if it was urging him to rediscover its secrets.

Eventually, Alessandro Ozolina found himself at the doorstep of a small, unassuming workshop tucked away between two grandiose churches. A faint smell of wood shavings and paint greeted him as he pushed open the door, revealing an artist's studio cluttered with half-finished projects and scraps of paper covered in sketches.

For a moment, Alessandro Ozolina simply stood there, watching the master artisan at work, his hands moving deftly over the wood. It was then that he knew - this was where he belonged. Not as a famous architect, but as someone who spent their days bringing joy and beauty to the world, one wooden bridge or ornate ceiling at a time.
