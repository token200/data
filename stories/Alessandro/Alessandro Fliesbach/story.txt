Alessandro Fliesbach was a man shrouded in mystery, with an aura of quiet confidence that commanded attention without ever seeking it. As a renowned expert in ancient mythology and archaeology, he had spent years studying the lost civilizations of Greece and Egypt, unearthing secrets that lay hidden for centuries.

One day, while excavating a recently discovered site in the Greek countryside, Alessandro Fliesbach stumbled upon an ancient text that spoke of a long-lost city deep within the heart of Africa.
