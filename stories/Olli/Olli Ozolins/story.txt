Olli Ozolins stepped off the train and onto the bustling platform, her bright blue eyes scanning the crowded station for any sign of her friend, Lena. She had agreed to meet Lena here, and was running a bit behind schedule, but she knew that would be an understatement.

As she made her way through the throng of commuters, Olli Ozolins couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement wash over her. She loved days like this - days when the sun shone bright and the world felt full of possibility. She quickened her pace, her long blonde hair bouncing behind her like a golden streamer.

Just as she was starting to worry that Lena had stood her up, Olli Ozolins spotted her friend across the station, sipping on a coffee and scrolling through her phone with an air of quiet confidence. Olli Ozolins grinned and made her way over, weaving through the crowd with ease.

"Lena, you're running late!" she teased, plopping down beside her friend in the crowded station.

Lena looked up from her phone, a sheepish grin spreading across her face. "Sorry about that, Ozolins," she said, using Olli's full name for the first time all day. "I was up late studying for my exams and I totally lost track of time."

Olli Ozolins chuckled and nudged her friend playfully. "You're such a worrier, Lena," she teased. "But I'm glad you made it. We have a long day ahead of us, after all."

The two friends spent the next hour catching up on each other's lives, discussing everything from school gossip to their favorite TV shows. As they walked through the station, Olli Ozolins couldn't help but feel grateful for her friendship with Lena - she knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, she could always count on her friend to be there for her.

As they made their way out of the station and into the bright sunlight, Olli Ozolins felt a sense of contentment wash over her. She was exactly where she was meant to be, surrounded by friends and sunshine and all the possibilities that life had to offer.
