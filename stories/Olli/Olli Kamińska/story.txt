Olli Kamińska stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar streets of Warsaw. The city was alive with activity, but she felt out of place, like an outsider looking in. She had returned to her hometown after years abroad, seeking solace from the chaos that had driven her away.

As a child, Olli had known this city like the back of her hand. Her parents owned a small bakery on ulicy Chełmska, where she would help out as soon as she was old enough. But life had taken her elsewhere - to school in Kraków, then university in London, and finally, a job as an art teacher in Berlin.

Now, with the loss of her mother and the quiet desperation that had taken up residence inside her, Olli felt like a ghost drifting back through the streets she once knew. Her eyes lingered on the bakery, now empty and still, a reminder of all she'd left behind.

She walked to her family's old apartment, the one above the bakery where she grew up sleeping under the same starry sky as her parents. The door creaked in protest as she opened it, revealing a space that had changed little over the years. Her mother's favorite armchair was still there, with its worn velvet cushions and patchwork quilt.

Olli wandered through the rooms, feeling like a stranger in her own home. She rummaged through old trunks and boxes, searching for some clue as to what she'd forgotten or lost along the way. In one corner, an old painting by a local artist caught her eye - a depiction of Warsaw's rooftops at dusk, with the Vistula River snaking its way through the city.

Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as Olli gazed upon the familiar landscape. This was where she belonged, surrounded by the memories and stories that had shaped her into who she was today. She closed her eyes, letting the painting wash over her like a warm bath, and for a moment, she felt like herself again - whole, whole, and home.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the city in a golden glow, Olli opened her eyes to find that her mother's old desk was now hers. It creaked under the weight of new notebooks, papers, and pencils, inviting her to write her own story - one of love, loss, and belonging.
