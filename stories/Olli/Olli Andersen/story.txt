Olli Andersen stood at the edge of the frozen lake, his skis slung over his shoulder like a worn leather satchel. The air was crisp and cold, with a hint of wood smoke carried on the wind from the small cabin nestled in the trees nearby. He took a deep breath, feeling the frosty air fill his lungs, and began to edge into stride.

Olli had always loved this place. Growing up in a small village nestled at the foot of the mountains, he'd spent countless winters exploring the frozen wilderness. As a young man, he'd tried his hand at skiing, but it was only when he stumbled upon an old, worn-out pair of cross-country skis hidden away in his grandfather's attic that he truly found his calling.

The skis had belonged to Olli's great-grandfather, a legendary skier who'd competed in the World Championships back in the 1920s. There was something about those old, handmade skis that spoke to Olli on a deep level – maybe it was the way they fit perfectly in his hands, or the way the cold wood seemed to come alive under his feet.

As he glided across the lake's surface, Olli felt at one with the snow-covered trees and the frozen water. He was lost in thought, memories of past winters unfolding like a film reel in his mind. He recalled the time he'd spent a week skiing solo through the French Alps, the way the sunlight had danced on the peaks as he crested each ridge.

The sound of crunching snow beneath his skis snapped him back to reality. Olli turned to see a figure emerging from the trees – an old man with a kind face and eyes that twinkled like the stars on a clear night.

"Oskar!" Olli called out, relief washing over him. "I thought you'd never find me."

The old man chuckled and ambled closer, his breath misting in the cold air. "I've been following your tracks for hours," he said, shaking his head. "You're still as wild as ever, Olli."

Olli grinned, feeling a sense of belonging wash over him. "Just trying to keep the tradition alive," he said, his eyes crinkling at the corners.

Together, they skied across the frozen lake, their footsteps quiet on the snow-covered surface. As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the landscape, Olli knew that this was where he belonged – in the mountains, with the old man by his side.

Eventually, they reached the cabin, where a steaming pot of coffee and a plate of warm, flaky pastries waited for them. As they sat down to eat, Olli turned to Oskar and said, "You know, I've been thinking about taking up the old way again – making my own skis from scratch."

Oskar's eyes lit up with excitement. "Ah, you're talking about the art of woodworking!" he exclaimed.

Olli nodded, a sense of purpose building within him. "Yes – and maybe one day I'll pass it on to my own children."

The old man smiled, his eyes misty with nostalgia. "I'm sure they will," he said, patting Olli's hand. "You've got the heart of a true skier in you, Olli."
