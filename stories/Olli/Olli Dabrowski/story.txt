His clients often found themselves drawn to him like moths to a flame, sensing that Olli, whose full name was Ołdrzyk "Olli" Dabrowski, possessed an uncanny ability to piece together seemingly unrelated clues.

One drizzly evening, as Olli sat at his desk sipping coffee and staring out the rain-soaked window, his phone rang. It was a frantic call from the mayor's office, who begged Olli to investigate a string of mysterious burglaries in the city's affluent Old Town neighborhood.
