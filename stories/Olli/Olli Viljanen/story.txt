Olli Viljanen was known for his peculiar profession - he was a professional line-stander. With a keen eye for opportunity and an uncanny ability to blend into the background, Olli had made a living out of waiting in line for people who didn't want to waste their time.

It all started when Olli's wife, Lea, got tickets to a sold-out concert by his favorite band. However, she was unable to attend due to work commitments. Instead of leaving the tickets idle, Olli decided to take matters into his own hands and offer his services as a line-stander.

Word spread quickly about Olli Viljanen's exceptional skills in waiting patiently for hours on end. Before long, he had a steady stream of clients seeking his expertise. From waiting in lines for new iPhones to securing coveted spots at trendy restaurants, Olli was always happy to help.

One sunny Saturday morning, Olli found himself standing outside the doors of a popular coffee shop. He was there to wait for his client, Emma, who desperately wanted to get her hands on the latest limited-edition coffee beans. As Olli sipped his own coffee and flipped through his book, he couldn't help but think about how much he loved his job.

With years of experience under his belt, Olli had honed his skills to perfection. He knew exactly when to arrive early, how to navigate the crowd with ease, and most importantly, how to maintain a patient demeanor even in the face of chaos.

As Emma emerged from the coffee shop with her coveted beans in hand, she turned to Olli and thanked him profusely for his services. "You're a lifesaver!" she exclaimed, handing over a generous tip. With that, Olli Viljanen pocketed the cash and continued on his way, ready for the next adventure.

As he walked away from the coffee shop, Olli couldn't help but smile to himself. Being Olli Viljanen, line-stander extraordinaire, was truly the perfect job for him.
