Olli Angert trudged through the snow-covered streets, his boots crunching against the frosty pavement. He had just finished a grueling shift at his part-time job at the local café and was looking forward to a quiet evening at home. As he walked, the lights of his small apartment building flickered to life before him.

As Olli entered his cozy abode, a warm smile spread across his face. His cat, Loki, a sleek black feline with piercing green eyes, greeted him from the windowsill. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, enticing Olli's senses. He made himself a steaming cup and settled into his favorite armchair.

Just as he was about to settle in for the night, the doorbell rang. Olli raised an eyebrow, wondering who could be visiting at this ungodly hour. He hesitated for a moment before getting up to answer it. As he opened the door, a gust of cold air swept in, and a tall figure clad in snow-covered parka stood before him.

"Loki?" Olli's eyes widened as he took in the stranger's features – angular cheekbones, piercing blue eyes, and raven-black hair that fell across his forehead. "You're Loki's sister!"

The woman smiled warmly. "I'm Lotta Angert. I think we should catch up."

Olli stepped aside, allowing Lotta to enter. The room was suddenly filled with an air of familiarity as the siblings sat down in matching armchairs. They sipped their coffee and laughed together, discussing everything from Loki's latest escapades to Olli's job at the café.

As they talked, Olli discovered that Lotta had moved back to Helsinki after years abroad, seeking solace in the city she once called home. Her travels had taken her to some of the world's most remote corners, where she'd honed her photography skills and documented the stories of those living on the fringes.

As the night wore on, Olli found himself captivated by Lotta's tales of adventure and resilience. He realized that sometimes, all it takes is a friend from your past to shake things up and rekindle a sense of purpose.

As Lotta prepared to leave, she handed Olli an envelope with her address scribbled on the front. "We should meet again soon," she said, smiling mischievously. "Maybe I'll bring my camera and capture some city views through your window."

With a warm smile, Olli watched as his new sister-in-arms disappeared into the night, carrying with her a piece of the Helsinki snowscape that would forever be etched in his heart.
