Olli Morgan stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar surroundings. It had been years since she'd returned to Ravenswood, a small town nestled in the heart of Scotland. She'd left behind a complicated past, one that still lingered in every corner of her mind.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, the air was thick with the scent of peat smoke and damp earth. Olli breathed it in deeply, feeling a sense of comfort wash over her. This was where her grandmother had grown up, where her mother had built a life that Olli had never known.

Her thoughts turned to her family's old farmhouse on the outskirts of town. The house stood empty now, but its stone walls still told stories of laughter and tears, of love and loss. Olli pushed open the creaky door, stepping inside into a world she thought she'd left behind.

The interior was just as she remembered – worn wooden beams, faded curtains, and a fireplace that crackled with life when the wind picked up. As she wandered through the rooms, memories came flooding back: afternoons spent playing in the garden with her grandmother's stories, long walks on the moors with her mother's hand in hers.

But there were also shadows to navigate – the one that had driven Olli away from Ravenswood all those years ago. A darkness she couldn't shake, a pain that lingered like an open wound. She'd tried to put it behind her, to leave it in the past, but the memories still lingered.

Olli's footsteps led her to the old kitchen, where she'd spent countless hours helping her grandmother with recipes and stories. The wooden table was scarred, its surface bearing the weight of years and laughter. She ran her hand over the scratches, feeling a sense of connection to this place, to these people, that she couldn't quite explain.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the floor, Olli felt the presence behind her. It was as if someone had followed her back from wherever she'd been. She turned to find an old wooden chair sitting in front of the fireplace – the one her grandmother used to sit in every evening.

Olli took a seat, feeling the warmth seep into her bones. She closed her eyes, letting the silence wash over her. For the first time since leaving Ravenswood, she felt like she was home. The weight of her past still lingered, but it wasn't as crushing as before. Olli opened her eyes to find a small piece of paper on the table, scribbled with words from her grandmother's handwriting: "The stories will set you free."
