As a writer, she sought to capture these moments in her work, weaving them into narratives that were both poignant and thought-provoking.

Growing up in a small town, Chiara was surrounded by characters who would later become the foundation of her writing. Her abuela, Sofia, was a pillar of strength and wisdom, who taught Chiara the value of tradition and family. Her best friend, Mateo, was a free spirit who introduced her to the world beyond their little town.
