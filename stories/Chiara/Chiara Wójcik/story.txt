One day, Chiara received a call from a local non-profit organization, asking for her help with a particularly challenging case. A group of factory workers had been exposed to toxic chemicals while working at a nearby manufacturing plant, and the company was refusing to take responsibility for their injuries.

After months of tireless work, Chiara finally had enough evidence to take to court. She presented her case to a packed courtroom, using every trick in the book to convince the judge and jury of the workers' right to compensation. The outcome was far from certain, but one thing was clear: Chiara Wójcik would not rest until justice was served.
