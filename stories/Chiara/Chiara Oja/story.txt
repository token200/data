One night, after a particularly grueling rehearsal session, Chiara Oja found herself lost in thought as she walked home through the quiet streets. She couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing – that there was more to her music than just the technical aspects of performance and production.

Without thinking, Chiara Oja sat down at the piano and began to play.

She knew exactly what "Echo Fade" needed to take their music to the next level – and that spark would be ignited by her own unique voice and vision. With renewed purpose, Chiara Oja returned home, ready to tackle the final stretch before the album's release date. Her fans couldn't wait to hear what she had in store for them.
