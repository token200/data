Elli Yumi stood alone on the edge of the cliff, gazing out at the vast expanse of ocean that stretched before her. The wind whipped through her long, dark hair as she breathed in deeply, feeling the salty air fill her lungs. She closed her eyes and let the rhythm of the waves wash over her.

Elli Yumi was a woman with a troubled past, one that had shaped her into the person she was today. Born to a family of nomads, she had always been drawn to the freedom of the open road, but a tragic event in her youth had forced her to settle down for a time. Since then, she had spent years honing her skills as a healer and traveling from village to village, using her gifts to help those in need.

As she stood on the cliff's edge, Elli Yumi felt a sense of peace wash over her. It was a feeling she hadn't experienced in months, not since her last journey had ended in heartbreak. But there was something about this place that drew her in, something that made her feel like she was finally home.

She took a deep breath and opened her eyes, scanning the horizon for any sign of life. And then, on the distant shore, she saw it: a figure walking towards her, their footsteps steady and purposeful. Elli Yumi's heart skipped a beat as she realized who it was - Kaito, an old friend from her travels, one who had been searching for her for months.

Kaito reached her side, his eyes locked on hers with a warmth that made Elli Yumi's heart swell. "I've found you," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. Elli Yumi smiled, feeling the weight of her worries lift off her shoulders. For the first time in years, she felt like she was exactly where she was meant to be.

Together, they stood on the cliff's edge, watching as the sun dipped below the horizon. And for one moment, all was right with the world. Elli Yumi knew that no matter what lay ahead, she would face it with Kaito by her side.
