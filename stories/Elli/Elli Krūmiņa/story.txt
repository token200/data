One day, as Elli was setting up her equipment on a busy street corner, she noticed a group of people gathered around a small stage. They were watching a local band perform, and Elli couldn't help but feel a pang of envy.

As the weeks went by, Elli Krūmiņa's star continued to rise. She began to play larger venues, and even landed a few paying gigs at some of Riga's most prestigious music halls. And though she still spent many hours on the streets, busking for change, Elli knew that she had finally found her place in the world.

One evening, as Elli was taking a break between sets, she caught sight of herself in a reflective windowpane. She smiled, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over her.
