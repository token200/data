Elli Hansen stood at the edge of the vast, rolling hills, her feet sinking into the soft earth. The wind whipped through her dark hair as she gazed out at the endless expanse of green and gold. It was moments like these that reminded her why she'd left it all behind – the city, the concrete jungle, the artificial trappings of modern life.

As a child, Elli had always felt suffocated by the expectations placed upon her. Her parents, both accomplished in their respective fields, wanted her to follow in their footsteps: science or medicine, perhaps, and become something of a high-achieving professional. But Elli's heart belonged elsewhere – in the wilds, among the trees and wildlife.

She'd spent countless hours exploring the woods behind her family's rural home, collecting leaves and watching animals that would have been considered pests to most people. Her parents had thought it "unbecoming," but Elli saw beauty in the unexpected. And when she was old enough, she'd packed a small bag and set out into the world beyond.

Years of travel and adventure had forged her into the person she was today: resourceful, resilient, and attuned to the rhythms of nature. She'd lost count of how many places she'd been – from the streets of Tokyo to the ancient ruins of Machu Picchu – but each new location left its mark on her soul.

Elli's eyes wandered to a nearby thicket, where a family of rabbits huddled together in the fading light. Her gaze lingered for a moment, drinking in their quiet contentment. This was what she'd been searching for all along – not success or status, but connection with the world around her.

A faint rustling in the underbrush caught her attention. Elli turned to see a small, wounded bird stumble into view, its feathers ruffled and beak twisted at an awkward angle. Without hesitation, she crouched beside it, gently lifting the creature's head from the grass. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming wildflowers as Elli examined her new patient.

It was moments like these that reminded her why she'd made this life – to heal and nurture the creatures of the world, rather than to build a name for herself in society. She tucked the bird into her jacket and took a deep breath, letting the silence wash over her. For now, at least, Elli felt exactly where she belonged.
