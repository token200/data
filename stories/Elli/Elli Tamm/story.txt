Elli Tamm stood at the edge of the frozen lake, her eyes fixed on the icy expanse before her. The air was crisp and cold, and the only sound was the soft crunch of snow beneath her boots as she made her way towards the water's edge.

She had always been drawn to this place, where the wilderness seemed to stretch out endlessly and the sky above felt boundless. As a child, Elli had spent hours exploring these woods with her father, learning about the ancient trees, the hidden streams, and the creatures that lived within the forest's heart.

But it was the lake that held a special significance for her. She remembered the day she had lost her parents in this very spot, the day they had been swept away by the treacherous currents beneath their ice-skating rink. The memory still stung, but Elli knew that coming back to this place was where she found solace.

As she walked, the wind began to pick up, sending wisps of snow swirling around her ankles. She didn't notice at first, too caught up in her thoughts as she made her way closer to the water's edge. But when a gust buffeted her hard, Elli felt a jolt run through her body.

She looked down and saw that her gloves were torn, the fabric ripped from the seams as if something had reached out and pulled them off. A shiver ran down her spine as she frantically fastened new ones around her wrists.

For an instant, Elli forgot to breathe. Something was watching her from the shadows – something with eyes that gleamed like stars in the dark.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the trees. Tall and imposing, their features obscured by a fur-lined parka, they moved towards Elli with deliberate slowness.

"Who are you?" Elli demanded, trying to keep her voice steady.

The stranger slowed as they approached, revealing a face that Elli recognized but couldn't quite place – eyes bright blue, skin pale and weathered, the sharp jawline of someone who'd faced hardship and come out on top. She saw something in those eyes that sparked recognition – this person was connected to her past.

"I'm...I'm here for you," they said softly, their voice like a gentle breeze on a summer's day.

As Elli looked up at them, she felt the past begin to unravel before her, revealing secrets hidden beneath the surface. The unknown woman took another step forward, her eyes locked with Elli's – and in that moment, Elli Tamm knew that nothing would ever be the same again.
