Elli Zarins stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the mist-shrouded streets of Ashwood. The town was never bustling with life, but there was a quiet energy to it that Elli found appealing. As she made her way through the station, Elli's eyes scanned the crowded carriages, searching for a familiar face.

She spotted a figure sitting in the corner, hood up and eyes fixed on the ground. Elli quickened her pace, curiosity getting the better of her. She reached the carriage and dropped onto a stool beside him, waiting for him to glance up.

"Elli Zarins," he said gruffly, eyes squinting through his dark glasses.

Elli smiled wryly. "Just call me Elli."

The man nodded, pulling down his hood to reveal a messy tumble of black hair. "I'm Kael," he said, offering a hesitant smile.

As they waited for their luggage to arrive, the silence between them grew more comfortable. Elli had met Kael through an old acquaintance; she'd been drawn to his brooding intensity, and he seemed to sense it too.

When the luggage appeared, Elli and Kael lugged it out of the station, leaving the chaos behind. The streets were empty, save for the occasional rat scurrying across the cobblestones. They walked in silence, the only sound the crunch of gravel beneath their feet.

Eventually, they arrived at a small caf√© on the outskirts of town. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of baking and the soft hum of conversation. Elli settled into a booth by the window, her eyes drawn to the fog-shrouded hills beyond. Kael joined her, taking a seat across from her.

As they sipped their coffee, Elli asked him what brought him to Ashwood. Kael hesitated, collecting his thoughts before speaking in a low tone.

"I've been searching for something," he said finally. "A way to make things right."

Elli's eyes narrowed, intrigued by the mystery surrounding Kael.
