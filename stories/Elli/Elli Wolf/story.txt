Elli Wolf stood at the edge of the frozen lake, her breath misting in the chill air. She was a loner, a wanderer who had no home and no family to call her own. Yet, she found a sense of peace out here, surrounded by the vast expanse of white.

As she stepped onto the ice, Elli felt the world slow down around her. The trees seemed farther away, their branches etched against the grey sky like skeletal fingers. She walked for hours, her boots crunching on the frosty surface, until she reached a small cabin nestled among the pines.

Elli had been drawn to this place by rumors of an old man who lived here, a wise one with knowledge of the forest and its secrets. She found him sitting by the fire, his eyes glinting in the dim light.

"You're Elli Wolf," he said, without looking up. "I've heard stories about you."

Elli nodded, feeling a shiver run down her spine.

"I know what you are," the old man continued, turning to face her. "You're a wanderer, a ghost of the wild. You roam these forests and mountains because that's where your heart is."

Elli felt a pang in her chest. How did he know?

The old man nodded as if reading her thoughts. "Your parents were both outlaws," he said. "Their love was fierce and wild, but it didn't last. They left you here, alone, with the memories of their passion and the lessons they taught you."

Elli felt a lump form in her throat. She had always known that she was different, that she couldn't quite fit into society.

"But you've learned to survive," the old man said, his eyes twinkling with approval. "You've learned to navigate the wilds like a ghost, invisible and free."

As Elli looked at the old man, she saw something in him that made her feel seen and understood. For the first time in years, she felt a sense of belonging.

Over the next few weeks, Elli returned to visit the old man often, learning about his wisdom and secrets from the forest. She found herself drawn into his world of healing and magic, where the boundaries between human and animal blurred.

As she prepared to leave, Elli knew that she would carry the lessons of the wild with her forever. The old man smiled at her, and for a moment, they were both just two outcasts finding each other in this vast and beautiful world.
