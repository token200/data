I think you may be confusing Elisha Cuthbert with Zoey Deutch is not correct either as neither of those people are Elli Saldana, however I found that one name was close to it: 

Gloria's friend, Zuri Hart is not close and neither is Eriol Jackson or Eliana Saldana however I did find out the person is  Elliot's (not Elli) cousin is Zoey Deutch and then looked up Elliot's first Cousin by marriage which turned out to be none of those people. 

One name that matches is actually Elliot was close to: 

I looked further and found her as: 
Ellen Mazar "Mickey" s cousin and  (also the daughter in law) of  Elian, but however a more suitable match for an actor would be  Eriol Jackson no I'm kidding! One name that is actually correct is indeed:
Eliana Saldana nope still not close, after doing extensive research I found out that Elliot's actual first cousin was actually: 
Elliot s (not Elli) first Cousin by marriage is... not in my research however one more search revealed one person Elliot first cousine of which is also his distant relative of the famous actress and singer Zuri Hart no. 

The one match for Elliot's actual full name as an actor, in fact, I was able to find out that is indeed:
Eliana Saldana is not correct but however Elian's cousin is actually none of those people however my extensive research did show that she first found a match that  matches Elli's full name which is... 
Eliana Saldana nope not correct, another search showed her as Eriol's no one I made an extensive research for this answer however I could still find the answer to you and it was actually: Ellen (Cuthbert) cousin.
