Elli Straume stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of saltwater and diesel fuel filling her lungs. It had been years since she'd last set foot in Ravenswood, the small coastal town where she grew up. As Elli Straume, she'd always felt a sense of restlessness, as if there was something more out there for her than the narrow streets and faded dreams of this sleepy community.

Now, at 25, Elli had left Ravenswood behind to chase her art in the city. But after a painful breakup and a grueling year of struggling to make ends meet, she'd found herself back on the train, bound for home. It wasn't just nostalgia that drew her back – there was something specific she needed to attend to.

Elli made her way through the deserted streets, passing by the old ice cream parlor where she used to work summers as a teenager. The building looked smaller than she remembered, but the faded sign still creaked in the wind, reading "Lindys' Sweet Treats" in peeling letters. She smiled to herself – only one place remained unchanged.

As she turned onto her street, Elli Straume spotted an old photograph on the porch of her family's now-abandoned house. It was a picture from when she was just a girl, standing beside her grandfather's fishing boat, the same one he'd taken her out on countless times. The memories came flooding back – afternoons spent reeling in silverfish, summer storms chasing across the water.

Elli took a deep breath and stepped onto the porch, her feet sinking into the worn boards. For the first time in months, she felt like she was coming home to something more than just dust and decay. As the sun dipped low over Ravenswood, Elli Straume realized that sometimes, no matter how far you stray, your roots run deep.
