Elli Ayumi stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the unfamiliar town spread before her. As the youngest child of a traveling performance troupe, Elli had grown up on the road, never staying in one place for too long. But after a falling out with her family, she'd decided it was time to strike out on her own and make a life in this new town.

Elli Ayumi took a deep breath, shouldering her worn leather satchel and setting off towards the small café where she'd arranged to meet a potential employer. The sign above the door read "Mae's Music Lessons" – Elli had heard it was a small but reputable business, looking for a qualified teacher.

As she pushed open the door, a bell above it rang out, and Elli Ayumi's eyes adjusted to the warm light within. Mae herself sat behind the counter, a kind smile on her face as Elli approached. "You must be Elli Ayumi," she said, standing up to offer a handshake. "Welcome to Mae's Music Lessons. I'm afraid we're a bit understaffed at the moment – our regular teacher has fallen ill."

Elli nodded sympathetically. She'd had plenty of experience with last-minute changes in her own life; it seemed this would be no different. But as she began to discuss rates and qualifications, Elli Ayumi couldn't help but feel a spark of excitement. This could be the perfect opportunity to settle down – if only for a little while.

Mae handed Elli a schedule and a key to the small room above the café, where she'd be teaching her first lesson that afternoon. As Elli made her way back out into the bright sunlight, she felt a sense of possibility settling over her like a shroud. Maybe this was the start of something new – something rooted, if only for a little while, in one place. And as she walked down the street, Elli Ayumi couldn't help but feel a thrill of anticipation: what would this new chapter bring?
