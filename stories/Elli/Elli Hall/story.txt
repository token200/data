Elli Hall sat alone in her small café, sipping on a cup of coffee and staring out at the rain-soaked streets of Portland. It was a typical grey day in the city, but Elli didn't notice. She was lost in thought, replaying the events of the past week in her mind.

As a successful event planner, Elli had always been known for her attention to detail and ability to bring people together. But lately, she had been feeling overwhelmed by the pressure to deliver perfect events. Her latest project, a charity gala, was looming on the horizon and Elli was starting to feel the weight of responsibility.

Just then, the door to the café swung open and Elli's business partner, Rachel, walked in, shaking the rain off her coat. "Hey Elli, I heard you were having a tough day," she said, plopping down in the chair across from Elli.

Elli sighed and rubbed her temples. "I don't know how much more of this I can take, Rach. The pressure is mounting and I just feel like I'm not good enough."

Rachel reached out and put a hand on Elli's arm. "You're an amazing event planner, Elli Hall. You have a gift for bringing people together and making events truly special. Don't forget that."

Elli looked at Rachel, feeling a lump form in her throat. She knew she was lucky to have a partner like Rachel, who believed in her even when she didn't believe in herself.

Just then, the door to the café swung open again and Elli's best friend, Emily, walked in, carrying a large plate of freshly baked cookies. "Hey girls! I brought some treats," she said, setting the plate down on the table.

Elli smiled as she watched Emily expertly juggle three plates of coffee cups while simultaneously chatting with Rachel. It was just another day for her friend and business partner - but Elli couldn't help feeling a little envious.

As they chatted and laughed together, Elli began to feel a weight lift off her shoulders. Maybe, just maybe, she wasn't alone in this after all. With renewed energy and determination, Elli stood up and began planning her next move, ready to take on the challenges ahead with confidence and poise.

"I think it's time I started taking care of myself," Elli said to Rachel as they left the café. "You know what they say - self-care is key."

Rachel nodded in agreement. "Definitely, Elli Hall. You deserve it."
