Elli Olsen stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the crowded station for any sign of her sister. It had been months since they'd last spoken, and Elli was starting to feel a sense of unease wash over her.

As she made her way through the throng of people, Elli's thoughts turned to their complicated past. Growing up, Elli and her sister, Ava, had always been close, sharing secrets and dreams with each other. But as they'd grown older, their paths had begun to diverge, and now Elli found herself wondering if she'd ever see her sister again.

Just as Elli was starting to lose hope, a figure emerged from the crowd, her long blonde hair tied back in a ponytail. It was Ava, and Elli's heart skipped a beat as their eyes met.

"Elli," Ava said, her voice hesitant. "It's been a long time."

Elli nodded, feeling a mix of emotions swirling inside her. "Ava," she replied, her voice barely above a whisper. "I've missed you."

The two sisters stood there for a moment, unsure of what to say or do next. Finally, Ava broke the silence. "I'm sorry," she said, her eyes dropping to the ground. "I was wrong to leave like I did. I know that now."

Elli's expression softened, and she reached out to take her sister's hand. "It's okay," she said. "I understand. But next time, can we please just talk about it?"

Ava nodded, a small smile playing on her lips. As they walked together through the station, Elli felt a sense of peace wash over her. She was glad that Ava had come back into her life, and she was determined to make the most of their reunion.

As they made their way to the exit, Elli turned to her sister with a curious expression. "So, what brings you here?" she asked.

Ava hesitated, then replied, "I'm starting fresh. I need to get away from everything and everyone."

Elli nodded, understanding. She knew that Ava needed space, but she also knew that their bond was stronger than any distance or obstacle.

Together, the sisters walked out of the station, into a bright and uncertain future. And Elli Olsen felt grateful for this second chance at family and forgiveness.
