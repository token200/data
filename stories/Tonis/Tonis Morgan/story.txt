As a child, Tonis had been fascinated by color and texture, spending hours mixing paints and experimenting with different techniques. His parents, both artists themselves, encouraged his creativity, providing him with endless supplies of canvases, brushes, and paints.

His paintings seemed to vibrate with an otherworldly power, as if the very colors themselves were alive.

As Tonis's reputation grew, so did his commissions.
