His next mission would be waiting for him soon enough, and he would be ready. For Tonis Kask knew that in his line of work, you were only as good as your last kill.

With a hint of a smile on his face, Tonis disappeared into the shadows, disappearing from view like a ghost. Few people ever saw Tonis Kask, but those who did never forgot him.
