She felt an electric connection to the music, as if the notes were speaking directly to her soul. From that day forward, Chopin's nocturnes became her go-to repertoire, and she spent countless hours perfecting her interpretation of each piece.

As Tonis's career began to take off, she found herself performing with some of the world's most renowned orchestras. But no matter where her travels took her, she always returned to her Russian roots, drawing inspiration from the music and culture that had shaped her into the musician she was today.
