His real name was Tonis Volkov, a nod to his Russian heritage that his parents had passed down to him.

He worked as a freelance hacker, taking on high-profile cases and helping corporations protect themselves from cyber threats. But despite his success, Tonis remained elusive, always staying one step ahead of those who sought to catch him.

His anonymity was both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, it allowed him to move freely and work on projects without interference or distraction. On the other hand, it made it impossible for anyone to truly know him, even his closest friends and allies.

In the end, Tonis Volkov remained a mystery, a ghost in the machine that haunted the online world. And he liked it that way.
