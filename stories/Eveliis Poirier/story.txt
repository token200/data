Born into a family of modest means, Eveliis grew up on the streets of Montreal's rough neighborhoods. Her early years were marked by poverty and hardship, but it was also during this time that she discovered her passion for music. With a voice that could melt steel and a talent for playing the guitar, Eveliis began performing on street corners and in small clubs, earning enough to support herself.

But Eveliis's life was not without its challenges. She struggled to find stability, constantly on the move from city to city, never staying in one place for too long. This nomadic lifestyle took a toll on her relationships, leaving her with few close friends and a string of failed romances.

Despite these setbacks, Eveliis persevered, driven by a fierce determination to share her music with the world. She spent years honing her craft, touring small towns and big cities alike, building a reputation as one of the most exciting new voices in the industry.

As she gazed out into the crowd, her eyes locked onto the sea of faces, each one a reminder that she was no longer alone.

In that moment, Eveliis Poirier knew that she had finally found her place in the world â€“ on stage, with her guitar slung over her shoulder and her voice soaring through the night.
