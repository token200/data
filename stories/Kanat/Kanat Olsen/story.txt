Kanat Olsen stepped out into the chilly evening air, his eyes scanning the bustling streets of Oslo. As the lead detective at Hordaland Police Department, he had seen it all - from gruesome murders to high-profile scandals. But tonight, something felt off.

A young woman, barely 25 years old, stood on the corner, her hands shaking as she clutched a piece of paper. Kanat recognized the look in her eyes - fear, desperation. He approached her cautiously, his hand resting on the butt of his gun.

"Hello," he said softly. "What's going on?"

The woman looked up at him, her gaze darting around the crowded street before settling back on Kanat. "I need to tell you something," she whispered urgently. "My sister's gone missing."

Kanat nodded sympathetically, pulling out a small notebook from his pocket and flipping through the pages. He had dealt with countless missing persons cases over the years, but there was something about this woman's words that resonated deep within him.

He listened intently as she recounted her sister's last days - the usual daily routine of work, social media posts, nothing out of the ordinary. But on Wednesday morning, her phone had stopped ringing. Her parents were worried, and they had called Kanat in a panic.

As Kanat listened, his mind began to piece together fragments of information. The missing woman's name was Sofia - 28 years old, with no priors, no enemies that he could find. She worked as an accountant at a small firm downtown, and her social media profiles were sparse on personal life.

Kanat knew he had to act fast. He asked the woman for any photos or videos of Sofia's last days, anything that might lead him to clues. As they walked towards his car, Kanat couldn't shake off the feeling that something was amiss - a hunch that this case would be different from all the others.

The night air seemed darker now, as if the shadows themselves were closing in around them. Kanat lit a cigarette, taking long, deliberate puffs as he pondered the enigma before him. He knew one thing for sure: Sofia's disappearance was just the beginning of a very long and very difficult journey.

With a resolute nod, Kanat turned to the woman and said, "Don't worry, I'll do everything in my power to find your sister."
