The day of battle arrived, and Kanat charged into the fray like a whirlwind, cutting down Ryota's soldiers with deadly precision. The enemy lord himself faced Kanat, their blades clashing in a flurry of steel and sparks. For what felt like an eternity, the two warriors danced around each other, neither giving quarter.

In the end, it was Kanat who emerged victorious, Ryota falling to his sword as if weighed down by leaden chains. The villagers cheered, and Akakawa's walls rang with their joyous shouts. Kanat stood tall, his chest heaving with exertion, his eyes ablaze with triumph.

As news of the battle spread throughout the land, people from far and wide came to pay homage to Kanat Hideki, the hero who had saved their village.
