As she grew older, Kanat's passion for art only intensified. She pursued formal training at the Riga Academy of Art, where she honed her skills and developed a unique style that blended traditional techniques with modern sensibilities. Her artwork often explored themes of identity, culture, and social justice, sparking conversations and debates among her peers.

She was featured in prominent art exhibitions and publications, including a solo show at the Riga Art Museum. Her paintings were met with critical acclaim, with one critic praising her "remarkable ability to capture the essence of Latvian culture" in her artwork.

Despite her success, Kanat remained committed to using her platform to amplify marginalized voices. She worked closely with community organizations and artists from underrepresented backgrounds, providing them with resources and opportunities to share their stories. Her collaborations often resulted in powerful installations that challenged societal norms and sparked meaningful discussions.

One notable project saw Kanat teaming up with a group of local musicians to create an immersive sound installation that explored the intersection of music and identity. The event drew hundreds of attendees, who were moved by the evocative soundscape and thought-provoking visual narratives. For Kanat Pētersons, this experience was a highlight of her career, demonstrating the impact she could have when combining art with activism.

Kanat's success continued to grow, but she remained true to her roots, always mindful of her heritage and its significance in shaping her work. As an artist, advocate, and community builder, Kanat Pētersons was a force to be reckoned with, using her talents to inspire positive change and celebrate the beauty of Latvian culture.
