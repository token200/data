Zhou Chun-yi sat in his small, cluttered office, staring at the stack of bills and documents that seemed to be piling up faster than he could pay them off. As a freelance graphic designer, life was never predictable, but lately, it felt like he was juggling too many irons in the fire.

He let out a deep sigh and rubbed his tired eyes, feeling the weight of his responsibilities bearing down on him. His parents had always encouraged him to pursue his passion for design, but now, at 25, he was struggling to make ends meet.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was his best friend, Emily, who worked as a freelance writer. She plopped down in the chair across from him and began flipping through the bills.

"Hey, chun-yi, I heard you're having some financial trouble," she said, her voice laced with concern. "Want me to help you brainstorm?"

Zhou Chun-yi shook his head. "It's not just about money, Em. It's about purpose. I feel like I'm losing myself in all this freelance work."

Emily nodded understandingly. "I know what you mean. Sometimes I think we're just trying too hard to make it as freelancers. We need to remember why we started doing this stuff in the first place – for the love of it, not just for the money."

As they chatted, Zhou Chun-yi's mind began to wander back to his childhood days spent exploring the countryside near his hometown. He used to spend hours sketching the plants and animals he encountered, lost in a world of fantasy and creativity.

"That's when I realized I wanted to be an artist," he said, a smile spreading across his face. "Not just a graphic designer, but someone who can make people feel something with their work."

Emily grinned back at him. "You still can! You don't have to give up on your dreams because you're not making enough money. There are ways to make it work – maybe take on fewer projects, focus more on personal projects, that kind of thing."

Zhou Chun-yi felt a surge of determination course through his veins. Maybe Emily was right. Maybe he didn't need to sacrifice his passion for the sake of financial stability.

He stood up, feeling a newfound sense of purpose. "Thanks, Em," he said, clapping her on the back. "I think I'm going to take your advice and shake things up. Time to get creative again!"

As they left the office together, Zhou Chun-yi felt like he was walking into a new chapter of his life – one that would be filled with art, imagination, and maybe even a little financial stability.
