Aisha Patel walked into the bustling cafe, scanning the room for a familiar face. She had been searching for her childhood friend, Rohan, for hours, and finally, she spotted him huddled in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee.

"Aisha!" he exclaimed, as she approached him. "I've been looking all over for you!"

Aisha smiled and plopped down beside him at the small table. "Sorry about that," she said. "I got lost in the streets of Mumbai."

Rohan chuckled. "You're always getting lost somewhere," he teased. "But I'm glad you found me. I was starting to think you'd abandoned me for good."

Aisha laughed and playfully rolled her eyes. "Never, Rohan," she said. "I'll never abandon our friendship."

The two friends spent the next few hours catching up on each other's lives. Aisha filled Rohan in on her latest job at a marketing firm, while Rohan shared stories of his adventures traveling the world.

As they chatted, Aisha couldn't help but feel grateful for their lifelong bond. She and Rohan had grown up together, exploring the streets of Mumbai and sharing secrets in the dead of night. Even as adults, their friendship remained strong, a constant source of comfort and support in each other's lives.

Just then, a group of rowdy patrons stumbled into the cafe, drawing the attention of Aisha and Rohan. "Shh!" Rohan whispered, holding up his hand in warning. "Be quiet for a second," he said, as he listened intently to the chaos.

Aisha peered at him curiously. "What's going on?" she asked quietly.

Rohan just shook his head. "I don't know," he replied. "But I think it has something to do with our old high school."

Aisha raised an eyebrow, intrigued. She turned back to her coffee, lost in thought as the sounds of the cafe faded into the background.
