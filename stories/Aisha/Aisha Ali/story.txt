Aisha Ali walked into the dimly lit caf√©, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting in the corner, his back to her, sipping on a cup of coffee. His name was Rohan, an old friend from college who had always been there for her.

As she approached him, he finally looked up and smiled. "Aisha! Long time no see," he said, standing up to greet her with a warm hug.

They spent the next hour catching up on each other's lives. Aisha had just returned from a year-long trip to Europe, working as an freelance writer. Rohan had started his own business after completing his MBA. They talked about everything and nothing, laughing like they used to when they were students together.

After their reunion, Rohan suggested they take a walk along the river that ran through the heart of the city. The sun was setting, casting a golden glow over the water. They strolled hand in hand, reminiscing about old times and making plans for the future.

As they walked, Aisha confided in Rohan about her struggles as a writer. She had always dreamed of publishing a book, but the rejection letters were starting to get her down. Rohan listened intently, offering words of encouragement and advice.

"You have a unique voice, Aisha," he said. "Don't give up on your dreams. Keep writing and believing in yourself."

Aisha smiled, feeling a surge of gratitude towards her friend. She knew that she could always count on Rohan to be there for her.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, they settled down on a bench overlooking the river. The stars began to twinkle above, and Aisha felt a sense of peace wash over her. It was moments like these that made her grateful for friendship and the people who had always been by her side.

Rohan turned to her with a mischievous grin. "Hey, I have an idea," he said. "Let's start a writing group together. We can share our work, give each other feedback...it'll be fun!"

Aisha laughed, feeling a spark of excitement ignite within her. "That sounds like perfect timing," she replied.

And with that, two old friends made a promise to support and encourage each other in their creative pursuits. The city lights twinkled below them, as they sat together under the starry sky, ready to embark on this new adventure together.
