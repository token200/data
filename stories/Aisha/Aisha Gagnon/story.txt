Aisha Gagnon walked into the bustling café, her eyes scanning the crowded room for a familiar face. She spotted her best friend, Leila, sitting at a small table by the window and made her way over.

"Aisha!" Leila exclaimed, as she stood up to greet her friend with a warm hug. "It's so great to see you! I've missed you all week."

Aisha smiled and hugged her back, feeling a wave of relief wash over her. She had been going through a tough time lately, struggling to find meaning in her life after graduating from college.

"I've missed you too, Leila," she said, taking a seat across from her friend. "I needed to get out of the apartment and see some people. It's just been so quiet and isolating."

Leila nodded sympathetically. "I know how that feels. Sometimes I think we need a break from our own minds just to clear our heads. But don't worry, you're here now and everything will be okay."

The two friends chatted for a while, catching up on each other's lives and sharing stories about their struggles and triumphs. Aisha found herself opening up to Leila in ways she hadn't expected, talking about her fears and doubts with ease.

As they talked, the café owner came over to take their order. "What can I get for you ladies today?" she asked, smiling at them both.

"Just a cup of coffee for me, please," Aisha said, turning back to Leila. "And what about you?"

"I'll have a cappuccino with extra foam," Leila replied, "and a slice of lemon pound cake."

As they waited for their drinks and treats, Aisha felt a sense of gratitude wash over her. She was lucky to have friends like Leila in her life, people who understood her and supported her without condition.

When their order arrived, they settled back into their conversation, lost in discussion about everything from books to music to their hopes for the future. Aisha Gagnon felt a sense of peace settle over her, knowing that she was exactly where she needed to be – surrounded by good friends and good food, savoring the simple pleasures in life.

As they finished up and prepared to leave, Leila reached out and put a hand on Aisha's arm. "You're going to be okay, Aisha," she said softly. "I promise."
