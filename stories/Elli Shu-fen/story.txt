Elli Shu-fen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. It had been years since she'd set foot in Taipei, but the memories still lingered like a familiar scent. Her fingers drummed against the strap of her backpack as she waited for the sounds of the city to envelop her once more.

She took a deep breath, feeling the familiar thrum of excitement coursing through her veins. For the next few weeks, she'd be staying with an old family friend in the heart of the city – Auntie Mei. Elli had grown up hearing stories about Auntie's adventures as a young woman, and she was determined to follow in her footsteps.

The taxi driver navigated the crowded streets with ease, expertly weaving past pedestrians and vendors alike. As they approached the small apartment building, Elli spotted a faded sign reading "Mei Lan-Shu" – a childhood nickname for her aunt that seemed almost mythical now.

Elli alighted from the cab and shouldered her backpack, making her way through the crowded courtyard to Auntie's front door. She knocked twice, and the soft thud of footsteps signaled her arrival. The door swung open, revealing a face as warm and creased as Elli had imagined – Mei Lan-Shu.

Over steaming cups of tea, Elli poured out stories of her own adventures in Canada – tales of snow-covered landscapes, frozen lakes, and cozy cabin retreats. Auntie listened with an amused smile, her eyes twinkling like polished jade. It was clear that she'd heard every detail before – a testament to their enduring bond.

The days blurred together as Elli settled into the familiar rhythms of Taipei life. They wandered through night markets, sampled exotic flavors, and watched old movies in the apartment's cluttered home theater. Auntie regaled her with tales of revolutionary protests, martial law, and underground art collectives – stories that seemed both thrilling and foreboding.

At night, Elli retreated to her small room, feeling grateful for this slice of normalcy amidst the whirlwind of memories and expectations. Her fingers strayed over a faded tattoo on her wrist – a Chinese character that Auntie had inscribed years ago: "Teng Da Mei Xing" or 'Heavenly Will". It was an inscription Elli now repeated whenever she felt lost.

As Elli drifted off to sleep, the sounds of Taipei seemed to envelop her once more – car horns, vendors calling out their wares, and the steady hum of traffic in the distance. She smiled softly into the darkness, feeling Auntie Mei's gentle presence like a guiding light on her journey home.
