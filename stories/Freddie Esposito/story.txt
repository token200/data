Freddie Esposito, the infamous hitman, sat in his dimly lit office, sipping on a glass of fine scotch. His eyes scanned the walls, adorned with photographs of his past victims, each one a reminder of the power and respect he commanded in the underworld.

As a child, Freddie had grown up on the streets, surrounded by the sounds of gunfire and the smell of smoke. He had learned early on to rely only on himself, to trust no one but himself. And so, he had built a reputation as one of the most feared men in the city's organized crime world.

Freddie's latest target was the wealthy businessman, Marcus Thompson. Rumor had it that Thompson had discovered some dark secrets about Freddie's past and was using them to blackmail him. The hit would be easy money, but Freddie knew that wasn't true. He needed to make an example of Thompson, to show everyone that Freddie Esposito didn't take kindly to threats.

Just then, his phone rang. It was his partner, Vinnie "The Bull" LaRosa. "Freddie, I've got some news for you," Vinnie said, his voice low and urgent. "Thompson's been seen at a charity gala tonight. He thinks he can hide in plain sight."

Freddie snorted. "Amateurs." He handed the phone to his assistant, who relayed the information back to Freddie.

With a plan in place, Freddie set out for the gala. He arrived in style, dressed to the nines and dripping with confidence. Thompson was seated at the head table, sipping champagne with a smug smile on his face.

Freddie spotted him and made his move, slipping into the crowd unnoticed. He wove through the guests, using his charm and charisma to blend in. Finally, he reached Thompson's side and leaned in close.

"It's over," Freddie whispered, his eyes locked on Thompson's.

Thompson's smile faltered for a moment before he realized who was standing next to him. His eyes went wide with fear as Freddie's hand closed around his throat.

But this wasn't the same hitman that had taken down countless others. This time, it was personal. Freddie wanted to show Thompson that even in the world of organized crime, there were limits to what could be pushed.

And so, Freddie leaned in closer, his eyes locked on Thompson's as he whispered one final message: "You're next."

The guests watched in horror as Freddie pulled out a knife and ended Thompson's life right there at the gala. When it was all over, Freddie smiled, a cold glint in his eye.

That was the way it was done. That was the mark of Freddie Esposito.

As he walked away from the gala, phone ringing in his hand, Freddie couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. He had made an example of Thompson and sent a message to everyone else: you don't mess with Freddie Esposito.

And so, the legend grew, Freddie's name whispered in fear by those who knew better than to cross him.
