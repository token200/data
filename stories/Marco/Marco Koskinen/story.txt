Marco Koskinen stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the familiar station in Helsinki. As a detective with the Finnish police force, he knew every nook and cranny of this city. But today, he was on a case that felt personal.

A wealthy businessman had gone missing, leaving behind only a cryptic message for Marco to find. The victim, Markus Lindstrom, was a close friend from his university days. They had always been close, but as their careers took different paths, they lost touch. Now, with Markus gone, Marco felt like he was being pulled back into the past.

As he made his way through the station, Marco's mind wandered to the memories of their time together. He remembered the late-night conversations about philosophy and politics, the laughter-filled days at festivals, and the quiet moments when they would just sit together, watching the sunset over the Baltic Sea.

Marco arrived at Markus' office and began searching for clues. The air was thick with tension as he sifted through papers, looking for any hint of what had happened to his friend. He found a note on Markus' desk, written in hasty handwriting: "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone."

With a sense of foreboding, Marco Koskinen knew that this was going to be a long and difficult case. He packed up his belongings and headed out into the Helsinki night, determined to find Markus Lindstrom and uncover the truth.

As he approached the clock tower, Marco felt a shiver run down his spine. This was it â€“ the moment of truth. He drew his gun, ready for anything, and slowly pushed open the creaky door. The wind howled through the empty streets, but inside, all was quiet. Where was Markus? And what had happened to him?

The darkness seemed to swallow Marco whole, leaving only one thing certain: he would leave no stone unturned until he found out.
