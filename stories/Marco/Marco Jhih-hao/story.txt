Marco Jhih-hao was known for his impeccable taste in antique furniture. As the owner of a small, yet renowned shop in Taipei's bustling Old Town, he spent most of his days scouring the city's markets and estates for rare pieces to add to his collection.

One sunny afternoon, Marco Jhih-hao strolled through the narrow alleys, his eyes scanning the stalls for something that caught his attention. He had heard rumors of a local collector who possessed a rare Qing dynasty armchair, said to be worth a small fortune. As he turned a corner, he spotted a vendor hawking an ornate wooden cabinet.

Marco Jhih-hao approached the vendor, inspecting the cabinet with a discerning eye. The intricate carvings and inlaid patterns caught his attention, but he knew it was just the beginning. He pressed a few coins into the vendor's hand, and walked away, leaving him to wonder if he had missed an opportunity.

Undeterred, Marco Jhih-hao continued his search for the armchair. Hours passed as he visited estate after estate, each one promising to yield something remarkable but ultimately falling short. As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the city, he spotted a small flyer tacked to a bulletin board.

"Rare Furniture for Sale," it read. " Qing Dynasty Armchair, 18th century."

Marco Jhih-hao's heart skipped a beat as he tore off a corner of the flyer and tucked it into his pocket. This was it – the break he had been waiting for. He quickened his pace, his mind racing with possibilities.

Back in his shop, Marco Jhih-hao spent hours poring over the flyer, verifying every detail before making his move. Finally, he arrived at the collector's estate, a lavish mansion on the outskirts of town. The armchair sat proudly in the foyer, its beauty almost overwhelming.

Marco Jhih-hao knew that this was it – his chance to acquire the rare piece that would cement his reputation as one of Taipei's leading furniture connoisseurs. With trembling hands, he signed the papers and made the purchase, already envisioning the accolades that would follow in the days ahead.
