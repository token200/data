Marco Simon had always been drawn to the sea. Growing up in a small coastal town, he spent most of his childhood exploring the rocky shores and watching the sailboats bob gently on the waves. As he grew older, his love for the ocean only deepened, and he knew that he wanted to spend his life out on the water.

After completing his education, Marco joined the local fishing fleet, where he quickly proved himself to be a skilled and hardworking sailor. He spent years honing his craft, learning everything there was to know about the tides, the weather patterns, and the best ways to catch fish in different conditions.

But Marco's true passion lay not just in the practical skills of fishing, but in the stories and legends that surrounded the sea. As a child, he had heard tales from his grandfather, a grizzled old sailor who had spent years at sea, about mermaids and sea monsters, about sunken ships and hidden treasure.

As Marco grew older, these stories only grew more vivid in his mind, and he began to wonder if there was any truth to them. He started keeping a journal of all the strange occurrences that happened on his fishing trips - the time a school of fish swam alongside the boat in perfect synchrony, the night when a storm blew in without warning, leaving him shaken but unharmed.

Years went by, and Marco became one of the most respected fishermen in the fleet. He had stories to tell and legends to share with anyone who would listen. But he also knew that there was more to life than just fishing - he had a restlessness inside him, a sense that there was something out there waiting for him.

One day, while on a trip out of the harbor, Marco spotted a strange shape on the horizon - a ship unlike any he had ever seen before. He felt a jolt of excitement and trepidation as he steered the boat towards it. As they drew closer, he saw that it was an old galleon, its sails worn but still billowing in the wind.

Marco felt a sense of wonder wash over him - this was no ordinary ship. And as he looked around, he saw figures on deck, beckoning to him from across the water. He knew in that moment that his life was about to change forever.
