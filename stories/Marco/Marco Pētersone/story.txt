Marco Pētersone was a Latvian-born photographer known for his striking and haunting images of the post-industrial landscapes of Central Europe. Born in Riga, Latvia, in 1975, Marco grew up surrounded by the remnants of Soviet-era industrialization, with factories and factories chiming through the city's streets.

As a child, Marco was fascinated by the abandoned buildings and crumbling structures that dotted the outskirts of Riga. He would spend hours exploring these places, collecting discarded objects and documenting the decay with his makeshift camera.

After completing art school in Tallinn, Estonia, Marco traveled extensively throughout Europe, capturing images of urban decay and industrial neglect. His photographs quickly gained attention from galleries and collectors, who praised his unique perspective on a rapidly changing world.

One of Marco's most notable series, "The Last Industry", chronicled the decline of Latvian factories and manufacturing plants in the early 2000s. These powerful images captured the eerie silence of abandoned warehouses, the rusting remains of machinery, and the desolate landscape left behind by industrial decline.

However, it wasn't until Marco returned to Latvia in 2015 that he created some of his most haunting work yet. Faced with a rapidly changing country struggling to find its place in a globalized world, Marco turned his lens on the crumbling Soviet-era infrastructure and housing projects of Riga's outskirts.

These photographs not only captured the decay but also told stories of people who had called these places home for decades. Marco's images showed families living in cramped, makeshift apartments; workers standing idle amidst abandoned factories; and children playing in ruins that once were homes.

Marco Pētersone's work has been exhibited internationally, including at the Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. His photographs have also been featured on the covers of numerous publications, from The Guardian to Le Monde.

Despite his international success, Marco remains committed to his roots, often incorporating elements of Latvian folk culture into his work. As he continues to explore and document the changing landscapes of Central Europe, Marco Pētersone's photographs stand as a testament to the power of art to capture the essence of our rapidly shifting world.

In his own words, "I am not just documenting decay; I'm trying to capture a moment in time that will forever hold a piece of our collective memory. My photographs are an attempt to slow down the pace of change and give people pause for reflection."
