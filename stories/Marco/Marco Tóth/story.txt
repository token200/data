Marco Tóth was an enigmatic figure, shrouded in mystery and intrigue. A skilled thief and con artist, he had made a name for himself on the streets of Vienna, leaving a trail of bewildered aristocrats and cunning marks in his wake.

With his chiseled features and piercing green eyes, Marco could charm the birds from the trees, but those who knew him well understood that beneath his charismatic facade lay a calculating mind.
