Marco Boulanger was a man with an unusual talent - he could hear people's thoughts. It wasn't something he had ever been able to control, and it often left him feeling overwhelmed by the cacophony of thoughts that filled his mind.

As a child, Marco had always felt like there was something different about him. He couldn't explain why, but he would sometimes catch snippets of conversation between people who were supposed to be alone in their rooms or on the bus. At first, he thought it was just his vivid imagination running wild, but as he grew older, he realized that the thoughts weren't coming from anywhere else.

Marco's parents had taken him to see specialists and psychologists, hoping to find some explanation for his condition. But no one seemed able to offer any answers. They would try to help him learn to block out the thoughts or develop coping mechanisms, but it was like trying to put a lid on a volcano - no matter how hard he tried, the thoughts just kept coming.

As a result, Marco had learned to retreat into his own world. He would spend hours lost in books and music, escaping from the constant chatter that filled his mind. But even those escapes were fragile, and he knew that at any moment, someone's inner monologue could burst forth and shatter the peace.

One day, a young woman named Sophia moved into the apartment next door to Marco. At first, she seemed quiet and reserved, but as Marco got to know her, he began to sense that there was something different about her too. She would sometimes catch his eye, and for a moment, he would feel like they were sharing some secret language.

As they grew closer, Marco realized that Sophia had a unique gift of her own - the ability to hear music in people's voices. Whenever someone spoke, their words came alive with melody and rhythm, creating an otherworldly harmony that was both beautiful and haunting.

For the first time in his life, Marco felt like he wasn't alone. He knew that there were others out there who could see and hear things that no one else could, and that realization gave him hope. Maybe, just maybe, Sophia was someone who could help him learn to control his gift - or at least understand it better.

As they sat on the couch together, listening to the silence between the thoughts in their minds, Marco felt a sense of peace wash over him. It wasn't like the chaos he had grown accustomed to, but a quiet calm that came from knowing someone understood what he was going through.
