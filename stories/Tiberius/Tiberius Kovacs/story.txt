Tiberius Kovacs stepped out of the rain-soaked streets and into the dimly lit bar, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of life. As a former soldier in the Union of Tyrany, he had seen his fair share of battles, but nothing could have prepared him for the desolate landscape of his own past.

Kovacs made his way to the bar, ordering a whiskey on the rocks as he surveyed the patrons. A gruff bartender with a thick beard raised an eyebrow at his request, but nodded curtly and slid the drink across the counter.

As he sipped his whiskey, Kovacs's thoughts turned to the mission that had brought him here. He was supposed to meet with a contact, someone who claimed to have information about the whereabouts of his sister, who had been kidnapped by the tyrannical forces of Governor Aden Geiger.

Kovacs's eyes narrowed as he scanned the room once more, his hand resting on the grip of his pistol, which was holstered at his side. He had been tracking Geiger for months, following a trail of clues that led him deeper into the heart of the tyrant's stronghold.

As he waited, Kovacs couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He glanced around the room, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Just a group of rough-looking men huddled in the corner, nursing their drinks and eyeing each other with suspicion.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows, her face hidden behind a veil of dark fabric. "Tiberius Kovacs," she whispered, her voice barely audible over the music playing in the background. "I have what you're looking for."

Kovacs's heart quickened as he rose from his stool, his eyes locked on the mysterious woman. "What is it?" he demanded, his hand resting on the grip of his pistol once more.

The woman hesitated, her voice barely above a whisper. "Your sister... she's being held in a maximum-security facility, deep within Geiger's stronghold."

Kovacs's eyes flashed with determination. He knew what he had to do next. With a cold calculation, he nodded at the woman, and together they set out to infiltrate the fortress and rescue his sister once and for all.
