Tiberius "Tib" Moreau stood at the edge of the dimly lit rooftop, his eyes scanning the sprawling city below. The neon lights of skyscrapers and bustling streets cast an otherworldly glow on the rain-soaked pavement. A low hum of jazz music drifted up from a club in the distance, mingling with the sound of distant sirens.

Tib's gaze lingered on the rooftops across the street, where his estranged brother, Lucien, was said to be hiding. Rumors swirled that Lucien had made a pact with the city's underworld to secure his own fortune. Tib's eyes narrowed, and he turned back to the rooftop, where the shadows seemed to close in around him like a shroud.

As a child, Tib had grown up idolizing his older brother, who was rumored to be a master of illusion and deception. Their parents had long since passed away, leaving Tib to navigate the treacherous world alone. But with each passing year, Lucien's name became synonymous with fear and exploitation. People whispered that he'd made pacts with dark forces to further his own ambitions.

The rain intensified, drumming against the rooftop's metal grating. Tib's thoughts turned to their shared past, when they were children and had dared to dream of escape from this decaying city. Lucien had always been the one to take risks, while Tib played it safe. But after a fateful fall down a fire escape, everything changed.

Tib's gaze wandered back to the rooftops across the street, where he spotted Lucien standing, arms raised against the rain like a supplicant. Something about that stance told Tib that his brother was seeking more than just fortune and power.

Without hesitation, Tib sprang into action, leaping off the rooftop and landing with a thud on the pavement below. The world seemed to slow as he sprinted towards Lucien's building, dodging umbrellas and pedestrians along the way. Reaching the door, Tib slammed his fist against the metal plate, sending shivers through the room.

When the door swung open, Tib confronted his brother, demanding answers about their shared past. For an instant, Tib saw a glimmer of their old bond in Lucien's eyes â€“ a spark that ignited something deep within him.

As the rain continued to pour down, Tib realized that there were still secrets he'd never uncovered about his own family. He turned back towards the city, feeling more resolute than ever before. Tonight was not the end; it was just the beginning of their journey together.

For now, Tib decided, he would stand by Lucien's side and explore this twisted world they called home. Who knew what mysteries lay hidden beneath its streets, or which forces controlled them? But one thing was certain: with his brother by his side, Tib Moreau would no longer be alone in the dark.
