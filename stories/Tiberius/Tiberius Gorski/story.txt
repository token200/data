Tiberius "Tib" Gorski was a man with a storied past and an even more complex present. Growing up on the streets of Warsaw, Poland, Tib had learned to rely on his wits and fists to survive. But as he grew older, he began to realize that there was more to life than just scraping by.

After serving in the Polish army, Tib settled down in New York City, where he found work as a mechanic at a small shop in Brooklyn. He spent his days tinkering with engines and his nights studying the language of the land - English. It wasn't easy, but Tib was determined to leave his old life behind.

Years went by, and Tib became a fixture in the community. He ran marathons, volunteered at local charities, and even started dating. But despite all his progress, Tib couldn't shake the feeling that he was living someone else's dream. He felt like he was hiding from himself, afraid to reveal the truth about who he really was.

One night, while working late at the shop, Tib received a mysterious phone call. On the other end was an unknown number, but one voice was unmistakable - his estranged father, Marek Gorski. It had been decades since they'd last spoken, and Tib's heart skipped a beat as he heard the familiar Polish accent.

"Tiborius," his father said, using the full name that Tib hadn't used in years. "I'm coming to visit. Meet me at the old park at midnight."

Tib was torn. Part of him longed to see his father again, to finally understand why they'd drifted apart. But another part of him knew that he couldn't just open up like that after all these years.

As the clock struck midnight, Tib made his way to the park, wondering what lay ahead. His heart pounded with anticipation as he waited for Marek to arrive. Only then would he know if this chance encounter was a step forward or a step back into the unknown.
