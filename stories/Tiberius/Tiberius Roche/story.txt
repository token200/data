One stormy night, Tiberius Roche received a call from the police department, requesting his assistance in investigating a string of high-end jewelry store robberies. The thief seemed to be always one step ahead of the law, leaving behind no signs of forced entry or exit.

Tiberius Roche arrived at the scene of the latest heist, a posh boutique on the outskirts of town, and began surveying the area. He noticed that the security cameras were disabled, but there was something else peculiar – a small, almost imperceptible mark on the window frame.
