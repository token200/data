In the scorching deserts of Kujira, Tiberius Wei-lun roamed, his piercing green eyes scanning the dunes for any sign of life. As a skilled treasure hunter, he had been tracking the fabled Golden Scarab for years, and finally, he was closing in on his prize.

Tiberius Wei-lun's reputation preceded him - whispers of his expertise spread like wildfire through the desert towns, drawing in would-be rivals and curious adventurers alike. But few could match his unwavering determination and unshakeable conviction.

As Tiberius Wei-lun made his way back through the temple, the Golden Scarab clutched tightly in his hand, he couldn't help but feel a sense of pride - this was what it meant to be Tiberius Wei-lun, treasure hunter extraordinaire.
