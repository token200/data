"What is it that you would like me to create?" Tiberius Ming (张明) asked, his hands already moving towards the client's sketchbook.

The man handed him a sheet of paper adorned with intricate designs and patterns. "Create a painting of the Jade Emperor," he said, his voice filled with reverence.

Tiberius Ming (张明)'s eyes widened as he took in the commission. He knew that this would be one of his most challenging projects yet, but he was up for the task.

With a determined smile, Tiberius Ming (张明) set to work on his masterpiece. Hours turned into days, and days turned into weeks as he poured all of his skill and creativity into the painting.

Finally, after months of tireless work, Tiberius Ming (张明)'s painting was complete. The client took one look at it and nodded in approval. "You have truly outdone yourself, Tiberius Ming," he said, handing over a small fortune as payment.
