Tiberius Deschamps was a man with a storied past, his eyes bearing the weight of countless secrets and whispers. A French-Canadian explorer and cartographer, he had spent years traversing the uncharted territories of North America, mapping its vast expanse and uncovering hidden treasures.

Born in 1830 to a family of modest means, Tiberius's natural aptitude for geography and mathematics soon earned him a place at the prestigious École des Cartographes in Paris. It was there that he honed his skills as a draftsman and cartographer under the tutelage of the renowned cartographer, Jean-Baptiste Céloron de Blainville.

Tiberius's big break came in 1850 when he was commissioned by the British Museum to map the newly discovered territories of the Pacific Northwest. With an expedition team at his disposal, Tiberius braved treacherous waters and unpredictable weather patterns, driven by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and discovery.

Over the years, his name became synonymous with bravery, wit, and unwavering determination. He spent countless nights poring over dusty tomes and crumbling maps in the dimly lit archives of institutions across Europe, piecing together the fragmentary narratives of forgotten civilizations.

One fateful evening, while pouring over a particularly obscure text on the history of the indigenous peoples of North America, Tiberius stumbled upon an ancient tale of gold-rich veins hidden deep within the Canadian Rockies. Intrigued by the prospect, he spent the next several months tracking down local legends and cryptic clues that would lead him to the fabled treasure.

As word of his discovery spread like wildfire through the academic community, the enigmatic cartographer vanished from public view. Some whispered of a grand adventure into the heart of the Rockies; others claimed that Tiberius had been swallowed whole by some unseen force, leaving behind only an empty shell of the man he once was.

But on a crisp autumn morning in 1865, as the last wisps of sunlight faded over the vast expanse of the prairies, a solitary figure emerged from the fog-shrouded mountainside – Tiberius Deschamps, his eyes aglow with secrets and tales from beyond the reaches of mortal men.
