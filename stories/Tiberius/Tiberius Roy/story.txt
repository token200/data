Tiberius Roy stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the cityscape. The wind whipped his dark hair into a frenzy as he breathed in deeply, the scent of smoke and concrete filling his lungs. It was moments like these that he felt most alive.

As a former soldier turned mercenary, Tiberius had seen his fair share of battles. He'd fought in some of the bloodiest wars in the world, earning a reputation for being ruthless and efficient. But after a particularly brutal mission went sour, Tiberius had grown disillusioned with the endless cycle of violence.

Now, at 35, he was trying to leave that life behind. Or, rather, finding new ways to use his skills for good. It wasn't easy – the temptation to go back to old habits lingered, and some days the city seemed too dark and corrupt for him to care about making a difference.

But tonight was different. Tonight, Tiberius had received a message from an unknown source, inviting him to meet at this rooftop with a proposition. The message had been cryptic, but one thing was clear: whoever was behind it wanted something that only Tiberius possessed – his unique skillset, honed over years of combat and strategy.

As he scanned the horizon, Tiberius spotted a figure emerging from the shadows. He drew his gun instinctively, eyes narrowing as the stranger approached. It was a woman, dressed in black leather armor, her face obscured by a helmet.

"I see you're still using that 'I'm a killer' look," she said with a wry smile, eyes glinting with amusement. "But I think it's time we talked about your skills being used for more than just personal gain."

Tiberius raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. "Who are you?" he asked, holstering his gun.

"My name is Ada," she replied, the words dripping with mystery. "I'm here to offer you a chance to join something bigger – a secret organization dedicated to using your talents for good. No more petty wars or blood money; just justice."

For a moment, Tiberius hesitated, weighing the pros and cons. It was a tempting offer, one that could change the course of his life forever. And as he looked out over the city, something within him stirred – the glimmer of hope, perhaps, or simply the thrill of the unknown.

Whatever it was, Tiberius knew in that moment that he'd take Ada's proposition. He'd leave his mark on the world – and try to make a difference while doing so.
