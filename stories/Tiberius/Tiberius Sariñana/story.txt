Tiberius Sariñana was a man shrouded in mystery, known only to a select few for his extraordinary abilities as a thief and an artist. His eyes gleamed like dark jewels as he navigated the labyrinthine streets of 19th century Madrid, a city alive with artistic fervor.

As a young man, Tiberius had been apprenticed to a renowned painter, where he honed his skills in capturing light and shadow on canvas. But amidst the swirling colors and textures, Tiberius's own secret passion – thievery – began to stir.

He became enthralled with the concept of stealing, not just valuable trinkets or gold, but entire works of art themselves. He rationalized that if he could acquire these masterpieces, then only to sell them to those who truly appreciated their value would they be preserved for posterity.

One stormy evening, Tiberius strolled through a crowded market square when his trained eyes spotted an exquisite still life on display by the prominent artist, Eduardo Gimeno. The painting depicted a tranquil orchard scene with delicate blooms and an old wooden gate, set against a backdrop of velvety night sky.

Tiberius was captivated by the piece's symphony of colors and its evocation of peace. In that instant, his resolve hardened: he would steal the painting, regardless of the risks. 

Days turned into weeks as Tiberius continued to monitor the market square where Gimeno's still life hung proudly on display at a small art gallery. He observed the artist's habits, noting that every other evening around sundown, he would retire to his workshop for several hours.

That night was the one that sealed Tiberius's fate: as Gimeno packed up his belongings and disappeared into the gloom of his darkened studio, the painting remained carelessly exposed. 

Swiftly and silently, Tiberius crept across the threshold of the gallery, a nimble shadow that darted between the empty display cases. With trembling hands, he carefully freed the still life from its hooks.

Upon reaching Gimeno's workshop, Tiberius found a note detailing his intention to unveil a new collection next week at an exclusive salon in Barcelona – an invitation meant for him alone. Consumed by emotion and the thrill of his daring plan, Tiberius was determined to sell Gimeno's still life, no matter what.

But the price he demanded for the painting proved a turning point: it was said that those who sold masterpieces should remain forever bound to their art, lest they lose themselves in its splendor.
