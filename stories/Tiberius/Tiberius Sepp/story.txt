Tiberius Sepp was known for his peculiar occupation – collecting and preserving antique door handles. His small workshop in the heart of Vienna was a treasure trove of strange and fascinating artifacts, each one telling a story of its own.

As he sat at his workbench, surrounded by a sea of screws, bolts, and hinges, Tiberius Sepp's mind wandered back to his childhood. Growing up, he had always been fascinated by the old doors that lined the streets of Vienna, their intricate carvings and mysterious mechanisms captivating him.

Years later, after completing his apprenticeship as a clockmaker, Tiberius Sepp discovered his true calling – collecting antique door handles. He spent years traveling the world, searching for the most unusual and beautiful examples to add to his collection.

His friends often teased him about his obsession, but Tiberius Sepp didn't mind. For him, each handle was a window into the past, telling a story of the people who had used them before. The worn, rusty hinges on an old wooden door told the tale of countless comings and goings; the delicate, filigree-patterned handles on a Victorian-era mansion whispered secrets of high society.

Tiberius Sepp's collection grew with each passing day, and his workshop became a shrine to the humble door handle. He spent hours polishing and restoring each one, bringing out their hidden beauty like a master craftsman.

One day, a young artist stumbled upon Tiberius Sepp's workshop while searching for inspiration. Enchanted by the doors, handles, and other curiosities on display, she asked if she could sketch some of them. Tiberius Sepp agreed, watching with a warm smile as her pencils brought his beloved collection to life.

As the artist left, clutching her sketches and a newfound appreciation for the beauty in the mundane, Tiberius Sepp felt grateful for his unique passion. His door handles had become more than just objects – they were keys to unlocking the stories of the past. And he was content to spend the rest of his days preserving and sharing them with the world, one handle at a time.
