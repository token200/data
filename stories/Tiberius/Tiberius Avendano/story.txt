Tiberius Avendano was no ordinary individual. With his striking features and razor-sharp intellect, he had carved out a niche for himself in the world of high-stakes art forgery. A master of disguise and deception, Tiberius's skills were sought after by collectors and connoisseurs from around the globe.

As the sun set over the bustling streets of Tokyo, Tiberius Avendano sat in his cramped apartment, surrounded by stacks of forgeries, rare artifacts, and an assortment of eclectic trinkets. He sipped on a cup of steaming green tea, lost in thought as he contemplated his next move.

A call from his contact at the Japanese museum interrupted his reverie, informing him that a new shipment of priceless masterpieces had arrived. Tiberius's eyes lit up with excitement as he mentally cataloged the pieces, searching for any hidden inconsistencies or flaws that could be exploited.

With lightning speed and precision, Tiberius set to work recreating the most coveted piece in the collection: a rare Vermeer. He spent hours studying the artist's brushstrokes, pouring over dusty texts and conducting meticulous research on the colors and materials used by Vermeer himself.

As he worked, Tiberius Avendano felt a sense of satisfaction wash over him. This was what he had always been meant to do – create something from nothing, deceive even the most discerning eye. His skills were unmatched, his reputation unparalleled.

But as the night wore on and the painting neared completion, Tiberius couldn't shake off the feeling that someone was watching him. He glanced around the room, half-expecting to see a figure lurking in the shadows.

It was then that he heard the knock at the door – a soft, hesitant tap-tap that seemed almost...human. With a sigh of relief, Tiberius rose from his chair and made his way to the entrance, where he found an unexpected visitor: his estranged sister, Luna Avendano. Their eyes met in a flash of recognition, the air thick with unspoken words and unresolved tension.

For one moment, Tiberius forgot about forgeries, collectors, and masterpieces – all he saw was the ghost of his past, staring back at him from the other side of the door.
