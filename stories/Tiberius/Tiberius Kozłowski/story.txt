Tiberius Koz≈Çowski was a man shrouded in mystery. A Polish aristocrat with a penchant for the macabre, he had made a name for himself as a collector of the most unusual and exotic curiosities.

His mansion, located on the outskirts of Krakow, was a labyrinthine monstrosity of turrets and towers, each one adorned with strange symbols and hieroglyphics. The air was thick with the scent of old books and decay, and the walls seemed to whisper secrets to those who dared to listen.

Tiberius himself was a tall, gaunt figure with sunken eyes and skin as pale as alabaster. His hair was slicked back, revealing a prominent widow's peak that seemed to darken his already troubled expression. He moved with an unnatural gait, as if his very limbs were weighted down by the secrets he kept.

Rumors abounded about Tiberius's collection. Some said it contained cursed artifacts from ancient civilizations, while others whispered of forbidden knowledge that could drive men mad. The truth was unknown, and those who dared to venture near the mansion did so at their own peril.

One stormy night, a young woman named Anna found herself lost in the streets of Krakow. Seeking refuge, she stumbled upon Tiberius's mansion, its windows glowing like lanterns in the darkness. Despite her initial reservations, Anna felt drawn to the place, as if an unseen force was guiding her towards the door.

As she entered, Tiberius greeted her with a cold, calculating smile. "Welcome, my dear," he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "I've been expecting you. You see, I have just the thing for someone of your... particular talents."

Anna followed him through the winding corridors, each step leading her deeper into the heart of the mansion. Finally, they arrived at a door adorned with intricate carvings of skulls and crossbones. Tiberius produced a key from his pocket and unlocked the door, revealing a room filled with strange and wondrous objects.

In the center of the room, on a pedestal of black marble, sat an artifact that made Anna's blood run cold. It was a taxidermied raven, its eyes glowing with an otherworldly light. Tiberius smiled, seeming to sense her fear. "This," he said, "is my most prized possession. And soon, it will be yours."

As the storm raged on outside, Anna realized that she had made a terrible mistake. She was trapped in a world of madness and terror, with no escape from Tiberius's grasp. The raven watched her, its eyes burning with an evil intensity, as if waiting for her to succumb to its dark magic. And in that moment, Anna knew she was doomed.
