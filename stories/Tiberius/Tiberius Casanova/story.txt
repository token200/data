One fateful evening, while on a high-stakes heist in the heart of Paris, Tiberius Casanova crossed paths with an alluring young socialite named Colette. Entranced by her striking beauty and razor-sharp wit, Tiberius was immediately smitten, convinced that he had finally found his perfect mark.

However, as their whirlwind romance began to blossom, Colette's icy reserve slowly started to thaw, revealing a sharp mind and quick tongue that left Tiberius Casanova more than a little perplexed.
