Tiberius Jarv was an enigma to the people of Ravenshire. A quiet, reserved individual with an air of mystery surrounding them. Few had ever laid eyes on the infamous thief, and even fewer knew the truth behind their identity.

As a child, Tiberius had grown up on the streets of Ravenshire, surviving by his wits and cunning. He had learned to navigate the shadows, avoiding detection and making a name for himself as one of the most elusive thieves in the city. His full name, Tiberius Jarv, was whispered in hushed tones among those who knew him, with many believing it to be a curse.

Despite his reclusive nature, Tiberius had a reputation for being ruthless and cunning, always staying one step ahead of his pursuers. He had stolen from the wealthy elite, leaving behind only the faintest hint of his presence. It was said that if you were lucky enough to catch a glimpse of him, you would be granted a single wish, but at a steep price.

One fateful night, Tiberius received an offer he couldn't refuse: to steal a priceless artifact from the collector's mansion on the outskirts of town. The catch? He had to complete the heist within a single hour, or risk being caught and serving a life sentence. Tiberius accepted the challenge, knowing that this was his chance to prove himself.

With a plan in place, Tiberius set out into the night, navigating the intricate locks and security measures with ease. As the clock ticked down, he worked with lightning speed, moving from room to room, gathering the artifact without being seen. When the hour finally ran out, Tiberius stood victorious, the artifact safely in hand.

He vanished into the shadows, leaving behind only a whisper of his presence: a single drop of ink on the collector's doorstep, bearing the signature of Tiberius Jarv. Some say that on quiet nights, you can still hear the faint sound of a whispered wish, carried on the wind by the ghost of Tiberius Jarv.
