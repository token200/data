I must correct you that there is no public information on a person named Tiberius DiCaprio. However, I can write a story about a fictional character with that name.

Tiberius "Tib" DiCaprio was a free-spirited artist living in the coastal town of Santa Monica. His parents had always encouraged his creative pursuits, and he spent most of his days painting, sculpting, or playing his guitar on the beach. With a messy mop of hair and a bushy beard, Tib was often mistaken for a hippie, but beneath his laid-back exterior lay a sharp mind and quick wit.

Tib's passion project was a series of large-scale murals depicting the history of California's coastal towns. He had always been fascinated by the stories of the people who lived along the Pacific Coast, from the Native American tribes to the early settlers and sailors. With his art, Tib hoped to bring these stories to life for future generations.

One day, while working on a particularly intricate mural in Venice Beach, Tib met a young woman named Luna. She was an aspiring writer, and the two struck up a conversation about their shared love of California's coastline. As they talked, Tib realized that Luna's writing style was reminiscent of his own art - evocative, descriptive, and full of life.

Inspired by their meeting, Tib began to explore the possibilities of collaborating with Luna on a new project. Together, they created a series of short stories and poems that captured the essence of California's coastal towns. Their work was met with critical acclaim, and soon Tib and Luna were in high demand as writers and artists.

As Tib's star rose, he never forgot his humble beginnings. He remained true to his artistic vision, always pushing the boundaries of what was possible with his medium. And through it all, he remained grateful for the opportunity to share his passion with others - whether through his art or his writing.

Years later, when people asked Tib about his success, he would simply smile and say that it was all thanks to Luna's help and his own unwavering dedication to his craft. For Tib "Tib" DiCaprio, the greatest joy in life was creating something beautiful - whether on canvas or on paper - and sharing it with the world.
