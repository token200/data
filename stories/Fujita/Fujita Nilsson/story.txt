Fujita Nilsson stepped into the dimly lit bar, her eyes scanning the crowded room with a mixture of curiosity and caution. As a renowned astrophysicist, she had grown accustomed to being in the spotlight, but tonight she sought refuge from the public eye.

Nilsson's gaze landed on a familiar face - her colleague and friend, Dr. Maria Rodriguez, who was nursing a whiskey at the bar. Fujita made her way over, exchanging warm smiles with Maria as they hugged hello.

"What brings you out tonight?" Maria asked, raising an eyebrow.

"Just needed a break from the lab," Nilsson replied, sliding onto the stool beside Maria. "The data from our latest Mars expedition has been overwhelming me."

Maria nodded sympathetically. "I know the feeling. Sometimes I think we spend too much time staring at screens and not enough time enjoying the universe itself."

Nilsson chuckled, sipping her own drink - a local specialty that had won her over during her last visit to this planet.

As they chatted, the bar began to fill with patrons who recognized Fujita Nilsson from her groundbreaking research on exoplanetary atmospheres. While she was used to being mobbed by fans and admirers, tonight she preferred the anonymity of a quiet night out.

Just then, the bartender called out an order for the entire room, and Fujita's ears perked up as he began to recite an obscure astronomical poem, weaving a spell over the audience. She leaned in closer to Maria, entranced by the performance.

When it ended, the crowd erupted into applause, and Fujita smiled wryly, acknowledging the unexpected turn of events. "Guess I'm still a magnet for attention, even when I try to fly under the radar."

Maria laughed, clapping her on the back. "Hey, someone has to keep your ego in check, Fui."

Nilsson rolled her eyes good-naturedly, smiling at the nickname that only Maria used - a testament to their lifelong friendship and mutual affection for the quirky, brilliant scientist that Fujita Nilsson truly was.
