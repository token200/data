Her reputation grew, as did her legend. People began to whisper about the enigmatic martial artist known only as Fujita Chun-yi, a name that struck fear into the hearts of her enemies.

Despite the demands of her new life, Chun-yi never forgot the wisdom of Master Wong, who had instilled in her a deep sense of responsibility and respect for the ancient traditions she had sworn to uphold. With each victory, she felt a sense of pride and purpose, knowing that she was carrying on the legacy of Hung Gar and protecting those who needed her most.

As Chun-yi walked through the neon-lit streets of Kowloon, her eyes scanned the crowds with a quiet intensity, ever vigilant for the next challenge to overcome. Her name would become synonymous with courage and honor, and the legend of Fujita Chun-yi would live on forever.
