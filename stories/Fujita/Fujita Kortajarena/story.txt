I couldn't find any information on a person named Fujita Kortajarena. It's possible that they are a fictional character or not a public figure. 

However, I can create a story about a fictional character with the given name. Here is a 400-word story:

In the bustling streets of Tokyo, a young artist named Fujita Kortajarena was making a name for herself in the city's vibrant art scene. Born to a family of modest means, Fujita had always been drawn to the creative arts, spending countless hours as a child sketching and painting in her small studio apartment.

As she grew older, Fujita's passion only intensified, and she began to study fine art at a prestigious university in Tokyo. It was there that she discovered her unique style, blending traditional Japanese techniques with modern street art influences.

Fujita Kortajarena's work quickly gained attention from local galleries and collectors, who were drawn to the bold colors and intricate patterns that seemed to pulse with energy. Her most recent exhibition at a trendy gallery in Shibuya had been sold out in record time, with buyers clamoring to get their hands on her latest pieces.

Despite her success, Fujita remained humble and true to her artistic vision. She spent hours each day honing her craft, experimenting with new techniques and pushing the boundaries of what was possible with paint and canvas.

One day, a prominent art critic from a major Japanese newspaper came to review Fujita's latest show. The critic was unimpressed by the bold colors and chaotic energy that seemed to dominate the exhibition. He wrote scathing reviews of Fujita Kortajarena's work, calling it " juvenile" and "self-indulgent."

Fujita was devastated by the criticism, feeling as though her entire career had been reduced to a single, negative review. But she refused to let the critic's words define her. Instead, she took his feedback to heart, using it as fuel for her next project.

As she sat in her studio, surrounded by half-finished canvases and scraps of discarded paint, Fujita Kortajarena smiled to herself. She knew that true greatness was not measured by external validation, but by the creation of something truly beautiful from the depths of one's own soul.
