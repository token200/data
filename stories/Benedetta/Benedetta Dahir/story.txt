As an intrepid traveler and photographer, she had always been drawn to the exotic and unknown. Born in Rome, Benedetta Dahir had spent years exploring the world's most fascinating destinations, capturing their essence through her lens.

As she wandered through the narrow alleys of the medina, Benedetta Dahir's camera hung around her neck, ready to snap a moment of magic. She was on a mission to capture the perfect shot of the ancient Bahia Palace, its intricate tiles and carved woodwork gleaming in the sunlight.
