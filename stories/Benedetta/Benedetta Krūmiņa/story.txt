Benedetta Krūmiņa stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any signs of life. The once-thriving port town was now a shadow of its former self, a relic of a bygone era. Benedetta, or Betta as she was known to those who knew her, had returned to her hometown after many years away.

As she made her way through the empty streets, memories came flooding back. The smell of saltwater and fish, the sound of seagulls crying overhead, the feel of sand between her toes. Benedetta's thoughts were interrupted by the soft chime of a bicycle bell. She turned to see a young woman, no more than twenty years old, pedaling towards her.

"Hey, you must be Betta," the girl said with a smile. "I've heard so much about you."

Benedetta nodded, intrigued. The girl introduced herself as Lieve, and the two set off on a journey through the town's crumbling streets. They passed by the old lighthouse, its once-majestic presence now diminished by years of disuse.

As they walked, Lieve asked Benedetta about her life in the city. Betta told tales of her work as a historian, uncovering secrets and piecing together the stories of those who had come before. But there was something missing – a sense of connection to this place that had shaped her so profoundly.

Lieve listened intently, nodding along as Betta spoke. "You know, my grandmother used to tell me stories about this town too," she said. "She said it was a place where time stood still."

Benedetta smiled wistfully. "That's exactly what I've always loved about it," she replied. "The feeling of being suspended between past and present."

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the town, Benedetta and Lieve found themselves at the edge of the sea. They stood in silence for a moment, watching as the waves rolled in.

Benedetta felt a sense of peace wash over her. Being back in Krūmiņa was like coming home – not to a place she knew well, but to a part of herself that had been waiting patiently all these years.
