Benedetta Wiśniewski was a 25-year-old freelance writer who had always been fascinated by the world of mythology and folklore. Growing up in a small town in Poland, she spent most of her childhood listening to tales of old gods and goddesses from her grandmother, who would regale her with stories of the Slavic pantheon.

As Benedetta grew older, her interest in mythology only deepened. She began to study the ancient myths and legends of Eastern Europe, devouring books and articles on the subject. Her friends would often tease her about her "nerdy" obsession, but Benedetta didn't care – she was convinced that there was more truth to these stories than most people gave them credit for.

One day, while researching in the local library, Benedetta stumbled upon an ancient manuscript of Polish folk tales. As she flipped through its yellowed pages, she came across a story that seemed to leap off the page at her: the tale of the "Dusznicka Kobieta," or the "Ghost Woman of Dusznik." According to legend, this vengeful spirit haunted a small village in rural Poland, seeking revenge on the living for the death of her lover.

Benedetta was captivated by the story. She spent hours poring over the manuscript, trying to uncover more information about the Dusznicka Kobieta. As she delved deeper into her research, she began to notice strange occurrences around her – doors creaking open on their own, faint whispers in the dead of night.

Convinced that she was onto something, Benedetta set out to investigate further. She spent weeks tracking down local legends and stories about the Dusznicka Kobieta, finally uncovering a trail that led her to a small, rural village deep in the Polish countryside.

There, she met an elderly woman named Agnieszka, who claimed to have lived in the village all her life. Over steaming cups of tea, Agnieszka told Benedetta the stories of old – of how the Dusznicka Kobieta was said to appear only under the light of the full moon, and of how she could be placated with offerings of bread and milk.

Benedetta listened, entranced. She knew that she had stumbled upon something special – a doorway into a world of ancient myths and legends. As she left the village that night, the moon hanging low in the sky, Benedetta felt a sense of excitement and wonder that she had never experienced before. She knew that her life would never be the same again.
