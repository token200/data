Benedetta García Martínez stepped off the crowded bus and onto the bustling streets of Barcelona. As a freelance journalist, she had been traveling for weeks, chasing leads on a story that could make her career. Her eyes scanned the sidewalk, taking in the colorful buildings and lively chatter of passersby.

A sudden pang of hunger struck Benedetta García Martínez, and she ducked into a nearby café to grab a quick bite.

She raised an eyebrow, taking the phone from him, and asked, "What do you want?" The driver smiled, and said, "Let's just say we have a story that needs telling."
