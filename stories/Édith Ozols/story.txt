Édith Ozols was a force to be reckoned with in the world of high-stakes art forgery. Born into a family of modest means, she had always been driven by a fierce desire for success and recognition. As a child, she would spend hours poring over dusty old books in her local library, mesmerized by the works of the Old Masters.

Despite her lack of formal training, Édith's talent was undeniable. She spent years honing her craft, studying everything from brushstrokes to art historical context. Her skills soon caught the attention of some of the most influential collectors and dealers in the world.

Édith's claim to fame came when she created a forgery of a long-lost painting by the French master, Claude Monet. Dubbed "La Rivière de la Nuit," the piece was a stunning recreation of Monet's famous water lily paintings. It quickly sold for a small fortune, and Édith became an overnight sensation.

But as her reputation grew, so did the scrutiny. Art experts and investigators began to sniff around, looking for evidence of her forgeries. Édith knew she had to stay one step ahead if she wanted to maintain her grip on the art world.

She traveled to the farthest reaches of Europe, gathering inspiration from hidden corners and secret collections. Her network of sources and informants allowed her to stay informed about even the most obscure markets. She became a master of deception, able to convincingly pass off her forgeries as genuine masterpieces.

Yet, Édith's success came at a cost. She had few close relationships outside of her art world, and those she did have were often tainted by her reputation for dishonesty. Her relationships with collectors and dealers were transactional, with each side wary of being taken advantage of.

As the years went by, Édith began to feel a twinge of guilt about her work. She knew that she was profiting from the efforts of other artists, who would never have the opportunity to see their creations in public. Her conscience nagged at her, but it was too late for regrets now. She had built a reputation on her skills, and she wasn't about to let anyone or anything take that away.

One day, a mysterious stranger approached Édith with an offer she couldn't refuse: create a forgery of one of the most elusive paintings in history, hidden away from prying eyes for centuries. The catch was that she would have to do it all alone, without her network of sources or informants.

Édith hesitated for a moment before nodding her agreement. This was going to be her biggest challenge yet – and perhaps her final test.
