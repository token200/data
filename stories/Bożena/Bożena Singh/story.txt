Bożena Singh was not your average person. Born to Indian parents in Poland, she had grown up surrounded by the vibrant culture and traditions of her childhood. Her full name, Bożena Katarzyna Singh, reflected the mix of Eastern European and South Asian heritage that made her who she was.

As a young woman, Bożena had always felt like an outsider in both Polish and Indian society. Growing up, she struggled to find her place between two worlds, often feeling torn between the expectations of her parents and those of her peers. But it was this sense of dislocation that ultimately led her to pursue her passion for dance.

With a background in ballet and contemporary movement, Bożena had dreamed of becoming a professional dancer since childhood. And now, at 25, she had finally made it to the top – performing with some of Poland's most esteemed companies while also touring internationally.

Despite her success, Bożena couldn't shake off the feeling that something was missing. She felt like a part of her was still unexplored, waiting to be discovered. And then, one fateful night after a particularly grueling rehearsal, she stumbled upon an old trunk in her attic. Inside, she found a collection of traditional Indian clothing and accessories – saris, bindis, and jewelry that sparkled in the dim light.

As she delved deeper into her family's heritage, Bożena discovered a sense of belonging she had never known before. She began to incorporate elements of Indian dance into her own performances, weaving together the intricate patterns of Bharatanatyam with the fluidity of contemporary movement. It was as if she had finally found the missing piece of herself.

Her full name, Bożena Katarzyna Singh, now held a new significance – not just a reflection of her mixed identity, but a symbol of the journey she had undertaken to find her true voice. And with each step on stage, Bożena felt like she was claiming her place in both worlds, embracing the rich tapestry that made her who she was.
