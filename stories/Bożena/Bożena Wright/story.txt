One sunny afternoon, Bożena Wright decided to take a walk along the nearby riverbank. She breathed in deeply, savoring the sweet scent of blooming flowers and fresh grass. As she strolled, she noticed a young girl sitting alone on a bench, gazing out at the water. Bożena Wright couldn't resist the urge to introduce herself.

"Hello there," Bożena Wright said with a warm smile, "my name is Bożena Wright. I'm an artist. What's yours?"

The girl looked up, startled at first, then smiled shyly. "I-I'm Sophia," she replied.

Bożena Wright sat down beside Sophia and began to sketch the landscape before them. As they talked, Bożena Wright learned that Sophia was a quiet and introspective child who found solace in nature. The two quickly discovered a shared love for art and the beauty of the world around them.

When they finished, Sophia turned to Bożena Wright with tears in her eyes. "Thank you," she said, her voice trembling. "You truly see me."

As she walked away from the riverbank, Bożena Wright couldn't help but feel grateful for the chance encounter with Sophia. It was a moment that had reminded her of the power of connection and creativity in her life.
