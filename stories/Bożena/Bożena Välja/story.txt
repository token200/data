Bożena Välja, a 35-year-old Estonian woman with an infectious laugh and a passion for photography, had always felt like she was meant to be in a foreign land. Growing up on the idyllic island of Saaremaa, surrounded by rolling hills and the Baltic Sea, Bożena's wanderlust had been nurtured from a young age.

After completing her studies in Tallinn, she saved up enough money to embark on a solo journey around Europe. With a worn-out backpack, a camera slung over her shoulder, and a sense of adventure in her heart, Bożena set off to explore the world beyond Estonia.

Years went by, and Bożena's travels took her to hidden corners of Germany, the winding streets of Paris, and the picturesque canals of Amsterdam. With each new destination, she immersed herself in local cultures, trying new foods, attending festivals, and practicing languages that had been etched into her brain through books and language classes.

But it was during a trip to Croatia that Bożena stumbled upon something truly special. As she wandered along the ancient city walls of Dubrovnik, camera in hand, she felt an inexplicable sense of belonging. There was something about the red-tiled roofs, the turquoise sea, and the narrow cobblestone streets that spoke to her very soul.

For a few magical months, Bożena called Dubrovnik home. She spent her days photographing the city's majestic architecture, learning Croatian from the locals, and indulging in fresh seafood feasts at the old port. It was during this time that she fell deeply in love with the place – its people, its food, and even its quirky charm.

Eventually, Bożena made the bittersweet decision to leave Dubrovnik behind and return to her homeland of Estonia. Though she knew it would be a far cry from the Dalmatian coast, she couldn't shake off the feeling that a part of her heart had been left behind in Croatia's walled city.

Back home, Bożena settled into her small apartment, camera at the ready, and began to document the hidden gems of Saaremaa. As she scrolled through her photos, now infused with memories of Dubrovnik, she realized that home was where the heart was – not just in a physical place but also within oneself.

Years later, when Bożena would look out at the Baltic Sea, now gazing upon familiar hills and shores, she'd smile, knowing that the experiences of her travels had enriched her very essence. And as she clicked the shutter on her camera, capturing the intricate textures and colors of Estonia's landscape, she knew that Dubrovnik – though a temporary stop on her journey – would forever be a part of her own story.
