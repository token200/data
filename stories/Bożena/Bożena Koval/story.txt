One day, while wandering through the market, Bożena stumbled upon a small antique shop tucked away on a quiet street. The store's owner, an elderly woman with a kind smile, invited Bożena to take a look around. As she browsed the shelves, Bożena's eyes landed on an old camera with intricate engravings on its body.
