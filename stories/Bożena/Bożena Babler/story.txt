Bożena Babler was a Polish poet known for her vivid and emotive works. Born in 1948, she spent most of her life in Krakow, where the medieval city's winding streets and picturesque squares seemed to seep into her writing.

Her poetry often explored themes of love, loss, and the human condition. With words that danced like the Vistula River at dawn, Bożena wove intricate tales of everyday life, imbued with a deep sense of longing and nostalgia.

One sunny afternoon in June 1967, Bożena sat in her small, cluttered study, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and scraps of paper covered in scribbled lines. She stared at the blank page in front of her, hesitant to put pen to paper once more. The words refused to come, taunting her like a mischievous child.

Suddenly, a faint knock on the door broke the silence. It was her best friend, Justyna. "Bożena, I've brought soup and some fresh bread," she said with a smile. The aroma of simmering vegetables wafted through the air, transporting Bożena to memories of childhood.

As they ate together, Bożena shared her latest frustrations with Justyna – how words seemed to elude her, leaving only empty pages in their wake. Justyna listened attentively, her eyes sparkling with understanding. "Your poetry is like a river," she said gently. "Sometimes it's turbulent, but it always flows."

Bożena felt a lump form in her throat as she gazed out the window at the swaying trees. This was exactly what she needed – a reminder that creativity lay within and around her. Taking a deep breath, she set her pen to paper once more.

This time, words poured onto the page like honey from a golden hive. Lines flowed effortlessly, weaving tales of longing, love, and loss. Bożena felt herself transported to distant lands, meeting characters who whispered secrets in the dead of night.

As Justyna left, carrying the now-empty bowl with her, Bożena gazed upon the words scattered before her. They shimmered like dew on a spider's web – precious, ephemeral, and full of promise. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she read her latest verses aloud to herself.

Bożena Babler knew then that her poetry was not just about expressing emotions but also about finding solace in words themselves. They had set her free, freeing her to soar like the Vistula on a summer's day.
