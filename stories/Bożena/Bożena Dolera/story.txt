Bożena Dolera stood at the edge of the forest, her eyes fixed on the old wooden bench where she had spent countless hours as a child. The sunlight filtering through the trees above cast dappled shadows on the ground, and a gentle breeze rustled the leaves. It was a scene that brought back memories of afternoons spent lost in daydreams and stories.

As a young girl, Bożena would spend hours sitting on this bench, creating worlds with her wild imagination. She'd conjure up tales of brave knights, hidden treasures, and mythical creatures. Her grandmother, Babcia Dolera, would join her on these adventures, regaling Bożena with stories of her own childhood and the struggles she faced during World War II.

Years went by, and life took Bożena in different directions. She grew up to become a successful writer, penning novels that explored the complexities of human relationships and the beauty of the Polish countryside. Her love for storytelling never wavered, but she channeled it into her writing instead of fantasy tales.

One day, as Bożena sat on the bench once again, she felt a sense of nostalgia wash over her. The trees seemed taller, the sun stronger, and the air more vibrant than ever before. It was as if time had slowed down, allowing her to reconnect with the little girl she used to be.

Bożena closed her eyes, letting the memories flood back. She remembered Babcia Dolera's gentle hands, her soothing voice, and the way she'd listen intently to Bożena's stories. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she recalled the joy and freedom of those afternoons spent in the forest.

The sound of rustling leaves snapped Bożena back to reality. A young girl, no more than ten years old, sat down beside her on the bench. She introduced herself as Ola, and Bożena noticed the same spark of imagination in the child's eyes that she had once seen in herself.

Without hesitation, Bożena began to tell Ola a story – one about a brave knight, a hidden treasure, and a magical forest that came alive at night. As they sat on the bench together, lost in their own worlds, Bożena realized that her love for storytelling was not just about writing, but about sharing it with others and passing on the magic of imagination to those who needed it most.
