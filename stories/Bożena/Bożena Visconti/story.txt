Bożena Visconti stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar streets of Verona. As the last living heir of the ancient Visconti dynasty, she had spent most of her life studying the history of her family's rule in Italy.

Born Bożena Visconti di Milano, she had grown up hearing tales of her ancestors' conquests and struggles for power from her wise and aged mother. But it wasn't until she stumbled upon an old, dusty tome hidden away in the castle library that she discovered a dark secret: her family's rise to power was built on bloodshed and betrayal.

Determined to uncover the truth about her family's past, Bożena spent years researching and exploring the city of Verona. She wandered through the narrow streets, taking in the sights and sounds of the medieval town, while keeping an eye out for any clues that might lead her to answers.

One day, as she walked along the banks of the Adige River, she stumbled upon a small, forgotten church. Inside, she found a hidden room containing ancient texts and artifacts from her family's reign. Among them was a letter penned by her great-great-grandfather, Gian Galeazzo Visconti, detailing his plans for conquest.

Bożena's eyes widened as she read the words, feeling a mix of emotions: shame, anger, and sadness. She realized that her entire life had been built on a foundation of deceit and violence, and that it was time to break free from the legacy of her family's dark past.

As she closed the letter, Bożena felt a sense of purpose wash over her. She knew that she couldn't change the course of history, but she could start anew, forging a path that would honor her family's name without perpetuating their wrongdoings. And so, with a newfound sense of determination, Bożena Visconti set out to build a future that was hers alone, one that would leave behind the shadows of her ancestors' legacy.
