A young and ambitious artist, Bożena had always been drawn to the city's vibrant streets, where she would spend hours sketching and capturing the essence of its eclectic neighborhoods.

One fateful evening, while exploring a quaint alleyway in the heart of Krakow, Poland, Bożena stumbled upon an old, mysterious-looking piano.
