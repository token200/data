As a child, she would spend hours listening to her grandmother play the fiddle, mesmerized by the lively tunes. Now, at 25, Bożena had become an accomplished musician herself, playing the violin with precision and emotion.

One evening, as Bożena Maier walked along the main street of Zakopane, she stumbled upon a local music festival in full swing.

As the night drew to a close, the festival organizers approached Bożena with an offer she couldn't refuse - to become the official musician for the upcoming Krakow Folk Festival. With tears in her eyes, Bożena accepted the challenge, knowing that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to share her passion with the world.
