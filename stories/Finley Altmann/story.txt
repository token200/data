Finley Altmann stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of familiarity. He had been on the move for weeks, dodging questions from the authorities and trying to shake off the memories that haunted him.

It was a chilly autumn morning in Berlin, the kind of day where the wind whipped through the streets and the smell of coffee wafted from the cafes. Finley breathed it all in, feeling a sense of detachment wash over him. He had always been a wanderer, never staying in one place for too long.

As he made his way through the station, Finley spotted a small café tucked away in a corner. The sign above the door read "Kaffee und Literatur", and something about it drew him in. He pushed open the door and stepped inside, the warm glow of the café enveloping him like a hug.

The barista, a bright-eyed young woman with a pierced nose, looked up from behind the counter and smiled. "Willkommen, Sie wissen?" she asked, her German thick but understandable to Finley's ears.

"Ja," he replied, his own accent slightly laced with American inflections. He took a seat at the small table by the window and ordered a coffee in fluent German.

As he sipped his coffee, Finley noticed an old man sitting at the next table over, typing away on his laptop. There was something about him that caught Finley's attention – perhaps it was the way he seemed to be scribbling notes in the margins of his own writing, or the look of concentration etched on his face.

When the old man finally looked up, their eyes met across the table. "Sorry," Finley said with a sheepish grin. "I'm a bit of a stranger here."

The old man smiled back at him, his eyes twinkling with amusement. "Ah, you're not from around here," he observed. "But that's okay. We all have our secrets."

Finley raised an eyebrow. There was something about this old man that put him at ease – perhaps it was the way they both seemed to be hiding behind masks of their own.

For a few hours, Finley and the old man talked about everything and nothing, sharing stories and laughter like old friends. And as he left the café with his coffee cup still in hand, Finley felt a sense of belonging wash over him for the first time in months.

Perhaps it was just a fleeting moment, but for that one day at least, Finley felt like he belonged somewhere.
