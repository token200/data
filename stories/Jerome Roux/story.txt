Jerome Roux was a man shrouded in mystery, his past a tangled web of secrets and half-truths. He moved through the world with an air of quiet confidence, his piercing green eyes seeming to see right through you.

As a former detective, Jerome had spent years honing his skills on the mean streets of New Orleans. He'd seen it all – from gruesome murders to petty thefts – and yet he still managed to keep a level head. That was until the night he received a cryptic message that would change everything.

The note was typed on plain white paper, with only two words scrawled in red ink: "Echoes Remain." Jerome's gut told him it was more than just a prank or a wild goose chase – this was something real. Something worth investigating.

He set out into the darkening city, following a trail of clues that led him from the French Quarter to the outskirts of town. As he walked, the shadows seemed to grow longer and darker, like skeletal fingers reaching out to snatch him back.

At last, Jerome arrived at an abandoned warehouse on the riverfront. The building loomed above him, its windows boarded up and its door covered in rusty chains. He produced a key from his pocket – one that he'd managed to scrounge up from an old acquaintance – and unlocked the creaking door.

 Inside, the air was thick with dust and decay. Jerome coughed as he stepped further into the warehouse, his eyes adjusting slowly to the dim light. That's when he saw it: a series of mirrors arranged around the room, each one reflecting a different image of himself.

Jerome felt a shiver run down his spine as he approached the nearest mirror. He gazed at the reflection staring back at him – the worn face with eyes that seemed to hold a thousand midnights. It was almost...familiar. Yet, somehow, it didn't quite feel like himself.

The further he explored the warehouse, the more Jerome began to realize that each of the mirrors showed a different version of his past. He saw himself as a young cop, full of idealism and fire; he saw himself as an older man, worn down by the weight of years.

And at the center of it all, the mirrors seemed to be pointing to one final image: Jerome standing before a city that was being consumed by darkness. The shadows crept across his face like living things, twisting and writhing in agony.

As the truth dawned on him, Jerome felt a crushing weight settle upon his shoulders. He realized that he'd been playing both sides – the light and the dark – all along. And now, it seemed that the darkness was winning.

The echoes remained, whispering secrets in his ear as the city around him descended into chaos. In that moment, Jerome Roux knew that he was no longer a detective, but a reflection of the very shadows he'd once hunted.
