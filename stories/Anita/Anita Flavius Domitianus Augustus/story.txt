In the scorching desert sun, Anita Flavius Domitianus Augustus trudged through the sand, her eyes fixed on the distant oasis. She was a wanderer, a nomad with no fixed abode, but a heart full of hope. Her parents had been soldiers, and she had grown up listening to tales of their bravery and conquests.

As she walked, Anita's thoughts turned to her past life. Born into a family of modest means, she had always felt like an outsider. But when she discovered her latent talent for sword fighting, she knew she was meant for something more. She spent years honing her skills, traveling from town to town, taking on whatever work she could find.

Anita's nomadic lifestyle had its drawbacks, however. She had few friends and no family ties to speak of. But she didn't need anyone else; she was content with her own company. Her only companions were the stars at night and the vast expanse of sand beneath her feet.

As she crested a dune, Anita spotted the oasis in the distance. A tiny cluster of palms surrounded a small pool of water, reflecting the sun's bright light like a mirror. She quickened her pace, feeling a surge of excitement course through her veins.

For a moment, Anita Flavius Domitianus Augustus forgot about her hardships and let herself revel in the beauty before her. The oasis seemed like a slice of paradise, a haven from the harsh desert world she called home.

As she approached the pool's edge, Anita noticed a figure sitting on a rock nearby. It was an old man with wispy hair and a kind face. He beckoned to her, inviting her to join him by the water. Anita hesitated for a moment before sitting down, feeling an inexplicable sense of belonging.

The old man introduced himself as Kanaq, a fellow traveler who had lived in many lands. Together, they sipped from the pool's edge, watching the stars twinkle to life above. For the first time in years, Anita felt like she was home.
