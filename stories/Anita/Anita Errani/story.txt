As a renowned music critic, she had spent years honing her craft, pouring over the work of countless artists, from the iconic jazz legends of the 1920s to the avant-garde musicians of the modern era.

Her eyes wandered over the shelves, taking in the eclectic collection of vinyl and CDs that lined them.
