Anita Jie was a free-spirited artist who lived life on her own terms. Born and raised in the vibrant city of Tokyo, Japan, she had always been drawn to the eclectic and unknown. Her bright pink hair and eclectic wardrobe were just a few reflections of her adventurous personality.

As an art student at the prestigious Tokyo Art University, Anita Jie had honed her skills as a painter, sculptor, and printmaker. She was particularly fascinated by the works of Japanese master artists such as Hokusai and Utamaro, who inspired her to experiment with bold colors and striking compositions.
