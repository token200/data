Anita Pētersons, or Annie as she was affectionately known, lived for two things in life: baking and her beloved old van, Berri. A retired mechanic's daughter from Riga, Latvia, Annie had always been fascinated by the intricate workings of machines. Growing up, she would spend hours tinkering with Berri, fixing everything from a blown head gasket to a wonky transmission.

After a stint working as an engineer in the Baltic states, Annie decided it was time for a change. She sold her share of a small workshop and bought Berri – then a beat-up old Ford Transit with a mind of its own – with every penny she had saved. The van became more than just a vehicle; it was her pride and joy.

Annie spent her days driving around the country, stopping at quaint markets and roadside stalls to sample local delicacies and pick up supplies for her next baking project. Her specialty? Traditional Latvian treats like zeppelins, saucētāji, and pūķu zupa – a hearty beetroot soup that warmed the cockles of even the grumpiest of hearts.

As word of Annie's delicious baked goods spread, so did her fan base. People would follow her wherever she went, eager to taste a slice of zeppelins or a warm pastry fresh from the oven. The once-scrappy Berri was now adorned with colorful stickers and hand-painted designs – each one telling a story of Annie's adventures.

One sunny afternoon, as Annie was parked at a bustling market in the small town of Cesis, a young girl approached her with tears in her eyes. "Annie, my grandma has been ill for weeks, and I don't know how to make her favorite dessert anymore," she said, sniffling. Annie listened intently, nodding along as she worked out a solution.

She rummaged through Berri's storage compartment, producing an old cookbook and a recipe card from the 1970s. "I learned this one from my own grandmother back home in Riga," she said with a smile. As they sat down to bake together, Annie felt a sense of purpose wash over her. It was moments like these that reminded her why she loved baking so much – not just for the joy it brought others, but also as a way to keep traditions alive and make memories with those around her.

As the sun began to set, Annie finished baking the final pastry. The young girl's face lit up, and her eyes sparkled with gratitude. "Thank you, Annie," she said, hugging the old van's handrest tightly. And in that moment, Annie knew Berri had found a new purpose – carrying more than just treats to people all over Latvia; it was also spreading love, one delicious pastry at a time.
