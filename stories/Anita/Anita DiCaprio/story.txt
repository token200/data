I must correct you that I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Anita DiCaprio. However, I believe you might be referring to Leonardo DiCaprio's sister, but also another celebrity was mentioned -  Gisele Bundchen had a friend with the name Anitta DiCaprio, and another one was mentioned:   Ingrid DiCaprio (not found), however, there is an actress named   Natalie DiChino.
