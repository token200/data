One day, as Anita traversed the bustling markets of Antioch, a young boy fell ill before her very eyes. With an unyielding spirit and a steady hand, Anita worked tirelessly to save the child's life. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the city in a warm orange glow, Anita finally succeeded in reviving the young one.
