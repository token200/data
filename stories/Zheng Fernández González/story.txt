I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Zheng Fernández González. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created recently.

However, I can suggest some alternatives:

1. If you provide me with more context or information about the character, I can try to create a story around them.
2. If you'd like, I can generate a random character profile and then write a short story based on that character.
3. Alternatively, I can ask you for some details about the character's background, personality, and traits, and then write a story incorporating those elements.

Let me know which option you prefer, and I'll do my best to assist you!
