Joseph Kask was a man consumed by bureaucracy. His life revolved around the tedious world of paperwork and administrative red tape. As a low-level clerk in a large corporation, he spent most of his days staring at spreadsheets and attending pointless meetings.

Despite his mundane job, Joseph had big dreams. He longed to break free from the monotony of his daily routine and make a real difference in the world. But every time he tried to take a chance, he was held back by the suffocating grip of bureaucracy.

One day, Joseph received a mysterious letter that read: "Your case will be decided on a Wednesday at 3 PM." He had no idea what it meant or who had sent it, but something about it sparked a sense of excitement and trepidation within him. Was this his chance to escape the drudgery of his life?

As the day of the mysterious letter approached, Joseph found himself becoming increasingly agitated. Who was behind this enigmatic message, and what did they want from him? He couldn't shake the feeling that his entire existence hung in the balance.

On Wednesday at 3 PM, Joseph arrived at a nondescript building, his heart racing with anticipation. He was greeted by an unseen figure who led him to a cramped room filled with rows of dusty files and flickering fluorescent lights. As he waited for what felt like an eternity, a low hum began to emanate from the shadows.

Suddenly, a voice spoke out of thin air: "Joseph Kask, your case is hereby dismissed...with further review." The words hung in the air like a weight, leaving Joseph feeling both relieved and bewildered. As he stumbled out of the room, he realized that this was only the beginning – not the end.

The mysterious figure reappeared, handing him a small folder with a cryptic message scrawled on its cover: "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone." Joseph's heart skipped a beat as he took the folder, his mind racing with possibilities. Who was behind this? And what did they want from him next?

For the first time in years, Joseph Kask felt alive – or at least, more alive than he had in a long time.
