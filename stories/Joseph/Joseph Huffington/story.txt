I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Joseph Huffington. It's possible that you meant to ask about a different person or character.

However, I did find information on Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., an American naval aviator and politician who was involved in the development of Social Security, but this is not a well-known historical figure.

On the other hand, Joseph Pulitzer was a Hungarian-born journalist and publisher who was known for his philanthropic efforts, particularly through his work with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. He is also famous for establishing the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 1918.

If you're looking for information on a different character, could you please provide more context or details about Joseph Huffington?
