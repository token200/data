Joseph Trevisan was a man with a mysterious past. He stood at around 6 feet tall, with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair that fell to his shoulders. His features were sharp, chiseled by years of hard labor and hardship.

As a young boy, Joseph had grown up on the streets of Rome, surviving by his wits and his fists. He had quickly learned how to fend for himself, but deep down, he knew he deserved more. When he turned 18, he enlisted in the Italian army, hoping to find purpose and belonging.

However, it was during his time in the military that Joseph discovered a strange gift – he could heal wounds with just a touch of his hand. It started as a whisper of doubt from his comrades, but soon spread like wildfire through the ranks. People would bring him their injuries, and he'd take them in his arms, feeling an inexplicable energy flow through his body.

Joseph kept this ability hidden for years, using it to help those in need, always one step ahead of prying eyes. But when a life-or-death mission went wrong, and Joseph was left with a crippling injury, he realized that his gift could be the key to redemption.

After leaving the military, Joseph dedicated himself to helping others. He became a wandering healer, traveling from town to town, using his powers to mend wounds, ease pain, and bring hope to those who had lost it. His reputation grew, as did his legend. People whispered about the 'Angel of Rome', the mysterious figure with the green eyes and healing hands.

But Joseph knew that there was more to him than just a gift. He had a fire burning within, a drive to make amends for past mistakes. As he traveled from village to village, he sought out those who had been wronged by the system – the oppressed, the marginalized, and the downtrodden. Using his powers, he worked tirelessly to right the balance of justice.

Years went by, and Joseph's legend grew. But with great power comes great responsibility, and soon, those who feared his abilities began to hunt him down. Would Joseph continue on his path, using his gift for good or would he be silenced forever? Only time would tell.
