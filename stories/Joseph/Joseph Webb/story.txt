Joseph Webb stepped out of his small, cluttered office and into the sweltering summer air. As a private investigator in the bustling city of New Haven, he was no stranger to the scorching heat that seemed to suffocate the streets every July.

As he walked down the sidewalk, Joseph's mind wandered back to the case that had brought him out of his office earlier that day - a missing persons inquiry for Emily Wilson, the 19-year-old daughter of a prominent local businessman. Her parents had been frantic with worry, and the police were stumped.

Joseph quickened his pace as he spotted a familiar figure waiting for him outside the local diner. It was Sarah Jenkins, a sassy waitress who seemed to know everything that went on in New Haven's seedy underbelly. She flashed Joseph a knowing smile as he approached.

"Hey, Joe! I got some info for you," she said, slipping into the booth beside him. "I heard Emily was last seen arguing with a guy named Alex over at the local bar, The Red Lion."

Joseph's ears perked up. This could be their first real lead in the case. He jotted down some notes on his pad as Sarah continued to chat.

"Word is, Alex has a history of trouble. The cops have been sniffing around him for weeks, but they can't pin anything on him."

Joseph thanked Sarah and headed back into his office to dig up more information on Alex. After a few hours of digging through old case files and making some phone calls, he finally got his break.

As the sun began to set outside, Joseph received a call from an unknown number. It was Alex himself, and he claimed to know where Emily was hiding. But as soon as Joseph hung up the phone, something didn't feel right.

He glanced out the window to see Sarah walking away from The Red Lion, her eyes darting nervously back and forth as if she were being watched. Suddenly, Joseph's instincts kicked in. He felt like he was missing a crucial piece of evidence - and that it might be hidden right under his nose.
