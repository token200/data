Joseph Põld was a man shrouded in mystery, his past whispered about in hushed tones among the Estonian community. Few knew much about him, except that he had an uncanny ability to fix anything mechanical, from bicycles to tractors.

One day, a young girl named Liina approached Joseph with her broken-down bicycle. She explained that she couldn't afford to take it to the mechanic in town and begged Joseph to help her out. As they sat together on the grassy field, watching the sun set behind the trees, Joseph revealed his true nature - not just a handyman, but a guardian of sorts.

He had been watching over Liina's family for years, discreetly helping them when they needed it most. His services were never asked for, nor did he ever charge for his work. It was as if Joseph Põld had taken an oath to protect those in need.

As the days passed, more and more people came knocking on Joseph's door, seeking assistance with their broken items. There was the farmer whose tractor broke down during the harvest season; the elderly woman who needed help fixing her wheel chair; even the local priest who required a replacement for his church's bellows.

Each time, Joseph would appear at the doorstep, toolbox in hand, ready to lend a helping hand. He worked tirelessly day and night, never complaining or asking for anything in return. His reputation grew, but so did his isolation. Few dared approach him directly, fearing he might disappear into thin air if they asked too many questions.

Despite this, Liina remained by Joseph's side, watching as he fixed everything from leaky faucets to faulty farm equipment. She saw the love and care in his eyes when he worked, and she knew that beneath his gruff exterior lay a heart of gold. As the sun set on another day, Joseph Põld would smile, knowing that there was still much work to be done for those who needed it most.
