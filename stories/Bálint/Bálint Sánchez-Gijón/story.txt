He was fascinated by the history and traditions of Spain, and it eventually became clear that this aspect of his heritage would play a significant role in his life.

As he grew older, Bálint became increasingly involved in his community. He started volunteering at local Spanish-language schools, where he taught young children about their cultural roots. His passion for education and social justice earned him recognition within the community, and soon he was approached by local activists to help with various projects.

One day, Bálint was approached by a prominent publisher who wanted him to write a book about his experiences growing up Spanish in America. The project was a labor of love for Bálint Sánchez-Gijón, and he threw himself into it with dedication and passion.
