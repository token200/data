Bálint Jørgensen stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. It was a typical Friday evening in Copenhagen, with students and professionals alike gathered to unwind after a long week. Bálint, or Bal as he liked to be called, had just finished a meeting with his friends at the university's student union and was looking forward to some much-needed socializing.

As he waited for his order, Bal spotted an old friend from high school sitting in the corner, sipping on a coffee. He made his way over, flashing a warm smile as he approached. "Hey, Andreas! Long time no see!"

Andreas looked up, surprised by the sudden interruption, but quickly broke into a wide grin. "Bal! It's been ages. How've you been?"

The two friends chatted for a bit, catching up on each other's lives and sharing stories from their respective careers. Bal had always dreamed of becoming a journalist, and was currently working as a freelance writer. Andreas, on the other hand, was studying to be a lawyer.

As they talked, Bal noticed a group of young people gathered around a table in the center of the room, enthusiastically discussing something. His curiosity piqued, he wandered over to join them. It turned out that they were students from his university's creative writing program, working on their first novel together. Bal was immediately drawn into their conversation, sharing his own experiences as a writer and offering words of encouragement.

After a while, the group invited him to join in, and Bal gladly accepted. He spent the next hour bouncing ideas off the other writers, sharing his expertise and learning from theirs. It was moments like these that reminded him why he loved being a part of this community – the passion, the creativity, and the support.

As the night wore on, Bal bid farewell to his new friends and made his way back to Andreas. "Thanks for meeting up tonight," he said, clapping his friend on the back. "It's been just what I needed."

Andreas smiled, nodding in agreement. "Anytime, Bal. We'll catch up again soon."
