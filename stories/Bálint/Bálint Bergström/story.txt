Bálint Bergström stepped out of the rain and into the cozy pub, shaking the water from his coat. As he made his way to the bar, he was greeted by the familiar face of Olga, the bartender.

"Ah, Bálint Bergström, always a pleasure to see you," she said with a warm smile. "What can I get for you tonight?"

Bálint took a seat at the counter and ordered a whiskey on the rocks. As he waited for his drink to arrive, he noticed a young woman sitting alone at a table by the window.

"Who's that?" Bálint asked Olga, nodding towards the mysterious woman.

Olga followed his gaze and raised an eyebrow. "That's Éva, our new waitress. She just started working here last night."

Bálint watched as Éva took a sip of her own drink, looking around the pub with a mixture of curiosity and unease. He couldn't help but feel drawn to her, despite not knowing much about her.

Just then, Éva caught his eye and smiled faintly. Bálint felt a spark of connection, and he found himself getting up from his seat to walk over to her table.

"Mind if I join you?" he asked, taking a seat across from her.

Éva looked surprised but nodded, and they began to chat. As the night wore on, Bálint learned that Éva was new to town, having just moved from Budapest with no job lined up.

Bálint listened intently as she shared her story, feeling a sense of solidarity with this stranger. He told her about his own life, about working as a writer and struggling to make ends meet.

As the hours passed, their conversation flowed easily, and Bálint found himself falling for Éva's quick wit and infectious laugh. By the time he left the pub, he knew that he had to see her again.

The next day, Bálint stopped by the café where Éva worked, hoping to catch a glimpse of her. As he waited in line, he spotted her expertly juggling multiple tables at once.

When it was his turn to order, Bálint asked for a cup of coffee and struck up a conversation with Éva as she handed him his drink. He learned that she was planning to try her hand at writing poetry, inspired by the works of János Bihari.

Bálint beamed with pride, knowing that he had already found someone who shared his passion for words. As they exchanged numbers and made plans to meet up again, he couldn't help but think that this chance encounter might just lead to something special in Éva's life – and perhaps even in his own as Bálint Bergström.
