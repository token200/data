Bálint Farah stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, his eyes scanning the rooftops for any signs of movement. A former detective turned private investigator, he had a reputation for being one of the best in the business. His latest client, a young socialite named Sophia, had hired him to investigate her sister's disappearance.

Bálint's thoughts drifted back to the case that had led him to take this job. His own sister, Éva, had vanished under mysterious circumstances six months ago. The police had given up on the case, but Bálint was determined to find out what had happened to her.

He adjusted his watch and checked his phone for any new messages from Sophia. A text from her assistant arrived, confirming that she would meet him at the agreed location in an hour. Bálint nodded to himself, mentally preparing for the meeting.

As he walked into the café, Sophia was already seated at a table by the window, sipping on a cup of coffee. She looked nervous, fidgeting with her hands as she greeted Bálint. He smiled sympathetically and sat down across from her, pulling out his notebook and pen.

"So, Miss...?" he began, glancing at Sophia's file.

"Kovács," she replied, her voice barely above a whisper. "Liliana Kovács. My sister Liliana was supposed to meet me here last night. She never showed up, and I'm starting to get really worried."

Bálint nodded attentively as Sophia spoke, his mind racing with possibilities. He jotted down some notes in his book and asked a few questions, trying to get a sense of what had happened.

As they chatted, Bálint's thoughts drifted back to Éva again. He knew that he couldn't let his personal feelings cloud his judgment, but he also knew that the past was going to be a factor in this case. The connections between his own sister's disappearance and Liliana Kovács' vanished life were too eerily similar.

Bálint pushed the thoughts aside, focusing on Sophia's words. He promised her that he would do everything in his power to find out what had happened to Liliana and vowed to leave no stone unturned.

With a renewed sense of determination, Bálint left the café, ready to face whatever lay ahead. This was going to be a tough case, but with his years of experience and skill as a detective, he was confident that he would uncover the truth behind Liliana's disappearance.
