Bálint Korolev was a man shrouded in mystery. As the sole survivor of a notorious assassination attempt, he had been left with more questions than answers. The memories of that fateful night still haunted him - the sound of gunfire, the feeling of being pushed off a rooftop, and the sight of his would-be assassins fleeing into the darkness.

Despite his ordeal, Bálint Korolev had managed to pick himself up, dust himself off, and begin anew. He moved from place to place, never staying in one spot for too long, always keeping a watchful eye out for potential threats. His past was a constant source of unease, but he refused to let it define him.

As he walked down the crowded streets of Tokyo, Bálint Korolev couldn't help but feel like an outsider. He stuck out like a sore thumb, his dark hair and piercing blue eyes making him stand apart from the sea of faces around him. People seemed to be constantly watching him, their eyes lingering on him for just a moment too long.

Bálint Korolev felt like he was living in a perpetual state of limbo, caught between two worlds. He had no real family, no real friends, and no real home. All he had was his own wits and his determination to survive.

As he turned a corner, Bálint Korolev spotted a small café tucked away in a quiet alleyway. He pushed open the door and stepped inside, grateful for the respite from the hustle and bustle of the city outside. The barista looked up at him with a friendly smile, and for a moment, Bálint Korolev felt like he belonged.

For a brief instant, the memories of his past receded into the background, and all that was left was the present. He ordered a cup of coffee and sat down at a small table by the window, watching as the world outside continued to spin without him. In that moment, Bálint Korolev felt almost normal, like he could finally put the pieces of his shattered life back together. But as he took a sip of his coffee, reality snapped back into place, and he was left once again with more questions than answers.
