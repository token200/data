As Bálint's fame grew, so did his appreciation for the quiet life of a small town baker. He found joy in returning to his family's bakery every evening, surrounded by the warm scent of bread and the love of his family. For Bálint García Fernández, success was not just about achieving artistic recognition but also about staying true to himself and the world around him.
