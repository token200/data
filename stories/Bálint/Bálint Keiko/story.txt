Bálint Keiko stepped into the small café on the outskirts of town, her eyes scanning the dimly lit room for a familiar face. It had been months since she'd last set foot in this place, and yet, it still felt like home. She spotted him sitting at a corner table, nursing a cup of coffee, his dark hair perfectly messy.

Bálint Keiko smiled to herself as she made her way over to him. She took a seat across from him, ordering a cup of tea as he raised an eyebrow in greeting. "Long time no see," he said, his Hungarian accent still music to her ears.

The two had met on a whim during one of Bálint Keiko's travels abroad, bonding over their shared love of literature and poetry. Over the years, they'd lost touch, but the connection remained strong. They talked for hours, reminiscing about old times and sharing stories of new adventures.

As they sipped their drinks, Bálint Keiko mentioned a friend who'd recently moved to Berlin – a fellow writer, struggling to find his voice in the city's bustling literary scene. Her friend was convinced that he needed to take a leap of faith, join a writing group, and start putting himself out there. Bálint Keiko nodded thoughtfully, remembering her own struggles with self-doubt.

Their conversation meandered through topics both serious and light-hearted, with Bálint Keiko laughing so hard she nearly snorted her tea out her nose. As the sun began to set outside, casting a warm glow over the café, they delved into more introspective territory. The quiet moments were when Bálint Keiko felt most at home – surrounded by good books, great company, and the comforting familiarity of their shared experiences.

As she prepared to leave, Bálint Keiko reached out, grasping his hand in a gentle gesture of solidarity. "Thanks for listening," she said softly. Her friend smiled back, the creases around his eyes deepening with warmth. "Anytime, Kéki," he replied, using her diminutive form of address.
