Bálint Nowak stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the small station in front of him. He had been traveling for days, and the thought of finally reaching his destination was almost overwhelming. As a young historian, Bálint had spent years researching the lives of 19th-century Hungarian nobles, but he had always felt like there was something missing. A sense of connection to the people he was studying, a sense of understanding that went beyond dusty old texts and photographs.

As he made his way through the station, Bálint noticed a small café tucked away in a corner. He pushed open the door and stepped inside, the warm aroma of coffee and pastries enveloping him. The barista looked up as he approached, a friendly smile spreading across her face.

"Welcome to Café Rézkovics," she said, taking his order with ease. "What can I get for you?"

Bálint smiled back, feeling a sense of relief wash over him. This was it – this was the start of something new, something exciting. He ordered a coffee and took a seat at a small table by the window, watching as people bustled in and out of the station.

Just then, a figure appeared outside the café, walking towards him with a purposeful stride. Bálint's heart skipped a beat as he recognized the man – it was Dr. Szabó, one of his professors at the university. They had met briefly on several occasions, but Bálint had never really talked to him, content instead to watch from afar.

Dr. Szabó walked into the café and spotted Bálint, a hint of a smile playing on his lips. "Bálint Nowak," he said, extending a hand. "I'm so glad I found you."

Bálint took the professor's hand, feeling a jolt of excitement run through him. This was it – this was the moment he had been waiting for. He pulled out his notebook and began to scribble down notes as they talked, ideas flowing freely from one mind to another.

As the conversation drew to a close, Dr. Szabó patted Bálint on the back. "You have a gift, young man," he said. "A gift for understanding people, for finding the human in history."

Bálint smiled, feeling a sense of pride and purpose wash over him. He knew that this was just the beginning – that with Dr. Szabó's guidance, he would uncover secrets and stories that had been hidden for centuries.
