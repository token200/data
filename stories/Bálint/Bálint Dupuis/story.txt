Bálint Dupuis stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the desolate landscape. He had been away for three years, sent to this small town in rural Hungary to escape the memories that haunted him back home.

As a child, Bálint had grown up in a tight-knit community where everyone knew each other's business. But when his family was torn apart by tragedy, he became withdrawn and isolated. His parents were killed in a fire, and his younger sister was left with severe burns. The incident left Bálint feeling guilty, like it was all his fault.

He had always felt like an outsider among his own people. He tried to hide behind his bookish nature and intellectual pursuits, but the pain of his past lingered, refusing to be buried.

As he walked through the town, Bálint noticed the quiet desperation that seemed to permeate every corner. The residents were all struggling, their faces etched with worry lines and weary eyes. He felt a pang of recognition; he knew how it felt to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders.

Bálint made his way to the local café, where he had arranged to meet an old acquaintance named László. The man was an enigma, with a quick wit and a silver tongue that could charm even the grumpiest of souls. Over coffee, László listened intently as Bálint shared his story, nodding sympathetically.

"You've been away for three years," László said, his voice low and measured. "But I can see it in your eyes; you're still carrying the weight of your past. It's time to let go, Bálint."

Bálint looked at him, searching for answers. But László just smiled and leaned forward, his elbows on the table.

"I'm telling you a secret," he whispered. "Your parents didn't die in that fire because it was their fault. They died because they loved you too much. You were their everything."

Bálint felt a lump form in his throat as tears pricked at the corners of his eyes. He had never considered this before; he thought he was alone in carrying the guilt. László's words brought a wave of understanding, washing over him like a balm.

For the first time in three years, Bálint felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, he could learn to forgive himself and move forward.
