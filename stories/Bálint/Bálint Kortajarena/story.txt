Bálint Kortajarena stepped out of the foggy Budapest streets and into the grand foyer of his family's ancient mansion. The soft chime of the grandfather clock echoed through the halls as he made his way to the study, where his father waited with a glass of fine scotch in hand.

"It's time, Bálint," his father said, his eyes twinkling behind wire-rimmed spectacles. "The family business requires your attention."

Bálint poured himself a glass and took a seat beside his father, running a hand through his unruly dark hair. He had always been more interested in the art of woodworking than the cutthroat world of Kortajarena Enterprises, but it seemed fate had other plans.

Their ancestors had built the family's success on the backs of Hungarian farmers, supplying them with exquisite furniture and textiles. But times had changed, and Bálint's generation was expected to adapt – or risk losing everything.

As they sipped their drinks in silence, the sound of piano music drifted from upstairs, where his younger sister, Zsófi, was practicing Chopin's nocturnes. She had a gift for music that rivaled his own love of woodworking, but Bálint knew her talents lay elsewhere – in the world of art and performance.

The door creaked open, and his mother walked in with an elegant smile. "Dinner is ready," she announced, ushering them towards the dining room. Their parents had long since passed on, leaving behind a legacy that required careful management.

Bálint's thoughts turned to his sister's recent departure for Vienna, where she hoped to establish herself as a professional dancer. He couldn't help but wonder if he'd follow in her footsteps one day – or forge his own path, using the skills he'd learned from their family's artisans.

As they sat down to dinner, Bálint felt a sense of restlessness stir within him. He knew that he would inherit his father's position as CEO one day, but it was a burden he wasn't sure he was ready to bear.

The night wore on, filled with lively conversation and laughter. As the clock struck midnight, Zsófi appeared in the doorway, her eyes shining with excitement. "Bálint, I have an idea – let's create something new together. Something that combines art and music, using the family's legacy as a starting point."

A spark ignited within him, and he knew, in that moment, that his journey was far from over.
