Rihards Pelz trudged through the snow-covered streets of Tallinn, Estonia, his heavy boots sinking into the drifts. As a young detective with the Estonian Police and Border Guard Board, he had seen his fair share of corruption and crime, but nothing could have prepared him for the case that was about to land on his desk.

It started with a cryptic phone call from an anonymous source, hinting at a high-stakes embezzlement scheme involving some of Tallinn's most influential businessmen. The caller had promised Rihards evidence, but only if he agreed to meet in person. The detective's gut told him this was big, and he couldn't afford to ignore it.

As he made his way to the agreed-upon location, a dingy cafe on the outskirts of town, Rihards' mind replayed the usual suspects: there were always plenty of people with fingers in every pie, but how did you separate the fact from fiction? He took a deep breath and pushed open the door, scanning the room for his mysterious informant.

Inside, he spotted a hooded figure hunched over a table, sipping on a cup of coffee. Rihards' eyes narrowed; who was this person, and what did they have to gain by getting involved with a high-profile investigation? He approached cautiously, trying not to startle the stranger.

As he slid into the chair across from the hooded figure, a wave of relief washed over him. This wasn't some desperate vigilante, but someone with genuine knowledge - and evidence to prove it. The informant handed Rihards a small USB drive containing documents, emails, and financial records that linked several prominent businessmen to the embezzlement scheme.

The detective's eyes scanned the data, his mind racing with connections and motives. It was going to take time to untangle this web of deceit, but he had a feeling he was on the cusp of something big.

Over the next few weeks, Rihards worked tirelessly to build the case against the embezzlers, following a trail of digital breadcrumbs that led him from high-stakes money laundering operations to under-the-radar shell companies. The Estonian authorities were stunned by the depth of corruption exposed in this investigation - and not everyone was happy about it.

One fateful night, as Rihards reviewed the final evidence one last time, his phone rang. It was the chief superintendent, his voice low and urgent: "Pelz, we've got a problem. Someone's taken out a hit on our top witness."

Rihards felt a shiver run down his spine; this was personal now. The killer wouldn't stop until he had silenced them all - but Rihards was ready for the fight of his life. He hung up the phone and started typing, the digital keys clacking against the keyboard as he began to piece together one final puzzle.
