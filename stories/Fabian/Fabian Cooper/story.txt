In the end, Fabian Cooper remained an enigma, but Sarah knew her librarian friend for who he truly was â€“ a man of great wit and wisdom, with a heart full of kindness and compassion. As they sat together in the library, surrounded by the quiet hum of books and the soft glow of reading lights, Fabian smiled to himself, knowing that he had finally found a place where he could be himself, without fear of judgment or reprisal.
