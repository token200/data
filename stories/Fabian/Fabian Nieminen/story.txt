Few people knew that behind the mask of anonymity, Fabian was actually a 25-year-old Finnish cybersecurity expert.

One day, Fabian received a mysterious message from an unknown sender, challenging him to break into a highly secure server. The offer was too enticing to resist, and Fabian eagerly accepted. He spent weeks studying the server's firewall, searching for vulnerabilities that he could exploit.
