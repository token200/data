Fabian Schneider was a man with a passion for music and art. Growing up in Berlin, he spent most of his childhood exploring the city's vibrant street art scene, marveling at the intricate murals that adorned the walls of abandoned buildings.

As Fabian grew older, his fascination with the intersection of music and visual art only deepened. He began to experiment with creating soundscapes that echoed the rhythms of the city's streetscape. His early productions were met with enthusiasm from local music enthusiasts, who praised Fabian Schneider's unique ability to capture the essence of Berlin's urban landscape.

One fateful night, Fabian Schneider received an invitation to perform at a renowned art gallery in Kreuzberg.

As the audience was transported into Fabian Schneider's world, they witnessed a side of Berlin they had never seen before â€“ a city alive with energy, creativity, and rebellion. The soundscape ebbed and flowed like the Spree River itself, carrying listeners through a sonic odyssey that left them breathless and wanting more.
