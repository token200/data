Born in Rome to a family of modest means, Fabian Pioli's journey to the top was not an easy one. Growing up on the streets of Italy's capital city, he was forced to rely on his wit and determination to overcome adversity. His hard work paid off when he landed a scholarship to play for the esteemed Lazio youth team.

Pioli's impressive performances at the youth level soon caught the attention of AC Milan scouts, who offered him a professional contract in 2003.

As the seasons went by, Pioli's tactical acumen and ability to adapt his strategies to suit different opponents earned him widespread acclaim. The 2020-21 season saw AC Milan climb from mid-table obscurity to a surprise top-four finish in Serie A. The team's resurgence was attributed largely to Pioli's innovative approach and commitment to nurturing young talent.
