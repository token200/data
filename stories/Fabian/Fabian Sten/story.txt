Fabian Sten stepped out of his worn leather jacket and into the chilly Helsinki night air, the scent of freshly brewed coffee wafting from the café across the street. As a former detective turned private investigator, Fabian had seen it all – the dark alleys, the seedy underworld, and the desperate faces that haunted the streets.

But it was moments like these, alone in the quiet darkness, that Fabian found solace. He sipped his coffee, feeling the warmth spread through his chest as he gazed out at the frozen Lake Saimaa, its surface glinting like a million diamonds in the moonlight.

Fabian's thoughts turned to the case that had brought him here – a wealthy businessman with ties to organized crime, missing and presumed dead. The police were stumped, and Fabian had been hired by the victim's family to find out what really happened.

As he sat at his desk, pouring over files and notes, Fabian couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A nagging sense of unease, like a faint hum in the background of his mind. He tried to ignore it, focusing on the details, but it only seemed to grow louder.

Just then, his phone rang, breaking the silence. Fabian picked up, answering with a curt "Sten."

"Fabian?" A soft voice answered, sending a shiver down his spine.

"Finn," he replied, a name he knew all too well – a name that had become synonymous with danger and deception in his world of investigation.

"What do you know about the disappearances on Muhu Island?" Finn's voice was like ice, cool and calculated.

Fabian hesitated, weighing his options. "I'm still investigating," he said finally.

"Don't play dumb with me, Fabian," Finn sneered. "We both know what's really going on here. And I think you're getting close to the truth."

The line went dead, leaving Fabian staring at his phone in shock. Who was Finn working for? And how did they know so much about his case?

As he sat back down at his desk, Fabian knew that this was just the beginning. The darkness closing in around him seemed to grow thicker, like a fog rolling off the lake. He took a deep breath and lit a cigarette, letting the smoke curl out into the night air as he prepared for what lay ahead.

For Fabian Sten, there was no turning back now – only a journey deeper into the shadows, where danger lurked around every corner.
