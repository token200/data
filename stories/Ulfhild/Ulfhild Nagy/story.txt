Ulfhild Nagy stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of her missing sister. It had been weeks since Astrid vanished while on a solo trip to the countryside, leaving behind only a cryptic note for Ulfhild.

The younger sibling's mind was a jumble of worry and determination as she made her way through the crowd. She had always looked up to Astrid, whose adventurous spirit and free-spirited nature had inspired Ulfhild to pursue her own path in life. But now, with every passing day, Ulfhild felt the weight of responsibility settling heavy on her shoulders.

As she pushed open the door to the small café where Astrid was supposed to meet her friend, Lena, a look of relief washed over Ulfhild's face. There, sipping a cup of coffee and laughing with Lena, was Astrid Nagy – alive and well.

But as they exchanged warm hugs and tears of joy, Ulfhild couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The note Astrid had left behind hinted at a darker force at play, one that had forced her sister to flee in the dead of night. And when Lena revealed that she had seen strange men lurking around the train station on the day of Astrid's disappearance, Ulfhild's unease deepened.

As they sat down to catch up over lunch, Ulfhild asked Astrid directly about the note and her sudden departure. Her sister hesitated, then began to recount a harrowing tale of being stalked by a mysterious figure in the woods. The more Astrid spoke, the more Ulfhild realized that her sister's ordeal was far from over.

With renewed determination, Ulfhild vowed to support her sister every step of the way. She knew it wouldn't be easy – navigating the complex web of emotions and fears that had been building up inside them both. But with Astrid by her side, Ulfhild felt a sense of purpose she had never known before.

As they parted ways after lunch, Ulfhild turned to Lena and asked if she knew anything about the men who had been seen around the train station. Lena's expression was grim, but her words gave Ulfhild the courage to take action: together, they would unravel the mystery surrounding Astrid's disappearance and bring those responsible to justice.

For now, though, Ulfhild simply smiled at her sister and promised to be there every step of the way – as long as she had to fight for it.
