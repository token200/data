Ulfhild Avendaño, known to few as "The Wolf's Bane," was a mysterious and deadly assassin who roamed the streets of 15th century Spain. Her reputation preceded her, striking fear into the hearts of those who crossed her path.

Born in a small village on the outskirts of Barcelona, Ulfhild was orphaned at a young age and forced to fend for herself from a very early age.

Ulfhild's unique gift was her ability to read people's faces, to discern their intentions and motivations with uncanny accuracy. This skill allowed her to infiltrate even the most secure establishments, gaining the trust of those around her before striking when least expected.

Word spread quickly about Ulfhild Avendaño's prowess, earning her the nickname "The Wolf's Bane." Some said she was cursed, born with an inner darkness that drove her to kill. Others whispered that she possessed supernatural abilities, allowing her to manipulate fate itself.
