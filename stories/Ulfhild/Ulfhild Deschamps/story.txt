Ulfhild Deschamps stepped into the dimly lit café, her piercing blue eyes scanning the room as she searched for her contact. As a renowned private investigator, she had dealt with her fair share of shady characters, but there was something about this meeting that left her on edge.

The air was thick with tension as Ulfhild spotted her mark, Victor Dumont, huddled in the corner, nursing a cup of black coffee. His eyes locked onto hers, and he raised an eyebrow in a silent greeting. Ulfhild smiled wryly, knowing that this was exactly what she had been hired to observe.

Victor, a smooth-talking businessman with a reputation for being untouchable, had been accused of embezzlement by his own company. He had denied the allegations, but rumors swirled like smoke bombs in the crowded streets. As Ulfhild took a seat across from him, Victor leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers together.

"So, Miss Deschamps," he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm, "I hear you're quite the sleuth. I must say, your reputation precedes you."

Ulfhild chuckled, sipping her own coffee as she leaned forward. "I've been doing this job for a long time, Victor. People like you make it interesting."

Victor raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. "Interesting? You think so?"

"Let's just say I have some... questions," Ulfhild said, her eyes never leaving his face.

The game was on. For the next hour, Ulfhild probed Victor with clever questions and wry observations, watching as he shifted uncomfortably in his seat. The café patrons began to stare, sensing that something was amiss.

As the meeting drew to a close, Ulfhild slid her chair back, rising from her seat. "Well, it's been... enlightening, Victor," she said, smiling sweetly. "But I think we're done for now."

With a flick of her wrist, Ulfhild produced a small notebook from her bag and scribbled down a few notes. As she walked out of the café, Victor called after her, his voice laced with a mixture of annoyance and curiosity.

Ulfhild turned back over her shoulder, a wry smile playing on her lips. "Until next time, Victor," she said, before disappearing into the crowded streets like a ghost.

The investigation was far from over, but for now, Ulfhild had gathered enough information to take back to her office and dig deeper. She knew that with every lead, the web of deceit would get thicker, but one thing was certain – Ulfhild Deschamps was always ready to unravel the threads.
