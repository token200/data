Ulfhild Faust stepped into the dimly lit tavern, her piercing blue eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a lone wolf hunter, she had grown accustomed to facing danger alone, but tonight's mission felt particularly perilous.

Her full name, Ulfhild Faust, was whispered in awe by those who knew her skills. She was a master tracker, a weaver of spells, and a warrior forged from the fires of Norse mythology. Her ancestors had once roamed the land with the gods themselves, leaving behind a legacy of bravery and cunning.

As she ordered a tankard of ale at the bar, Ulfhild's gaze lingered on a hooded figure huddled in the corner, their presence seeming to draw the shadows towards them like dark magnets. Her instincts screamed warning, but she pushed forward with caution.

"Who sits here?" she asked the bartender, her voice low and even.

"A traveler," he replied, his eyes darting nervously towards Ulfhild's broad shoulders.

Ulfhild raised an eyebrow, sensing deception. She slid onto a stool beside the hooded figure, her presence filling the space like a cold breeze.

"You're not from around here, are you?" she asked, her voice gentle but firm.

The traveler hesitated before slowly pushing back their hood, revealing striking green eyes and jet-black hair that fell to their shoulders. "No," they admitted quietly. "I'm fleeing something."

Ulfhild's hand instinctively went to the dagger at her belt. She knew signs of dark magic when she saw them – and this traveler was reeking of it.

"What have you gotten yourself into?" Ulfhild asked, her tone measured but urgent.

The traveler's eyes darted around the tavern before locking onto hers once more. "A darkness spreads," they whispered, their voice barely audible over the din of the patrons. "I seek your help to stop it."

Ulfhild's grip on her dagger tightened, a spark of interest igniting within her. This could be the adventure she'd been waiting for – and with her full name on her lips, Ulfhild Faust, the darkness would not stand a chance against her unyielding will.
