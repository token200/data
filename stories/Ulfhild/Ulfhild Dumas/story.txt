The village elder, wise and aged, seemed hesitant to grant the stranger's request. However, after a brief conversation, he nodded his head in agreement. The stranger was welcomed into the village, but Ulfhild Dumas remained vigilant, keeping a close eye on the newcomer.

As the first light of dawn crept over the horizon, the stranger's true form was revealed – a dark sorcerer with powers beyond human comprehension. With a swift arrow, Ulfhild Dumas struck down the sorcerer, saving her village from destruction.

In the aftermath, the villagers hailed Ulfhild Dumas as a hero, and her name became synonymous with bravery and cunning. Though she preferred to keep a low profile, Ulfhild Dumas knew that her legend would live on forever, inspiring generations to come. As for the stranger, only whispers remained – a dark sorcerer vanquished by the unyielding spirit of Ulfhild Dumas.
