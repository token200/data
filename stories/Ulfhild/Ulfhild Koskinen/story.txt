In the dimly lit tavern, Ulfhild Koskinen sat huddled in the corner, nursing a mug of lukewarm ale. Her raven-black hair was tied back in a tight braid, revealing a scattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose. She gazed into the flames dancing in the hearth, lost in thought.

As a member of the rebel group known as "The Nightwatch," Ulfhild had dedicated her life to fighting against the tyrannical rule of the tyrant King Malakai. Her skills with a sword were unmatched, and her cunning was legendary among her comrades.

Just then, a hooded figure slipped into the tavern, scanning the room before locking eyes with Ulfhild. "Koskinen," they whispered, their voice like gravel on stone. "We have a message from the Resistance."

Ulfhild's grip on her ale tightened as she rose from her seat, followed by the hooded figure. They navigated the crowded tavern in silence, pushing aside patrons to reach the entrance. Outside, a snow-covered carriage waited, its horses snorting against their harnesses.

Inside, Ulfhild took her place beside the driver, who handed her a parchment sealed with the emblem of the Resistance. She unwrapped the wax and read the message scrawled upon it: "Meet us at Oakwood Manor tonight, under the light of the full moon."

Ulfhild's eyes narrowed as she tucked the parchment into her belt. This was no casual gathering – something big was brewing within the ranks of their enemies.

As the carriage sped through the snowy streets, Ulfhild pondered the message. Who could be behind such a bold move? And what did they plan to achieve?

The snowflakes swirled around the carriage as it vanished into the night, leaving Ulfhild Koskinen lost in thought. She knew that when she arrived at Oakwood Manor, only one thing was certain: the stakes would be higher than ever.

Her hand instinctively drifted to the hilt of her sword, now resting against her thigh. Ulfhild Koskinen was a woman on a mission – and nothing was going to stand in her way.

With the full moon hanging low in the sky, Ulfhild arrived at Oakwood Manor, her heart pounding with anticipation. Tonight, the fate of their rebellion hung in the balance. Only time would tell what secrets lay hidden within those manor walls, but one thing was certain – Ulfhild Koskinen was ready to face whatever came next.
