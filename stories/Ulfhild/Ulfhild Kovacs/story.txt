Ulfhild Kovacs stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. She had been traveling for days, and finally, she was in the city of Brindlemark, where her estranged mother lived. Ulfhild's thoughts were a jumble of emotions - excitement to see her mother again after all these years, mixed with trepidation about the reasons behind their last argument.

As she made her way through the crowded station, Ulfhild's long blonde braids bounced behind her like a metronome. She had always been proud of her heritage, and her name was a testament to that - Ulfhild, meaning "wolf shield" in the ancient tongue of Brindlemark, and Kovacs, a surname passed down through generations of warriors.

Ulfhild's thoughts turned to her mother, who had abandoned her when she was just a child. Her mother, Brynja, had been a member of an elite guard unit, known for their bravery and skill in battle. But after Ulfhild's father died, Brynja had left Brindlemark, unable or unwilling to care for their young daughter.

Ulfhild pushed open the door to her mother's house, a sense of trepidation building in her chest. She called out, her voice firm but controlled. "Mother?"

The door creaked open, and Brynja stood before her, a look of surprise on her face. "Ulfhild?" she said, her voice laced with hesitation.

For a moment, the two women simply stared at each other, the years of separation bridging the gap between them. Then, without another word, Ulfhild stepped forward, embracing her mother tightly.

As they hugged, Ulfhild felt a weight lift off her shoulders. She knew that her mother's past was complicated, and that their reunion would not be easy. But for now, she was just grateful to have her mother back in her life.

"Let's talk," Brynja said, stepping back from the hug.

Ulfhild nodded, a sense of determination growing within her. She was ready to face whatever lay ahead, as long as it meant spending more time with her mother.
