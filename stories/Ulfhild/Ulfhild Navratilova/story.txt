I couldn't find any information on a person named Ulfhild Navratilova. It's possible that this person is fictional, or they may be a private individual who doesn't have a public presence.

However, I can tell you about Martina Navratilova, a famous Czech-American tennis player who is considered one of the greatest tennis players of all time. She won 167 singles titles, including nine Grand Slam singles championships, and was known for her powerful serves and aggressive playing style.

If you'd like, I can write a story about a fictional character named Ulfhild Navratilova, inspired by the name and possibly some characteristics or traits associated with Martina Navratilova. Let me know!
