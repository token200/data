Ulfhild Abdi trudged through the dense forest, her feet sinking into the damp earth as she followed the worn path. As a skilled huntress and warrior from the North, she knew these woods like the back of her hand, but on this particular day, she was on high alert.

Her tribe, the Norski, had been plagued by strange occurrences - tools gone missing, food stores ransacked, and eerie whispers carried on the wind. Ulfhild Abdi's intuition told her that something was amiss, and she aimed to put an end to it.

As she pushed aside a curtain of tangled vines, she spotted movement out of the corner of her eye. Her hand instinctively went to the knife at her belt, its familiar weight a comforting presence. With a quiet calm, Ulfhild Abdi drew her dagger and crept forward, eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of danger.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from behind a tree - a young girl, no more than ten winters old. She clutched a small pouch to her chest, and Ulfhild Abdi could see the faint glow of magic emanating from within. The huntress's instincts screamed at her to be cautious; this was no ordinary child.

"Who are you?" Ulfhild Abdi demanded, her voice firm but controlled. "What brings you to our lands?"

The girl looked up, her eyes flashing with an otherworldly energy. "I... I am Eira," she stammered. "And I've come seeking refuge."

Ulfhild Abdi's expression softened ever so slightly as she regarded the child. There was something familiar in Eira's gaze - a spark of recognition that seemed to say, "I know you." With a quiet nod, Ulfhild Abdi Abdi extended an offering: a small portion of dried meat from her pouch.

"I'll let you pass," she said finally, "but tell me, child - what darkness drives you?" Eira hesitated before answering, and Ulfhild Abdi knew in that moment that their encounter would be just the beginning of a long and perilous journey together.
