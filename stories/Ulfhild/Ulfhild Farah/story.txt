Ulfhild Farah stood before the old, worn-out mirror in her cramped, dimly lit attic bedroom. She stared at her reflection, the flickering candlelight dancing across her features like a sinister waltz. Her piercing green eyes seemed to hold a world of secrets, hidden beneath the veil of a tattered, lace-trimmed cloak.

As she gazed deeper into the glass, Ulfhild's mind began to wander back to her past. She was once a skilled warrior from the frozen lands of Nordmark, feared and respected by all who knew her name. But that life was lost long ago, consumed by a fire that left only ashes and scars in its wake.

Now, she existed in the shadows, using her cunning and stealth to survive in this strange new world. Ulfhild's fingers drummed a staccato beat on the wooden frame of the mirror as she pondered her next move. A mysterious message had arrived at her doorstep earlier that morning, beckoning her to meet with a rival who promised answers about her sister's disappearance.

Ulfhild's heart skipped a beat as memories flooded her mind: her younger sister, Elara, vanished into the night on the eve of their 21st birthday. The elder gods themselves had whispered cryptic warnings in Ulfhild's ear, hinting at dark forces that lurked beyond the veil of reality.

She took a step back from the mirror, her eyes locking onto the portrait above it – an old man with piercing blue eyes and a wispy beard, whose name was Eryndor Thorne. A patron who had helped Ulfhild survive these treacherous years in exchange for loyalty and service.

As she pondered whether to heed the message or remain hidden away, Ulfhild felt an unseen presence behind her. Turning around, she caught a glimpse of herself in the reflection: the same face stared back at her, yet seemed different – more weathered, worn.

A rustling sound echoed through the attic as a small bundle fell onto the wooden floorboards below. Ulfhild's eyes narrowed; it was a package meant for her, sent by an unknown hand. With growing unease, she reached down to collect the bundle and lift its contents into the flickering light.

The scent of parchment wafted up, carrying whispers of forgotten lore and half-forgotten names. Ulfhild's eyes widened as the pages unfolded before her: ancient texts and arcane diagrams danced across the surface. The mysterious message was no longer needed – Ulfhild Farah had found a new path to follow.

With each word written on those yellowed pages, she felt the weight of her past lifting, like the morning mist burning away beneath the rising sun. And in that instant, Ulfhild knew she would find Elara again, no matter where this journey led – through treacherous landscapes, mystical realms, or into the very heart of madness itself.
