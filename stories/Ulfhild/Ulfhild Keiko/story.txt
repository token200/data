In the snow-capped mountains of the far north, Ulfhild Keiko trudged through the knee-deep drifts, her fur-lined cloak billowing behind her like a ghostly mantle. A skilled huntress and warrior, she was feared by none, for her prowess in combat and her uncanny ability to track even the most elusive prey.

As she walked, Ulfhild Keiko's thoughts turned to the gathering of the Northmen's Council, which would take place at the ancient longhouse of her kin. News had reached her of a rival clan seeking to challenge their dominance, and she was determined to be ready for them. The winds whispered secrets in her ear, but Ulfhild Keiko listened not, her mind fixed on the task ahead.

As she crested a ridge, Ulfhild Keiko spotted a small figure watching her from the shadows - her brother, Einar. He was younger than she, with a mischievous glint in his eye and a grin that could charm the wolves themselves. "Sister," he called out, as she approached him.

"Brother," Ulfhild Keiko replied, ruffling his hair with a calloused hand. "I see you're keeping watch. What news do you bring me?"

Einar hesitated, before speaking in a low tone. "There's talk of dark magic at work, sister. Some say the rival clan is using it to bolster their strength." Ulfhild Keiko's expression turned grim - she knew that dark magic was a threat to all they held dear.

The two siblings walked on in silence for a while longer, the only sound the crunch of snow beneath their feet. When they finally reached the longhouse, Ulfhild Keiko and Einar were greeted by their kin, who welcomed them with open arms and hot mead. The night ahead would be filled with stories, songs, and strategic planning - for Ulfhild Keiko was a warrior on the threshold of battle, and she would not falter.

As the fire crackled and spat, Ulfhild Keiko's thoughts turned once more to the rival clan. She would prepare herself, body and soul, for the battles to come. For in this harsh, unforgiving land, only the strongest would survive - and Ulfhild Keiko was ready.
