Gabriel Alsbach stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the familiar station. He had been away for two years, and it felt like a lifetime since he'd last set foot in Ravenswood. The small town was still quaint, with its cobblestone streets and old-world charm. But there were changes, too - new shops and restaurants had sprung up, and the old mill was now a trendy boutique hotel.

Gabriel felt a pang of nostalgia as he walked towards his family's old Victorian home. He'd grown up in this house, playing hide-and-seek in its labyrinthine halls and exploring the gardens behind it. His parents were still there, of course - his father had taken over the family business, and his mother was still the most wonderful cook in all of Ravenswood.

As he opened the creaky front door, Gabriel was enveloped by the familiar scent of old books and wood smoke. The interior hadn't changed much - the same oak paneling, the same fireplaces, even the same faded Persian rug. It felt like coming home.

But as he made his way upstairs to his room, Gabriel couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. He'd been away for two years, studying art and philosophy in Paris, and now he was back, ready to take over the family business - or so his parents had expected. The truth was, Gabriel wasn't sure what he wanted to do with his life. Art seemed like a luxury he couldn't afford anymore, not after his father's health began to decline.

Downstairs, his mother was waiting for him, her eyes shining with tears as she hugged him tightly. "We're so glad you're home," she whispered. "It's been too long."

As they sat down to dinner, Gabriel felt a sense of unease growing inside him. This wasn't the Ravenswood he remembered - it seemed like everyone was watching him, waiting for him to fulfill some sort of expectation. He knew his parents were just trying to support him, but he couldn't shake the feeling that he was trapped.

Over dessert, his father spoke up, his voice low and measured. "Gabriel, we need to talk about the future," he said, his eyes meeting Gabriel's across the table. "The business needs someone to take over soon - your mother and I can't keep running it forever."

Gabriel felt a wave of panic wash over him. He wasn't ready for this. Not yet. As they finished dinner and began clearing the table, Gabriel knew he had some explaining to do. He couldn't just walk back into his old life without facing what he wanted to become.

With a newfound sense of determination, Gabriel stood up from the table, the sound of clinking silverware and murmured conversation fading away as he turned towards the future, whatever it might hold.
