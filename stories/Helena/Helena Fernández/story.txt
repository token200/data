Helena Fernández's eyes scanned the crowded café, her mind preoccupied with the mysterious package in her purse. It had arrived unexpectedly yesterday afternoon, wrapped in brown paper and twine, with only a single phrase scrawled on the outside: "Trust no one".

As a journalist, Helena was no stranger to secrecy and deception. She had spent years uncovering hidden truths and exposing corruption, often at great personal risk. But this latest development felt different, like the whispers of a ghost from her own past.

Helena took a sip of her coffee, her gaze drifting towards the stranger sitting across from her. A young woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair, who seemed to be watching Helena's every move. They had struck up a conversation just an hour ago, discussing everything from art to politics, but Helena couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to this woman than met the eye.

Just as she was about to ask another question, the stranger excused herself and slipped out of the café, leaving behind a small piece of paper on the table. Helena picked it up, her heart racing as she read the message: "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone".

Helena felt a shiver run down her spine. She knew that if she went to the meeting, it could be a trap. But something about the package and this mysterious woman made her feel like she was running out of time.

As she left the café, Helena couldn't help but think of her grandmother, who had always warned her: "A journalist's duty is not just to uncover the truth, but to protect herself from it". Tonight, Helena would have to decide whether to trust no one, or take a risk and see where the mysterious package led.

With a sense of trepidation, she made her way back to her small apartment, the package safely tucked away in her purse. As she locked the door behind her, she couldn't help but wonder: what secrets lay hidden in that brown paper? And who was watching her from the shadows?

The clock on the wall seemed to tick louder, as if it too knew that Helena's life was about to change forever. Tonight, at midnight, the truth would finally begin to unravel.
