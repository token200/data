Helena Zariņa stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a familiar smell that transported her back to her childhood spent in these very woods.

As she made her way through the forest, the trees seemed to close in around her, casting long, ominous shadows on the ground. Helena Zariņa had always felt at home here, surrounded by the ancient trunks and twisted branches that whispered secrets in the wind.

She walked for hours, the silence broken only by the rustle of leaves beneath her feet and the soft chirping of birds in the distance. Finally, she came upon a clearing, where a small cottage sat nestled among the trees. A wispy tendril of smoke curled from the chimney, beckoning her closer.

As she approached, a figure emerged from the doorway - an old woman with eyes that seemed to see right through Helena Zariņa. "Ah, child," she croaked, her voice like the rustling of dry leaves. "I've been expecting you."

Helena Zariņa felt a shiver run down her spine as the old woman beckoned her inside. The cottage was dimly lit, the air thick with the scent of herbs and spices. A fire crackled in the hearth, casting flickering shadows on the walls.

The old woman gestured for Helena Zariņa to sit by the fire, where a steaming cup of tea waited. As she sipped the bitter brew, the old woman began to speak in a low, hypnotic tone. "You have been chosen, Helena Zariņa," she said. "Chosen to wield the power that lies within you."

Helena Zariņa felt a surge of energy run through her veins, as if the very forest itself was awakening within her. She knew, in that moment, that her life would never be the same again. The old woman's words had awakened something deep within her, and she could feel it stirring - a power that only she could control.

As the night wore on, Helena Zariņa listened intently as the old woman taught her the ancient secrets of the forest. She learned how to harness the energy of the trees, how to communicate with the creatures that lived among them. And when the first light of dawn crept over the horizon, she knew that she was ready - ready to embark on a journey that would take her deep into the heart of the forest, and beyond.
