Helena King was known for her sharp wit and quick tongue, but few people knew that beneath her tough exterior lay a heart of gold. As a renowned detective in the city's police department, she had solved some of the most baffling cases in recent history.

One day, while reviewing a new case file, Helena stumbled upon an intriguing clue - a small note with a single word written on it: "Echo". Intrigued, she decided to dig deeper. She spent hours poring over the evidence, retracing steps and interviewing witnesses.

As the sun began to set, Helena sat at her desk, sipping on a cup of steaming hot tea. Her eyes scanned the notes in front of her, searching for any connection between "Echo" and the seemingly unrelated victims' profiles. Suddenly, an idea struck her - what if the killer was sending a message? What if "Echo" was more than just a word, but a call to action?

With newfound determination, Helena set out to re-interview the suspects. She asked pointed questions, probing for any hint of motive or connection to the cryptic note. Hours turned into days, and finally, she got her break.

It happened when she spoke with one of the minor witnesses - a quiet young woman who had been shaken by the events. As Helena pressed her for details, the girl's eyes widened, and she stammered out the words "Echo...it was my brother". In that moment, the pieces fell into place. The victims were all connected to this mysterious figure, known only as "The Architect".

Helena King knew in that instant that she had cracked the case wide open. She made a mental note to look deeper into the brothers' backgrounds and started working on building her case against them. Her sharp mind was racing with the implications of her discovery.

With every step forward, Helena felt an overwhelming sense of satisfaction - this was what it meant to be a detective - solving mysteries and bringing justice to those who had been wronged. As she walked out of the police station that evening, knowing she had finally brought herself one step closer to the truth, she couldn't help but feel proud of her remarkable skills as Helena King.
