Helena Balodis stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of her family. She had been waiting for this moment for what felt like an eternity - the reunion with her estranged parents after years of distance.

As she made her way through the crowd, a sense of nervousness washed over her. What would her parents be like now? Would they even want to see her?

She spotted her mother first, standing by the exit, looking frazzled as ever. Helena's heart swelled with love as she rushed towards her. The two women hugged tightly, tears streaming down their faces.

"Helena, my darling," her mother whispered into her ear. "I've missed you so much."

Helena pulled back and examined her mother's face, taking in the fine lines etched around her eyes. It was hard to believe that this was the same woman who had once been so full of life and laughter.

Just then, Helena heard a voice behind her. "Helena! Oh, it's you!" Her father emerged from the crowd, beaming with joy.

The two men shook hands, their faces breaking into wide grins. It was clear that they had been just as anxious to see each other as Helena had been.

As they made their way through the station, Helena couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder at the man her father used to be. The same father who had abandoned her and her mother without so much as a second thought. But now, here he was, holding out a warm smile and open arms.

"Let's get some lunch," her father suggested, leading them to a nearby caf√©. Over sandwiches and coffee, Helena tried to process everything that was happening. It wasn't going to be easy, she knew, but for the first time in years, she felt like maybe, just maybe, things were starting to heal.

As they finished their meal and prepared to leave, Helena's mother turned to her and said, "We've been so sorry, Helena. We know we don't have a lot to make up for, but we want you to know that we love you." Helena nodded, feeling a sense of peace wash over her. It was a start, at least.
