Helena Mikhailov stepped out of her small Moscow apartment and into the crisp morning air. She took a deep breath, feeling the weight of her responsibilities settle onto her shoulders. As a renowned detective with the Moscow Metro Police Department, she had seen it all - from the glamorous to the gruesome.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket as she walked towards her car, a sleek black Audi A4. It was an anonymous number, but Helena recognized the tone - urgent and insistent. She pulled out the receiver and answered, her voice firm despite the early hour.

"Detective Mikhailov," she said, her eyes scanning the street for any signs of surveillance.

The caller on the other end hesitated before speaking. "Helena, I have information about a case that requires your attention. Meet me at the café on 5th Street at midnight."

Helena's instincts told her to be cautious, but something about the tone resonated with her. She made a mental note of the time and location, already preparing herself for whatever lay ahead.

As she arrived at the designated café an hour later, Helena spotted a figure in the shadows. The person stepped forward, revealing a young woman with a look of desperation etched on her face.

"I'm Maria," the woman said, glancing nervously around the café. "I used to work for Victor Petrov - you know, the oligarch? I have evidence that could bring him down."

Helena's eyes narrowed as she pulled out her notebook and pen. Maria handed her a small USB drive, containing documents and recordings of shady business dealings.

As they reviewed the material together, Helena realized the magnitude of Maria's discovery. Petrov's empire was built on corruption and deceit - and now, thanks to Maria's bravery, justice might finally catch up with him.

But as the clock struck midnight, Helena couldn't shake off the feeling that she was being watched. She glanced around the café, her trained eyes scanning for any signs of surveillance. Suddenly, a hand clamped over her mouth, and everything went dark.

When Helena came to, she found herself back in her apartment, the phone still ringing in her ear. The voice on the other end spoke words that chilled her to the bone: "You're getting too close, Detective Mikhailov."
