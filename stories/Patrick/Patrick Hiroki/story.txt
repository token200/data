Patrick Hiroki was a man consumed by his past. A former soldier, he had seen his fair share of battle and bloodshed, but nothing could have prepared him for the trauma that lay ahead. It started with a phone call from an unknown number, a voice on the other end whispering a single phrase: "They're coming for you."

At first, Patrick thought it was just a prank, but as the days went by, he began to receive more and more mysterious messages. He tried to brush it off, but the feeling of being watched never left him.

One night, as he walked home from work, he noticed a figure lurking in the shadows. The man was tall and imposing, with piercing eyes that seemed to bore into Patrick's very soul. Without hesitation, Patrick took off running, his feet pounding the pavement as he desperately sought to escape.

It wasn't until he reached the safety of his apartment building that he finally felt safe enough to look back. And what he saw took his breath away. The man was standing at the entrance, staring up at him with an unnerving intensity.

Patrick knew then that he had to get out of town, but it was too late. A team of men, clad in black tactical gear, emerged from the shadows and surrounded him. They were armed to the teeth, their eyes cold and unforgiving.

The leader, a burly man with a scar above his left eyebrow, stepped forward and revealed a shocking truth: Patrick's past was not what he thought it was. He had been involved in a top-secret government program, one that had trained him to be an assassin.

Patrick's world came crashing down around him as the men dragged him away, taking him deeper into the heart of darkness. For the first time in his life, he felt truly alone, with no escape from the demons that haunted him.

As he was thrown into a cell, Patrick couldn't help but wonder: had he ever been more than just a soldier? Or was this who he truly was all along?
