Patrick Angert was known for his peculiar sense of style, which often left onlookers perplexed. With a wardrobe that seemed to be plucked straight from a thrift store and a penchant for wearing mismatched socks, he was the quintessential eclectic. But despite his questionable fashion choices, Patrick's wit and charisma won over those around him.

As a freelance writer, Patrick spent most of his days holed up in his cluttered apartment, typing away on his old laptop while sipping lukewarm coffee from a stained mug.

One evening, as he was walking home from the local coffee shop, Patrick spotted a blank wall staring back at him like an untamed canvas.
