Born and raised in Mumbai, India, Patrick had always been passionate about painting and sculpture, but it wasn't until he discovered street art that he truly found his voice.

As he wandered through the city streets, Patrick would often stop at empty walls and cover them with vibrant murals that reflected his love for nature and social justice. People began to take notice of his work, and soon, galleries and collectors were knocking on his door.

Despite his rapid rise to fame, Patrick remained humble and true to his roots. He continued to create art that was both visually stunning and thought-provoking, using his platform to bring attention to issues that mattered most to him.
