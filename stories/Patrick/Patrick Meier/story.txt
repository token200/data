Patrick Meier trudged through the pouring rain, his eyes scanning the city streets for any sign of life. As a private investigator, he'd seen it all - the bright-eyed optimists and the desperate souls who walked alone at night.

It was on nights like these that Patrick found himself lost in thought. His latest case had been a particularly tough one: a high-society woman named Sophia, who had hired him to find her missing sister. Despite his best efforts, Patrick couldn't shake the feeling that he'd failed her.

As he turned a corner onto 5th Street, Patrick spotted a figure huddled in an alleyway. He quickened his pace, his gut telling him that this was someone he needed to talk to. The figure straightened as Patrick approached, and for a moment, they locked eyes in the dim light of the streetlamp.

It was Sophia, her eyes red-rimmed from crying. "Patrick, I'm so glad you're here," she whispered, her voice trembling.

Patrick ushered her into his office, making coffee while she poured out her story - about how her sister had gone missing three weeks ago, and no one seemed to know anything. Patrick listened attentively, his mind racing with possibilities.

Just as Sophia was starting to calm down, the doorbell rang. It was a delivery guy, holding a small package wrapped in brown paper. "For...Patrick Meier," he said gruffly before turning on his heel and disappearing into the rain-soaked night.

The package weighed a good 10 pounds, Patrick reckoned - not something you could carry around for long. He unwrapped it with a flourish, revealing an old VHS tape inside. The label read "Confidential" in bold letters, but there was no name or contact information.

Patrick raised an eyebrow as he inserted the tape into his old boombox. It started to play immediately - a grainy video showing a woman standing outside Sophia's mansion on the night of her disappearance. Suddenly, Sophia spoke up, "Wait! Stop!"

The camera stopped rolling, and Patrick felt a shiver run down his spine. This was it. He had finally gotten closer to finding the truth about Sophia's sister. With newfound determination, he tucked the VHS back into its casing, knowing this was only the beginning of a long night - but also perhaps the start of a breakthrough.

Patrick knew in that moment, no matter how bleak things got, justice would come.
