As the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the clearing, Patrick finished his masterpiece. With a satisfied sigh, he closed his sketchbook and stood up, brushing off his worn jeans. The flowers seemed to nod in appreciation as he passed by, their delicate petals rustling softly in farewell.
