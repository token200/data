Patrick Kozlowski was known for his unorthodox approach to detective work. A self-proclaimed "sleeper agent," he spent most of his days lounging on the couch, watching reruns of classic TV shows and sipping on cheap beer. However, when a case came knocking, he sprang into action.

One fateful evening, a local boutique owner named Emily stumbled upon a cryptic message scrawled on her storefront window: "The devil's in the details." Panicked, she called the police, but to no avail. That's when Patrick Kozlowski answered the phone – or rather, didn't answer it until he did.

The next morning, Patrick strolled into Emily's shop, sporting a rumpled suit and a disheveled haircut. She eyed him warily, wondering how this slovenly detective would crack her case. But Patrick was on the job.

As he began surveying the scene, his eyes scanned every inch of the store, taking in the faint scent of perfume and the scratches on the windowsill. "This isn't just a vandal attack," he muttered to himself. "It's a message."

Patrick spent the next several hours interviewing Emily and reviewing the security footage. And then, like a bolt of lightning on a stormy night, it hit him – the phrase "devil's in the details" wasn't a random act of vandalism at all. It was a clue.

After some quick mental math, Patrick realized that the phrase referred to an obscure episode of Emily's favorite TV show, which featured a memorable line about the devil being in the details. The connection sent him racing through the town's history books, and soon he uncovered a hidden pattern.

It turned out that a rival boutique owner had been trying to sabotage Emily's shop for months. Patrick Kozlowski had solved the case – with minimal effort and plenty of beer-fueled insight. As he sipped his victory drink, Emily thanked him profusely, grateful that her sleazy detective had saved her business from certain ruin.
