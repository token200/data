Patrick Balode, a middle-aged detective with a reputation for being one of the best in the city, sat at his desk, staring blankly at the cold cup of coffee in front of him. The latest case was still fresh on his mind - the disappearance of 22-year-old Sarah Jenkins.

Sarah's parents had reported her missing three days ago, and despite the thorough investigation by Patrick and his team, they had yet to find any leads. As he sipped his lukewarm coffee, Patrick couldn't shake off the feeling that something was amiss. He had seen cases like this before, where the victim seemed ordinary, with no enemies and a clean record.

Patrick got up from his chair and began pacing around the room. His mind started racing, going over every possible scenario in his head. Was Sarah's disappearance a kidnapping or was she an active participant? Had she been running away from something or someone?

Just then, his phone rang, breaking the silence. It was his partner, Maria Rodriguez.

"Hey, boss," Maria said, her voice husky from the early morning hours. "I just got something on Sarah's phone records."

Patrick's ears perked up. "What did you find out?"

"She had a few suspicious calls in the days leading up to her disappearance," Maria replied. "Looks like she was talking to someone who wasn't supposed to be on her contact list - some guy named Jack."

Patrick made a mental note of the name Jack and its significance. He knew that sometimes, it was the smallest piece of information that could crack a case wide open.

As he continued pacing around his office, Patrick's mind started racing with theories and connections. Who was Jack? What did Sarah want to communicate to him?

Just then, Maria walked in with a folder containing the phone records. "Here, boss," she said, handing it over to him.

Patrick scanned through the pages, his eyes scanning for any inconsistencies or patterns. And then, suddenly, he saw it - a text message exchange between Sarah and Jack that had been deleted from her phone just hours before she disappeared.

The text read: "I need your help."

With this new information, Patrick felt a sense of determination wash over him. He knew that he was getting close to solving the case, but he also knew that there were still many questions left unanswered.
