Ethan Neumann sat alone in his dimly lit apartment, staring at the worn photograph on the coffee table. It was an old picture of him and his late mother, Rachel. They were standing together, arms wrapped around each other, both wearing bright smiles on their faces.

As he gazed into her warm eyes, Ethan's mind began to wander back to that fateful day when she had passed away. He had been only 19 years old at the time, still trying to find his place in the world. His mother, a renowned artist and free spirit, had always encouraged him to pursue his passions, no matter how unorthodox they may seem.

Growing up, Ethan had idolized his mother's carefree nature, her ability to see the beauty in even the most mundane things. He remembered spending hours with her in the studio, watching as she brought her art to life on canvas. Her infectious laughter and boundless energy had always made him feel alive.

As he grew older, however, Ethan began to chafe against his mother's permissive nature. He felt suffocated by her constant support and encouragement, which he perceived as enabling rather than empowering. His own ambitions and desires were constantly at odds with hers, leading to a rift between them that seemed insurmountable.

The photograph, however, was a reminder of the happy times they had shared together. Ethan's eyes followed Rachel's smile as it curved across her face, transporting him back to the carefree days of his childhood. He recalled the way she used to sing silly songs with him on long car rides, or the countless hours they spent playing chess and exploring the city.

As he lost himself in the memories, a faint hum began to emanate from the corner of his room. Ethan's gaze drifted towards an old guitar leaning against the wall. It was a gift from Rachel before she passed away, with a note attached that read: "Play for yourself, son."

Without thinking, Ethan rose to his feet and walked over to the guitar. His fingers instinctively danced across the strings as he began to play a melancholic melody that echoed the sorrow in his heart. The music flowed through him like a river, carrying him back to the days when life had been simpler.

As he played on, the room grew darker, but Ethan didn't notice. Lost in the symphony of notes and memories, he finally felt the weight of his grief lifting, if only for a moment.
