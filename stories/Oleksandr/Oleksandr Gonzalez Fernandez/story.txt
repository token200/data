With the necklace safely in hand, Oleksandr vanished into the night, leaving Sophia with a sense of unease and a feeling that she had just made a deal with a devil. As for Oleksandr, he smiled to himself, knowing that his reputation as a master thief would only continue to grow. In his world, secrets were currency, and those who kept them best were the ones who thrived.

And so, Oleksandr Gonzalez Fernandez disappeared into the shadows, ready to plan his next move, always staying one step ahead of those who sought to uncover his true identity.
