Oleksandr Andersen, or Sasha to his friends, stood at the edge of the frozen lake, his eyes fixed on the distant lights of Moscow. The cold air stung his cheeks, but he hardly noticed, lost as he was in thought.

It had been a long and difficult journey for the young Pole from Warsaw to get to Moscow. He had fled his homeland after a chance encounter with the local communist party, and now found himself in the Soviet Union, living under an assumed name.

But Sasha wasn't afraid. Not yet, at least. The thrill of adventure and the promise of a new life drove him forward, even as he struggled to find work and make sense of this strange new world.

As he gazed out across the lake, Sasha felt a pang of homesickness. He missed his mother's cooking, his friends' laughter, and the warmth of the Polish sun on his skin. But he knew that couldn't be his life now.

Sasha took a deep breath, feeling the chill of the air fill his lungs, and began to walk across the lake. The ice creaked beneath his boots, but it held firm, and he made good progress.

As he walked, Sasha noticed something strange - a group of men on skates, gliding effortlessly across the ice with ease. They were laughing and joking, their movements fluid and confident. Sasha watched them for a while, feeling a pang of envy.

Eventually, one of the men noticed him standing there, staring. He skated over to Sasha, his face set in a friendly smile. "You're not from around here, are you?" he asked, his voice dripping with amusement.

Sasha shook his head, feeling a little self-conscious. "I'm from Poland," he replied, trying to sound nonchalant.

The man nodded thoughtfully. "Well, welcome to Moscow," he said. "My name is Vladimir. What's yours?"

For the first time in weeks, Sasha felt like he might actually be starting to make a life for himself here. Maybe this new world wasn't so bad after all.

"Oleksandr," he replied, smiling back at Vladimir. It was a small act of defiance, but it felt like the start of something big.
