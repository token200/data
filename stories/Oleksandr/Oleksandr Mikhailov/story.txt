Oleksandr Mikhailov's eyes scanned the papers, his mind racing with connections and inconsistencies. He knew he had found something - a trail of money that led directly to the mayor's office. The more he read, the more convinced he became that this was going to be the story of his career.

As the day wore on, Oleksandr Mikhailov poured all his energy into the article. His fingers flew across the keyboard as he wrote, his words pouring out in a torrent of indignation and outrage. He knew it wouldn't be easy - there would be pushback from those who wanted to keep their secrets buried.
