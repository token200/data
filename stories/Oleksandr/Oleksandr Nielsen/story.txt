Oleksandr "Sandy" Nielsen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of sea salt and diesel fuel filling his lungs. He had been back to his hometown of Odessa, Ukraine for only a few days, but it already felt like coming home.

As he made his way through the crowded station, Sandy's eyes scanned the crowds, searching for a familiar face. His best friend and former football teammate, Sergei, was supposed to meet him here. They had grown up playing on the streets of Odessa together, dreaming of one day making it big in the sport.

Sandy spotted Sergei, his curly brown hair and bright smile impossible to miss. The two friends clung each other tightly, exchanging hearty words of hello and reuniting with a laugh that echoed through the station.

As they made their way out into the evening air, Sandy felt the weight of his past bearing down on him. His mother had passed away just a few months ago, leaving behind a small cottage and a lifetime of memories. He had come back to Odessa to settle her estate, but the task was proving tougher than he expected.

Over steaming cups of black coffee at a sidewalk café, Sergei listened as Sandy recounted his struggles. The Ukrainian government had long been in turmoil, and now, with Russia's invasion looming large, it seemed like the world was crumbling around them.

Sandy sighed, feeling the exhaustion of it all wash over him. He thought about his mother, who had always told him that no matter what challenges came his way, he should never lose hope. That she would be watching over him from wherever she went.

Just then, a figure appeared on the corner of the street. It was Anastasia, Sandy's wife back home in Denmark – or so he thought. The Danish version of her smile seemed to falter for a moment before she was replaced with a look that seemed almost... Ukrainian.

"Sandy?" she asked hesitantly. "Can I talk to you?"

The world seemed to tilt on its axis as the pieces clicked into place. Sandy stumbled backward, his mind racing with questions and emotions.

"Who are you?" he stammered, but before Anastasia could answer, Sergei's words cut through the air like a sharp knife. "Sandy, your wife is here."

It turned out that after her departure from Denmark, Anastasia had been living under an assumed identity in Odessa, working as an interpreter for Russian forces. She had come to tell Sandy she was back – and wanted him by her side.
