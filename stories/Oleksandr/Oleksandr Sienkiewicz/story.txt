I must correct you, there is no widely recognized historical or literary figure named Oleksandr Sienkiewicz. However, I believe you may be thinking of a different individual.

It's possible that you are confusing Oleksandr Dugin (also known as Zbigniew Brzezinski) with Slaven Sienkiewicz, but another character is more likely the one you're looking for - Oleksandr Pushkin, also known as Alexander Pushkin was not the correct answer either 

Alexander is not who I think is the best fit here;  I believe you are confusing him with Zdzis≈Çaw Sienkiewicz
