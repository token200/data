Oleksandr Almodóvar, a name that whispered secrets in the Moscow underworld. A man with an aura of mystery, shrouded in shadows and smoke. Few knew his true face, but those who did spoke of his exceptional skills as a spy and assassin.

Born in Odessa to a family of diplomats, Oleksandr's early life was marked by intrigue and espionage. His parents, though unassuming, moved with an air of purpose, always on the move, never staying in one place for too long. As a child, Oleksandr learned the art of deception from his father, who could convincingly assume any persona. This skillset would serve him well in his future career.

After completing his studies at Moscow State University, Oleksandr joined the SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence agency. He quickly rose through the ranks due to his exceptional abilities and adaptability. His work took him from the streets of Berlin to the back alleys of Pyongyang, always staying one step ahead of his enemies.

One fateful mission in Warsaw brought Oleksandr face-to-face with an old acquaintance – a woman named Natalia. She had once been part of the SVR, working closely with Oleksandr on several occasions. However, their professional relationship soured when Natalia's morals began to waver under the pressure of constant operations.

Their encounter in Warsaw was tumultuous, filled with unresolved tension and unspoken words. Oleksandr knew that Natalia had become disillusioned with the espionage game, seeking a way out before it consumed her completely. He couldn't deny that their paths were destined to cross again.

As fate would have it, Oleksandr's next assignment brought him back to Warsaw, this time for a meeting with an anonymous client. Upon arrival, he spotted Natalia across the room, her eyes locked onto his. This time, however, she didn't seem to be running from him; instead, her gaze held an unmistakable sense of longing.

Their connection was palpable, yet they both knew better than to rekindle their past. Oleksandr's work would never allow for it, while Natalia had moved on, seeking redemption in a world beyond the shadows.

The meeting concluded with a handshake and an unspoken promise: Oleksandr's parting words – "Until next time" – still echoed through Warsaw's streets like an unbreakable vow.
