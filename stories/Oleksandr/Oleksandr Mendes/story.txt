Oleksandr Mendes stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the faded sign that read "Kharkiv". He had been away for so long, it felt like a different life. The city seemed smaller than he remembered, yet the same gritty energy pulsed through its streets.

A former engineer turned mercenary, Mendes had seen his share of battles and bloodshed. He'd fought in eastern Ukraine, where the conflict raged on like a perpetual storm. But after a particularly brutal skirmish left him with a bullet wound in the leg, he knew it was time to lay low for a while.

Mendes made his way through the crowded station, dodging vendors and tourists alike. He wore a scruffy beard and a battered fedora, trying to blend in as much as possible. Few people recognized him on the street, but those who did whispered warnings or offered hastily drawn maps of safe houses.

He hailed a taxi and gave the driver an address on the outskirts of town. As they sped through the city, Mendes gazed out the window at the skeletal trees lining the roads. The war had left its mark – craters pockmarked the pavement, and the once-green hills were now barren and grey.

The taxi dropped him off in front of a small, run-down apartment complex. A battered sign creaked in the wind, reading "Komsomolka" in faded letters. Mendes knew the owner, an old woman named Nadia who owed him a debt from years ago. He knocked twice on her door and was greeted with a scowl that softened into a warm smile.

"I told you I'd take care of it, comrade," she said, ushering him inside. "Coffee's still hot."

Mendes smiled back, feeling the warmth spread through his chilled bones. It had been years since he'd known comfort like this – food on the table, a roof over his head, and no guns to carry. He took off his jacket, letting Nadia wrangle the wispy threads of his beard into something resembling order.

For a few hours, at least, Oleksandr Mendes could forget about the fighting. Forget about the ghosts that haunted him – the faces of fallen comrades, the scent of gunpowder still etched in his nostrils. In this dingy corner of Kharkiv, for one night, he was just another tired man with a cup of coffee and a chance to rest.
