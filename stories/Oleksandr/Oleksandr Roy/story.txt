Oleksandr Valeryevich Roy had always been a man of mystery. A former Russian spy, he had spent years working for the SVR, gathering intelligence and carrying out missions across the globe. But after a particularly close call with his own country's security forces, Oleksandr decided it was time to hang up his espionage tools.

He moved to Berlin, where he found work as an English teacher at a local university. It was a far cry from his previous life, but Oleksandr was drawn to the city's vibrant culture and intellectual atmosphere. He threw himself into his new role, using his linguistic skills to help students navigate the complexities of modern German.

Despite his attempts to blend in, however, Oleksandr couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He would catch glimpses of suspicious individuals lurking in the shadows, only to lose them as soon as he turned around. It was a trait that came with years of experience as an operative – his instincts were honed to detect even the slightest hint of danger.

One day, while grading papers at his office, Oleksandr noticed a familiar face among the students. A young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair had taken an interest in his course, attending every class and engaging with him during office hours. There was something about her that drew Oleksandr in – perhaps it was the way she smiled, or the way she spoke with a confident authority.

As he watched her leave his office for the final time, Oleksandr felt a spark of curiosity ignite within him. Who was this enigmatic student, and what did she want? He made a mental note to keep an eye on her, even as he tried to push aside the lingering memories of his past life. It seemed that Oleksandr Valeryevich Roy was not yet ready to be fully retired after all.
