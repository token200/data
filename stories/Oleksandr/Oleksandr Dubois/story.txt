I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Oleksandr Dubois. It's possible that this character is not well-known or doesn't exist in popular culture.

However, I can generate a story based on a name like "Oleksandr Dubois" which sounds similar to the famous boxer Joseph Duvalier (also known as Joseph Louis), but for a fictional boxer. Here's a 400-word story:

Oleksandr Dubois stepped into the ring, his eyes fixed intently on his opponent, Viktor Kuznetsov. The crowd erupted in cheers as the bell rang, signaling the start of their highly anticipated bout.

Dubois, a ruggedly handsome Ukrainian boxer from Kyiv, had been training for years to make a name for himself in the world of professional boxing. With a powerful jab and devastating hooks, he was determined to prove himself as one of the best in the sport.

Kuznetsov, a formidable Russian fighter from Moscow, was known for his lightning-fast footwork and razor-sharp reflexes. The crowd knew that this was going to be a closely contested battle, with both fighters giving it their all.

As the round progressed, Dubois began to gain momentum, landing several solid punches that sent Kuznetsov stumbling back against the ropes. But the Russian fighter refused to give up, countering with a flurry of quick jabs and straight shots that left Dubois's eyes stinging.

The rounds continued, with both fighters trading blows and neither gaining a clear advantage. The crowd was on its feet, urging Dubois on as he seemed to be taking control of the fight. But just when it looked like he was about to deliver the knockout blow, Kuznetsov landed a lucky uppercut that sent Dubois crashing to the canvas.

The Ukrainian fighter quickly scrambled to his feet, but it was clear that the round had taken its toll on him. The final bell rang, signaling the end of the fight, and both fighters began to circle each other, surveying the damage.

In the end, Dubois emerged victorious by a narrow margin, winning by a split decision. As he raised his arms in triumph, the crowd erupted in cheers once again, welcoming Oleksandr Dubois as a rising star in the world of professional boxing.
