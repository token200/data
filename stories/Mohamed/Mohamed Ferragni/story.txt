I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Mohamed Ferragni. However, I did find information on Giuseppe Ferragamo, an Italian shoe designer, but also found information on Giorgio Armani and Giacomo Ferragamo's son, however I could not verify that he was of Egyptian heritage.

Mohamed El-Sayed Moustafa is a former chairman of the Egyptian Football Association. However, no notable Egyptian fashion influencer or businessman by the name of Mohamed Ferragni exists, despite being married to Italian fashion designer Georgina Chapman in 2017
