Mohamed listened intently, nodding his head as the woman described the damage. When she finished speaking, he smiled warmly and said, "Don't worry, Mrs. Johnson, I'll have this table looking like new in no time."

As the days passed, Mohamed worked tirelessly on the old table, carefully sanding down the surface and reattaching loose joints. He also made sure to research the original design of the piece, so that he could accurately replicate the intricate carvings that adorned its frame. When the table was finally complete, Mrs. Johnson returned to collect it, tears of joy in her eyes as she gazed upon the restored antique.
