I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Mohamed Kalniņa. It's possible that this character is not well-known or doesn't exist in popular culture.

However, I can create a story about a fictional character with the surname Kalniņa, and include their full name at least two times.

Here is a 400-word story:

In the bustling streets of Riga, Latvia, a young man named Mohamed Kalniņa navigated through the crowded market square. His bright smile and infectious laughter drew attention from passersby, who couldn't help but be charmed by his warm demeanor.

Mohamed Kalniņa was a food enthusiast, and his love for traditional Latvian cuisine had led him to open his own bakery in the heart of the city. The aroma of freshly baked rye bread and pastries wafted out of his shop, enticing customers to come and sample his delicious creations.

As Mohamed Kalniņa worked tirelessly behind the counter, he regaled his customers with tales of his heritage and the history behind each dish. His knowledge was impressive, and his passion for Latvian cuisine shone through in every aspect of his business.

One day, a group of tourists stumbled upon Mohamed Kalniņa's bakery while exploring the city. They were immediately drawn in by the tantalizing smells and the warm atmosphere. The young baker greeted them with a smile and offered them samples of his latest creations. As they tasted the flaky pastry and savory pie, their eyes widened in amazement.

"Who is this incredible baker?" one of the tourists asked, turning to Mohamed Kalniņa.

"He's Mohamed Kalniņa," replied another customer, "and he's a true master of Latvian cuisine."

Mohamed Kalniņa beamed with pride at the compliment. He took great joy in sharing his culture and traditions through his food, and it was clear that he had created something special.

As the tourists prepared to leave, they thanked Mohamed Kalniņa for the delightful experience and promised to return soon. The young baker smiled, knowing that his passion and dedication had brought people together over a shared love of good food and culture. And as he watched them disappear into the crowded streets, he couldn't help but feel grateful for the opportunity to share his gift with the world.

Mohamed Kalniņa returned to his bakery, already planning new recipes and flavors to share with his customers. His love for Latvian cuisine continued to grow, and his passion for sharing it with others only deepened.
