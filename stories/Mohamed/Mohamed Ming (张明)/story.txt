In the bustling streets of Beijing, a young man named Mohamed Ming Zhang made his way through the crowded alleys, dodging vendors and pedestrians with ease. His full name, Mohamed Ming Zhang, was a testament to his mixed heritage - his mother was Egyptian, while his father was Chinese.

As he walked, Mohamed Ming's mind wandered to his upcoming exams at Peking University. He had always dreamed of studying business, just like his idol, Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba Group. But with his parents' expectations weighing heavily on him, Mohamed Ming felt pressure to excel in his studies as well.

One evening, while sipping coffee at a trendy caf√© in the upscale Sanlitun neighborhood, Mohamed Ming met a fellow student named Sophia.

The two struck up a conversation, discussing everything from renewable energy to the latest tech trends.
