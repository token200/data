Zoltán Zawisza was a man shrouded in mystery, his past a tangled web of secrets and half-truths. A renowned archaeologist, he had spent his life uncovering the most hidden and forgotten relics of the ancient world. His eyes, piercing green and intense, seemed to bore into those he met, as if sizing them up for potential usefulness.

With heart pounding in his chest, he pushed aside the curtains and stepped into the unknown, ready to uncover the secrets that had eluded him for so long.
