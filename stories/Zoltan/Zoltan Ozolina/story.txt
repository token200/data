As László carefully wrapped the vase in tissue paper, Zoltán Ozolina couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. Another treasure found! He paid for the vase and promised to return soon, eager to explore more hidden treasures with his trusted friend and guide, László.

Back at his office, a cluttered room filled with maps, artifacts, and dusty books, Zoltán Ozolina carefully examined the vase under his magnifying glass. The intricate patterns and colors seemed to dance in the light, revealing secrets that only he could see.
