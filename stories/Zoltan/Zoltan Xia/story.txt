Zoltán Xia was no ordinary citizen; he was a master thief, with fingers that seemed to have a life of their own and eyes that gleamed like stars in the night sky. His skills were unmatched, and those who had crossed him spoke of his unparalleled cunning.

One fateful evening, as Zoltán Xia strolled along the Danube promenade, he received an invitation from the enigmatic Countess Sofia, a woman rumored to possess treasures beyond mortal comprehension. Her summons was laced with a hint of challenge, drawing the attention of even the most seasoned adversaries.

Without hesitation, Zoltán Xia accepted the countess's offer, aware that his reputation as a master thief would be on the line.

And so, his full name, Zoltán Xia, became synonymous with daring exploits and unparalleled cunning.
