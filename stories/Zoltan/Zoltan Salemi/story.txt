Desperate to be reunited with it, Sophia pleaded with Zoltan Salemi to take on the case.

As he sipped his tea and listened intently, Zoltan Salemi's eyes lit up with intrigue. He began asking Sophia a series of seemingly unrelated questions, which only seemed to confuse her further.

Hours turned into days as Zoltan Salemi followed every lead, interviewing suspects and gathering clues. His unorthodox methods often raised eyebrows among the police department, but he knew that sometimes it took a step outside the box to crack the most complex cases.
