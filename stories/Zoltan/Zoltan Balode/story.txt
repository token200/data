Zoltan Balode didn't hesitate, using their cunning and agility to outmaneuver the guard and make a break for it. They sprinted through the museum's corridors, dodging startled visitors and alarms blaring in the background.

They melted into the shadows, disappearing into the darkness, leaving behind only whispers of their legendary escapade.
