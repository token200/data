Zoltán Rossi was known for his enigmatic smile and piercing green eyes that seemed to see right through you. As a master thief and con artist, he had built a reputation for being one step ahead of the law.

Born into a family of traveling performers, Zoltán had always been drawn to the art of deception. He honed his skills on the road, learning how to read people and manipulate situations to his advantage. But it wasn't until he set foot in the city that he truly found his calling.

Zoltán's latest mark was a wealthy businessman with a penchant for rare artifacts. The owner of the business, Mr. Jenkins, had recently acquired a priceless gemstone, and Zoltán was determined to get his hands on it. He spent weeks casing the joint, studying Mr. Jenkins' routine and waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

Finally, the night arrived. Zoltán donned his finest suit and made his way to the business's headquarters, a sleek glass tower in the heart of the city. He sauntered up to the reception desk, flashing his most charming smile at the security guard.

"I'm here for the meeting with Mr. Jenkins," he said, producing a fake invitation from his pocket. "I have some... investments to discuss."

The guard raised an eyebrow but couldn't deny Zoltán's air of confidence. He let him in, and Zoltán was ushered into the conference room where Mr. Jenkins waited.

As they sat down to discuss the gemstone, Zoltán listened intently, waiting for the perfect moment to pounce. But as he gazed into Mr. Jenkins' eyes, he saw something there that gave him pause. A glimmer of recognition, perhaps? A hint that this man was more than just a mark?

Zoltán's smile faltered for a moment, and Mr. Jenkins noticed. He leaned forward, his voice low and menacing.

"I know who you are, Zoltán Rossi," he said. "I've been expecting you."

For once, the game had changed. Zoltán found himself on the back foot, wondering if he'd underestimated the businessman. But as he looked into Mr. Jenkins' eyes, he saw something there that made him think this might just be the start of a new partnership.
