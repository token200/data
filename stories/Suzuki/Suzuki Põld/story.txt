Suzuki Põld was a peculiar individual known for his affinity with machines and his unwavering passion for Estonian folk music. Born in Tallinn, Estonia, to a family of skilled craftsmen, Põld showed an early aptitude for tinkering with engines and gears.

As he grew older, Suzuki's fascination with machinery only intensified, leading him to become one of the top mechanics in his homeland. His impressive skills earned him recognition from fellow Estonians and even attracted the attention of international car enthusiasts.

Despite his fame as a mechanic, Põld's true love lay in traditional Estonian folk music. He spent countless hours perfecting his accordion playing, often incorporating local melodies into his workshop playlist to stimulate creativity and inspire innovative solutions.

One fateful day, Suzuki was approached by a local museum director who asked for his help in restoring an old tractor that had been donated as part of the museum's collection. The tractor, once proudly owned by Põld's own father, had fallen into disrepair over the years and required meticulous care to revive it.

With great enthusiasm, Suzuki accepted the challenge. As he meticulously worked on the tractor, he found himself reminiscing about his childhood days spent playing traditional Estonian folk songs with his siblings. The nostalgic atmosphere sparked a new idea – incorporating traditional music elements into the museum's restoration project.

Intrigued by Põld's innovative approach, the director offered him a permanent position at the museum as both a mechanic and an artist-in-residence. Suzuki accepted, marking a new chapter in his life where he could share his dual passions with fellow enthusiasts.

As word of Suzuki Põld's remarkable skills spread throughout Estonia, visitors flocked to witness his extraordinary work on traditional machines, accompanied by the enchanting sounds of Estonian folk music wafting through the air.
