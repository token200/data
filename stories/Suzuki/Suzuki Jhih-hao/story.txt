Suzuki Jhih-hao, a brilliant and reclusive scientist, stood at the edge of his laboratory, staring out into the night sky. His eyes, red from lack of sleep, gleamed with an intensity that bordered on obsession.

Jhih-hao's latest project, codenamed "Eclipse," had been consuming him for months. He was determined to crack the code to manipulating time itself, and his colleagues feared for their sanity as they watched him work tirelessly day and night.

As he gazed up at the stars, Jhih-hao's mind whirled with calculations and theories. His hands moved of their own accord, sketching out equations on a notepad as if possessed by some other force entirely. The room around him melted away, leaving only the universe itself, vast and uncaring.

Suddenly, his lab assistant, Chen, burst in, her face etched with worry. "Jhih-hao, we need to talk," she said, her voice trembling.

Jhih-hao turned to her, his eyes narrowing. "What is it, Chen?"

"It's the funding, Jhih-hao," she replied, trying to keep her tone steady. "The board has cut off our budget due to...other priorities."

A cold smile spread across Jhih-hao's face. "Ah, but I've made progress," he said, his voice dripping with triumph.

"Progress?" Chen repeated, incredulous. "You mean you've almost lost your mind? Your colleagues have reported hearing strange noises coming from the lab at night...the whispers in the dark..."

Jhih-hao chuckled, a low, menacing sound. "Whispers? Ah, those are just my equations taking shape."

Chen took a step back, her eyes wide with fear. She knew that look â€“ it was the same one Jhih-hao had when he'd first announced his plan to break the boundaries of space-time.

Without another word, Chen fled the lab, leaving Jhih-hao to his dark ambitions.

As she stumbled out into the night air, a faint whisper echoed through the corridors, carried on the wind: "Time is just a moment away..."

The world around her seemed to bend and warp, as if time itself was unraveling. She felt herself being drawn back to Jhih-hao's laboratory, inexorably bound by threads of science and madness.

And when she finally reached his side, Jhih-hao greeted her with an enigmatic smile: "Welcome, Chen...to the Eclipse."

Together, they vanished into the shadows, their footsteps echoing through the universe as they embarked on a journey that would defy the laws of time itself.
