Suzuki Tamm was a young, enigmatic violinist who had made a name for himself in the classical music world with his mesmerizing performances. Born into a family of modest means, Tamm's love affair with music began at a tender age, when he would often sneak away from his chores to listen to old records by Paganini and Vivaldi.

Despite his talent, Tamm never attended traditional music conservatories, preferring instead to hone his craft through intense practice sessions and self-study. His dedication paid off, and soon he was playing with some of the top orchestras in Europe, his name becoming synonymous with technical precision and emotional depth.

But Tamm's life was not without its secrets. A dark past haunted him, one that he kept hidden from the prying eyes of the public. He had grown up on the streets, surviving by his wits and his talent for manipulation. And though he had long since left that life behind, the ghosts of his past still lingered, tempting him with promises of easy fame and fortune.

One night, Tamm received an offer to perform at a exclusive private concert in a wealthy patron's mansion. The pay was astronomical, but there was something about the invitation that felt off – like he was being pulled back into a world he thought he had left behind.

As he arrived at the mansion, Tamm was greeted by the hostess, a stunning woman with piercing green eyes and a smile that seemed to hold secrets of its own. She led him to a lavish saloon, where the other musicians were waiting – a motley crew of virtuosos, each more talented than the last.

But as the night wore on, Tamm began to realize that something was amiss. The patrons were not just wealthy collectors, but rather dark figures with hidden agendas, all gathered in one place for some reason that seemed to be beyond his comprehension. And at the center of it all, he saw a figure from his own past – a woman who had been thought long dead.

Tamm's instincts screamed at him to leave, but it was too late. He had played the first note on his violin, and nothing could ever take that away from him again.
