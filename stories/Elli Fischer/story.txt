Elli Fischer sat in her small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty bookshelves and the faint scent of old paper. As a renowned literary critic, she had spent years pouring over the works of countless authors, searching for that elusive spark of genius. Her eyes wandered across the pages of the latest manuscript she had received, scribbled notes in the margins a testament to her tireless pursuit.

A knock at the door broke the silence, and Elli hesitated for a moment before rising from her chair. She made her way to the entrance, peering through the peephole before pushing open the door to reveal her colleague, Rachel Kim. The two women had been friends since graduate school, bonding over their shared passion for literature.

"Elli, I have some news," Rachel said, her voice low and hesitant. "The publishing house has offered me a book deal."

Elli's eyes widened as she ushered Rachel inside. She dropped into the couch beside her friend, crossing her legs in excitement. "Congratulations! That's amazing news!"

Rachel smiled weakly. "Thanks, but I have to tell you – it's not just the book itself that's got me worried."

"What do you mean?" Elli asked, a note of concern creeping into her voice.

"It's...the author," Rachel replied, her eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape route. "He's one of those 'discovery' authors – the ones who are supposed to be the next big thing."

Elli raised an eyebrow. "What's wrong with that? Don't they deserve a chance?"

Rachel snorted. "You know as well as I do, Elli, that discovery author syndrome is nothing but a marketing ploy. They're written for the masses, not literature lovers like us."

As Elli listened to Rachel's concerns, she couldn't help but think back to her own journey as a critic. She had once believed in those 'discovery' authors too – only to watch them fizzle out under intense scrutiny from the literary community.

"You know what?" Elli said, a mischievous grin spreading across her face. "I'd love to take another look at this manuscript."

Rachel hesitated for a moment before nodding in agreement. As they sat back down to read the book together, Elli noticed something peculiar – the writing was flawed, but not just in terms of style or technique. The author's world-building lacked depth, their characters shallow and unrelatable.

Yet, despite her initial reservations, Elli found herself becoming increasingly invested in the story. Perhaps it wasn't perfect, but there was something endearing about its rough-around-the-edges charm. As they read on, Elli began to envision a different book – one that spoke directly to readers who craved authenticity over polished prose.

"I think I see what Rachel means," Elli said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Maybe we can help this author grow."

Rachel's eyes met hers, filled with understanding and hope. And in that moment, Elli knew she was exactly where she belonged – pushing the boundaries of literature, one manuscript at a time.
