Vanessa laughed and replied, "Just the usual - pasta, pizza, and lots of love!" Her family's restaurant, Bella Vita, had been a staple in the community for years, and Vanessa Mae Marrone was proud to be carrying on the tradition.

After finishing her painting, Vanessa stepped back to admire her work. The colors danced across the canvas, evoking the feeling of la dolce vita – the sweet life. She knew that she wanted to share this joy with others, to inspire people to appreciate the beauty in their own lives.
