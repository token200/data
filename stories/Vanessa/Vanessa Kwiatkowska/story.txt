As the evening drew to a close, Vanessa's parents took her aside to congratulate her on her success. "We always knew you were special, Vanessa Kwiatkowska," her mother said with a smile. Her father added, "You've made us proud, and we can't wait to see what the future holds for you." Vanessa beamed with happiness, knowing that she had finally found her way in the world of art.
