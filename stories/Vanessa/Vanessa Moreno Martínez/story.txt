Vanessa Moreno Martínez, known to her friends and family as Nae, had always been fascinated by the night sky. Growing up in a small town surrounded by vast desert landscapes, she would often sneak out of her bedroom window at midnight to gaze up at the stars. Her abuela used to tell her stories about the constellations, how each one held a secret and a magic all its own.

As Nae grew older, her love for stargazing only deepened. She spent countless hours poring over astronomy texts, learning about black holes, galaxies, and the mysteries of the universe. Her room became a makeshift observatory, with telescope in hand, she'd spend hours lost in the vast expanse of space.

But Nae's passion wasn't just for the science behind the stars; it was also for the sense of wonder they brought her. She felt most alive when she was under the night sky, surrounded by the endless possibilities that stretched out before her. Her friends would often tease her about her "star-gazing" habits, but Nae didn't care – she knew that in those moments, she was exactly where she was meant to be.

One night, as Nae was gazing up at the stars, she noticed something peculiar. A shooting star streaked across the sky, its tail blazing with a fiery light. Without thinking, Nae made a wish, her heart beating with excitement and hope. What would it be? A chance to explore the cosmos? To make a difference in the world?

As she stood there, the stars twinkling like diamonds above her, Nae felt a strange sensation – as if the universe itself was listening to her wish. It was then that she heard a faint whisper on the wind, a soft voice speaking a single word: "La Luna."

Nae's eyes widened in wonder as she turned towards the sound. There, nestled among the shadows of a nearby cactus, stood an old, gnarled moon rock. As if drawn by her gaze, it began to glow with an ethereal light, illuminating the dark desert landscape.

In that instant, Nae knew that her life was about to take a dramatic turn. She felt an insatiable curiosity, a sense of purpose she'd never experienced before. The stars above seemed to be guiding her towards something – or someone. As she gazed up at the night sky, Nae smiled, knowing that this was just the beginning of her journey into the unknown.
