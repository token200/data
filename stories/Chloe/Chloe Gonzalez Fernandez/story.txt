As her career took off, Chloe continued to prioritize social justice and activism in her work. She began collaborating with local organizations and community groups to create large-scale public art installations that addressed issues like racism, sexism, and economic inequality.

Through her art, Chloe aimed to inspire her audience to think critically about the world around them and to take action towards creating positive change. Her message resonated deeply with people of all ages and backgrounds, earning her a devoted following and critical acclaim from fellow artists and critics alike.
