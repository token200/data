One night, Amelia received an invitation to compete in a high-stakes street racing tournament, with the winner taking home a prize of $100,000. She knew it would be her chance to take her skills to the next level and prove herself as one of the best drivers in the business.

As she arrived at the track, Amelia could feel the energy of the crowd and the other competitors.
