As she left the mat, Giulia was met with a surprise visit from Master Lee, who beamed with pride at his young protégée's incredible achievement. "I always knew you had it in you, Giulia," he said, his voice choked with emotion. "You are truly a master of your craft." And with that, Giulia Yun knew that she would never forget the lessons she had learned under Master Lee's guidance.
