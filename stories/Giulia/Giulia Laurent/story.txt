Her love of nature and creativity only grew stronger as she got older, leading her to pursue a degree in fine arts.

After graduating, Giulia settled in the city, determined to make a name for herself as an artist.

Despite the demands of her newfound success, Giulia remained true to herself and her art. She continued to draw inspiration from the natural world, incorporating elements of nature into her work whenever possible. Her latest series, "Ephemeral Landscapes," was a stunning testament to this focus, featuring delicate watercolors and bold brushstrokes that seemed to capture the very essence of the atmosphere.
