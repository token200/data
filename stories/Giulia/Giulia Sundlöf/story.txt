Giulia Sundlöf stepped into the dimly lit gallery, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of life amidst the scattered artworks. As the curator of the esteemed Stockholm Museum of Modern Art, she had spent countless hours curating exhibitions and selecting pieces to display for the public's delight. Tonight was no exception.
