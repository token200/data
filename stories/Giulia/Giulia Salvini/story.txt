Giulia Salvini stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the salty air of the Amalfi Coast hitting her like a wave. She had been away for what felt like an eternity, but the winding roads and colorful towns of this place were like home to her.

As she made her way through the bustling station, Giulia's thoughts turned to the reason she'd returned: her mother's illness. Her poor mother, God rest her soul, had always been the pillar of strength in their family. Now, with cancer taking its toll on her body and mind, it was up to Giulia to take care of herself for once.

The bell above the station door jingled as she pushed it open, leading her straight into the bright sunlight. She blinked rapidly, adjusting to the glare after a lifetime indoors in her studies. Her long brown hair blew in the gentle breeze, framing her heart-shaped face and warm golden eyes.

Giulia's smile faltered for a moment, but then she remembered why she was here – to be with her mother during this difficult time. She had taken leave from her teaching job at the local school to care for her, and it weighed heavily on her shoulders.

She hailed a taxi, giving the driver the address of her family's old stone house overlooking Positano. The view would do her some good, she thought – watching the sea glisten as the sun set would remind her why this place was so special.

When they arrived at the house, Giulia found her mother weak but content on the couch, a small smile playing around her lips. The room was still filled with the scent of fresh lemons and herbs from her famous cooking. It brought back memories of lazy summer afternoons spent in the garden with her own children now grown and living far away.

Giulia hugged her tightly, tears pricking at the corners of her eyes as she took in the familiar sight of her mother's frail body but resilient spirit. 'Don't worry,' Giulia whispered softly, "you won't be alone anymore.'
