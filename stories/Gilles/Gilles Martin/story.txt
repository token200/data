Gilles Martin was a man with a passion for restoring old motorcycles. He spent most of his days in his cluttered garage, surrounded by tools and half-finished projects. His friends had long given up trying to get him to join them for social events, preferring to leave him alone with his beloved machines.

One day, as Gilles was working on a particularly tricky engine, he heard a knock at the door. He looked up in surprise to see a young woman standing on his porch, looking a bit lost.

"Can I help you?" Gilles asked gruffly, wiping the grease from his hands onto his overalls.

"I'm so sorry to disturb you," she said, "but I was driving by and saw your motorcycle shop. I've always been fascinated by old bikes, but I've never had the chance to restore one myself."

Gilles raised an eyebrow. He wasn't used to strangers, let alone those who shared his passion.

"Well, what makes you think you can handle a project like this?" he asked warily.

The woman smiled. "I used to work in a bike shop as a teenager," she said. "My father taught me how to fix anything with an engine. I've been looking for a new challenge."

Gilles studied her face, taking in the determined look and the spark of excitement in her eyes. He couldn't help but be intrigued.

"Okay," he said finally. "Come on in. But don't expect any special treatment just because you're pretty."

The woman laughed and followed Gilles into his garage, where she was immediately overwhelmed by the chaos. Gilles chuckled as he watched her try to navigate through the sea of tools and half-finished projects.

Over the next few weeks, the woman – whose name was Sophie – proved herself to be a quick learner. She worked tirelessly alongside Gilles, helping him to finish the motorcycle they'd started together. As they worked, Gilles found himself opening up to Sophie in ways he never had with anyone before.

For the first time in years, Gilles felt like he wasn't alone anymore. And as he looked at Sophie, her hands covered in grease and her eyes shining with excitement, he knew that he was ready to take on whatever came next – as long as it was with someone who shared his passion for restoring old motorcycles.
