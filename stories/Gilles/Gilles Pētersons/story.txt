One day, while browsing through a vintage store in Old Town, Gilles stumbled upon an old trunk adorned with intricate carvings. The shopkeeper told him it once belonged to a mysterious traveler who had been known to take inspiration from ancient cultures. Gilles was immediately drawn to the trunk's unique design and decided to purchase it.

Back at his studio, Gilles began to explore the trunk's contents. Inside, he found a collection of rare fabrics, antique jewelry, and handmade tools. Among the treasures, one item caught his eye: an exquisite silver locket adorned with a small crystal pendant in the shape of a dragon.

Intrigued by the locket's mysterious past, Gilles spent countless hours researching its origins. He discovered that it was said to have once belonged to a legendary warrior queen from ancient Latvia, who had used the locket as a symbol of her power and strength.
