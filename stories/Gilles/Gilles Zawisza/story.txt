As a young boy, he had always been drawn to the world of art and science, spending hours pouring over dusty tomes in his father's library and experimenting with makeshift contraptions in the backyard.

As he grew older, Gilles' interests only deepened, leading him to study engineering at a prestigious university. It was there that he honed his skills, designing innovative solutions for complex problems and earning top honors among his peers. His talent did not go unnoticed, and soon he found himself recruited by a cutting-edge research facility on the outskirts of the city.

There, Gilles worked alongside a team of brilliant minds, collaborating on projects that pushed the boundaries of human understanding.
