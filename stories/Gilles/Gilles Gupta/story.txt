Gilles Gupta stepped out of his small, cluttered office in downtown Mumbai and took a deep breath of the humid air. As the CEO of Gupta Industries, one of India's largest textile manufacturers, he was used to the chaos that surrounded him. But despite the hustle and bustle, Gilles remained calm and collected, his sharp mind always focused on the next move.

Born into a family of modest means, Gilles had worked his way up from humble beginnings to build his company from scratch. His father had been a small-time trader, but Gilles had seen an opportunity to create something bigger and better. He had poured all his energy into Gupta Industries, expanding its operations and investing in new technologies.

As he walked through the bustling streets of Mumbai, Gilles's mind was already on the meeting with his investors later that day. They would be discussing the possibility of taking the company public, and Gilles knew that he needed to convince them that it was the right move.

When he arrived at the meeting room, Gilles greeted his team with a warm smile and got straight to work. He presented his arguments for going public, citing the potential for increased revenue and growth opportunities. The investors listened intently, their faces a mix of curiosity and skepticism.

Just as it seemed like the meeting was reaching a stalemate, one of the investors spoke up. "Mr. Gupta, we're concerned about the debt you've taken on to finance this expansion. How do you plan to pay it off?" Gilles smiled again, this time with a hint of amusement. "That's where my father's wisdom comes in," he said. "He always told me that 'Debt is just another form of equity.' I believe that by taking calculated risks and diversifying our investments, we can not only pay off the debt but also increase our profits."

The investors looked at each other uncertainly before nodding in agreement. Gilles knew he had won them over.

After the meeting, as Gilles left the office building, he couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. He had taken his father's words to heart and turned them into action, growing Gupta Industries into one of India's most successful companies.

But more than anything, Gilles was excited for what the future held. With the company on the verge of expansion, he knew that there would be new challenges to face, but also new opportunities to seize. And he was ready for whatever came next.
