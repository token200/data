Gilles Leïtner, a French-Argentine musician and singer-songwriter, had always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and art. Growing up in Buenos Aires, he spent countless hours listening to electronic music and experimenting with synthesizers in his small apartment.

As Gilles' interest in music production grew, so did his reputation among local artists and DJs. His unique blend of French and Argentine influences earned him a loyal following, and he began performing at underground clubs and festivals throughout South America.

But it wasn't until Gilles stumbled upon an old synthesizer in a thrift store that he discovered his true passion: creating music using nothing but found objects and DIY electronics. With the help of some online tutorials and trial-and-error experimentation, he was able to build his own instrument – a strange, hybrid contraption that blended elements of keyboards, drum machines, and even a vintage typewriter.

Gilles' new creation quickly became the star of his live performances, drawing in crowds with its mesmerizing beeps, chirps, and whirs. People were captivated by the sheer weirdness of it all, and soon he was playing to sold-out shows across Argentina and beyond.

Despite the rapid rise to fame, Gilles remained committed to his DIY ethos. He continued to build new instruments using recycled materials and repurposed electronics, always pushing the boundaries of what was possible with a little bit of creativity and ingenuity.

As his reputation grew, so did his artistic expression. Gilles began incorporating elements of visual art into his performances, projecting colorful patterns and images onto the walls behind him as he played. His music became a fusion of sound and light, drawing in viewers from all walks of life.

For Gilles Leïtner, the intersection of technology and art had become more than just an interesting intersection – it was his entire world. And with each new creation, he felt himself expanding into something even greater: a universe of possibilities waiting to be explored.
