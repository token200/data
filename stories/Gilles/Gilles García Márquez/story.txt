I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Gilles García Márquez. However, I believe you may be referring to Gabriel García Márquez, a renowned Colombian novelist and journalist.

Here's a story about the real-life author:

Gabriel García Márquez was a literary icon, known for his magical realism and captivating storytelling. Born in Aracataca, Colombia, on March 6, 1927, García Márquez grew up surrounded by the rich cultural heritage of his homeland.
