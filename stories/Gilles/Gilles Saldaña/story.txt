Gilles Salda単a's research led him to an underground network of thieves and forgers, who were known to operate in the shadows. He spent countless hours gathering intel and tracking down leads, often putting himself in harm's way to get closer to his target.

One night, as he was following a suspect through the crowded streets of Paris, Gilles found himself face-to-face with one of his own past selves. "Gilles Salda単a," the thief sneered, "I never thought I'd run into you again."

Gilles smiled wryly and pulled out his gun. "I'm not here to talk, my friend. You're coming with me."
