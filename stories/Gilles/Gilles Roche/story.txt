Gilles Roche sat on his worn velvet couch, strumming the chords to "The World Outside". He closed his eyes and let the melancholy tune wash over him, reminiscent of his tumultuous past. As the lead singer of the indie-rock band, Gentle Bones, he'd written many songs about heartbreak and longing.

As he gazed out the window, watching the rain-soaked streets of New York City, Gilles couldn't help but think of his ex-girlfriend, Lily. They'd been together for three years, but a messy breakup had left him feeling lost and restless. The memories still lingered, like the echoes of a haunting melody.

Gilles took a sip from his whiskey glass and began to pick at his guitar strings, creating an improvisational riff that seemed to capture the moodiness of the night. He'd always found solace in music, using it as a means to process his emotions and work through his demons.

As he sang, his voice cracked with raw emotion, conveying the pain and vulnerability that came with loving deeply. The lyrics spilled out from his heart, an unbridled expression of the turmoil that still lingered inside him.

The door to his apartment creaked open, signaling the arrival of his guitarist, Andrew. "Hey, man, want me to join you?" he asked, nodding towards Gilles' guitar. Gilles hesitated for a moment before shaking his head. He wanted this song to be a solo performance, a declaration of vulnerability in the dark.

Andrew sat down beside him on the couch, watching intently as Gilles continued to strum and sing. The music wove an intimate web around them, creating a sense of space that allowed both men to let their guard down. It was as if they were sharing a private moment, suspended from time itself.

The rain outside intensified, pounding against the windows like a persistent heartbeat. But within his apartment, there existed a different rhythm â€“ one that echoed through Gilles' very being. In this space, he could bare his soul and sing directly to Lily's heart, as if she were still standing right in front of him.

As the final chord faded away, Gilles felt a sense of catharsis wash over him. The song had finally let him exhale all its pent-up emotions, freeing him from the weight that held him captive for so long.
