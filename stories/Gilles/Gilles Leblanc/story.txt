Gilles Leblanc stepped out of his worn leather jacket, letting the warm Montreal summer air wash over him. It was a sight he hadn't seen in years, one that brought back memories of summers spent with his late grandfather. The smell of freshly baked bagels wafted from the nearby bakery, enticing Gilles to grab a coffee and pastry.

As he walked down Sainte-Catherine Street, people nodded in recognition. Gilles was an old-timer, with a weathered face and piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through you. He had lived through wars, protests, and social change, but his spirit remained unbroken.

Gilles stopped at the corner of Bishop Street, where he ran into old friend Marcel Dupont. "Bonjour, mon ami," Marcel said, with a hearty handshake. The two men reminisced about their time in the army, shared stories of their wives' gossiping, and laughed over the absurdity of it all.

As they walked towards the water's edge, Gilles couldn't help but think about his late wife, Marie. She had passed away five years ago, leaving him with a hole that still felt like an open wound. He looked out at the Saint Lawrence River, watching as the sun set behind the skyscrapers.

Marie would have wanted me to keep moving forward," Gilles said to Marcel, wincing as the memory of her words cut through his grief. "We had our time together, and I'm grateful for every moment."

Their conversation was interrupted by a group of rowdy teenagers playing hockey in the park. One of them, a young boy with a messy mop of hair, wandered over to Gilles and asked if he could get his picture taken with him. Gilles hesitated at first, but then smiled and agreed.

As they posed for photos, the boy asked Gilles about his life before the war. He spoke of growing up in the working-class neighborhood of Rosemont-Petite-Patrie, of playing baseball in the streets, and of joining the army to see the world. The boy listened with wide eyes, fascinated by Gilles' tales.

After a while, the group dispersed, leaving only Gilles and Marcel. They stood there for a moment, watching the stars begin to twinkle above. "You're still got it, Gilles," Marcel said, clapping him on the back. "The stories, the laughter â€“ you've got more than most people I know."

Gilles chuckled, feeling a sense of peace settle over him. Maybe he didn't have all the answers, but he knew one thing for sure: life was worth living, even in the face of loss and hardship.
