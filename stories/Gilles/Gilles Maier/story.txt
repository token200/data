Gilles Maier stepped out of the misty forest and into the bustling streets of 17th century Paris. As the chief of police, he was no stranger to the city's underbelly, but tonight felt different. The air was thick with tension, and the whispers of a mysterious figure haunted every corner.

Maier's eyes scanned the crowds, his mind racing with possibilities. He had received reports of a ghostly apparition seen near the Seine, and he aimed to get to the bottom of it. As he walked, the sound of horse hooves echoed behind him. Maier turned to see his trusted lieutenant, Henri, approaching.

"Maier, I've found something," Henri said, handing him a piece of parchment. "This was left on my doorstep earlier tonight. It reads: 'The ghost of Gilles Maier haunts the city.' Can you make sense of it?"

Maier's eyes narrowed as he examined the note. It was cryptic, but one thing stood out - his own name. He felt a shiver run down his spine. Was this some kind of prank, or was there more to it?

As they delved deeper into the mystery, Maier discovered that several witnesses had reported seeing a figure in an old coat and hat, eerily resembling himself. The more he learned, the more convinced he became that something supernatural was at play.

The night wore on, with Maier and Henri following leads and questioning suspects. But no matter how hard they searched, they couldn't shake off the feeling that Gilles Maier's ghost was watching them from the shadows.

Just as they were about to give up, a faint whisper seemed to carry on the wind: "Gilles Maier... follow me." The words sent chills down their spines. With a deep breath, Maier steeled himself and followed the mysterious voice into the unknown.

As they disappeared into the night, Henri turned to him with a questioning gaze. "Maier, do you think we're in over our heads?" Maier's response was barely audible: "Let's find out."
