One day, while working on a particularly challenging puzzle, Gilles Étienne Saar received an unexpected visit from an old acquaintance, a fellow cryptographer named Sophia Patel. She arrived at his office with a cryptic message etched onto a small piece of paper, and a look of urgency in her eyes.

"Gilles," she said, "I've been working on a new code, one that I think you'll find fascinating. It's an ancient dialect from a long-lost civilization, and I believe it holds the key to unlocking a powerful secret."
