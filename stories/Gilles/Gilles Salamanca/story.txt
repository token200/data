Gilles' eyes narrowed as he watched the young gangster, Marco, attempt to muscle in on his territory. He was known throughout the city as a ruthless and cunning crime lord, feared by all who knew him. His nickname, "The Coyote," had been earned over years of outsmarting his enemies and staying one step ahead of the law.

Gilles Salamanca, also known simply as Gus, was a man of few words, but when he spoke, people listened. He had built his empire from scratch, starting on the streets of Albuquerque and working his way up through a series of strategic alliances and brutal power struggles.

As Marco continued to boast about his own supposed connections to the cartel, Gilles couldn't help but smile to himself. He knew that Marcus was nothing more than a small-time player trying to ride the coattails of a much larger operation. The Coyote's ears perked up as he listened to Marco's tales of "influence" and "protection," his mind working overtime to figure out where the young gangster got his facts.

Gilles' patience was wearing thin, but he knew that playing Marco like a fiddle would be too easy. Instead, he decided to give him a chance to prove himself. A subtle nod from one of his associates, and suddenly Marco was faced with an unexpected offer: a meeting with the very same cartel that Marcus claimed to have ties to.

Gilles' eyes sparkled as he watched Marco squirm under the pressure. The Coyote's reputation as a master manipulator had preceded him for years, and now it seemed like the young gangster would be his next pawns to play. With a raised eyebrow, Gilles nodded for Marco to take a seat across from him.

In this game of cat-and-mouse, only one side could emerge victorious. The stakes were high, but for Gilles Salamanca, there was no other way to do business.
