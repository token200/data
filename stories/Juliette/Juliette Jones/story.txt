Juliette Jones stepped into the dimly lit jazz club, her eyes scanning the room for the familiar figure of Max Wellington. It was a chilly autumn evening in New Orleans, and the air was thick with the scent of smoke and bourbon. As a journalist, Juliette had been tracking a lead on a possible expose about corruption within the city's elite, and she had received a tip that Max might be the key to unlocking it.

As she made her way to the bar, a sultry voice called out from across the room, "Juliette! Darling, I see you're still chasing down those stories." Juliette turned to face Max, who was sipping on a whiskey sour with a charming smile etched on his face. She had met Max at a dinner party a few months ago, and she had since discovered that he was more than just a charismatic socialite - he was also a source of information for some of the most influential people in the city.

"Max," Juliette said, sauntering over to him with a smile. "I see you're still keeping yourself busy. What's new?"

"Just the usual," Max replied, raising an eyebrow as he handed her a glass of wine. "Politics, scandals, and all that jazz." He winked at her.

Juliette laughed, feeling a spark of excitement at the prospect of uncovering a major story. She knew that Max was always connected to something big, but she also knew that getting close to him would require patience and finesse.

As they sipped their drinks and talked about everything from music to art, Juliette couldn't help but notice that there was something off about Max's demeanor tonight. He seemed...on edge.

"What's wrong?" Juliette asked, her journalist's instincts on high alert.

Max hesitated for a moment before leaning in close. "I think someone is watching us," he whispered.

Juliette's eyes scanned the room again, but this time she didn't see anyone suspicious. She just saw people enjoying themselves, lost in the music and laughter of the night.

"Who?" Juliette pressed on, her curiosity piqued.

Max glanced around the room once more before answering quietly, "Someone who should be dead."

Juliette's eyes widened as she felt a shiver run down her spine. She knew that she had stumbled into something much bigger and more complex than she had initially thought.
