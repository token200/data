Her parents, both accomplished painters in their own right, nurtured her talent and provided endless support as she honed her craft. As Juliette Tzu-chi, the name that had been passed down through generations of artists, she knew she was following in the footsteps of greatness.

One day, a prominent gallery owner stumbled upon one of Juliette's pieces at a local art fair. Enchanted by the colorful brushstrokes and intricate details, he offered her a solo exhibition.
