Juliette Koval was known for her razor-sharp wit and sharp tongue, but beneath her tough exterior lay a complex web of emotions. As a renowned forensic psychologist, she had spent years studying the darkest corners of the human mind, but nothing could have prepared her for the case that would test her skills like no other.

The mysterious murder of a wealthy businessman sent shockwaves through the city's elite, and Juliette Koval was tasked with unraveling the tangled threads of evidence.
