Juliette Handschuh stared out at the city from her small apartment, her eyes tracing the neon lights that danced across the skyscrapers. As a successful tech entrepreneur, she had seen it all – the startup incubators, the venture capital firms, the networking events where everyone wore their best "I'm-going-to-change-the-world" smile.

But Juliette wasn't one for grand gestures or forced networking. She liked her work because it was hands-on, and that's exactly what she did – built software from scratch, poured over lines of code until they hummed like a well-oiled machine.

That's where the name came in – Handschuh, which roughly translated to "gloves" in German. Her parents had met while working at a textile factory, and Juliette was named after her mother's favorite glove-making technique. As she grew older, the nickname stuck, even as she shed its literal meaning.

Now, at 35, Juliette had built a reputation for herself as one of the top tech minds in Berlin. Her startup, Handschuh Software, had landed a major contract with the German government and was expanding rapidly.

But despite her success, Juliette couldn't shake off the feeling that she'd lost touch with what truly mattered – creativity. In the world of software development, where every line of code counted and innovation was just one iteration away from obsolescence, it felt like a constant struggle to stay relevant.

One evening, as she worked late into the night, Juliette's phone buzzed with an incoming message from her colleague, Daniel. "Hey, want to grab some curry at the Kreuzberg Curry Haus? Tonight?" he texted. "It's not a business meeting, promise!"

For a moment, Juliette hesitated – it was tempting to stay in and pour over lines of code, but something about the invitation resonated with her. She smiled to herself as she shut down her laptop and headed out into the night.

At the curry house, Daniel asked about her latest project, and Juliette found herself opening up about the stress of deadlines and competition. For once, she didn't feel like she was talking about code or tech – she was talking with someone who cared.

That night, under the warm glow of the curry lights, Juliette rediscovered something she'd almost forgotten: that success wasn't just about building software, but about finding happiness along the way.
