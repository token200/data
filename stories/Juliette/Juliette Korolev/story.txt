Juliette Korolev sat alone in her dimly lit apartment, staring out at the rainy night sky. The flickering fluorescent lights above her head cast eerie shadows on the walls as she rummaged through her stacks of dusty vinyl records.

As a teenager growing up on the wrong side of the tracks, Juliette had always found solace in music. She spent most of her days exploring the underground record stores and thrift shops that lined the streets of East London, searching for rare gems to add to her collection.

Now, as an adult, Juliette worked at a small record store of her own, surrounded by the very same records she had once coveted as a teenager. But despite her success, she couldn't shake off the feeling of restlessness that had been plaguing her for months.

She put on a worn-out copy of The Velvet Underground's "White Light/White Heat", letting the raw energy and dissonance wash over her as she drifted back into her memories. She remembered late nights spent listening to records at the local squat, where she had first discovered her passion for punk rock and anarchy.

But life had taken a different turn since then. Juliette's relationships had soured, her dreams of becoming a successful musician had faded away, and she found herself trapped in a loveless job with no direction in sight.

As she listened to Lou Reed's gravelly vocals, Juliette felt the weight of her own expectations bearing down on her. She longed for something more, but didn't know what it was anymore.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was her best friend, Rachel, who had come over unannounced with a battered old suitcase in tow.

"What's this?" Juliette asked warily, eyeing the case suspiciously.

Rachel grinned mischievously. "I've been thinking," she said, "and I think it's time we took our lives back."

Together, they spent the rest of the night packing up their belongings and loading into Rachel's battered old van, which would take them on a journey to nowhere in particular - just anywhere that felt free.

For Juliette, it was like exhaling for the first time in years. She slipped behind the wheel of the van, with her record collection scattered all over the back seat, and hit the road into the unknown, determined to find herself again.
