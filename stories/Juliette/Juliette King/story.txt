Juliette King sat alone on the edge of her bed, staring blankly at the wall as tears streamed down her face. It had been three years since her mother's passing, and yet the pain still lingered, like an open wound that refused to heal.

As she thought back on the memories they shared, Juliette couldn't help but smile. Her mother, Alice King, had always been her rock, her confidante, her guiding light. She remembered the countless hours they spent baking together in the kitchen, laughing and chatting as they created delicious treats that filled their home with warmth and love.

But life had other plans, and soon Juliette was left to navigate the world on her own, making mistakes and learning from them. Her father, John King, did his best to be there for her, but he was often absent, lost in his own struggles. As a result, Juliette felt like she was carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders.

Despite the challenges she faced, Juliette remained determined to follow her dreams. She had always been passionate about art, and she spent every spare moment honing her skills, experimenting with different mediums and techniques. Her mother had encouraged her, urging her to pursue her passions, even when it seemed like an impossible feat.

As she looked around her room, Juliette's eyes landed on a small sketchbook that her mother had left behind. It was filled with sketches of the two of them, smiling and laughing together. She picked up the book, running her fingers over the pages as tears welled up in her eyes.

"I miss you, Mom," she whispered aloud, feeling a lump form in her throat.

Just then, Juliette's phone rang, shattering the silence. It was her best friend, Emily. "Hey, girl, what's going on?" Emily asked, concern evident in her voice.

Juliette hesitated, unsure of how to share her emotions with someone else. But something about Emily's kind tone put her at ease. "I just miss my mom so much," she confessed, feeling a weight lift off her shoulders as the words spilled out.

Emily listened attentively, offering words of comfort and support. As they talked, Juliette felt a sense of peace wash over her, knowing that she was not alone in her grief. Her mother may be gone, but her love and legacy lived on through her children, including Juliette King.
