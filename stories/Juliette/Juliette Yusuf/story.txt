Juliette Yusuf sat alone at her small, cluttered desk, surrounded by stacks of dog-eared books and scribbled notes. As a freelance writer and poet, she had always been drawn to the darker corners of life, and her work reflected that.

Her latest project, a collection of poetry inspired by the works of Edgar Allan Poe, was nearing completion. Juliette's fingers moved deftly across the keyboard as she crafted a new verse:

"In twilight's hush, where shadows dance
Amidst the whispers of a dying chance
A solitary heart beats with despair
And in its darkness, I find my care"

As she typed, her mind wandered to the mysterious stranger who had appeared at her doorstep two nights ago. He was tall and lean, with piercing green eyes that seemed to see right through her. His presence had been both unsettling and intriguing, leaving Juliette feeling both drawn and repelled.

The door creaked open, and a warm light spilled in, illuminating the dimly lit room. Juliette's sister, Leila, entered carrying a steaming cup of coffee.

"Hey, sis," Leila said, setting the cup down beside Juliette. "How's it going? You've been holed up here for days."

Juliette shrugged, not looking up from her screen. "Just trying to meet a deadline."

Leila sat down in the chair opposite Juliette and sipped her own coffee. "You're really close on that Poe collection, though. I think it's going to be your best work yet."

Juliette's gaze flickered up, meeting Leila's warm smile. She felt a surge of gratitude towards her sister, who had always been her biggest supporter.

The silence between them was comfortable, and Juliette found herself opening up to Leila about the stranger from two nights ago. Leila listened intently, her expression growing more serious with each passing moment.

When Juliette finished speaking, Leila reached out and placed a gentle hand on her arm. "You have to be careful around him, Jules," she said softly. "I don't like the way he makes you feel."

Juliette nodded, feeling a shiver run down her spine at the mention of the stranger's name.

Leila stood up, gathering her things. "I'll leave you alone for now. But just remember, sis â€“ you're strong enough to handle whatever comes your way."
