Juliette Lindqvist stepped into the bustling café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him, sitting alone by the window, nursing a cup of coffee. Her friend and confidant, Marcus Thompson, had promised to meet her here an hour ago, but Juliette had lost track of time in the museum's new exhibit.

As she approached, Marcus looked up, catching her gaze. He flashed his bright smile, and Juliette felt a warmth spread through her chest. She took a seat across from him, setting down her own coffee cup.

"Sorry I'm late," Juliette said, leaning back in her chair. "I got completely absorbed in the exhibit."

Marcus chuckled, shaking his head. "That's our Jules," he teased. "Always getting lost in history."

Juliette playfully rolled her eyes, taking a sip of her coffee. The museum's new exhibit on ancient civilizations had been fascinating, but it was good to be back with her friend.

As they chatted, Juliette couldn't help but think about their plans for the evening. They were supposed to meet up with their friends at the concert hall, where a local band was playing tonight. She had promised Marcus she'd come, even if she wasn't feeling well.

Marcus noticed her wincing in discomfort and raised an eyebrow. "You okay?" he asked, his voice low and concerned.

Juliette nodded, taking another sip of coffee. "Yeah, I'm fine. Just a little under the weather."

Marcus leaned forward, his eyes locked on hers. "If you're not feeling well, we can always head home," he said, his voice gentle.

But Juliette shook her head. She had made promises to their friends, and she wasn't going to back out now. Besides, a night at the concert hall sounded like just what she needed – a distraction from the fatigue that had been plaguing her all day.

As they finished their drinks and prepared to leave, Juliette felt a sense of gratitude for Marcus's understanding. He always knew how to make her feel better, even on the tough days. And as they walked out of the café together, side by side, Juliette couldn't help but feel grateful for friends like him in her life.
