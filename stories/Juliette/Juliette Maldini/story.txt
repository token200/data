"You never know what's possible when you work hard and chase your dreams," Jules told them. "Just remember to always have fun and play with passion."

The girls nodded eagerly, inspired by Jules' words of wisdom. As she continued on her way, Jules couldn't help but feel grateful for the opportunity to share her story and inspire others.
