Juliette Pires was no stranger to adventure. As a renowned archaeologist and explorer, she had spent her fair share of years uncovering hidden treasures and lost cities. Her latest expedition had brought her to the remote jungles of South America, where local legends spoke of an ancient civilization hidden deep within the dense foliage.

Juliette Pires was determined to find proof of this lost city, and she spent weeks studying ancient texts and maps, pouring over every scrap of information she could gather.
