Isabelle Jian sat at her desk, staring blankly at the stack of bills and financial reports in front of her. As the CEO of Jian Enterprises, she had always prided herself on being a shrewd businesswoman, able to make tough decisions and drive her company to success. But lately, she'd been feeling overwhelmed by the weight of responsibility.

Just as she was starting to get caught up in worries about the future of her company, there was a knock at the door. It was her assistant, Ling.

"Isabelle, I have some good news," Ling said with a smile. "Your mom just called. She's coming into town for dinner tonight."

Isabelle felt a surge of excitement and gratitude towards her mother. She had always been close to her, but lately, she'd been so caught up in work that she hadn't had much time for them.

As the evening approached, Isabelle found herself looking forward to it more and more. She spent the day preparing for her mom's visit, making sure the house was spotless and her favorite dishes were on hand.

When her mom arrived, they sat down together over a delicious dinner of steamed fish and vegetables. Isabelle's mom asked about everything from her job to her personal life, listening attentively as she spoke.

As they talked, Isabelle began to feel a sense of peace wash over her. She realized that maybe she hadn't been taking care of herself enough, too caught up in the demands of work to enjoy the simple pleasures in life.

Her mom noticed the look on her face and reached out to put a hand on her arm. "You're doing a great job, Isabelle," she said softly. "But don't forget to take time for yourself, okay? You can't pour from an empty cup."

Isabelle smiled, feeling a sense of gratitude towards her mom. It was a message she knew she needed to hear.

Over the rest of the evening, they talked and laughed together, enjoying each other's company without worrying about anything else. As the night drew to a close, Isabelle walked her mom to the door and gave her a big hug.

"Thank you for reminding me of what's truly important," she said, feeling a sense of clarity wash over her.

Her mom smiled back at her and kissed her cheek. "Anytime, sweetie. That's what moms are for."

As Isabelle watched her mom drive away, she felt a renewed sense of purpose. She knew that as the CEO of Jian Enterprises, she had to stay focused on the future, but now she also had a new reminder of what truly mattered in life: family and self-care.
