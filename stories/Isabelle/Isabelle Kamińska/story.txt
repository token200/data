Isabelle Kamińska stepped into the crowded café, her bright smile illuminating the room as she scanned for a familiar face. It was a chilly winter evening, and the atmosphere inside was cozy, with steam wafting from cups of hot coffee and the soft hum of jazz music playing in the background.

She spotted him – Tomasz – sitting at a corner table, nursing a cup of black coffee. Isabelle Kamińska made her way over to him, her high heels clicking on the marble floor. As she approached, Tomasz looked up and flashed his warm smile.

"Hey," he said, as if reading her mind. "I was starting to worry I'd have to find you."

Isabelle chuckled and slid into the seat across from him. "Sorry about that. Traffic got a bit crazy on the way here."

Tomasz took a sip of his coffee before turning his attention back to Isabelle Kamińska. "So, how's work been treating you?"

She leaned back in her chair and began to fill Tomasz in on her latest projects at the museum where she worked as an curator. As they talked, the noise level around them decreased, replaced by an intimate connection that only came from sharing late-night conversations.

After discussing art history for over an hour, Isabelle Kamińska glanced at her watch, surprised to see how late it was getting. "I'm sorry, Tomasz," she said, looking up at him. "But I really should be heading home."

Tomasz nodded and set his cup down on the table. "Me too, I guess."

As Isabelle Kamińska gathered her things, Tomasz walked her out into the chilly night air, offering to grab a taxi for her if needed. With a nod of thanks, she accepted his offer and together they huddled under the awning until their ride arrived.

When Isabelle Kamińska stepped away from Tomasz at her doorstep, he gave her a soft kiss on the cheek. "See you soon," he said, turning to disappear into the night.

She smiled quietly, feeling grateful for friends like him – the ones who made life richer, even if only for those brief moments they shared. And as she settled into bed that night, she couldn't help but look forward to their next late-night adventure together.
