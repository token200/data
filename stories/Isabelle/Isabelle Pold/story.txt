As a child, Isabelle spent hours watching her mother, Colette Pold, paint masterpieces on canvas. She would sit at the edge of the room, mesmerized by the way her mother's brushstrokes seemed to dance across the fabric of the painting. Inspired by her mother's talent, Isabelle began taking art classes herself and never looked back.
