Isabelle Gagnon stepped out of the rain and into the warm glow of Café Réserve, shaking the water from her hair. She had spent the entire day lost in thought, trying to make sense of the strange occurrences that had been plaguing her family's bakery for weeks.

As she waited for her favorite coffee drinker, Monsieur LaFleur, to prepare her usual, Isabelle couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. It started with small things: utensils misplaced, ingredients accidentally spilled, and an unshakeable feeling that someone was watching her from the shadows. She had tried to brush it off as mere paranoia, but the occurrences grew more frequent and more bizarre by the day.

Isabelle's mind wandered back to the night of the full moon when she had witnessed a ghostly figure flitting around the bakery's courtyard. The figure had vanished as quickly as it appeared, leaving Isabelle shaken and confused. She had tried to tell her family about it, but they just laughed it off, telling her it was just the stress of running the bakery getting to her.

Monsieur LaFleur arrived with a steaming cup of coffee, topped with a generous dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon. "Ah, Isabelle, mademoiselle," he said with a warm smile, "I see you're troubled today."

Isabelle hesitated for a moment before spilling her secrets to the listening café owner. Monsieur LaFleur listened intently, his expression growing more serious by the minute.

"I think I know what's going on," he said finally, his voice low and conspiratorial. "This bakery has been built on top of an old cemetery, you know."

Isabelle's eyes widened as she recalled her grandmother's stories about the bakery's history. Her family had indeed made a small fortune buying up land in the city years ago.

"Maybe it's just a restless spirit trying to make its presence known," Monsieur LaFleur suggested, sipping his own coffee.

As Isabelle considered this possibility, the lights in the café began to flicker and the air grew colder. She felt a presence behind her, but when she turned, there was no one there.

Isabelle smiled at Monsieur LaFleur, a newfound sense of determination in her heart. "I think I'll make it my mission to find out what's really going on around here," she said with a hint of mischief.

Monsieur LaFleur chuckled and patted Isabelle on the back. "Ah, mademoiselle Gagnon, you're more than ready for this challenge."
