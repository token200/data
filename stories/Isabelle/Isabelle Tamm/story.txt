Isabelle Tamm stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station with a mix of familiarity and unease. She had been back in Ravenswood for only a few hours, but already she felt like an outsider. The same streets that had once seemed so welcoming now seemed narrow and confining.

Isabelle Tamm had returned to Ravenswood after many years away, her past catching up with her in ways she never could have anticipated. Her estranged father's passing had left her the family estate, a grand mansion on the outskirts of town that was shrouded in mystery and scandal.

As she made her way through the station, Isabelle Tamm couldn't help but feel like she was being watched. The same feeling that had driven her away from Ravenswood in the first place still lingered, making her skin prickle with unease. She quickened her pace, her heels clicking on the stone floor as she hurried to find a taxi.

The driver looked at her with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion as she climbed into the backseat. "Where can I take you?" he asked gruffly.

"Ravenwood Manor," Isabelle Tamm replied, her voice firm but uncertain.

The driver raised an eyebrow. "You're the new owner, huh?"

Isabelle Tamm nodded, trying to brush off the feeling of vulnerability that had settled over her.

As they drove through the rolling hills and dense forests that surrounded Ravenswood, Isabelle Tamm couldn't help but think about the secrets her father had left behind. Secrets that she was determined to uncover, no matter what it took.

The taxi pulled up to the manor's grand entrance, where a stern-faced butler greeted Isabelle Tamm with a curtsy. "Welcome home, Miss...?"

"Tamm," she replied, her voice steady.

As the butler led her into the foyer, Isabelle Tamm felt a sense of trepidation wash over her. She was back in Ravenswood, and she had no idea what lay ahead. But one thing was certain: she would uncover the truth about her family's past, no matter where it led.
