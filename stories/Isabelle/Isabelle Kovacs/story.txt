The thief seemed to always be one step ahead of the police, leaving behind no fingerprints, DNA, or other evidence. Isabelle was determined to crack the code and bring the culprit to justice.

One evening, as Isabelle was reviewing a particularly suspicious video clip, she noticed something peculiar - a small tattoo on the thief's wrist that matched one of her research subjects. The revelation sparked a new line of inquiry, and Isabelle quickly pieced together the evidence. With her findings in hand, she presented them to the police department.

The breakthrough was just what they needed, and soon the thief was apprehended.
