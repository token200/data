Isabelle Kenji sat in her small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by half-finished paintings and stacks of dog-eared novels. She was an artist, a writer, and a collector of lost things – and she had lost count of how many trinkets and treasures she'd accumulated over the years.

As she sipped her tea and stared out the window at the rain-soaked streets below, Isabelle's mind wandered to the latest item that had captured her attention. A dusty old locket with a faded photograph inside – the image of a couple smiling and arm-in-arm, their faces frozen in time.

She turned the locket over in her hand, studying it with a practiced intensity. Who were these people? Where did they come from? And why did this tiny, forgotten relic hold such power over her?

As she pondered these questions, Isabelle's phone buzzed on the coffee table beside her. She picked it up, and a text message flashed across the screen: "Meet me at the museum tonight. I think I've found something you'll love."

Isabelle's heart skipped a beat. Who could have sent this? And what could possibly be of interest to her? She quickly typed out a response, agreeing to meet the mysterious sender.

The hours ticked by in a blur as Isabelle paced back and forth in front of the museum's grand entrance. Finally, the doors swung open and she slipped inside, scanning the galleries for any sign of her unknown benefactor.

And then, there they were – two figures standing beside a display case, their faces bathed in the soft glow of museum lights. As Isabelle approached, the woman turned to face her, a hint of a smile playing on her lips.

"Isabelle Kenji," she said, extending a hand. "I've heard so much about your... unique talents."

As Isabelle shook the woman's hand, she felt a shiver run down her spine. Who was this stranger? And what did she want with Isabelle?

But before she could ask any questions, the woman leaned in close and whispered, "This locket. It belongs to you."
