Isabelle Jensen sat alone in her small apartment, staring blankly at the stack of bills on her kitchen counter. She had lost count of how many times she'd written checks for rent, utilities, and groceries that month. As a freelance writer, she worked sporadically, with long stretches of unemployment punctuated by brief periods of intense productivity.

Her phone buzzed with an incoming text from her best friend, Emma. "Hey girl, wanna grab brunch at that new spot downtown?" Isabelle hesitated for a moment before responding. She hadn't seen Emma in weeks, and the thought of socializing was both exciting and exhausting. How could she afford brunch?

As she pondered the question, a wave of self-doubt washed over her. Was she really cut out for this writing thing? Was she deluding herself with her aspirations? Isabelle's eyes drifted to a photo on her nightstand â€“ a picture of her mother, a renowned journalist who had passed away a year ago.

Her mom had always believed in her talent, even when it seemed like an impossible dream. "You'll make it happen, sweetie," she'd say whenever Isabelle expressed uncertainty. But now that she was back in reality, those words echoed in her mind like an encouragement from beyond the grave.

Feeling a surge of determination, Isabelle decided to tackle the bills first. She scribbled out checks for each item, crumpled them up, and deposited them into her mailbox. As she stood there, feeling the satisfying weight of responsibility settle onto her shoulders, Emma's text flashed on her phone again.

"Seriously, come on! I'll buy!" Isabelle smiled wryly, tapping out a response: "Sorry, Em! Need to pace myself today."

When the weekend arrived, Isabelle met up with Emma at the new brunch spot. They spent the morning laughing and gossiping over mimosas, completely forgetting about their financial worries. As they walked through the park afterwards, Isabelle turned to her friend with a newfound sense of resolve.

"Thanks for keeping me grounded, Em," she said, smiling. "Sometimes I forget that it's okay to not be okay."

Emma squeezed her hand reassuringly. "You're doing great, Iso. We'll get through this together."
