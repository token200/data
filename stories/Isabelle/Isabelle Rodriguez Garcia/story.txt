Isabelle Rodriguez Garcia was known for her fiery spirit and infectious laugh in the small town of Willow Creek. She owned the local café, "La Casa de Abuela," which was a staple in the community.

One sunny afternoon, a stranger wandered into La Casa de Abuela, looking lost and out of place. Isabelle immediately took a liking to the traveler, sensing that they were in need of comfort and kindness. She offered them a warm cup of coffee and invited them to sit by the window, where they could watch the world go by.
