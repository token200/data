One fateful evening, Nakamura Thompson received a visit from an elderly woman named Mrs. Jenkins, who had come to him with a peculiar tale of her missing granddaughter.

With his characteristic calmness, Nakamura Thompson listened intently as Mrs. Jenkins recounted every detail of her granddaughter's disappearance.

Determined to unravel the mystery, Nakamura Thompson set out to investigate, following a trail of cryptic clues and subtle hints that led him from one seedy part of town to another.
