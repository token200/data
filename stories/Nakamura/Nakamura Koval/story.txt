One day, Nakamura Koval received a call from an anonymous source claiming to have information about a high-profile murder case. The victim was a wealthy businessman with connections to the Japanese mafia. Intrigued, Nakamura Koval agreed to meet with the informant at a secluded café on the outskirts of town.

As she sat across from the informant, a young woman with a nervous demeanor, Nakamura Koval noticed that her name tag read "Yui". Yui revealed that she had witnessed the murder firsthand and was now in hiding due to fear for her life. With tears streaming down her face, Yui handed over a small USB drive containing evidence of the killer's identity.
