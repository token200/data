Nakamura Fournier stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the crowded station. She had been traveling for hours, and the excitement of a new adventure was starting to wear thin. As she made her way through the throng of people, her gaze landed on a small, quirky shop tucked away in a corner.

The sign above the door read "Curios and Antiques," and Nakamura Fournier felt an inexplicable pull towards it. She pushed open the door and was immediately enveloped in a warm, cluttered space filled with the scent of old books and dust.

Behind the counter stood an elderly man with kind eyes and a wild shock of white hair. "Welcome, young one," he said, his voice low and soothing. "I'm Max. How may I help you on this fine day?"

Nakamura Fournier wandered the aisles, running her fingers over the spines of ancient tomes and admiring the intricate carvings on a beautifully crafted wooden box. She had always been fascinated by the past, and this shop seemed like a treasure trove of forgotten history.

As she delved deeper into the store, Nakamura Fournier's thoughts turned to her own past. Growing up in Japan, she had always felt a sense of restlessness, as if there was something more out there for her. She had spent years searching for it, and finally, she had found herself at this small station, ready to start anew.

Max noticed her distant expression and nodded sympathetically. "You're looking for something, I think," he said, his eyes twinkling with understanding.

Nakamura Fournier turned back to him, a small smile on her face. "I suppose I am," she said. "I'm Nakamura Fournier, by the way."

Max chuckled and nodded again. "Ah, Niko-san. It's a pleasure to meet you."
