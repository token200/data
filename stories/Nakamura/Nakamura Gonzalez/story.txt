One sunny afternoon, Nakamura Gonzalez received a distress call from an anonymous source about a high-profile heist at a downtown museum. The thief had made off with a priceless artifact, leaving behind only a cryptic message: "The truth is hidden in plain sight."

Intrigued, Nakamura Gonzalez quickly assembled her team and set out to unravel the mystery.
