Nakamura Askarova, a nomadic warrior from the farthest reaches of the Mongolian steppes, was known for her unmatched skill with a bow. Her long, raven-black hair was often tied back in a ponytail, and her piercing green eyes seemed to gleam with an inner fire when she gazed out at the horizon.

Her reputation had spread far and wide, earning her the nickname "The Raven's Wings" among the nomadic tribes.
