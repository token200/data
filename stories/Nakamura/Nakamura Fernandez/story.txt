One rainy evening, Nakamura Fernandez received a cryptic message from an anonymous source, hinting at a mysterious disappearance in the upscale district of Harajuku. Intrigued by the challenge, he accepted the case without hesitation.

Upon arriving at the scene, Nakamura Fernandez noticed a small, intricately carved wooden box near the victim's location.

The detective's mind began to spin with possibilities as he pondered the meaning behind the cryptic message.

With his exceptional attention to detail, Nakamura Fernandez examined the victim's face, searching for any clues that might have been overlooked.
