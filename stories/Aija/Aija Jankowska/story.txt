Aija Jankowska stepped into the bustling café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting in the corner, sipping on a coffee and gazing out the window. Aija took a deep breath, smoothing out her dress as she made her way over to him.

It had been months since they'd last spoken, but their friendship remained strong. They'd met while working at the university's art department, bonding over their shared passion for creativity. Since then, Aija Jankowska and her friend, Alex, had lost touch, each going their separate ways.

As she approached him, Alex looked up, his eyes locking onto hers. He smiled, a warmth spreading across his face. "Aija! It's been too long," he said, his voice filled with genuine affection.

Aija returned the smile, feeling a sense of comfort wash over her. They hugged, the familiarity of their bodies touching sending a wave of nostalgia through her. As they pulled back, Alex gestured to an empty table by the window. "Join me?"

Over steaming cups of coffee, they caught up on each other's lives. Aija Jankowska shared stories of her latest art pieces, while Alex spoke about his new job as a graphic designer. Their conversation flowed effortlessly, as if no time had passed at all.

As they talked, the sounds of the café faded into the background. The world outside seemed to melt away, leaving only the two of them. Aija felt grateful for their friendship, which had weathered the storms of life and remained strong.

Their coffee cups emptied, Alex reached across the table and took Aija's hand. "I've missed you," he said softly. Aija squeezed his hand, her heart swelling with emotion. They sat there for a moment, hands clasped, as the world outside continued to spin.

Without a word, they knew that their friendship had been rekindled. As they parted ways, promising to stay in touch this time, Aija Jankowska smiled to herself. She was glad she'd found her way back to Alex, and to the warmth of their unbreakable bond.
