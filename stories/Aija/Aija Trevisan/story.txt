Aija Trevisan stepped into the dimly lit room, her eyes adjusting to the faint glow of the candles that lined the walls. She had been invited to a mysterious gathering by an old acquaintance, and curiosity got the better of her. As she made her way through the crowd, Aija Trevisan noticed the eclectic mix of guests - artists, writers, and musicians all gathered in one place.

Aija Trevisan's gaze landed on a figure standing alone by the window, gazing out at the city skyline. There was something about the way they stood that seemed almost... melancholic. She made her way towards them, her footsteps echoing off the walls.

As she approached, the figure turned to face her. It was a young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair, dressed in a flowing white dress that seemed out of place in the dimly lit room. "Aija Trevisan," the woman said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I've been expecting you."

Aija Trevisan felt a shiver run down her spine as she took in the woman's ethereal beauty. "What do you want from me?" she asked, trying to keep her tone light.

The woman smiled, and Aija Trevisan saw a glimmer of sadness in her eyes. "I just wanted to share something with you," she said, holding out a small piece of paper. "Aija Trevisan, I've written a poem about the city, and I think it's meant for you."

Aija Trevisan took the paper, feeling an inexplicable connection to the words that danced across its surface. As she read, she felt the world around her melt away, leaving only the sound of the woman's voice and the rhythm of the city outside.

When she finished, Aija Trevisan looked up to see the woman gazing at her with tears in her eyes. "Thank you," Aija Trevisan said softly, feeling a sense of connection that went beyond words.

The two women stood there for a moment, the only sound the soft hum of the candles and the distant thrum of the city. Then, without a word, they vanished into the night, leaving behind only the echoes of their shared moment in time.
