Aija Visconti stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, her eyes scanning the crowded street for any sign of trouble. As a private investigator specializing in high-stakes cases, she had seen it all before - from corrupt businessmen to deceitful lovers. But tonight was different. Tonight, she was after something more sinister.

She had been hired by a wealthy socialite named Sophia to investigate her sister's disappearance. The police had given up on the case months ago, but Sophia insisted that Aija couldn't leave without finding out what happened to her sister.

Aija flashed her badge at the bouncer outside the nightclub and slipped inside. She made her way to the bar, ordering a whiskey as she surveyed the room. That's when she saw him - a tall, imposing figure with piercing blue eyes. He was standing alone near the dance floor, sipping on a drink.

Aija recognized him from Sophia's security footage. This was Alexei Petrov, the infamous crime lord who had ties to some of the city's most powerful businessmen. She made her way over, her heels clicking on the polished floor.

"Mind if I join you?" she asked, her voice husky and confident.

Alexei turned, his eyes narrowing as he took in Aija's fitted black dress and sharp jawline. "I didn't expect to see you here," he said, his Russian accent sending a shiver down her spine.

"I'm not here for you, Alexei," she replied, taking a seat beside him. "But I do have business with Sophia. Tell me, what do you know about her sister?"

Alexei leaned in, his voice dropping to a whisper. "I don't know anything, Aija. But I can tell you that Sophia's sister was poking around where she shouldn't be."

Aija's eyes locked onto Alexei's. She knew he was hiding something - but what? And who had actually taken her sister?

The music pulsed around them, the beat echoing off the walls as Aija made a decision. This case was bigger than she had ever imagined, and she was ready to take on whatever came next.
