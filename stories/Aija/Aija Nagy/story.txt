Aija Nagy stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. The dim lighting and deserted streets seemed to match her mood perfectly - a perpetual gloom that had settled in over the past year.

As she made her way through the deserted town, Aija's thoughts drifted back to her life before this place. Her parents' farm in Budapest was always bustling with activity, the sound of chickens clucking and children laughing filling the air. But after her father's passing, her mother had sold the farm to make ends meet, and Aija had left to explore the world beyond.

That decision had led her on a wild ride - from sketching in art schools to working as a waitress in Paris. She'd even attempted a few failed writing gigs, but nothing seemed to stick. The doubts crept in with each rejection letter, each missed opportunity.

Now, at 25, Aija felt lost and adrift. Her mother's health was declining, and she needed to return home. But what would she do when she got back? The farm was gone, sold off without a second thought. She'd have to start all over again, pretending to be the carefree girl who'd left just a year ago.

Aija spotted a small café nearby and pushed open the door, slipping into the warm glow of the interior. It was filled with rowdy locals sipping coffee and discussing the latest news from the village square. She took a seat at the bar and ordered a cup of black coffee, watching as the bartender expertly crafted it.

As she waited for her drink to arrive, Aija pulled out a small notebook and began sketching in quick strokes. The sounds around her - clinking cups, muted laughter - provided a steady beat that guided her hand as she brought her latest character to life.

In this small café, surrounded by people who knew each other's names and stories, Aija felt a spark of connection ignite within her. It was like the world outside these walls still held promise, if only for the briefest moment. Maybe it wasn't about finding success or happiness; maybe it was just about holding onto the light in between.

The bartender handed Aija her coffee, and she smiled weakly at him. As she raised the cup to her lips, a phrase echoed through her mind: " Hold onto the light." She took a sip of the bitter liquid, feeling the taste evoke memories of rain-soaked mornings and late-night conversations under starry skies. And with that simple action, Aija Nagy knew she'd take one step closer to finding herself again.
