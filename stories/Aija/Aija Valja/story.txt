Aija Valja stepped into the old café, her eyes scanning the dimly lit room for any signs of life. It was a typical Wednesday evening in Tallinn, Estonia, and she had hoped to find some peace among the locals. As she waited in line to order, her mind wandered back to her childhood, growing up in this very city.

Aija Valja's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of espresso being poured into a cup. She took a seat at the bar, ordering a black coffee as she watched the world go by through the large windows. The old wooden beams and worn furniture seemed to hold a story or two, whispering tales of past patrons and late-night conversations.

As she sipped her coffee, Aija Valja noticed an elderly woman sitting alone at a corner table, nursing a cup of tea. There was something about the woman's eyes that caught her attention – a hint of sadness, a spark of resilience. Aija Valja felt drawn to her, as if an invisible thread connected their two souls.

Without hesitation, she got up and walked over to the old woman, introducing herself with a warm smile. "Hello," she said softly. "My name is Aija Valja. I couldn't help but notice you sitting here alone."

The woman's eyes lit up slightly as she looked at Aija Valja. "I'm Sofia," she replied in a raspy voice. "It's nice to meet you, young one."

As they began to chat, Aija Valja learned that Sofia had lived through the Soviet occupation and the struggles of rebuilding Estonia. Their conversation flowed like a gentle stream, meandering from memories of war-torn days to stories of love and loss.

For the first time in months, Aija Valja felt a sense of belonging, of connection with someone who understood her own experiences. As she prepared to leave, Sofia pressed a small note into her hand. "Keep this with you," she said with a smile. "It's for when the darkness falls."
