Bogdan Mendes was a man with a passion for restoring old cars. He spent most of his free time tinkering with engines, replacing parts, and polishing chrome until it shone like new. His small garage in the suburbs of Lisbon was a treasure trove of vintage machinery, each one telling a story of its own.

As he worked on his latest project, a 1969 Ford Mustang that had been collecting dust in a garage for decades, Bogdan couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. He had named her "Bertha" after the strong-willed women who had come before him. With Bertha by his side, he felt like he could conquer anything.

Bogdan's love affair with cars began when he was just a young boy, watching as his father, also a mechanic, worked on their family's old Citroen. Bogdan Mendes would sit for hours, mesmerized by the sounds and smells of the engine, learning the intricacies of how things worked. As he grew older, his fascination only deepened, and he began to work on his own projects, much to the dismay of his parents.

Despite the occasional setback or failed repair, Bogdan Mendes never lost his enthusiasm for restoring old cars. He took pride in bringing them back to life, making them purr like new once again. And as he worked on Bertha, he felt a sense of connection to his father and all the other mechanics who had come before him.

As the sun began to set, Bogdan stepped back from Bertha's dashboard, admiring his handiwork. The once-dusty engine now hummed smoothly, its chrome surfaces glinting in the fading light. He smiled, feeling a sense of satisfaction wash over him. This was what it meant to be Bogdan Mendes, car restorer extraordinaire â€“ bringing joy and life back to these beautiful machines.

With Bertha ready for her first drive, Bogdan couldn't wait to hit the open road and feel the wind in his hair. He knew that this was just the beginning of a new adventure, one that would take him to places both familiar and unknown. And as he walked out into the evening air, Bertha's engine purring softly behind him, Bogdan Mendes felt like he was exactly where he was meant to be.
