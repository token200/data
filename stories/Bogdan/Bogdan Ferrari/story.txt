Bogdan "The Bull" Ferrari was a force to be reckoned with in the world of professional wrestling.

With his signature moves – including the infamous "Ferrari Flip" and "Bull Rush" – Bogdan dominated opponents with ease, earning himself a reputation as one of the toughest sons of guns in the business.

But beneath the bravado and showmanship, Bogdan Ferrari harbored a deep sense of vulnerability.
