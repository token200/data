Bogdan Eglītis trudged through the snow-covered streets of Riga, his eyes scanning the frozen pavement for any sign of life. As the last of the winter sun dipped below the horizon, the city seemed to shrink in on itself, as if it too was retreating from the cold.

He stopped at a small café on the corner, ordering a black coffee and taking a seat by the window. The barista, an elderly woman with a kind face, looked up from her book and smiled.

"Good evening, Bogdan," she said. "How's business?"

Bogdan shrugged. "It's slow."

The barista nodded sympathetically. "You know how it is. People are always looking for ways to escape the city."

Bogdan raised an eyebrow. "Escape? You mean like I do every time I step out of here?"

The woman chuckled. "I think you're more complicated than that, Bogdan. But yes, some people might say you have a... unique way of coping with the cold."

He sipped his coffee, watching as the stars began to twinkle overhead. It was moments like these that he cherished – quiet, stillness, and the knowledge that no one was watching.

As he finished his drink, Bogdan noticed a figure standing across the street, watching him. Tall and imposing, with piercing blue eyes that seemed to bore into his very soul. Bogdan felt a shiver run down his spine as the stranger's gaze met his, but he didn't flinch.

Over the years, he had grown accustomed to being watched. In Riga, everyone was someone's business. But this person... this one was different. He could sense it in the way they stood, like a dark sentinel guarding some long-forgotten secret.

Bogdan pushed his chair back and stood, his movements economical and controlled. As he passed by the stranger on the street, their eyes locked once more. This time, however, Bogdan felt no fear – only a spark of curiosity.

The game was on.
