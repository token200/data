Bogdan Boucher stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. He had been traveling for hours, and the solitude was starting to get to him. As he made his way through the empty hallways, the echoes of his footsteps seemed to follow him like a ghost.

A former spy, Bogdan had left the world of espionage behind after a mission gone sour left him with more scars than just physical. He'd tried to start anew, but the ghosts of his past kept popping up, and he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.

As he emerged into the crisp evening air, the sound of seagulls filled his ears, and for a moment, Bogdan felt a sense of peace wash over him. He had come to this small coastal town in search of solitude, hoping to lay low for a while and forget about the memories that haunted him.

But as he walked along the beach, the shadows seemed to move of their own accord, and the wind carried whispers on its breath. Bogdan's instincts prickled, and he quickened his pace, his eyes scanning the rooftops and alleyways for any sign of movement.

He'd always been good at disappearing, but in this town, it seemed like no one knew him from Adam. Or so he thought. As he turned a corner, a small café caught his eye, its neon sign flickering like a beacon in the darkness.

Bogdan pushed open the door and stepped inside, enveloped by the warm scent of coffee and baked goods. The patrons looked up as he entered, their faces a blur of curiosity and suspicion. He slid onto a stool at the counter, ordering a coffee with a low, gravelly voice that sent a shiver down his own spine.

For a moment, Bogdan closed his eyes, letting the heat of the cup seep into his skin, and let his mind wander back to a time when he was just another face in the crowd. But as he opened them again, he caught sight of a familiar figure across the room – a woman with piercing green eyes that seemed to see right through him.

Bogdan's instincts kicked in, and he knew he had to get out of there before things got any more complicated. He tossed some cash on the counter and slipped back into the night, leaving behind the past and the questions it brought with it.
