Bogdan Pelz stepped out of the rain-soaked streets and into the dimly lit tavern, shaking the water from his coat. A former member of the notorious Red Vipers gang, he had been forced to leave after a botched heist went awry. The memories still haunted him – the screams of the hostages, the feel of cold steel pressed against his temple.

As he made his way to the bar, the patrons eyed him warily. Word of his departure from the Red Vipers spread quickly through the underworld. Some whispered that he was dead, a pawn sacrificed for the gang's own gain. Others claimed he had defected, trading loyalty for leniency.

Bogdan ignored their whispers and ordered a whiskey at the bar. The bartender, a grizzled old man with a scar above his left eyebrow, raised an eyebrow as he poured the drink. "Welcome back, Pelz," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "Or is it welcome to stay away?"

Bogdan's gaze locked onto the bartender's, and for a moment, they shared a silent understanding. This was a man who knew secrets, men who owed favors, and debts that could be collected at any moment.

As he sipped his drink, a figure emerged from the shadows near the door – a woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She wore a long coat that seemed to swallow her whole, and Bogdan's instincts immediately prickled. This was someone he knew, someone who owed him a debt of gratitude.

"Bogdan," she said, her voice husky and confident. "I see you're keeping a low profile."

"Evie," he replied, his smile wide. "Long time no see. What brings you to this fine establishment?"

"I need your help," Evie said, her eyes glinting in the dim light. "A favor, old friend. One that requires...your unique set of skills."

Bogdan's gaze narrowed as he took another sip of his drink. He had thought himself above such dealings, but the promise of profit and revenge was tantalizing. And besides, Evie was a woman who knew how to make deals – and break them.

The rain pattered against the tavern windows like a slow drumbeat, reminding Bogdan that sometimes, you had to play both sides to come out on top. He leaned forward, his eyes locked onto Evie's, and whispered, "Tell me more."
