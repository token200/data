Elzbieta Alsbach stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. As she waited in line to order, she noticed a figure sitting alone at a small table by the window. It was him – Jack, the former colleague who had mysteriously disappeared several years ago.

Elzbieta's mind flashed back to their time working together at the marketing firm. They were an unlikely duo – he, the charismatic free spirit, and she, the analytical introvert. Yet, they clicked, sharing late-night conversations about everything from philosophy to science fiction. Jack had always been the one who pushed her out of her comfort zone, encouraging her to take risks.

After ordering her coffee, Elzbieta made her way over to Jack's table. He looked up as she approached, his eyes crinkling at the corners in a warm smile.

"Elzbieta Alsbach," he said, his voice low and smooth. "It's been too long."

They exchanged awkward small talk for a while, catching up on each other's lives. Jack had traveled extensively, working as a freelance writer and exploring new places. Elzbieta had continued to work in marketing, but her passion for photography had finally led her to start her own business.

As they talked, Elzbieta couldn't help but notice the way Jack's eyes sparkled when he laughed or the way his hair curled slightly at the nape of his neck. It was as if no time had passed at all, and yet, everything felt different – more grown-up, more confident.

Their conversation flowed effortlessly, like they were picking up where they left off years ago. Elzbieta found herself feeling alive again, like she'd been sleeping through life and Jack was the one to wake her up.

As they parted ways, promising to meet up soon, Elzbieta felt a sense of excitement she hadn't experienced in years. Maybe this chance encounter was just what she needed – a reminder that life was full of possibilities and people who could bring them to life.
