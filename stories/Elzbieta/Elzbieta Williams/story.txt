Elzbieta Williams was a force to be reckoned with in the small town of Willow Creek. A talented baker and owner of the local café, Elzbieta's warmth and kindness had won over the hearts of everyone who walked through her doors.

Despite her reserved nature, Elzbieta had a hidden talent for creating magical pastries that seemed to capture the essence of each customer who tasted them. Her famous "Sunrise Scones" were said to grant the eater a boost of energy and confidence, while her decadent chocolate cake was rumored to bring good fortune.
