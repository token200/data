As word of her work spread, Elzbieta began to receive invitations to speak at conferences and events across Europe, sharing her knowledge with fellow scientists and inspiring a new generation of ocean stewards. Though she never lost touch with her roots, Elzbieta's reputation as a leading expert in marine biology continued to grow, earning her the respect and admiration of her peers.

Throughout it all, Elzbieta remained true to herself, staying fiercely loyal to her family and community. Her parents had taught her the value of hard work, dedication, and a deep love for the land and sea that had given her so much.
