Hashimoto Adelberg was a name whispered in awe by those who knew him. A recluse and a genius, he spent most of his life locked away in his sprawling mansion on the outskirts of Tokyo, surrounded by an army of loyal servants and an obsession with science.

Few people had ever laid eyes on Hashimoto, but rumors of his groundbreaking research in genetic engineering spread like wildfire through the scientific community. Some said he was working on a cure for cancer, while others claimed he was attempting to create life itself from scratch.

Adelberg's true passion lay elsewhere – in the manipulation of DNA itself. He spent years studying the intricate patterns of the human genome, determined to unlock its secrets and push the boundaries of what was thought possible. His laboratory was a marvel of modern technology, equipped with state-of-the-art machinery that hummed and whirred as he worked tirelessly through the night.

Despite his reclusive nature, Hashimoto was not without controversy. Some saw him as a visionary, pushing the frontiers of human knowledge, while others viewed him as a madman, playing God with the fundamental building blocks of life. The debate raged on, fueled by whispers of Adelberg's latest discoveries – some astonishing, others terrifying.

One night, a young scientist named Yui received an invitation from Hashimoto himself to visit his laboratory. She was both thrilled and terrified at the prospect of meeting the enigmatic figure she had heard so much about. As she stepped off the train and onto the winding driveway that led up to Adelberg's mansion, she felt a shiver run down her spine.

The interior of the mansion was just as imposing as its exterior – vast corridors lined with rows of dusty bookshelves and flickering fluorescent lights cast eerie shadows on the walls. Hashimoto himself was nowhere to be seen, but Yui soon found herself in his presence, surrounded by swirling clouds of data and the hum of machinery that seemed to reverberate through every cell of her body.

"Welcome," he said, his eyes gleaming with an intensity that made Yui's skin prickle. "I have a proposition for you, one that will change your life forever."

As the hours passed, Yui found herself drawn into Adelberg's world – a realm where science and discovery blurred with madness and obsession. And she knew, in that moment, that she would never be the same again.
