Hashimoto Kortajarena stood alone on the windswept shores of the Pacific, the misty veil of dawn shrouding the waves. As the last remnants of night dissipated, he felt the weight of his existence settling upon him like a mantle.

He was a man of contradictions: a former musician turned reclusive artist, haunted by the ghost of a love lost and the whispers of a past life yet to be written. Kortajarena's fingers danced across the canvas as if grasping for a fleeting melody, the colors bleeding into one another in shades of gray and sorrow.

It had been years since his last performance on stage. The crowds that once thronged to hear him play now whispered stories of the enigmatic figure who haunted the fringes of the music world. His fingers still retained the scars from a life spent caressing strings, but the sound of his own voice was lost to the winds.

In the solitude of the morning, as the light wrestled with the shadows, Kortajarena allowed himself a fleeting memory – the laughter of an audience entranced by the symphony he wove. A smile crept onto his face like a sunrise breaking through the clouds. It was a small victory in a battle against the darkness that had consumed him.

And yet, even this solace came with its price: in the quiet hours before dawn, when only shadows danced upon walls and echoes whispered secrets, Kortajarena felt an unseen presence nudging at his shoulders – an unseen hand beckoning him toward paths he dare not tread. The mystery of his own life pulsed like a drumbeat, urging him to confront what lay beyond the labyrinthine corridors of memory.

The Pacific waves lapped against the shore as if trying to remind Kortajarena that there was more to existence than the fragmented stories etched onto canvas. That music, the language of love and loss, could be more than a recollection or an ache – but still he hesitated. Perhaps because in surrendering to its mystery, he might find forgiveness, and so shed some of his skin.

As the dawn climbed higher into the sky, Kortajarena finally took his brushes from their places, and brought them to life on his canvas once more. Though the melodies had grown silent for a long while now, with each stroke, the ghosts gathered around him – those memories that shrouded the light like the Pacific mist.
