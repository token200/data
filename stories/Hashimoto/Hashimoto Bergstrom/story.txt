Hashimoto Bergstrom was a recluse who lived on the outskirts of town, where the air was thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. Few people knew much about her, but those who did whispered stories of her peculiar habits and unyielding dedication to her craft.

As a taxidermist, Hashimoto spent most of her days cooped up in her small workshop, surrounded by an arsenal of tools and specimens that she lovingly arranged like a macabre still life. Her clients were often eccentric individuals who sought to commemorate their loved ones in the most unconventional ways possible – stuffed and mounted animals with glassy eyes that seemed to follow you around the room.

Despite her affinity for death and the macabre, Hashimoto's own past was shrouded in mystery. Some said she had been born into a family of renowned taxidermists, while others claimed she was a wanderer who stumbled upon the craft by chance. Whatever the truth may be, one thing was certain: Hashimoto Bergstrom was a master of her art.

One day, a young artist named Luna arrived at Hashimoto's doorstep, seeking to commission a piece that would make her stand out from the crowd. As they sat down to discuss the project, Luna couldn't help but notice the peculiar array of artifacts on Hashimoto's walls – vintage medical equipment, antique dolls with glassy eyes, and even a mounted owl perched atop a velvet pedestal.

Hashimoto watched Luna's fascination with a keen eye, her expression unreadable behind a veil of worn leather skin. "I make my clients whole again," she said finally, her voice low and husky as she carefully wrapped a piece of fabric around the body of a stuffed rabbit. "They find comfort in the beauty of death."

Luna's eyes widened as she gazed upon Hashimoto Bergstrom's work – a testament to the power of transformation, no matter how fleeting it may be. And in that moment, she knew that she would never see the world in the same way again.
