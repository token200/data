Adriana Bērziņš stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the bustling streets of Riga, her eyes scanning the crowded market square. The sun was setting over the Baltic Sea, casting a warm orange glow over the scene before her. She breathed in deeply, taking in the smell of fresh bread and fish from the nearby vendors.

As a young woman with a fierce determination burning within her, Adriana had grown up on these streets, learning to navigate the city's winding alleys and secret passageways like a native. Her eyes gleamed with a spark of mischief as she wove through the crowds, pausing to smile at a familiar face or toss a coin to a beggar.

But despite her carefree exterior, Adriana was on a mission. She had received a cryptic message from an old acquaintance, hinting at the existence of a hidden treasure buried deep within the city's ancient walls. The note read only: "Where the wolves howl, look for the key."

Adriana's heart skipped a beat as she pondered the riddle. Wolves? How could that possibly lead to a treasure? She tucked the note into her pocket and continued her search, retracing her steps through the market square.

As she turned a corner, Adriana spotted a small antique shop tucked away between two larger buildings. The sign above the door read "Curios and Antiques," and she felt an inexplicable pull to enter. Inside, the shop was dimly lit, with shelves upon shelves of dusty trinkets and mysterious artifacts.

The proprietor, an elderly woman with piercing green eyes, looked up from behind the counter as Adriana entered. "Welcome, young one," she said, her voice low and husky. "I see you're searching for something."

Adriana nodded warily, unsure how much to reveal. But there was something about the old woman's knowing gaze that put her at ease.

"Perhaps," the proprietor suggested, nodding towards a small display case in the corner of the shop. "That wolf's head necklace might be just what you're looking for."

Adriana's eyes widened as she approached the case. The necklace was made of solid silver, adorned with intricate carvings of wolves and other animals. She felt an inexplicable jolt of connection to it.

"Yes," she said finally, reaching out to claim the necklace. "This is it."

As soon as her fingers wrapped around the pendant, Adriana knew that her life would never be the same. The old woman smiled, a knowing glint in her eye.

"Ah, but you'll see," she said, patting the case shut. "That wolf's head necklace will set you on a path from which there is no return."
