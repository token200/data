Nils Faust trudged through the snow-covered streets, his eyes fixed on the ground. He had lost count of the days since his last cigarette, and the ache in his chest was starting to feel like home. It was a cold, unforgiving world out there, but Nils knew that's where he belonged.

As he turned a corner, the neon lights of a dingy bar beckoned him inside. He pushed open the door and stepped into the dimly lit room, where the bartender greeted him with a nod. "The usual, Nils?" she asked, already reaching for his favorite whiskey.

Nils took a seat at the bar, running a calloused hand through his hair. It was a habit he'd developed over years of living on the streets, but it still gave him a small measure of comfort. He watched as the bartender expertly poured his drink, her eyes locked on his with a mixture of concern and familiarity.

Nils had been a troublemaker even back in school – always pushing boundaries, never playing by the rules. But after dropping out and hitting the streets, he'd found that his natural charisma was just enough to keep him from starving. He'd taken on odd jobs here and there, worked as a bouncer for a short while, but eventually, it all started to feel like too much.

That's when he met her – Lena, with her wild curls and infectious laugh. She'd been working at the bar when Nils first walked in, and from that moment on, they were inseparable. Lena had a way of calming him down, of making him see that there was more to life than just getting by.

But even Lena couldn't save him from his demons. After she left, Nils found himself lost and alone once again. He drifted through the city, taking whatever work he could find, but nothing seemed to stick. And so, with every passing day, the ache in his chest grew, a constant reminder that he was still just one step away from disaster.

Nils raised the glass to his lips, feeling the burn of the whiskey as it touched his tongue. He took a sip, closed his eyes, and let the pain wash over him. It was a familiar sensation, one he knew all too well – but for a moment, at least, it was something to hold onto.
