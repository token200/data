Nils Evans stepped off the train and onto the platform, his worn boots making a familiar scuffling sound on the metal grating. He stretched his tall frame, feeling the ache in his shoulders from the long journey. As he made his way through the crowded station, Nils Evans scanned the faces of the passengers, searching for one person in particular.

He spotted her sitting by the window, lost in thought as she gazed out at the sea of rooftops beyond the water's edge. Nils Evans smiled to himself as he quickened his pace, excitement building in his chest. It had been months since they'd last seen each other, and he couldn't wait to be reunited with Lena.

As he approached her, Lena looked up, catching sight of him in time to flash a radiant smile. Nils Evans felt his heart swell in response, his hands reaching out to wrap around hers as she rose from the bench. "Long time no see," he whispered, his eyes drinking in the sight of her.

Lena laughed, pulling him into a tight hug that left them both breathless. They stood there for a moment, the sounds of the station fading into the background as they simply held each other. Then, with a reluctant sigh, Lena stepped back and Nils Evans wrapped an arm around her waist, drawing her close once more.

The sun was setting over the water now, casting a warm golden light over the scene before them. Nils Evans felt at peace in this moment, with Lena by his side. They stood there for a long time, lost in their own little world of love and happiness.

Eventually, they broke apart to survey the unfamiliar surroundings. "We're here," Lena said softly, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "Time to explore."

Nils Evans grinned, leading Lena out into the bright sunlight that spilled across the bustling streets beyond the station. Hand in hand, they vanished into the throngs of people, ready to face whatever lay ahead together. As they walked, Nils Evans knew he had found his forever home â€“ with Lena by his side, and a whole new world waiting for them just around the corner.
