Nils Jun was a man consumed by his work. A renowned forensic psychologist, he spent most of his waking hours studying the darkest corners of the human mind. His focus was on understanding what drove individuals to commit heinous crimes, and how to prevent such atrocities from occurring.

One day, Nils received an urgent call from the police department. They had a new case that required his expertise: a series of brutal murders that seemed to be linked to an abandoned asylum on the outskirts of town. As Nils arrived at the scene, he was met with a sense of unease. The air was thick with tension, and the victims all shared one thing in common - they had been patients at the asylum years ago.

As Nils delved deeper into the case, he became increasingly fascinated by the psychological profile of the killer. He spent hours poring over the victim's medical records, studying their therapy sessions, and reviewing their interactions with other patients. The more he learned, the more convinced he became that the killer was not just a mindless monster - but someone who had been shaped by their experiences at the asylum.

Nils' obsession with the case took a toll on his personal life. His colleagues began to worry about his well-being, as he barely slept or ate for days on end. But Nils couldn't shake off the feeling that he was close to cracking the code. He became convinced that the killer was trying to send him a message - one that only he could decipher.

The night before the trial, Nils sat in his darkened office, surrounded by papers and files. He was on the verge of a breakthrough when suddenly, the lights flickered and went out. In the darkness, Nils felt a presence behind him. He spun around, but it was too late. A figure loomed over him, its eyes glowing in the dark.

In that moment, Nils realized that he had been wrong all along. The killer wasn't trying to send him a message - they were trying to consume him. As the darkness closed in, Nils knew that his own demons would be his downfall. He was no longer just a psychologist; he had become one of the very monsters he had spent years studying.

The next morning, the police found Nils' office in disarray. His files were scattered everywhere, and his phone lay shattered on the floor. But there was no sign of him. It was as if Nils Jun had vanished into thin air, leaving behind only the echoes of his own twisted psyche.
