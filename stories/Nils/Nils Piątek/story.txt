I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Nils Piątek. It is possible that this character is not well-known or was created for a specific purpose.

However, I can create a story about a fictional character named Nils Piątek if you would like. Please let me know what kind of story you are interested in (e.g. adventure, romance, sci-fi), and I will do my best to craft an engaging tale.

If you would like, I can also suggest some alternatives for the character's name. For example, Nils Piątek has a Polish origin, which could be interesting if you're looking to incorporate elements of Polish culture into your story.

Let me know how I can assist you!
