As he grew older, Nils' love for art and music only deepened, leading him to pursue a career as a musician. He formed a band with some friends from high school and began performing locally, playing folk-inspired melodies on the fiddle and accordion.

Nils Polo's big break came when a talent scout from Oslo stumbled upon one of his performances at a small venue in Ålesund. The scout was impressed by Nils' raw talent and charisma on stage, and soon he was offered a record deal with a major Norwegian label.
