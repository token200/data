Sakurai Ruiz Garcia was a name that struck fear into the hearts of those who knew it. A former thief and con artist, Sakurai had built a reputation for being untouchable, always staying one step ahead of the law. But after a particularly close call with the authorities, Sakurai decided to leave their life of crime behind and start fresh.

Renaming themselves "Ruiz" in an effort to erase their past, Sakurai set out to build a new identity for themselves. They took up work as a private investigator, using their skills to help those in need rather than lining their own pockets. It wasn't long before Ruiz's services were in high demand, and they found themselves working with some of the most powerful people in the city.

Despite their newfound success, Sakurai couldn't shake the feeling that they were still being watched. They would catch glimpses of a figure out of the corner of their eye, only to turn and find no one there. It was as if their past self was still lurking in the shadows, waiting for its chance to strike.

As Ruiz delved deeper into each case, they began to uncover a web of deceit that went far beyond anything they could have imagined. Corruption and greed seemed to seep from every pore of the city's elite, and Ruiz knew they had to do something to expose them. But with their own past still threatening to derail everything, Ruiz couldn't help but wonder if they were truly ready for this kind of danger.

One night, as Ruiz pored over a particularly incriminating file, Sakurai Ruiz Garcia appeared in the doorway, a mischievous glint in their eye. For a moment, Ruiz's composure was broken, and they saw the old thief staring back at them. But then, like a ghost, Sakurai vanished into thin air, leaving Ruiz to wonder if it had all been just a product of their own paranoid imagination.
