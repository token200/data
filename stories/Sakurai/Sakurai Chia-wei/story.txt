Sakurai Chia-wei stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the cityscape. The wind whipped through her dark hair, and she felt a sense of freedom that she rarely experienced in her daily life as a skilled operative.

Chia-wei was known for her razor-sharp instincts and unparalleled agility. She had been trained by the best, and it showed in every move she made, every decision she took. Her employers didn't always understand why they paid her so much to get the job done quietly, but Chia-wei knew that sometimes a whisper wasn't enough.

As she scanned the rooftops below, a faint noise caught her attention. It was the soft thud of footsteps, followed by the rustle of fabric. Chia-wei's eyes narrowed; this was no ordinary pedestrian. She reached for her comms device, but it remained silent â€“ another indication that this job was personal.

A figure emerged from the shadows, a woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. "Sakurai Chia-wei," she said, her voice low and husky. "I've been searching for you."

Chia-wei raised an eyebrow; who knew they had a connection? But something about the stranger's demeanor put her on edge. Maybe it was the way she seemed to know exactly what Chia-wei was thinking, or maybe it was just her gut.

"I'm not here," Chia-wei lied, trying to keep her tone even.

The woman chuckled, a low, throaty sound that sent shivers down Chia-wei's spine. "Oh, I think you are," she said, stepping closer. "You see, we both work for the same people. The ones who pull the strings from behind the scenes."

Chia-wei's mind raced; what was going on? Who was this woman, and why did she seem so confident?

The green-eyed stranger took a step closer, her eyes locking onto Chia-wei's. "We need to talk," she said, her voice dripping with menace.

For a moment, the two women stood there, locked in a silent understanding. Then, without another word, the stranger turned and leapt off the rooftop, disappearing into the night.
