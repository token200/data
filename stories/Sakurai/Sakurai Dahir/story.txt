Sakurai Dahir was known for his unconventional approach to life. A free-spirited individual with a passion for art and music, he lived life on his own terms. Born Sakurai Dahir to a traditional Japanese family, he grew up surrounded by the beauty of nature and the sounds of traditional instruments.

As a child, Dahir spent hours listening to the stories of his grandmother, who was a skilled taiko drummer. Entranced by her rhythmic beats, he began to mimic the sounds with his own hands, creating an impromptu percussion section in their backyard. His parents, though perplexed by his interest, encouraged his creativity, recognizing the unique spark within him.

As Dahir matured, his artistic expression evolved into a captivating blend of traditional Japanese instruments and Western influences.

In that moment, Sakurai Dahir knew he had found his purpose – to use his art as a bridge between cultures and hearts. As he gazed out at the sea of faces, he felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude toward his grandmother's drumming lessons, which had set him on this winding path.
