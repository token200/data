Sakurai Lewandowska stepped into the dimly lit cafe, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of her missing friend, Kaida. It had been three days since she'd last seen her, and Sakurai was growing increasingly worried. As a renowned detective in her own right, Sakurai couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off.

She took a seat at the bar, ordering a cup of black coffee as she pulled out her phone to check for any messages from Kaida's last known location. The screen read nothing but dead air, fueling Sakurai's growing unease.

Just then, the door swung open and in walked a tall, imposing figure - Ryota, a former colleague turned rival. His eyes locked onto Sakurai, a sly smile spreading across his face. "Ah, Sakurai Lewandowska, I see you're still stuck on this case."

Sakurai's grip on her coffee cup tightened as she rose from her seat. "What do you know about Kaida's disappearance?" she demanded.

Ryota chuckled, taking a seat next to her at the bar. "Oh, I know just enough to make it interesting. You see, Kaida and I used to be partners - on a case that went horribly wrong. She's been hiding from me for years, Sakurai Lewandowska."

The words cut deep, but Sakurai refused to let Ryota's taunts get the better of her. "I won't back down," she said coolly. "Tell me what you know."

Ryota leaned in, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Let's just say I have reason to believe Kaida was working on something big - something that could bring down the entire organization we used to work for."

Sakurai's eyes narrowed, her mind racing with possibilities. She knew she had to act fast if she was going to find Kaida before it was too late. With a newfound determination, she pushed Ryota away and set out into the night, ready to follow any lead that might bring her closer to her missing friend.

As she disappeared into the shadows, Sakurai Lewandowska knew she was in for the fight of her life - but she was determined to come out on top.
