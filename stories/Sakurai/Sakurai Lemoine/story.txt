Sakurai Lemoine stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the bustling streets of Tokyo. As the city's most infamous ghost hunter, he had grown accustomed to the eerie atmosphere that clung to his skin like a damp shroud.

Lemoine's eyes scanned the crowded streets, his gaze lingering on the vibrant neon signs and the throngs of people rushing to and fro. It was a city that never slept, and neither did Lemoine. He was always on the move, always on the hunt for something beyond the veil of the living.

A soft breeze rustled his hair, carrying with it the whispers of the dead. Lemoine's ears perked up, and he followed the sound to a small caf√© tucked away in a quiet corner of the city. The sign above the door read "Kokoro no Hana," or "Flowers of the Heart."

Lemoine pushed open the door, and a bell above it rang out softly. Inside, the air was thick with incense and the scent of fresh flowers. A woman with piercing green eyes looked up from behind the counter, her gaze locking onto Lemoine's.

"Ah, Sakurai-san," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I've been expecting you."

Lemoine nodded, his expression inscrutable. He had worked with this woman, a medium known only as Yumi, on countless occasions before. Together, they navigated the world of the dead, seeking out lost souls and resolving unfinished business.

Yumi gestured for Lemoine to sit, and he did so, his eyes fixed on the small tea set in front of him. A delicate china cup and saucer adorned with cherry blossoms sat on a nearby table, filled with a fragrant green tea.

As they sipped their tea, Yumi outlined her plan for the evening's hunt: a young woman named Emiko, who had died under mysterious circumstances just last week. Lemoine listened intently, his mind already racing with possibilities.

With a quiet nod, he stood, and together they set out into the night, ready to face whatever lay beyond the edge of the world. The city might be alive, but for Sakurai Lemoine, it was only ever on the cusp of death.
