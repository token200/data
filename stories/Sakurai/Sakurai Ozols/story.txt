Entranced by the spectacle, Kaito felt an inexplicable connection to the mysterious figure.

Afterward, Sakurai Ozols approached Kaito with a hint of curiosity in his eyes. "You have potential," he said, "but first, you must learn to quiet your mind." And so, Kaito began his apprenticeship under Sakurai Ozols' guidance.

Under Sakurai Ozols' tutelage, Kaito discovered the depth and complexity of Luminari. With each passing day, he grew stronger, more agile, and more confident in his abilities.
