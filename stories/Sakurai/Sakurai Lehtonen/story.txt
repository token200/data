Sakurai Lehtonen sat at his desk, staring out the window at the grey Helsinki sky. As a renowned detective with the Helsingin Poliisi, he had seen it all - from gruesome murders to high-stakes espionage. But nothing could have prepared him for the case that was currently keeping him up at night.

The body of a young woman had been found in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town, her face frozen in a permanent scream. The only clue was a small note left at the scene, with a cryptic message scrawled in red ink: "Eri valintatapa".

Sakurai's eyes narrowed as he thought back to the words. Eri valintatapa - it was an old phrase from Finnish folklore, meaning "every way is wrong". He knew that this case would require all his skills and experience to crack.

As he pondered the mystery, Sakurai's mind kept wandering back to the victim. She had been a beautiful young woman, with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. But what was her story? Who had killed her, and why?

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was his partner, Lieutenant Mika Tiihonen. "Sakurai, we've got something," he said, holding up a small piece of evidence. "This was found on the victim's phone - a text message from an unknown number."

Sakurai took the phone and examined it carefully. The screen showed a message that sent a chill down his spine: "You'll never find me". Suddenly, the cryptic phrase made sense. Eri valintatapa meant every path was wrong - but what if they were all pointing to the same conclusion?

With newfound determination, Sakurai turned to Mika and said, "Let's get to work. We have a killer to catch." Together, they began poring over the evidence, following every lead no matter how small. As they delved deeper into the case, Sakurai knew that he was getting closer to unraveling the mystery.

But would it be enough? The city of Helsinki was full of secrets and lies, and Sakurai knew that in this game, nothing was ever as straightforward as it seemed. Still, he was determined to solve the case, no matter what it took. After all, as a detective, it was his duty to uncover the truth - even if it meant walking down every path that led to the wrong conclusion.
