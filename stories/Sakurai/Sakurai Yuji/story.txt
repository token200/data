Sakurai Yuji's thoughts were interrupted by a familiar voice, "Yuji! What are you doing out here?" It was his best friend, Nakamura Kaito, who had joined him on the streets. Sakurai Yuji smiled, "Just taking a walk, Kaito-san. Clearing my head before our next sparring session."

Nakamura Kaito chuckled, "You and your love for martial arts, Yuji. You're going to wear yourself out one of these days." Sakurai Yuji playfully rolled his eyes, "Hey, someone has to keep you on your toes, right?"

As they continued their stroll, the conversation turned to their upcoming match against a rival dojo. Sakurai Yuji's competitive spirit flared up, and he began to rehearse his techniques in his mind. Nakamura Kaito, sensing his friend's focus, nodded encouragingly, "You've got this, Yuji. You're going to take them down."

The tension between the two friends was palpable as they approached the dojo. With a deep breath, Sakurai Yuji steeled himself for the challenge ahead. His dedication to Master Tanaka's teachings and his own growth had made him a formidable opponent, and he was determined to prove it.
