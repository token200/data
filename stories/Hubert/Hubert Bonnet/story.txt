Hubert Bonnet, a Frenchman in his mid-fifties with a wild shock of white hair and a bushy mustache to match, sat alone at a small café on the outskirts of Paris. His eyes scanned the room, taking in the sounds and smells of the bustling city outside.

It was 1962, and Hubert had just received news that his brother, Pierre, had gone missing during the Algerian War. Hubert's mind was flooded with memories of their childhood, playing cricket on the sun-drenched fields of the French countryside. He remembered the countless arguments they'd had over politics, and how their differences had grown wider with each passing year.

As he nursed his coffee, a young woman with bright pink hair and a paint-splattered apron caught his eye. She was a street artist, and Hubert couldn't help but notice the way she laughed with the café patrons. He struck up a conversation, learning that her name was Colette, and she'd lost her own brother in the war.

Their talk turned to Pierre's disappearance, and Hubert began to open up about his own fears and doubts. Colette listened intently, her eyes sparkling with understanding. As the hours passed, the café emptied, leaving only Hubert, Colette, and a handful of stray cats as patrons.

The night air was alive with music, and Colette pulled out her guitar. She began to play a haunting melody that sent shivers down Hubert's spine. The sounds blended with the hum of the city outside, creating an otherworldly symphony that seemed to connect them both to Pierre's spirit.

In that moment, Hubert felt a sense of peace wash over him. Colette took his hand, and together they gazed up at the stars twinkling above. It was as if their paths had converged by chance, but also because of something deeper – a shared understanding of loss and longing.

As the night drew to a close, Hubert rose from his seat, determined to find Pierre's brother's whereabouts. Colette handed him her address, inscribing it on a cigarette box with a bright pink marker: "For the lost souls of our past."
