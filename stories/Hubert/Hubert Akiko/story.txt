One night, Hubert set his sights on the most secure facility in Tokyo: the Ministry of Justice. The target was a priceless artifact known as the "Dragon's Eye," a gemstone rumored to grant immense power to its owner. With meticulous planning and precision execution, Hubert infiltrated the building, avoiding security cameras and guards with ease.

As he made his way deeper into the complex, Hubert felt a thrill of excitement coursing through his veins. This was the ultimate challenge, the crowning jewel in his career as a thief.
