One sunny afternoon, as Hubert Müller was setting up for a new exhibition, a young girl wandered into his studio. She had heard whispers about the enigmatic artist who painted masterpieces in a cluttered corner of the city. The girl's eyes widened as she took in the kaleidoscope of colors surrounding her.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the studio, Hubert Müller Müller leaned against his easel, exhausted but content.
