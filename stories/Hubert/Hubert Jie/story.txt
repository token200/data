Hubert Jie was a man of mystery and intrigue. As a skilled thief and con artist, he had made a name for himself in the underworld of New Haven's seedy districts. Few people knew much about him, but those who did whispered stories of his uncanny ability to talk his way out of any situation.

Hubert Jie, whose real name was never known by anyone outside of his family, had grown up on the streets, surviving by his wits and cunning. He had honed his skills as a young man, working for small-time fences and hustlers before eventually striking out on his own.

Despite his reputation as a master thief, Hubert Jie was not a malicious person. He had a code of honor, one that dictated he only steal from those who could afford it, and never from the vulnerable or innocent. It was a philosophy that guided him in all aspects of his life, from his relationships to his business dealings.

One night, Hubert Jie received a mysterious offer from a wealthy collector to steal a priceless artifact from a heavily guarded museum. The catch: the item was said to be cursed, and anyone who took it would face dire consequences. Hubert Jie was intrigued by the challenge, but also wary of the risks.

As he weighed his options, Hubert Jie couldn't help but think back to his childhood, when his parents had first told him about the legend of the cursed artifact. They had warned him that some secrets were better left unexplored, and that sometimes it was wise to leave well enough alone. But Hubert Jie was a man who lived by his own rules, and he couldn't resist the allure of the unknown.

With a deep breath, Hubert Jie made his decision. He would take on the job, but with one condition: he wanted a 50-50 split of the profits, no matter what happened next. The collector agreed, and so began Hubert Jie's most daring adventure yet. Only time would tell if he had made a pact with fate itself.
