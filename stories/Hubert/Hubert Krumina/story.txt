Hubert Krumina was a man shrouded in mystery, his past a tangled web of secrets and half-truths. As he stood on the rooftop, gazing out over the city, the wind whipping through his unkempt hair, it seemed as though he belonged to no one at all.

Born Hubert Krumina, the son of a failed artist and a struggling single mother, he had always felt like an outsider looking in. Growing up, he'd been shuffled from one foster home to another, never quite finding a place where he truly fit. His parents' tumultuous relationship had left him with more emotional scars than he could count.

Despite the hardships he'd faced, Hubert had managed to forge ahead, determined to make a name for himself. He'd studied architecture, but his true passion lay elsewhere – in the world of photography. Capturing moments, telling stories through images: that's what drove him.

But as with so many things, reality had gotten in the way. His portfolio had gathered dust on the shelves of an abandoned studio, and the photographs within told a story of disappointment rather than triumph.

Hubert Krumina's thoughts drifted back to his childhood, where he'd spent hours listening to his mother read poetry by Langston Hughes. The words had spoken directly to him – to him, this outsider looking in. They'd given him a sense of belonging he couldn't quite grasp as an adult.

With renewed purpose, Hubert Krumina turned away from the city's steel and concrete canyons and made his way towards a nearby park. As he walked through the verdant greenery, cameras slung over his shoulder, he began to feel like he was finally coming home – to himself, at least.
