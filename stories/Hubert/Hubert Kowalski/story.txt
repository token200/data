Hubert Kowalski, a rough-around-the-edges Polish-American, stood outside his small diner, wiping down the counter with a dirty rag. The neon sign above the door flickered in the fading light of day, casting an eerie glow on the deserted street. It was 5 PM, and already the place was empty.

Hubert had inherited the diner from his father, who had taken over from his own father before him. It was a family tradition, passed down through generations of Kowalskis. But Hubert had never been one for tradition. He liked things done his way, with a shot of whiskey and a dash of attitude.

As he finished cleaning the counter, the door swung open and in walked Jack, a local reporter from the city newspaper. "Hey, Hank," Jack said, using Hubert's nickname without asking permission first time. "I'm writing a story on the state of small-town America, and I figure your diner is the epitome of it."

Hubert raised an eyebrow. "Small town?" he snorted. "This place isn't small town, kid. This is hubris. We're the only game in town, and we like it that way."

Jack smiled politely. "I'll make sure to keep that in mind when I write my article. But seriously, Hank, your diner has a certain... charm. Can you tell me a bit about its history?"

Hubert snorted again. "You want the story? Alright, kid. My great-grandfather came here from Poland with nothing but a suitcase full of hopes and dreams. He worked his tail off to build this place from scratch. Now it's my turn to carry on the tradition."

As Jack scribbled down notes, Hubert busied himself prepping for the dinner rush. A young couple walked in, laughing and holding hands. Hubert greeted them with a smile, pouring them each a glass of fresh-squeezed lemonade without being asked.

"You know, kid," he said to Jack as they sat down at the counter, "this place may be small, but it's got heart."

Jack scribbled some more notes before asking if Hubert had any family photos that could accompany his story. Hubert's eyes clouded over for a moment, and he handed Jack an old black-and-white photograph of himself as a young man.

"That's my wife, Anna," Hubert said softly. "She passed away five years ago."

As Jack finished up his notes and prepared to leave, Hubert gave him a nod of thanks. "Tell the world about small-town America, kid. Just don't forget the heart."
