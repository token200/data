Hubert Pelz was known for his peculiar occupation as a professional line-stander. By day, he'd don a suit and tie, and by night, he'd wait in line for anyone who needed him to take their place. It was a strange skill set, but one that Hubert had honed over the years.

Hubert's clients ranged from new smartphone buyers waiting in line for hours at the Apple store to concert-goers hoping to snag tickets to a sold-out show. He'd wait patiently, sometimes for days, until his client's place in line was called. In return, he'd receive a small fee and the satisfaction of knowing he'd made someone else's life easier.

One day, Hubert received a call from a wealthy client who needed him to wait in line for a rare vinyl record release. The catch? The record store was located on the other side of town, and there were no lines to be found. Undeterred, Hubert set off early that morning, determined to find a way into the building.

After some digging, he discovered a back entrance where he could wait in line while remaining out of sight. As the hours ticked by, Hubert's patience was rewarded when a customer stormed out, unable to wait any longer. Seizing his chance, Hubert stepped forward and claimed the spot as his own. He purchased the record and delivered it to his grateful client.

As he walked back to his office, Hubert couldn't help but think that being a line-stander was more than just a quirky job â€“ it was an art form. He'd learned to appreciate the quiet moments spent waiting, observing people from afar as they grew impatient or elated. And at the end of the day, there was no feeling quite like knowing he'd made someone's life a little bit easier.

Hubert returned to his desk, a satisfied smile on his face. It had been just another day in the life of Hubert Pelz, professional line-stander extraordinaire.
