Hubert Lāce trudged through the misty streets, his worn leather boots making soft squelching sounds in the damp pavement. A former detective with a penchant for getting in over his head, Hubert had long since traded in his badge for a humble life as a private investigator.

His office, a cramped room above a vintage bookstore, was cluttered with dusty files and faded photographs. The walls seemed to sag under the weight of Hubert's own failures, but he didn't mind. This was where he belonged – amidst the detritus of other people's lives.

A knock at the door interrupted his reverie. "Come in," he grunted, not looking up from the stack of paperwork on his desk.

It was Henrietta, a pert little woman with a clipboard and a look that could curdle milk at twenty paces. She handed Hubert a folder filled with photographs and documents, her eyes scanning him with an air of superiority. "You're the one they call 'The Lāce', detective-turned- private-eye," she said, as if that was something to be proud of.

Hubert snorted, flipping through the contents of the folder. A faded Polaroid of a young woman, presumably his latest client; a handful of hastily scribbled notes on 'the art of seduction'; and a single sheet with an ominous warning scrawled in red ink: "Don't trust him".

"You think I need some kid's warnings to remind me how to do my job?" Hubert snarled, stuffing the folder back into Henrietta's hands.

For once, she seemed taken aback. "You've been warned before, detective," she whispered, her eyes darting around the cramped room as if searching for an escape route.

Hubert chuckled wryly, rubbing his temples with a weathered hand. He'd had plenty of close calls in his time – close calls that had ended with his own tail being between his legs. But Henrietta was right; this job wasn't for him anymore. Or at least, not as much as he once thought.

He leaned back in his chair, letting the shadows dance across his face. Maybe it was time to retire. After all, there were enough mysteries waiting outside these dingy walls to keep even a washed-up detective like Hubert Lāce on his toes.

For now, though, he just sat and stared into space – watching the mist creep in, and listening for the whispers of old ghosts from the other side of the desk.
