Hubert Straume, a man with an unconventional past, walked into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room as if searching for someone. He had always been a solitary figure, preferring to keep to himself, but lately, he'd found himself drawn to the hum of human activity.

As he waited in line, his mind wandered back to his childhood, growing up on the streets of Oslo. Hubert Straume, then just a young boy, had learned to rely on his wits and cunning to survive. His early years had been marked by poverty and hardship, but also a fierce determination to make something of himself.

The barista, a bright-eyed young woman with a pierced nose, asked him what he wanted. Hubert Straume ordered a black coffee, his voice low and smooth. He took a seat at the counter, watching as the other patrons laughed and chatted.

A group of rowdy students stumbled in, their boisterous laughter echoing through the café. Hubert Straume's eyes narrowed slightly; he didn't take kindly to disruptions. As they took their seats, one of them caught his eye – a young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She looked lost, alone, and adrift.

Over the next few hours, Hubert Straume watched her, sensing a kindred spirit in this stranger. He noticed how she nursed a cup of coffee, her gaze drifting towards the door as if searching for an escape. As the night wore on, he found himself wanting to intervene, to offer some comfort or guidance.

But something held him back. Perhaps it was his own history, or maybe it was simply his tendency to keep people at arm's length. Whatever the reason, Hubert Straume remained still, observing as the young woman's eyes began to well up with tears.

As she gathered her belongings and prepared to leave, their paths crossed in a brief, fleeting moment. Hubert Straume offered a nod of acknowledgement, his face expressionless. The young woman smiled weakly, then vanished into the night.

As he finished his coffee, Hubert Straume rose from his seat, feeling an inexplicable sense of emptiness. He had watched a fellow traveler pass through, and for the first time in years, he felt a pang of longing. But it was quickly snuffed out by the familiar weight of his own solitude. With a quiet sigh, Hubert Straume turned and left the café, disappearing into the Oslo night.
