Hubert Pierre Moreau was a man shrouded in mystery. Few people knew much about his past, but those who did spoke of him in hushed tones. He was a private individual, preferring to keep to himself and avoid the spotlight.

Despite this, Hubert's reputation preceded him. He was a master thief, known for his cunning and skill. His exploits had been featured in the papers, with headlines like "The Fox Strikes Again" or "Hubert Moreau Pulls Off Daring Heist."

But despite his notoriety, Hubert seemed to be beyond reproach. He was charming and charismatic, able to talk his way out of even the most precarious situations. Those who knew him described him as confident and self-assured, with a quick wit and a silver tongue.

One night, Hubert found himself at a high-stakes poker game in an exclusive club in the city. The other players were all wealthy socialites and business tycoons, but Hubert didn't care. He was there to win, no matter what it took.

As the cards were dealt and the betting began, Hubert played his hand with precision. He read his opponents expertly, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. The hours passed, with Hubert steadily racking up a sizeable pot.

But just as he was about to leave with the winnings, one of the players called out, "I don't think you've won enough, Hubert Moreau." It turned out that the dealer had made an error, and the other player claimed the entire pot. Hubert's face darkened, but he kept his cool.

"I apologize for the mistake," he said, with a smile. "But I think it's only fair that we start again from scratch."

The room fell silent, as all eyes turned to Hubert Moreau. No one expected him to behave like this. It was almost... humane. The other players slowly began to nod in agreement, and the game resumed.

In the end, Hubert walked away with a tidy profit, his reputation intact. He had proven once again that he was more than just a master thief - he was a gentleman of his word.
