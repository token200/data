Hubert Verdi was a man with a reputation for being one step ahead of the law. A master thief and con artist, he had been swindling the wealthy elite out of their fortunes for years. With a quick wit and a silver tongue, he could talk his way into – or out of – any situation.

Hubert's latest mark was a wealthy socialite named Vivian LaRue. He had been watching her from afar, studying her every move, and waiting for the perfect moment to strike. That moment came when Vivian's family announced that they would be hosting an extravagant charity gala at their estate, and Hubert saw it as his chance to get in.

Disguising himself as a catering staff member, Hubert arrived at the estate on the day of the gala, carrying a tray of champagne flutes. As he mingled with the guests, sipping champagne and making small talk, he began to work his magic. Vivian, entranced by Hubert's charisma and charm, found herself swept up in conversation with him, discussing everything from art to philosophy.

But as the night wore on, Hubert began to feel a pang of guilt. He had never been one for sentimentality, but there was something about Vivian that made him want to keep her from harm. Maybe it was the way she laughed at his jokes or the way she listened with such rapt attention to everything he said.

As the night drew to a close, Hubert realized that he couldn't bring himself to carry out his original plan. He handed Vivian's phone number to her and told her that if she ever needed anything, to just give him a call. Then, under the guise of a friendly farewell, he slipped away into the night.

Over the next few weeks, Hubert found himself looking forward to Vivian's calls, listening with rapt attention as she told him about her day or shared some funny joke. He began to see her in a different light – not just as a potential mark, but as a person.

Eventually, Hubert realized that he had fallen for Vivian LaRue hard. But would she ever be able to forgive him for his past transgressions? Only time would tell. For now, Hubert smiled to himself, knowing that sometimes it's okay to take a chance on love.
