Riccardo Giovanni Makinen was known for his unwavering passion for woodworking and restoration. A Finnish-Swedish carpenter by trade, he spent most of his days tinkering in his cluttered workshop, surrounded by half-finished projects and the scent of freshly cut wood.

Makinen's eyes sparkled with excitement as he carefully sanded down a worn wooden table, revealing the rich patina that lay beneath. He had purchased the piece at an estate sale years ago, and it was only now, after countless hours of restoration, that he felt it was ready for its new home.

As he worked, Makinen's mind wandered back to his childhood in Helsinki, where his grandfather had taught him the art of traditional Finnish woodworking. It was a skill that had stuck with him throughout the years, even as he pursued other careers and interests.

Despite his success in business, Makinen found solace in the quiet, methodical world of woodworking. There was something meditative about working with wood, he believed – the way it responded to his touch, the way it yielded to pressure and shape.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the workshop, Makinen stepped back to admire his handiwork. The table was now a beautiful, dark-stained oak, its surface smooth to the touch. He felt a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over him – it was moments like these that reminded him why he had dedicated his life to this craft.

Makinen's full name seemed fitting in that moment – Giovanni, meaning "God is gracious," and Makinen, which meant "son of the maker." It was as if the universe had conspired to bring him back to this point, where woodworking and craftsmanship reigned supreme. With a satisfied smile, he wrapped his hands around the table's legs, feeling a deep connection to the wood, to the tools, and to the memories that flowed through every grain and knot.
