Riccardo Visconti stepped into the opulent ballroom, his piercing blue eyes scanning the crowded room for any sign of her. His long, dark hair was slicked back, revealing a strong jawline that seemed chiseled from granite. As a member of the powerful Visconti family, Riccardo had grown accustomed to being surrounded by beauty and luxury.

As he made his way through the throng, Riccardo's thoughts turned to his sister, Francesca. She was a vision in red, her porcelain skin glowing like alabaster as she laughed with a group of admirers. He felt a pang of possessiveness, knowing that no one else could ever claim her attention.

Just then, Francesca caught sight of him and swooped across the room to plant a kiss on his cheek. "Brother, you look devastating," she whispered in his ear. Riccardo's face softened at her words; he loved being the center of his sister's gaze.

As they danced through the evening, Riccardo couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. His father, the Duke of Milan, had been acting strangely for weeks, his usually steady hand now trembling with anxiety. Riccardo knew that his family's fortunes were tied to the whims of their powerful allies, and he worried about what the future might hold.

Francesca seemed oblivious to her brother's concerns, lost in the music and the magic of the night. She was a true firecracker, that one â€“ bold, fearless, and unafraid to take risks. Riccardo admired her spirit, even as it made him nervous for her safety.

As the clock struck midnight, the ball came to an end, and Riccardo escorted his sister out into the cool night air. They strolled through the gardens, their footsteps echoing off the stone walls. For a moment, they stood side by side, looking up at the stars.

"What's on your mind, Francesca?" Riccardo asked softly, his voice barely audible over the crickets.

His sister turned to him, her eyes sparkling like diamonds in the moonlight. "I'm thinking about tomorrow, brother," she said, a mischievous grin spreading across her face. "And all the adventures we'll have."
