As she disappeared into the throng, her mind was already turning to the next project, the next composition that would allow her to express herself in the same way.

For Laura Camara, music was not just a profession â€“ it was her very lifeblood. And as she walked away from the auditorium, she knew that she would always be chasing the notes that flowed through her veins like water.
