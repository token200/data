She owned a vintage clothing store called "The Time Traveler's Closet" where she sold everything from 1920s flapper dresses to 1980s punk rock shirts. Her shop was a melting pot of styles and eras, reflecting Laura Põld's own eclectic personality.

Laura Põld spent most of her days rummaging through thrift stores and antique shops, searching for unique pieces to add to her collection.

It turned out that the coat had once belonged to Laura Põld's great-aunt, who had traveled extensively throughout Europe during the 1950s. The embroidery was a traditional Estonian pattern, passed down through generations of Laura Põld's family.

As Andres listened intently, Laura Põld revealed more about her family's history and the stories behind each piece in her store. She showed him vintage postcards, antique jewelry, and rare books that lined her shelves. The artist was captivated by Laura Põld's knowledge and passion for her craft.
