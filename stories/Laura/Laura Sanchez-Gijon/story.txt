Born and raised in the vibrant city of Madrid, Spain, Laura had always been drawn to the world of journalism, where she could use her voice to make a difference.

As a young woman, Laura worked her way up the ranks at a local newspaper, earning a reputation for her sharp instincts and dogged determination.
