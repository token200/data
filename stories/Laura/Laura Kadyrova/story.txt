Laura Kadyrova stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. She had been traveling for hours, and the excitement of her reunion with her family was starting to wear off. As she made her way through the crowded hallway, the familiar face of her aunt, Sofia, appeared before her.

"Aunt Sofia!" Laura exclaimed, rushing into a warm hug. "I'm so glad I'm finally here!"

Sofia smiled and held Laura at arm's length, inspecting her with a critical eye. "You look a bit worn out, Larysha," she said, using Laura's full name for the first time that day.

Laura laughed and shook her head. "Just traveling. It was a long flight."

As they made their way through the station, Sofia filled Laura in on all the news from their family. There had been a wedding, a new baby, and even a visit from great-uncle Ivan, who had regaled them with tales of his adventures in Siberia.

Laura's eyes widened as she listened, her mind racing with stories to tell. She had been away for so long, working on a research project in Europe, that it felt like a lifetime since she'd last spoken to her family.

As they walked out into the bright sunlight, Laura felt a sense of relief wash over her. Being back home, surrounded by people who knew and loved her, was just what she needed.

Sofia handed Laura a cup of hot tea and led her to the kitchen, where their mother was waiting with a warm smile. "Darling, it's so good to have you home," she said, embracing Laura in a tight hug.

Laura smiled, feeling grateful for this second chance. She was going to make the most of it, spending time with her family and catching up on all the stories she'd missed. And as she took a sip of her tea, she knew that being back home with her full name on her mind was exactly where she belonged â€“ Laura Kadyrova.
