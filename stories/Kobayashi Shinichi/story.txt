It was a chilly autumn evening in Tokyo, and Kobayashi Shinichi was walking home from work. As he strolled down the street, lost in thought, his mind wandered back to his past life as Kira, the serial killer who had evaded capture for years.

Shinichi's eyes scanned the crowded streets, taking in the vibrant lights of the city. He felt a sense of freedom that came with being himself once again, rather than hiding behind a mask of deception.

As he approached his apartment building, Shinichi couldn't help but think about his friendship with Sato Hiromi. Their chance encounters had become more frequent over the years, and he found himself looking forward to their meetings.

Shinichi opened the door to his apartment, greeted by the warm glow of the evening sun peeking through the blinds. He stepped inside, dropping his keys onto the counter as he made his way to the kitchen to brew a cup of tea.

Just as he was pouring the steaming hot water into a cup, there was a knock at the door. Shinichi hesitated for a moment before answering it, wondering who could be visiting so early in the evening.

To his surprise, it was Sato Hiromi, her eyes sparkling with curiosity as she asked if she could come in. Shinichi smiled, ushering her into the apartment and offering her a cup of tea.

As they sat down at the table, Sato began to ask about his latest job at the research facility, probing for details that only he knew. Shinichi was careful not to reveal too much, but he couldn't help feeling grateful for her unwavering interest in his life.

Over steaming cups of tea, they discussed everything from literature to music, their conversations flowing effortlessly as if no time had passed at all. It was moments like these that made Shinichi realize just how much he valued his friendship with Hiromi – and how much he wanted to be able to share more with her in the future.

As the evening drew to a close, Sato stood up to leave, her eyes lingering on Shinichi's as if she knew there was something she didn't quite see. Shinichi smiled, feeling a flutter of guilt for not revealing his true identity just yet.

"I'll call you tomorrow," he said, walking her to the door and closing it behind her.

The darkness outside seemed to press in around him once again, but this time, Shinichi felt a strange sense of comfort. For the first time since leaving Kira's world behind, he felt like himself, free to be who he truly was without fear of being discovered.

As he stepped back into his apartment, sipping the last drops of tea from his cup, Shinichi couldn't help but wonder what the future held for him – and whether he would ever be able to confront the ghosts of his past.
