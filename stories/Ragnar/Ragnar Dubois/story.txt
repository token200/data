Ragnar Dubois stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station as he waited for his connection to arrive. A traveling nurse by trade, Ragnar had grown accustomed to the solitude of life on the move. With a medical degree from a prestigious institution in Sweden, Dubois was sought after for his expertise in emergency medicine.

As he checked his watch for what felt like the hundredth time, Ragnar's thoughts turned to his next destination – a small town nestled deep in the Canadian wilderness. Dubois had been hired to provide care for a remote community struggling with access to medical facilities, and he intended to do just that. His rugged good looks and easy charm would serve him well in the isolation.

The train chugged into view, spewing steam as it screeched to a halt beside Ragnar. He gathered his belongings and boarded the vehicle, settling into a seat by the window as the scenery unfolded outside. Forests of towering pine trees gave way to vast expanses of open lake, their surfaces reflecting the brilliant blue of the sky.

Dubois watched as the world passed him by – children playing on the streets, commuters rushing for trains, and people from all walks of life hurrying about their daily routines. It was moments like these that made his work so rewarding: being able to help those in need, no matter where his journey took him.

The hours ticked by as Ragnar settled into a meditative state, lost in thought as the landscape blurred outside. Finally, he heard the voice of his connection – "Ragnar Dubois, your next transfer awaits." He disembarked the train and made his way to the platform, taking one last look at the world before it slipped from view.

The waiting room was small, with a few scattered chairs and a low table where Ragnar could take in the surroundings. His eyes wandered over the faces around him – worn faces that spoke of hardship and struggle. Dubois knew these people needed his help. He took a deep breath, mentally preparing himself for the challenges ahead. With a quiet determination, he rose to leave. It was time to start his work as a traveling nurse in this remote Canadian town, where Ragnar Dubois would find solace in the faces of those who required his aid most.
