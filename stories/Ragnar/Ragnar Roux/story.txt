Ragnar Roux stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his piercing blue eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As the infamous bounty hunter and mercenary, he had earned a reputation for being merciless and efficient. The patrons fell silent as he made his way to the bar, their gazes fixed on the imposing figure before them.

The bartender, a grizzled old man named Grimbold, looked up from polishing a mug with a wary expression. "What can I get you, Ragnar?" he asked, his voice low and cautious.

Ragnar slid onto a stool, his massive frame commanding attention. He signaled for a whiskey, his gaze lingering on the patrons before responding to Grimbold's question. "Information," he growled, his deep voice sending shivers down spines. "I'm looking for a lead on a wealthy merchant who's gone missing."

Grimbold's eyes darted nervously around the room, as if searching for an escape route or a way to deflect attention from himself. "Ah, you mean Marcellus Thorne?" he ventured, his voice barely above a whisper.

Ragnar's gaze snapped into focus, his expression unyielding. "That's the one."

Grimbold hesitated before spilling out the details: Thorne had been last seen leaving his mansion on the outskirts of town, accompanied by a mysterious woman in dark robes. Rumors swirled that Thorne was involved in some sort of shady dealings, and many believed he'd gone to meet with a rival merchant to negotiate a lucrative trade agreement.

Ragnar nodded curtly, tucking a few coins into Grimbold's hand before standing up. He towered over the patrons once more, his presence radiating an aura of menace. "I'll be keeping an eye on Marcellus Thorne," he declared, his voice sending a chill down the spines of even the most hardened individuals.

As Ragnar strode out into the night air, Grimbold let out a sigh of relief, wiping sweat from his brow with a trembling hand. He watched as the bounty hunter vanished into the shadows, his mind racing with questions about how he'd managed to extract the information he needed so seamlessly.

Outside, Ragnar disappeared into the darkness, driven by an insatiable hunger for justice â€“ or whatever other motivations drove him to take on missions that few others would touch. His path was fraught with danger, and those who crossed him often did so at their own peril.
