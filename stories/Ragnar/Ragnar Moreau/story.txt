Ragnar Moreau stood tall, his piercing blue eyes scanning the dimly lit tavern. The air was thick with the smell of smoke and cheap ale, but Ragnar's senses were on high alert, ever vigilant for potential threats. As a skilled mercenary, he had seen it all - from the battlesfields of distant lands to the dark alleys of seedy cities.

As he made his way through the crowded room, a low hum of conversation swirled around him, like a soft blanket of noise. Patrons eyed him warily, their faces a blur of suspicion and distrust. Ragnar Moreau had earned that right; after all, not many people knew much about the enigmatic mercenary who moved unseen and unheard.

Ragnar spotted his contact in the corner - a hooded figure with skin as pale as alabaster. They nodded almost imperceptibly, their eyes locking in a silent understanding. The figure slid a small package across the table, wrapped in worn leather. Ragnar unwrapped it, revealing a small pouch of silver coins and a folded piece of parchment.

The parchment was embossed with a royal seal - that of the kingdom he had sworn to protect all those years ago. It seemed his employer had received news from afar; an enemy faction sought to usurp power in one of the kingdom's most vulnerable provinces. The stakes were high, but Ragnar Moreau didn't hesitate. He knew what needed doing.

As he finished his ale and prepared to depart, a shadowy figure emerged from the shadows near the door. Eyes glinted with malice as they beckoned him closer. "Ragnar Moreau," they spat, their voice dripping with venom. "You've been meddling in affairs that are none of your concern."

The mercenary smiled coldly, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword. He was familiar with threats like this one - but only a fool would back down from them. With a flick of his wrist, the blade sprang to life in his hand, its silver gleaming under the tavern lights.

"You'd do well to remember that I'm Ragnar Moreau," he growled, his eyes glinting with warning. "No man tells me what to do."

With that, he turned and strode out into the night, ready to face whatever dangers lay ahead - knowing full well that as Ragnar Moreau, he was always prepared for battle.
