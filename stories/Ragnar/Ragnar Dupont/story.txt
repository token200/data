Ragnar Dupont stood at the edge of the rooftop, the city sprawled out before him like a canvas of steel and glass. He lit a cigarette, the flame from his lighter casting a golden glow on the darkening sky.

As a private investigator, Ragnar had seen it all – the desperation, the deception, the lies that people told to survive in this unforgiving world. But there was something about this case that had piqued his interest. A high-society socialite, Olivia Laurent, had hired him to find her missing sister, Sophia.

The police were stumped, and the client's desperation was palpable. Ragnar knew that Olivia was hiding something, but he couldn't quite put his finger on what it was. He took a long drag on his cigarette, blowing out the smoke in slow, measured breaths.

As he gazed out at the city, Ragnar's mind began to wander back to his own troubled past. His parents had been murdered when he was just a child, and he'd grown up on the streets, surviving by his wits and his fists. He'd left that life behind years ago, but it still lingered in the shadows of his mind.

Just then, Ragnar's phone buzzed in his pocket. It was Olivia again, asking for an update. He hesitated, knowing that he needed more time to dig through the Laurents' opulent lifestyle. They were hiding secrets, and Ragnar aimed to uncover them all.

He walked over to the edge of the rooftop once more, looking out at the glittering lights below. This city was a labyrinth of lies and deceit, but Ragnar Dupont was no stranger to getting lost in its streets.

As he stood there, he spotted a small note taped to the railing – a tiny piece of paper with a single sentence scrawled on it: "Look for the one who wears two faces."

Ragnar's eyes narrowed. This could be the break he needed. He tucked the note into his pocket and took another long drag on his cigarette, feeling the familiar spark of excitement ignite within him.

The game was afoot, and Ragnar Dupont was ready to play.
