Ragnar Bektemirova stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her boots scuffling against the rusted metal. She had been away from Moscow for months, wandering through the Siberian wilderness in search of something – or someone.

Her family had raised her to be a warrior, trained her in the art of combat from a young age. But Ragnar's heart wasn't in it. She had grown tired of the endless battles and bloodshed, and longed for something more.

As she made her way through the deserted station, Ragnar's eyes scanned the crowd with a mixture of caution and curiosity. What was she looking for? A fugitive? A friend? Or perhaps something more?

She spotted him first – a tall, lanky man with messy brown hair and a scattering of freckles across his cheeks. He looked out of place in this stark, Soviet-era station.

"Kuznetsov?" Ragnar called out, her voice clear and sharp.

The man turned, his eyes locking onto hers with a hint of surprise. "Ragnar," he replied, with a nod.

They had parted ways years ago, after a particularly brutal skirmish. Kuznetsov, also known as "The Fox", was a cunning fighter and strategist – the one person who could match Ragnar's skill in battle. But he was also her brother-in-arms, her friend.

"What brings you here?" Ragnar asked, falling into step beside him.

"I've got business," Kuznetsov said, his eyes glinting with amusement. "A job that requires... delicate hands."

Ragnar raised an eyebrow. "What kind of job?"

Kuznetsov smiled, and the lines around his mouth deepened. "Let's just say it involves getting my hands on some top-secret Soviet tech. And I have a feeling you're the perfect woman for the task."

Ragnar's mind whirled with possibilities. It was an opportunity to use her skills in a more... refined way, perhaps? To leave the fighting behind and forge a new path?

She nodded, a slow smile spreading across her face. "Okay," she said. "Let's do it."

Together, they disappeared into the cold Siberian night, leaving the station and its secrets behind.
