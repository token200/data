Ragnar Ryota stepped into the small café, his piercing green eyes scanning the room for any sign of her sister, Eir. The dim lighting and soft hum of conversation created a cozy atmosphere, but Ragnar's mind was elsewhere. She had received a cryptic message from an unknown sender, hinting at a long-buried family secret that threatened to upend everything she thought she knew about herself.

As she waited in line to order her coffee, Ragnar's thoughts drifted back to their childhood spent in the rural town of Akakawa. Her sister Eir had always been the more outgoing one, the popular child with a smile that could light up a room. But Ragnar had always felt like an outsider, content to spend hours lost in the pages of dusty old books and scribbling in her journal.

When she finally received her coffee, Ragnar took a sip and turned to scan the café again. Eir was nowhere to be seen, but a familiar face caught her eye - that of their childhood friend, Taro. He looked just as worn down by life as Ragnar felt, his eyes red-rimmed from lack of sleep.

As she approached him, Ragnar asked if he had any news about Eir's whereabouts. Taro shook his head, but offered to keep an eye out for her while Ragnar met with their old friend, Kaito. The three of them had grown up together, exploring the woods and sharing secrets in the dead of night.

Kaito listened intently as Ragnar recounted her message, his expression growing more serious by the minute. When she finished, he leaned forward, his voice low and urgent. "Ragnar Ryota, we need to talk about our family's past," he said, his eyes locked on hers. "There are things you don't know, things that could change everything."

Ragnar felt a shiver run down her spine as Kaito began to speak, revealing secrets she had never imagined. She listened, entranced, as the world around her seemed to spin out of control. When he finished, Ragnar knew that nothing would ever be the same again. The message from Eir was just the beginning - a doorway into a complex web of family history and hidden truths.

With Taro by her side, Ragnar stepped back into the unknown, ready to face whatever lay ahead. As they left the café, she whispered a single word: "Eir." It was all she knew, but it was enough. The Ryota sisters were about to uncover secrets that would upend their entire world - and change them forever.
