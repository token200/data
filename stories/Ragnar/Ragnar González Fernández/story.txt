Ragnar González Fernández was a man of mystery and intrigue. With his piercing blue eyes and chiseled features, he commanded attention without ever trying to seek it. A master thief and con artist, Ragnar had made a name for himself on the streets of Barcelona, where he lived and breathed.

No one knew much about Ragnar's past, except that he had grown up on the wrong side of the tracks. He had learned early on how to rely on his wits and cunning to survive, and it was this skillset that had served him so well in his line of work. From swindling tourists out of their euros to stealing valuable artifacts from museums, Ragnar had done it all.

One day, while casing a high-end jewelry store in the Gothic Quarter, Ragnar spotted her - a beautiful young woman with long, dark hair and piercing green eyes. She was a shop assistant, tasked with keeping an eye on the latest acquisition - a priceless diamond necklace worth millions. Ragnar was immediately drawn to her, and as he continued to watch her, he found himself becoming more and more entranced.

Over the next few weeks, Ragnar returned to the store again and again, always watching from afar as the young woman went about her day. He learned that her name was Sofia, and that she had a troubled past of her own. Despite his better judgment, Ragnar found himself growing more and more attracted to Sofia, and he knew that he had to make a move.

Finally, one evening, Ragnar worked up the courage to approach Sofia. To his surprise, she didn't run screaming from him - instead, she smiled and invited him in for a drink. As they sat down together at a nearby café, Ragnar realized that he was in over his head. He had never felt this way about anyone before, and he wasn't sure if he could handle the consequences.

For once, Ragnar González Fernández found himself speechless - unable to think of anything to say but "I don't know what I'm doing." But as he looked into Sofia's eyes, he knew that he was willing to find out.
