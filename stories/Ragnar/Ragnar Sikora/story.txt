Ragnar Sikora stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the small station with a mix of excitement and trepidation. He had been on the move for weeks, ever since leaving behind the only home he had known as a child. The memories of his family's farm in rural Poland still lingered, but Ragnar knew that he couldn't stay there forever.

He was a refugee, fleeing the war that had torn his country apart. His parents were dead, killed by the same militia who had destroyed their village. Ragnar had managed to escape, but he knew that he would never be able to go back.

As he made his way through the crowded platform, Ragnar's eyes landed on a small advertisement tacked to the wall. "Volunteer for American Agriculture Program - Help feed your country!" It was an offer too good to refuse. The thought of leaving behind the poverty and despair that had consumed him for so long was almost too much to bear.

Ragnar made his way to the office, where he met with a stern-faced woman who asked him a barrage of questions about his background and qualifications. She seemed unconcerned by his young age or the fact that he had never worked on an American farm before. After what felt like an eternity, she handed him a letter with a single sheet of paper - his visa.

"Welcome to America," she said curtly, before turning back to her desk.

Ragnar took the letter and walked out of the station, feeling a sense of hope that he hadn't felt in years. He had no idea what lay ahead, but he knew that it was better than nothing.

As he made his way through the city streets, Ragnar couldn't help but feel a sense of disorientation. The skyscrapers towered above him, their bright lights reflecting off the wet pavement. It was a world away from the rolling hills and fields of Poland.

But as he walked, Ragnar began to notice something else - people looking at him with curiosity, or even hostility. He realized that he didn't fit in here, not yet. But he also knew that he couldn't give up.

He had come too far to turn back now. And besides, Ragnar Sikora was a man who refused to be defined by his circumstances.
