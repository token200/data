Ragnar Schäfer stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As a former mercenary turned private investigator, he had seen his fair share of shady characters and dodgy deals. But there was something about this place that didn't sit right with him.

As he made his way to the bar, he noticed a woman sitting in the corner, her eyes fixed intently on him. She was a beauty, with long, curly brown hair and piercing green eyes. He could tell by the look of her that she was trouble, but he was intrigued nonetheless.

"Ragnar Schäfer," she said, as he approached the bar, "I've been looking for you."

He raised an eyebrow, his gut telling him to be cautious. "Can I help you?" he asked, his voice neutral.

"My name is Sophia Patel," she replied, her eyes locked on his. "And I'm here about my sister."

Ragnar's instincts immediately went on high alert. He had dealt with cases involving missing persons before, but something about Sophia didn't add up. "What makes you think she's in trouble?" he asked, his curiosity getting the better of him.

Sophia leaned in close, her voice barely above a whisper. "I received a letter from her, saying that someone was after her. She wouldn't say who or why, but I know she's scared."

Ragnar nodded sympathetically, his mind already racing with possibilities. He pulled out his notebook and flipped through the pages, his eyes scanning for any clues. As he did, Sophia slid onto the stool next to him, her body inches from his.

"I'll take the case," Ragnar said finally, his voice firm. "But I need you to tell me more about your sister."

Sophia hesitated, glancing around the café nervously. "She's a scientist," she whispered. "Working on some top-secret project at a research facility in the city. But something went wrong, and now she's gone missing."

Ragnar nodded thoughtfully, his mind working overtime to piece together the puzzle. He knew that this case was going to be tough, but he was ready for it. After all, Ragnar Schäfer had a reputation for being one of the best in the business.

As Sophia finished speaking, a sudden noise echoed through the café, making everyone jump. Ragnar's eyes snapped towards the door, his hand instinctively reaching for his gun. It seemed like this case was about to get a lot more complicated – and a whole lot deadlier.
