Teresa Eglitis was known for her striking features and captivating smile, which seemed to light up the entire room whenever she walked into it. A free-spirited artist, she had a way of making everyone feel at ease with her warm and gentle demeanor.

Born in the vibrant city of New Orleans, Teresa grew up surrounded by the rich cultural heritage of her hometown. She spent most of her childhood exploring the French Quarter, soaking up the history and music that seemed to seep from every brick and stone. As she got older, Teresa's fascination with art only deepened, and she began to spend hours sketching the people and places she saw.

She spent time in Paris, soaking up the impressionist masterpieces of Monet and Renoir, and later in Rome, where she became captivated by the ancient ruins and Baroque architecture.

Teresa's travels eventually took her to a small village in Tuscany, where she fell in love with the rolling hills and cypress trees that seemed to stretch on forever. It was there that she discovered her true passion for painting en plein air, capturing the fleeting moments of light and color that danced across the Italian countryside.

And as she stood before each canvas, lost in the flow of creation, she knew that she had found her true calling â€“ a life lived fully, and an art that would outlast her own mortal coil.
