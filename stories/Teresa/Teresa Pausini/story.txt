I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Teresa Pausini. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created for a specific purpose.

However, I did find information on a famous Italian singer-songwriter named Tiziano Ferro, but also there is an Italian singer, Teresa Poggi, and a singer  named Tina Turner who were also nicknamed as the "Queen of Rock n Roll", however none of them share this name.
