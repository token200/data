Teresa Straume was a woman with a penchant for the unknown. A renowned paranormal investigator, she had spent her fair share of years studying the unexplained and the occult. Her latest case was particularly intriguing - a haunted mansion on the outskirts of town that was rumored to be inhabited by malevolent spirits.

As Teresa stepped out of her car and onto the crumbling driveway, a shiver ran down her spine. She had always been drawn to places with a dark history, and this mansion seemed to fit the bill perfectly. With her trusty camera and equipment in tow, she began her investigation.

The interior of the mansion was a labyrinth of cobweb-covered corridors and dusty rooms. Teresa navigated through the space with ease, her eyes scanning for any signs of anomalies. She set up her equipment in the grand ballroom, where a particularly disturbing report had been filed by a previous occupant.

As night began to fall, Teresa settled in for what she hoped would be a long and eventful night. The hours ticked by slowly, with only an occasional creak or groan breaking the silence. But just as Teresa was starting to drift off to sleep, she felt it - a sudden chill that ran down her spine.

She sat up straight, her heart racing, and began to scan the room with renewed urgency. That's when she saw it - a faint, glowing light in the corner of the room. Without hesitation, Teresa sprang into action, grabbing her equipment and preparing to capture some evidence.

As she moved closer to the light source, Teresa felt an intense sense of unease. She knew that this was no ordinary phenomenon, but rather something far more sinister. Suddenly, a cold breeze swept through the room, extinguishing her equipment and sending Teresa Straume stumbling backward.

For a moment, there was silence. Then, from the depths of the darkness, a voice whispered a single word - "Welcome."
