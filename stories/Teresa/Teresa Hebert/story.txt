Teresa Marie Hebert was known for her bold and fearless personality, which often led her to take risks that others wouldn't dare to attempt. Growing up in the small town of Willow Creek, she always had a sense of adventure and was never satisfied with the status quo.

As a child, Teresa would spend hours exploring the nearby woods, climbing trees and chasing after squirrels.
