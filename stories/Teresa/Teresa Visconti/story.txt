Teresa Visconti stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. She had been traveling for hours, and the familiarity of the old city was a welcome respite from the long journey.

As she made her way through the crowded streets, Teresa's thoughts turned to the letter in her pocket. It was an invitation from her cousin, Alessandro, requesting her presence at his wedding to the woman he had met while studying abroad.

Teresa's family had always been tight-knit, but she and Alessandro were as different as night and day. He was charming and outgoing, always with a smile on his face, whereas Teresa was reserved and introspective. She had grown up watching him effortlessly navigate social situations, while she struggled to make small talk.

Despite their differences, Teresa loved her cousin dearly, and she knew he would be thrilled to see her at the wedding. As she made her way to the church, the sound of laughter and music grew louder, and Teresa's heart began to swell with excitement.

As she entered the crowded nave, Teresa's eyes scanned the sea of faces until they landed on Alessandro, resplendent in his tailored tuxedo. He caught sight of her and smiled broadly, striding towards her with an air of confidence that was almost infectious.

Teresa felt a flutter in her chest as Alessandro swept her into a warm hug. "Cara Teresa!" he exclaimed, using the Italian term for 'dear'. "I'm so glad you could make it!"

As they danced and laughed together, Teresa couldn't help but feel a pang of wistfulness. She knew that she would always be on the outside looking in when it came to Alessandro's relationships â€“ while she longed for connection and intimacy, he seemed to effortlessly attract people to him.

But as the night wore on, and Teresa watched her cousin exchange vows with his bride, she felt a warmth spread through her chest. Perhaps, just perhaps, there was more to love than she had ever imagined. And maybe, just maybe, Alessandro's infectious smile would be the key to unlocking her own heart.
