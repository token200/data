Madeleine Larsen stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway, her bright blue eyes scanning the crowded streets of Copenhagen's Nyhavn harbor. As a renowned detective with the Danish National Police, she had spent countless nights patrolling these very waters, searching for clues to solve the city's most baffling crimes.

Her latest case was no exception. A string of high-end jewelry store robberies had left the police baffled, and Madeleine was determined to crack the code. She lit a cigarette and took a long drag, her gaze drifting towards the harbor's historic buildings.

As she walked along the waterfront, Madeleine noticed a small, unassuming shop tucked away between two larger establishments. The sign above the door read "Curios and Antiques." Her curiosity piqued, she pushed open the door and stepped inside.

The shop was cluttered with an assortment of oddities and trinkets, each one more fascinating than the last. Madeleine wandered deeper into the store, running her fingers over the intricate carvings on an ancient wooden box. Behind the counter stood an elderly woman with piercing green eyes, who regarded Madeleine with a knowing glint.

"Welcome, Detective," she said, her voice low and soothing. "I've been expecting you."

Madeleine raised an eyebrow. "Expecting me? How do you know my name?"

The old woman smiled, revealing a hint of mischief. "Let's just say I have my ways. You see, I've been watching you from across the harbor, studying your techniques and habits. You're not like most detectives â€“ driven by instinct and impulse."

Madeleine's eyes narrowed. "What do you want, then?"

The old woman leaned forward, her voice taking on a conspiratorial tone. "I have information about the jewelry store robberies. Information that could crack the case wide open. But it comes with a price, Detective."

Madeleine hesitated for a moment before nodding. She knew she needed any advantage she could get in this investigation.

"Name your price," she said firmly.

The old woman grinned, her eyes glinting with triumph. "Oh, I think you'll find it's worth paying."
