One evening, Madeleine received a call from an anonymous source claiming to have information about a high-profile corruption scandal in the city's government. The caller revealed that a prominent businessman was at the center of the scandal, and that evidence had been gathered that would expose his wrongdoings for good.

Madeleine's curiosity was piqued, and she immediately began making plans to meet with the source. She arrived at a dingy café on the outskirts of town, where the mysterious informant revealed himself as a former employee of the businessman in question.

She had spent years building up her skills and her confidence, and she was ready for whatever came next.

As she left the café that evening, Madeleine felt a sense of satisfaction wash over her.
