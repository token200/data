Madeleine Krūmiņš stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. She had been away for months, volunteering in various NGOs across Europe, but it was time to return home to Latvia. As she made her way through the crowds, the sounds of a new language – Latvian – carried on the wind.

A child's hand reached out from behind a stroller and clutched at Madeleine's pant leg. "Dzienas gaidits!" the child exclaimed, startling her. "Good morning!"

Madeleine smiled, her bright blue eyes crinkling at the corners. She knelt down to meet the child, who stared up at her with wide eyes.

"Ja, mazī, dziena gaidits," she replied, offering a gentle smile.

The little one giggled and reached out again, this time grasping Madeleine's hand. "Lido?"

Madeleine chuckled and began to speak slowly in Latvian, "Lido! Tu esē latviešu!" She pronounced the words proudly: "You are a Latvian!"

As she stood up, a gust of wind swept through the station, carrying with it the scent of wet earth and damp leaves. Madeleine breathed deeply, feeling a sense of homecoming.

She had spent her travels studying social justice issues in Eastern Europe. Now, as she made her way to her small apartment, her mind turned to her family and friends back home. Would they be happy to see her? Had anything changed while she was away?

Madeleine pushed open the door and slipped inside, dropping her suitcase onto the floor with a soft thud. Her mother's warm smile greeted her from across the room.

"Zina! Welcome home!"

The two women hugged tightly, Madeleine inhaling deeply of her mother's familiar scent: laundry detergent and cooking spices. As they pulled back, Madeleine's eyes met those of her mother.

"What have you been up to?" she asked, curiosity sparking in her voice.

Her mother launched into a story of Madeleine's younger brother's antics, their family gatherings, and the quiet routines of daily life.

Madeleine laughed along with her mother, the sounds mingling with memories from her travels. For the first time since leaving Latvia, she felt a sense of belonging – to this place, its people, and its stories.
