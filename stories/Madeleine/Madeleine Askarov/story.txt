Madeleine Askarov stepped into the crowded coffee shop, scanning the room for a familiar face. Her eyes landed on Alex, sitting in the corner sipping on a latte. She smiled and made her way over to him.

As she approached, Alex looked up and caught her gaze. "Hey, Madeleine," he said with a nod. "Mind joining me?"

Madeleine nodded and slid into the seat across from him. "Thanks for having a table for me."

The barista arrived with their drinks, and they chatted quietly as they sipped their coffee. Alex had always been good at making conversation, but today he seemed more reserved than usual.

"What's on your mind?" Madeleine asked, noticing his distant expression.

Alex shrugged. "Just thinking about the project we're working on for the Smith account. It's due soon and I'm still not sure if it's up to par."

Madeleine leaned in, her eyes sparkling with interest. "You know what they say: 'perfection is overrated'. Sometimes less is more, right?"

Alex raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. "Go on."

Madeleine took a sip of her coffee before continuing. "I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. You've already done great work on this project – it's good enough."

Alex smiled wryly. "Thanks for the vote of confidence, Madeleine. But I appreciate your honesty."

As they sipped their coffee and talked through their ideas, Madeleine Askarov was her usual self – witty, insightful, and supportive. Alex felt a weight lift off his shoulders as he left the coffee shop with renewed confidence.

When they stepped out into the bright sunlight, Alex turned to Madeleine with a smile. "Thanks for talking me down from my pedestal, Madeleine. I owe you one."

Madeleine grinned mischievously. "Anytime, Alex. After all, that's what friends are for."
