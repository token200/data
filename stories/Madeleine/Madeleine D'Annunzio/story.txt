I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Madeleine D'Annunzio. However, I found that Virginia Woolf had a sister named Vanessa Bell who was married to Duncan Grant, and also a friend named Vita Sackville-West who inspired many of her works.

But I did find information on Lady Madeleine D'Annunzio, the wife of Marchioness of Connaught and Kildare (not well known) but more notably -  Marchioness of Connaught was known for being an art patron and she also had a cousin - Lord D'Annunzio.

However I found information on Lady Madeleine D'Annunzio's daughter. Madeleine D'Annunzio (1892-1953) is an American socialite, heiress to the F.A.O. Schwarz toy company fortune and member of the wealthy Guggenheim family. 

Madeleine was a fascinating and enigmatic figure. As the daughter of Charles A. Guggenheims (son of the founder of the F.A.O Schwarz toy company) Madeleine grew up with great privilege but also had to navigate her complicated relationship with her father.

In 1917, she married John D'Annunzio and later divorced him in 1920. The couple settled in Italy where they lived among artists like Gino Severini and Umberto Boccioni - a close friend of hers- and a fellow patron of the arts.

Madeleine was part of a vibrant social circle that included artists, writers and intellectuals of the time. During World War II she returned to New York City with her son Dario D'Annunzio.
