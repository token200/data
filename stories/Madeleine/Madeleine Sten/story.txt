Madeleine Sten stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit café, shaking the water from her long, dark coat. The Nordic detective was no stranger to the city's gray skies and damp streets, but she couldn't help feeling a sense of unease as she waited for her contact.

It had been months since Madeleine Sten had last seen her former colleague, Inspector Östlund, and she was starting to get worried that he might be in over his head. The message had been cryptic - just "we need to talk" - but Madeleine knew better than to ignore a plea for help from someone who owed her one.

As she waited, sipping on a lukewarm coffee, the door swung open and Östlund himself walked in, looking like he'd been dragged through the streets. His eyes scanned the room frantically before locking onto hers, and Madeleine felt a jolt of recognition.

"Madeleine," he said, his voice low and urgent. "I need your help."

Madeleine set her cup down and followed him to a corner table, where Östlund began to explain the situation. It seemed that one of their former informants had gone missing, and all evidence pointed to foul play.

Madeleine listened intently, her mind racing with possibilities. She knew that this was more than just a simple kidnapping case - there were forces at play here that went far beyond the streets of Stockholm.

As she nodded along, making notes on her phone, Madeleine couldn't help but think back to their partnership in the past. Östlund had always been her rock, the one person who knew how to push her buttons just right.

But now, as they delved deeper into this case, Madeleine realized that she might be in over her head. She was used to being the driving force behind investigations, but this one seemed to require a team effort - and she wasn't sure if she trusted anyone enough to hand it over to.

For now, though, she was willing to take the risk. After all, when it came to solving cases like this, Madeleine Sten knew that experience and intuition were key - and she had both in spades.
