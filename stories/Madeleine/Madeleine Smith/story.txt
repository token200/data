Despite the overwhelming evidence against her, Madeleine maintained her innocence throughout the proceedings. Her defense team argued that she had been acting under duress, and that MacLaren's death was a tragic accident rather than a premeditated crime.

The verdict was met with widespread outrage, with many calling for her execution. However, in the end, Madeleine was sentenced to life imprisonment instead. She spent seven long years behind bars, a period during which she became an iconic figure in Scottish society.

Madeleine's story has captivated historians and literary enthusiasts alike, inspiring numerous books, plays, and films. Her bravery and determination in the face of overwhelming adversity have become legendary, earning her a place in the annals of history as one of Scotland's most infamous women.

Today, Madeleine Smith is remembered as a complex and multifaceted individual, whose life was marked by both tragedy and triumph. Her story serves as a powerful reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope for redemption and forgiveness.
