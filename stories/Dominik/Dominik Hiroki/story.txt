Dominik Hiroki sat alone in his dimly lit apartment, the city lights of Tokyo twinkling outside the window. He stared blankly at the whiskey-stained glass on his coffee table, his mind consumed by the memories that haunted him.

It had been five years since the accident, five years since he'd lost the love of his life to a senseless tragedy. Akane's laughter still echoed in his ears, and the smell of her perfume could transport him back to the happiest moments they shared together.

Dominik took another swig of whiskey, feeling the burn all the way down his throat. He thought about how far he'd come since that fateful night - from a struggling artist to a renowned photographer, his work celebrated by galleries and collectors worldwide. But despite his success, the pain remained, a constant reminder of what he'd lost.

As he looked around the apartment, memories came flooding back. The graffiti-covered walls, once Akane's canvas for her street art; the worn couch where they spent countless nights discussing their dreams and aspirations; the wooden desk where Dominik would sketch out his next project, inspired by Akane's sparkling eyes.

A faint knock on the door interrupted his reverie. It was his assistant, Taro, with a bouquet of flowers and an apologetic expression. "I brought some of your favorite cherry blossoms," he said, setting the arrangement on the coffee table beside Dominik.

Dominik looked up at him, surprised by the gesture. "Thanks, Taro. You know I love these."

Taro hesitated before speaking, his voice barely above a whisper. "I saw something, Mr. Hiroki. A woman who looks just like Akane. She was standing on the corner of Shibuya Crossing, looking lost and scared. I thought you should know."

Dominik's heart skipped a beat as he followed Taro's gaze to the TV screen behind him. The image of the woman with striking features and piercing green eyes flickered across the screen, sending a shiver down his spine.

For an instant, time stood still, and Dominik felt Akane standing before him once more, her hand brushing against his cheek in a familiar gesture of affection. Tears welled up in his eyes as he realized that maybe, just maybe, some part of her was still with him, even if only in spirit.

With newfound purpose, Dominik stood up, his whiskey glass forgotten on the table. He took Taro's hand and together they stepped into the night, ready to face whatever lay ahead, side by side.
