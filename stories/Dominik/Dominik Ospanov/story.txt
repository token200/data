Growing up in the gritty city of Krasnoyarsk, Russia, he learned to navigate the shadows with ease.

One fateful evening, Dominik received a cryptic message from an anonymous source claiming to have information about a high-profile corruption scandal involving some of the city's most powerful officials.

As he walked through the deserted streets, the flickering streetlights casting long shadows behind him, Dominik couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He quickened his pace, his heart pounding in his chest, but when he arrived at the pre-arranged location, he found no one.
