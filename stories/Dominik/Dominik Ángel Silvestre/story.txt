Despite his talent, Dominik Ángel Silvestre struggled to find success in the art world. Rejection after rejection left him feeling defeated, wondering if he had simply wasted his time chasing a dream that was never meant for him.

He was finally being recognized for the talent that had always been inside him, waiting to be set free.
