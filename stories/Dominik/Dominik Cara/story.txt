Dominik Cara stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the city skyline. The setting sun cast a warm orange glow over the towering skyscrapers, and for a moment, he felt a sense of peace wash over him.

As a detective with the NYPD's Homicide Unit, Dominik had seen his fair share of darkness. But tonight was different. Tonight, he had received a call that had shaken him to his core - a young girl, no more than ten years old, had been found dead in Central Park.

Dominik thought back to the case files, the ones with the similar MOs and the victims all bearing an uncanny resemblance to each other. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was closing in on something big, but the pieces still eluded him.

He took a deep breath and turned away from the view, his mind racing with theories and suspects. The investigation had already yielded some promising leads, but Dominik knew that nothing could prepare him for the horrors that lay ahead.

As he made his way back down to the precinct, his phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number. "You're getting close," it read. "Meet me at the old warehouse on 5th and Main if you want to get answers."

Dominik's gut told him to ignore the message, but something about it resonated deep within him. He decided to take a chance, hoping that this mysterious stranger might hold the key to unraveling the tangled threads of the case.

He arrived at the warehouse just before midnight, the only sound being the creaking of old wooden beams and the distant hum of the city. As he entered the dimly lit space, a figure emerged from the shadows - a woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair, dressed in a black leather jacket that seemed to glow in the faint light.

"Who are you?" Dominik demanded, his hand resting on his gun.

The woman smiled, a cold, calculated smile. "I'm someone who knows what happened to that little girl," she said, her voice dripping with menace. "And I'm willing to tell you everything... for a price."

Dominik's eyes narrowed, unsure whether he should trust this enigmatic stranger or not. But one thing was certain - he needed all the information he could get if he wanted to bring justice to the dead girl and her family.
