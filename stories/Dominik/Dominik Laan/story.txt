Dominik Laan stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station with a mix of curiosity and unease. The forgotten town of Ravenshire lay nestled in the heart of the Norwegian wilderness, its residents as rugged as the landscape they called home.

As a journalist, Dominik had spent years investigating the mysteries surrounding Ravenshire's troubled past. Whispers of ancient rituals, unexplained disappearances, and eerie occurrences had long fascinated him. Now, with his latest article on the brink of publication, he'd received an invitation from the town's enigmatic mayor to visit.

The mayor, a woman named Kari, greeted Dominik warmly at the station. Her piercing green eyes seemed to hold a thousand secrets, but her smile put him at ease. As they drove through the winding roads, Dominik marveled at Ravenshire's untouched beauty – lakes, forests, and granite mountains stretching as far as the eye could see.

Their destination was an ancient fortress perched atop a craggy outcropping of rock. Kari explained that it held historical significance, once a sacred site for the long-forgotten tribe that once inhabited these lands. Dominik listened intently, his journalist's mind racing with questions and possibilities.

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the fortress walls, Dominik spotted something peculiar. A symbol, etched into the stone in bold strokes – it seemed ancient, yet unmistakably modern. Intrigued, he knelt beside it, feeling an inexplicable connection to this mysterious mark.

Kari watched him with a knowing glint in her eye. "This is what we call 'the Echo'," she whispered, as if sharing a secret that only the wind knew. Dominik's eyes widened; he sensed there was more to Ravenshire than met the eye.

Over dinner, Kari revealed hints of an unsettling history – ritualistic practices still practiced by some locals, mysterious disappearances linked to this symbol, and an ever-growing feeling of unease among the townsfolk. As the night deepened, Dominik's journalist instincts screamed for answers. Little did he know that Ravenshire was on the cusp of a revelation, one that would shatter his perception of reality and expose secrets better left buried.

Dominik settled into his room, the darkness outside mirroring his growing unease. He couldn't shake the feeling that he'd merely scratched the surface of Ravenshire's hidden world – and that he was now trapped in its web of mysteries.
