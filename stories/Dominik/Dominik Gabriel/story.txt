Dominik Gabriel stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit café, shaking the droplets off his coat. As he made his way to the counter, the barista greeted him with a nod. "The usual, right?" she asked, already knowing the answer.

Dominik nodded, taking a seat at the small table by the window. He pulled out his phone and began typing out a text message to his sister. His full name was Dominik Gabriel, but he had always preferred to be called Dom for short. It made things easier, especially when dealing with people who didn't know him.

The message sent, Dom turned his attention to the coffee in front of him. He took a sip, feeling the bitter taste wash over his tongue. It was just what he needed after a long day of work. As a freelance journalist, Dom's schedule was always unpredictable. Some days were filled with meetings and deadlines, while others were spent researching and writing.

As he sipped his coffee, Dom pulled out a notebook and began jotting down notes for an article he was working on. His full name might have sounded unusual to some, but Dom had grown accustomed to the stares and comments over the years. He had learned to ignore them, focusing instead on his work.

Just as he was getting into a groove, the door to the café swung open and a figure from his past walked in. It was Rachel, an old flame who had ended things abruptly several years ago. Dom's heart skipped a beat as their eyes met, but he quickly composed himself. He pushed the notebook aside and stood up, making his way over to where she was sitting.

"Rachel," he said, trying to sound nonchalant despite the flutter in his chest. "What brings you here?" The two of them chatted for a bit, catching up on old times. Dom couldn't help but think about how things might have turned out if they had stayed together. But as they parted ways, he knew that was a road not worth taking.

As he walked out into the rain once more, Dom felt a sense of closure wash over him. He pulled his coat tighter around him and began to make his way home, already looking forward to the next article on his desk. His full name might have its quirks, but Dom knew who he was – and that was all that mattered.
