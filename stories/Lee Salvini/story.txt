Lee Salvini stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out at the city below. The wind whipped his dark hair into a frenzy as he took a long drag on his cigarette. He was a man consumed by secrets and shadows.

As a former special operative, Lee had seen it all - the worst of humanity's depravity, the darkest corners of power and corruption. But now, he'd retreated to the city, seeking solace in the anonymity of the crowd. The memories still haunted him, though.

Lee's phone buzzed with an incoming call from his old comrade-in-arms, Jack Harris. "What are you doing tonight, Lee?" Jack asked over the line.

"Just taking a walk," Lee replied, his eyes drifting towards the neon lights of the city.

"Don't lie to me, Salvini. I know you're hiding something."

Lee sighed and stubbed out his cigarette in an empty can. He'd grown accustomed to living on the fringes, always keeping one step ahead of those who would try to bring him down. Jack was one of the few people he trusted - and even then, Lee wasn't entirely sure.

As they chatted, a sleek black sedan pulled up beside the building where Lee stood. A suited man in his mid-30s stepped out onto the pavement, flashing a badge at Lee.

"Lee Salvini?" the agent asked gruffly.

"That's me," Lee said, hands resting on the rooftop railing as he watched the agent approach him.

"I need to speak with you about something," the agent said, eyes scanning the rooftops before returning to Lee. "Your brother is missing."

Lee's grip on the railing tightened. His brother, Tony - gone without a word. Some might say it was coincidence, but Lee knew better. He'd had dealings with his brother in the past, and he knew that when someone went missing like this, there was always more to it.

"What do you know?" Lee asked, voice low and even.

"Not much yet," the agent replied hesitantly. "But we believe your brother may have gotten caught up in something... illicit."

Lee snorted. Illicit? That was an understatement.

"I want to know what happened to him," he said finally.

The agent's eyes flicked around before returning to Lee. "We'll do our best, Salvini. But you need to be careful. You're not the only one looking for your brother."

Lee smiled wryly - a thin, calculated smile that hinted at years of dealing with such games.

"I've been playing this game a long time," he said quietly.

"Then maybe it's time to change up your hand."
