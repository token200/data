One day, while attending a high-profile puzzle tournament, Luke was approached by a mysterious woman who introduced herself as Sophia, a fellow puzzle enthusiast. She revealed to Luke that she had been searching for someone with his unique skills, and was willing to offer him a substantial sum of money in exchange for his participation in an exclusive, invitation-only competition.

Intrigued by the prospect, Luke agreed to take on the challenge. He soon found himself at a luxurious villa in the countryside, surrounded by some of the world's most brilliant puzzle-solvers.
