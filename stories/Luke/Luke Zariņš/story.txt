Luke Zariņš was a man with an unassuming presence, often going unnoticed in crowded spaces. However, his piercing green eyes seemed to bore into those he met, as if sizing them up before making a decision about whether or not to engage.

Born and raised in Riga, Latvia, Luke had always felt like an outsider among his peers. He was the son of two immigrants who had come to the city seeking a better life for themselves and their family. As a result, Luke struggled to find his place within his community, often feeling more at home with books than people.

Despite this, Luke possessed a deep love for literature and poetry. He spent countless hours pouring over the works of Latvian authors like Jānis Poruks and Mihails Strengis, finding solace in their words when he felt lost or alone.

One day, while wandering through the streets of Old Town Riga, Luke stumbled upon a small café tucked away on a quiet alley. The sign above the door read "Lietuvių kūrėja" – Lithuanian poet – and Luke felt an inexplicable pull to enter.

Inside, he found a cozy atmosphere filled with the scent of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of conversation. Luke's eyes scanned the room until they landed on an elderly woman sitting by the window, her face illuminated by the golden light of afternoon. She introduced herself as Dita, a renowned Lithuanian poet who had also spent time in Latvia.

As Luke sat down beside her, he felt an inexplicable connection to this stranger. Over steaming cups of coffee, they discussed literature, life, and everything in between. For the first time in his life, Luke felt seen – truly understood – by someone else.

Over the next few weeks, Luke found himself returning to that small café again and again, seeking out Dita's guidance and wisdom. As he delved deeper into her poetry and the world of Lithuanian literature, Luke began to find his place in the world. He realized that his outsider status was not a curse, but rather an opportunity to connect with others on a deeper level.

As the sun set over Riga's skyline, Luke Zariņš knew that he had finally found his tribe – and himself.
