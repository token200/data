Luke D'Annunzio stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It had been years since he'd last set foot in Ravenswood, a town where his family's dark past still lingered like a shadow.

As a child, Luke had heard whispers of the infamous Luciano D'Annunzio, a man with a reputation for ruthlessness and cunning. His father, Alessandro, had been a close friend of Luciano's, but after a bitter falling out, Alessandro had vanished into obscurity. Now, as an adult, Luke was determined to uncover the truth about his family's tangled history.

The air was thick with moisture as he made his way through the mist-shrouded streets, following a trail of subtle clues that led him deeper into Ravenswood's heart. He passed by crumbling Victorian mansions and old oak trees, their branches twisted with age, like grasping fingers. Luke felt an unsettling sense of familiarity, as if the town itself was watching him.

Eventually, he arrived at the local pub, where a faded sign creaked in the wind, bearing Luciano's name. Luke pushed open the door, and a bell above it let out a weary clang. Inside, patrons eyed him warily, their faces reflecting a mix of curiosity and suspicion.

The bartender, an old man with eyes like two sunken coins, nodded at Luke as he ordered a whiskey. "You're new around here, ain't ya?" he drawled. Luke hesitated before speaking, unsure how much to reveal. "Just passing through," he said finally, draining his glass in one gulp.

The bartender's gaze lingered on him, as if sensing something beneath the surface. After a moment, he leaned in close and whispered, "You're D'Annunzio. Luke Luciano D'Annunzio." The name hung in the air like a challenge, and for an instant, Luke felt the weight of his family's legacy settling upon him.

He finished his drink in silence, lost in thought as the pub's patrons began to murmur among themselves. Outside, the mist swirled around him once more, shrouding Ravenswood in its damp, gray folds.
