Koskinen's team had been working tirelessly behind the scenes, scouring every inch of evidence for clues that might shed light on the Phoenix's identity. From surveillance footage to fingerprints, nothing seemed to have yielded any concrete results.

One night, as Koskinen pored over a particularly promising lead, his phone rang.

The connection was tenuous at best, but Koskinen's gut told him that this might be their breakthrough.

The revelation electrified Koskinen's team, and within hours, a composite image began to take shape. It wasn't the identity they had been hoping for, but it was a start.
