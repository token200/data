Luke Hassan stepped off the plane and onto the sun-kissed tarmac, the dry air enveloping him like a warm hug. He had been away for months, chasing leads in New York City, but now he was back in his hometown of Phoenix, Arizona.

As he made his way through customs, Luke's mind wandered back to the past few weeks. He had uncovered some interesting tidbits about his family's history, particularly his great-grandfather, Aziz Hassan. It seemed that Aziz had been a key player in the early days of the Islamic State, and Luke's research had only scratched the surface.

Growing up, Luke had always known that his name was Arabic for "strong warrior," but he had never felt connected to it. His parents had always been tight-lipped about their own past, and Luke had grown accustomed to living in a world where secrets were currency.

Now, as he collected his luggage and hailed a taxi, Luke couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He glanced around the airport, taking in the bustle of travelers rushing to catch their flights. Was it paranoia, or was someone really following him?

As he arrived at his family's old brownstone, Luke felt a pang of nostalgia wash over him. This had been his childhood home, where he had spent countless hours playing with his siblings and helping his mother in the kitchen. The interior still looked much the same, although the colors were a bit faded.

Luke's phone buzzed as he stepped inside. It was an unknown number, but the text on the screen sent shivers down his spine: "Meet me at the café on 5th Street at midnight. Come alone."

For a moment, Luke's heart pounded in his chest. Who could be calling him now? He didn't recognize the number or the message, but something about it resonated deep within him.

He made his way to the café that night, his eyes scanning the crowded streets for any sign of recognition. The door swung open, and a figure emerged from the shadows. Luke's heart skipped a beat as he realized it was someone he had been searching for all along: an old friend from his past who claimed to have information about his family's secrets.

With one word, "start," everything changed.
