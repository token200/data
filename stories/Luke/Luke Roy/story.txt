Luke Roy stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out at the city skyline as the sun set behind him. It was a habit he'd developed over the years, finding solace in the view from up high. The wind whipped his dark hair into a frenzy as he closed his eyes, feeling the cool breeze on his skin.

As a detective with the Special Crimes Unit, Luke had seen his fair share of darkness. But it was moments like these that reminded him why he'd become a cop in the first place: to bring justice to those who'd been left behind.

A memory popped into his mind - the case that had started it all for him. A young girl, murdered in her own home by someone she'd trusted. The guilt and helplessness he'd felt had driven him to this profession, a way to channel his anger and frustration into making a difference.

Luke took a deep breath and opened his eyes, scanning the rooftops below. He spotted a figure moving swiftly from one building to the next - a rookie cop, eager to prove herself in the big city. Luke watched as she struggled to keep up with her partner, learning from their mentor's guidance.

It was a familiar scene, one he'd lived through himself many years ago. But this time, it filled him with a sense of pride and accomplishment. He remembered when his own training had been so uncertain, but now he was the one guiding others.

As Luke turned to head back inside, his phone buzzed in his pocket. It was an alert from dispatch - a new lead on the Royson case, a string of murders that had been haunting him for years. A chill ran down his spine as he quickened his pace towards the stairs.

Back at his desk, Luke poured over the new evidence, his mind racing with possibilities. The Royson case was different this time - he sensed it in his gut. He'd followed every lead, talked to every witness, but still, justice remained elusive.

Just then, his partner, Rachel, walked into the room. "Luke, I think I found something," she said, handing him a folder filled with fresh evidence. Luke took the folder, scanning its contents before his eyes met hers.

"You're telling me this?" he asked, his voice firm but laced with emotion. Rachel nodded, her eyes locked on his.
