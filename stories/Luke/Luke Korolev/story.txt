Luke Korolev stepped out of his small apartment, took a deep breath of the crisp morning air, and began his daily commute to the hospital where he worked as a resident physician. As he walked to the bus stop, his mind wandered back to the conversation he had with his grandmother just last night.

"Baba, what's my destiny?" Luke had asked, feeling restless and unsure about his place in the world.

His grandmother, a wise and kind woman who had always known more than she let on, smiled and said, "Luke, you are meant for greatness. Not because of what others think or expect from you, but because of who you are."

As he rode the bus to work, Luke couldn't shake off the feeling that his grandmother's words held some truth. He had always been drawn to medicine, not just as a career, but as a calling – a way to help people and make a difference in their lives.

When he arrived at the hospital, Luke was greeted by the familiar chaos of the emergency room. Nurses rushed past him, shouting orders and rushing to treat patients, while the doctors stood back, observing and guiding. Luke took his place among them, ready to do whatever it took to help those who needed him most.

Over the next few hours, Luke worked tirelessly, diagnosing and treating patients with precision and compassion. He remembered a patient's name, Sarah, who had been admitted just last week for a critical illness. Luke checked on her progress several times that day, taking notes and updating her chart.

After his shift ended, Luke met up with some colleagues at the hospital cafeteria. They talked about their cases, sharing experiences and advice. One of them mentioned an upcoming medical conference, where some renowned experts would be presenting cutting-edge research in their field.

Luke's ears perked up as he listened to the conversation. He had always been fascinated by innovative treatments and technologies that could help patients like Sarah recover faster. The conference was scheduled for next week – perhaps it was his chance to learn from others, network with peers, and discover new ways to improve patient care.

As Luke walked home that evening, he felt a sense of purpose wash over him. He knew that life wasn't always easy, but it was moments like these, when he was exactly where he needed to be – surrounded by patients who needed his help – that made all the hard work worth it.

Baba's words echoed in his mind once more: "You are meant for greatness." Luke smiled, knowing that he still had a long way to go, but feeling more confident than ever about the path ahead.
