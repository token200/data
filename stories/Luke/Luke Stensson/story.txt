Luke Stensson trudged through the pouring rain, his eyes fixed on the worn pavement beneath his feet. As a freelance journalist, he was no stranger to the wet and wild streets of Seattle, but tonight felt different. Tonight, he was on a mission.

Rumors had been circulating about a high-stakes meeting between local business magnates and some unknown figures from the shadows. Luke had heard whispers that this gathering could be the key to exposing a deep-seated corruption scandal that had been plaguing the city for years.

As he turned a corner, Luke spotted a nondescript office building with a flickering neon sign reading "The Red Door". His heart quickened - this was it. He slipped into the shadows and observed from afar, watching as the doors opened to admit a handful of suited figures.

Just then, a sleek black sedan pulled up, disgorging an impeccably dressed woman who strode confidently towards The Red Door. Luke recognized her instantly - that was Vivian Reed, the enigmatic CEO of Reede Industries.

With a deep breath, Luke made his move, slipping past the guards and into the building's lobby. He navigated through the maze-like corridors until he finally reached The Red Door itself. As he pushed open the door, he found himself in a dimly lit chamber filled with an air thick with tension.

Luke's eyes locked onto Vivian Reed, who stood at the far end of the room, flanked by two imposing figures. He made his way towards her, notebook and pen at the ready. This was it - Luke Stensson had finally arrived at the epicenter of the scandal.
