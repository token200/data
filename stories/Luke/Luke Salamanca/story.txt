Luke Salamanca, a man shrouded in mystery and violence, sat alone at his favorite bar, nursing a whiskey. His eyes scanned the room, taking in the patrons who dared to enter his domain. The nickname "Mouse" had been coined by those who knew him, but few truly understood the cunning and ruthless individual he was.

Luke's past was marked by brutal battles with rival gangs, a legacy left behind by his infamous father, Don Vito Corleone. Yet, despite his association with organized crime, Luke operated on a different level – one of calculated precision, where loyalty was everything. His quiet confidence and measured demeanor were as deceiving as the steel in his hand.

The door swung open, and a hesitant figure slipped into the shadows. Luke recognized the young woman who had been sent by Vito's closest associates to plead his case for mercy during an impending operation against him. She whispered something urgent in his ear before swiftly disappearing back into the night. 

For a moment, Luke sat lost in thought. Operation Nightshade was scheduled to take place within days – Vito's plans were already set in motion. It was only logical that he should make himself known and protect those who served him, but doing so without drawing attention would be an uphill battle.

A flicker of determination kindled within him as the bar's lights dimmed, casting shadows across Luke's face. No amount of danger could keep him from doing what needed to be done – ensuring that all under his protection received the respect and security he was capable of offering.

He vanished into the darkness as suddenly as he had appeared, leaving behind only a faint scent of leather and smoke, an indication of where to find him next.
