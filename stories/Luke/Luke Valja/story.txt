Luke Valja stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out at the glittering city lights below. The wind whipped his dark hair into a frenzy as he leaned against the railing, lost in thought.

As the son of a high-ranking politician, Luke had always felt like an outsider in the cutthroat world of politics. His parents' constant need for validation and control had made him feel suffocated, leading him to seek solace in his art. Painting was his escape, a way to express the emotions that churned inside him.

Luke's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps behind him. He turned to see his best friend, Sophia, standing with her arms crossed, a look of concern etched on her face.

"Hey, Luke, what's going on?" she asked, falling into step beside him.

Luke shrugged, not bothering to elaborate. Sophia knew better than to push him when he was in this mood.

As they walked back down to the ground floor, Luke couldn't shake the feeling of restlessness that had settled inside him. He felt like he was trapped between two worlds – the world of his family and the world of his art.

Once they were safely indoors, Sophia led Luke to her small studio, where a canvas lay half-finished on an easel. She gestured for him to sit down beside it.

"What are you working on?" Luke asked, curiosity getting the better of him.

"I'm trying to capture the essence of you," Sophia replied with a smile. "You're always so moody and introspective – I want to convey that in this piece."

Luke's eyes scanned the canvas, taking in the swirling colors and bold brushstrokes. It was...him. He felt a surge of gratitude towards his friend.

"Thanks, Soph," he said, placing a hand on her shoulder. "That means more to me than you'll ever know."

As they sat together, lost in their own little world of art and emotion, Luke realized that maybe – just maybe – he had found a way to break free from the suffocating grip of his family's expectations.
