One evening, as he was working on a particularly intricate piece, Luke was approached by a young girl who couldn't have been more than 10 years old. She gazed up at him with wide eyes and asked, "Sir, why do you paint these powerful messages? Why do you want to make people think?" Luke smiled, his passion for art and activism shining through.

"I paint to give voice to the voiceless," he explained. "I want people to see the world in a different way, to question their assumptions and challenge the status quo." The girl nodded thoughtfully, her eyes sparkling with understanding.
