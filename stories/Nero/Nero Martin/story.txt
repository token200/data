Nero Martin stood at the edge of the rooftop, his piercing blue eyes scanning the city below. The neon lights of the skyscrapers reflected off the wet pavement like a canvas of diamonds and gold. He felt alive, like he was on top of the world.

As a former CIA operative turned private security consultant, Nero had seen it all. From the streets of Baghdad to the corridors of power in Washington D.C., he had walked among the shadows, always watching, always waiting.

But this job was different. This one was personal.

Nero's sister, Sophia, had been murdered five years ago, and despite his best efforts, he couldn't bring herself to rest. The police had closed the case, saying it was just another random killing, but Nero knew better. He had a feeling that someone had set her up, that there were secrets hidden behind the facade of a seemingly ordinary life.

As he gazed out at the city, Nero's mind began to wander back to those days in Baghdad. He had been part of an elite team, sent in to extract high-value targets from hostile territory. Sophia was supposed to be safe, but she had always been reckless, always chasing the thrill. And now...

The phone in his pocket buzzed, breaking the spell. Nero's eyes narrowed as he answered it. "Martin."

"Hey, Nero," a voice said on the other end. "It's Alex. I have some info on your sister's case."

Nero's grip on the rooftop's railing tightened. "What kind of info?"

"I found something," Alex said, hesitating. "A name. Someone who was involved in Sophia's murder."

Nero felt his heart racing, like a jackhammer pounding in his chest. He knew this was it â€“ this was the break he had been waiting for.

"Who is it?" he demanded.

Alex hesitated again before responding, "It's someone you know. Someone from your past."

Nero's eyes flashed with anger and determination. This wasn't just a case anymore; it was personal.

"I'll take care of it," Nero said, his voice low and deadly.

The line went dead, but Nero didn't need the confirmation. He knew what he had to do. The game was on, and he was ready to play.
