Nero Corbero stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a skilled mercenary and member of the infamous group known as "The Shadow Wolves," he had faced countless battles and adversaries, but tonight was different. Tonight, he had received a mysterious message from an old acquaintance, hinting at a lucrative job that required his unique set of skills.

As Nero made his way to the bar, he spotted a figure in the corner, nursing a mug of ale. The man looked familiar, but Nero couldn't quite place him. He approached cautiously, hand resting on the hilt of his sword.

"Mind if I join you?" Nero asked, voice low and even.

The stranger looked up, a hint of surprise on his face before quickly regaining composure. "Not at all, Nero Corbero," he said, with a nod. "I've been expecting you."

Nero raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "Expecting me? How did you know my name?"

The man smiled, revealing a set of crooked teeth. "We used to be comrades in arms, Nero. I'm Cassius, and I have a proposition for you."

Cassius leaned in, his voice taking on a conspiratorial tone. "There's a valuable artifact hidden within the city's walls, one that could grant us a significant advantage over our rivals. But it's heavily guarded, and requires... delicate hands to retrieve."

Nero's eyes narrowed, weighing his options. He had been out of the game for a while, but the prospect of adventure and wealth was too enticing to resist.

"I'm in," Nero said finally, extending a hand to Cassius. "Tell me more about this artifact, and what we need to do to get it."

Cassius grinned, clapping Nero's hand firmly. "I knew I could count on you, Nero Corbero. Together, we'll make history â€“ or at least, make ourselves rich."

With a nod, the unlikely duo set off into the night, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead, and prove once again why they were the most feared mercenaries in the land.
