Nero Johansson stepped into the dimly lit bar, her piercing green eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a skilled mercenary and private investigator, she had seen her fair share of dark alleys and backroom deals. But tonight was different. Tonight, she was here to meet with an old acquaintance who claimed to have information about her sister's disappearance.

Nero's thoughts drifted back to her younger sister, Luna, who had vanished three years ago under mysterious circumstances. Nero had spent countless hours searching for clues, following every lead, no matter how small or insignificant it seemed. But the case remained unsolved, and Nero's determination only grew stronger with each passing day.

She spotted her contact in the corner, a man known only as "Vinnie" to those who knew him. He was a shady character with a reputation for being able to get his hands on anything he wanted. Nero approached him cautiously, her hand resting on the grip of her gun.

"What can you tell me about Luna's disappearance?" she asked, her voice firm but controlled.

Vinnie hesitated, glancing around the room before leaning in close. "I heard it was something big," he whispered. "Something that could get us all killed."

Nero's eyes narrowed. "What are you talking about?"

Vinnie glanced at her watch before standing up and disappearing into the crowd. Nero sighed, wondering if she had just been led on a wild goose chase.

But then, a piece of paper slipped from Vinnie's pocket and landed in front of her. It was a cryptic message with only two words: "Look again."

Nero's heart skipped a beat as she realized that this might be the break she needed. She folded up the paper and tucked it into her pocket, determination igniting within her once more.

She would find Luna, no matter what it took. And this time, Nero Johansson was ready to dig deeper than ever before.
