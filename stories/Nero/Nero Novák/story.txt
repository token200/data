Nero Nov√°k stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station. As a private investigator, he had seen his fair share of rough neighborhoods, but there was something about this one that didn't sit right with him.

Nero's instincts told him to be cautious as he made his way through the crowded streets, his hand resting on the grip of his gun. He had been hired by a wealthy businessman to investigate a string of burglaries in the area, and Nero had a feeling that something was off about this case.

As he walked, Nero noticed a figure watching him from across the street. The woman was striking, with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She beckoned to him, and Nero felt a shiver run down his spine as he approached her.

"Who are you?" Nero asked, his hand still resting on his gun.

"I'm Sophia," she replied, her voice husky and confident. "I've been hired by the same client who sent you."

Nero's eyes narrowed. "What do you know about this case?"

Sophia smiled, a hint of mischief in her eyes. "Let's just say that I have my suspicions. But if you're looking for answers, you'll need to talk to the owner of this building."

Nero followed Sophia as she led him through the winding streets, eventually arriving at a nondescript office building. Inside, he found himself face to face with Victor Laurent, the wealthy businessman who had hired Nero.

As they spoke, Nero couldn't shake the feeling that Sophia was hiding something from him. He made a mental note to keep an eye on her as he dug deeper into the case, determined to uncover the truth behind the string of burglaries.

But for now, Nero was content to sit back and let Victor do the talking. After all, it was Victor who had hired him, and Nero trusted his instincts to guide him through this complex web of deceit and betrayal. As he listened to Victor's story, Nero couldn't help but wonder what secrets lay hidden beneath the surface of this seemingly ordinary case.
