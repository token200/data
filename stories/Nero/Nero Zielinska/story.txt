In the city's underbelly, where the streets were narrow and the alleys whispered secrets, Nero Zielinska was a figure shrouded in mystery. Few knew her true name, but whispers of her exploits had become legendary among the initiated.

Reno, as she was known to those closest to her, was a master thief with fingers as quick as the shadows themselves. Her eyes gleamed with an inner fire that seemed to burn brighter with every daring heist, and her smile could disarm even the most vigilant guards. But few dared call her by her full name, for it was said that Nero Zielinska was cursed – that anyone who spoke her true name aloud would be haunted by dark visions and eerie dreams.

Reno had grown up on the streets, surviving by her wits and her cunning. She had learned to weave in and out of the city's fabric like a ghost, leaving behind only whispers of her presence. But as she grew older, Reno began to crave more than just scraps and handouts – she wanted power.

She assembled a motley crew of accomplices, each with their own unique skills: there was Jax, the safecracker; Luna, the lock expert; and Zephyr, the getaway driver. Together, they hatched plans that would make even the most seasoned thieves green with envy. And so, Nero Zielinska's legend grew, as she pulled off daring heists with an ease that bordered on the supernatural.

One night, Reno received a mysterious summons from a wealthy patron – one who offered her a deal she couldn't refuse: pull off one final job, and in return, she would be granted the wealth and influence she had always dreamed of. The catch? She had to use her full name, Nero Zielinska, to seal the deal.

Reno hesitated for a moment, but the allure of power proved too great. She agreed to the terms, knowing that once spoken aloud, her true name would bind her forever. As she whispered the words, a shiver ran down her spine – for in that instant, she knew that there was no turning back. The curse had been activated, and Nero Zielinska's fate was sealed.
