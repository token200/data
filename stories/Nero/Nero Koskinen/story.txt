Nero Koskinen stepped into the dimly lit room, his eyes adjusting to the shadows that danced across the walls. The air was heavy with the scent of old leather and stale cigarettes. He had been summoned by the infamous crime lord, Viktor Petrov.

As he took a seat across from Petrov, Nero couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. Their conversation was always shrouded in tension, like a game of cat and mouse played out on the razor's edge of violence.

"What do you want, Petrov?" Nero asked bluntly, his voice firm despite the tremble in his hands.

Petrov leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers together as he spoke. "I have a problem, Koskinen. One of my... associates has gone missing. And I believe you know more than you're letting on."

Nero's gaze narrowed. He had always been tight-lipped about his past, but Petrov knew the truth all too well. The former detective had been consumed by the flames of corruption and revenge after his partner was murdered in a botched sting operation.

"I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about," Nero said with a smirk, trying to conceal the spark of curiosity that flared within him.

Petrov snorted, a low rumble that sent shivers down Nero's spine. "Don't play dumb, Koskinen. We both know you were the one who broke your partner out of the asylum before she went missing."

Nero's smile faltered for an instant, and Petrov saw his chance. He leaned forward, his eyes glinting with a sinister light. "You owe me, Koskinen. And now I'm going to collect."

For a moment, Nero was tempted to reveal everything â€“ the darkness that had consumed him, the chains of guilt that bound him to the shadows. But something inside him clicked into place, and he shook his head. "I don't know what you're talking about," he repeated, his voice dripping with defiance.

Petrov's expression darkened, and Nero knew he was playing a dangerous game. The outcome was far from certain, but one thing was clear: only one of them would walk out of this room alive.
