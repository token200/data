Nero Jankowska stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, her eyes scanning the rooftops for any sign of movement. As a private investigator, she had seen it all - the desperation in people's eyes, the lies they told to hide the truth. But tonight was different. Tonight, she was on the hunt for information about a man who had been dead for over a decade.

Rumors swirled that Nero Jankowska herself had played a role in his demise, and the whispers were starting to get under her skin. She pushed them aside, focusing on the task at hand. Her client, a reclusive millionaire, had hired her to uncover the truth about the mysterious death of his business partner.

As she crept through the alleyway, Nero Jankowska's phone buzzed with an incoming text from an unknown number. "Look again at the evidence," it read. She snorted - who was behind this? A ghost from her past or just a clever hacker?

She made her way back to her office, a cramped space above a dingy bar in the city's seediest part of town. Nero Jankowska dumped her bag onto the cluttered desk and began searching for any clues that might have been missed.

The case files were old - dusty documents and faded photographs that seemed to hold little significance now. But one image stood out: a grainy photograph of Nero Jankowska herself, standing next to the deceased businessman on the night he died.

A chill ran down her spine as she stared at the photo. Had someone been trying to tell her something? She felt a hand on her shoulder and spun around, gun drawn.

It was just her assistant, Mark - or so she thought. The man's eyes flickered with something else, something familiar... "Nero Jankowska, you really need to take care of yourself," he whispered, his voice laced with menace.

For a moment, Nero Jankowska forgot about the case and the secrets hidden within the shadows. She saw herself in Mark's eyes - the same fire that drove her now had driven him too, years ago. And then it clicked: this was not just another client wanting information. This was someone who knew the truth.

With newfound determination, Nero Jankowska turned the tables on Mark and pressed a button on her phone. The lights flickered and went out, plunging them into darkness. When they came back on, Nero Jankowska stood over Mark's unconscious form, gun still trained on him. "I think it's time I took care of myself," she whispered to herself, before walking away into the night.
