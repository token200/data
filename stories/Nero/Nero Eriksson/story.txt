Nero Eriksson stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the bustling streets of Stockholm. The snowflakes danced around him, casting a serene melody over the city's vibrant scene. As he navigated through the crowded market stalls, Nero's eyes scanned the crowds with an air of quiet confidence.

By day, Nero Eriksson was a successful businessman, known for his sharp wit and cunning negotiation skills. However, by night, he donned a different persona – that of a skilled thief and con artist. The thrill of outsmarting his marks and leaving them with a trail of unanswered questions had become an addictive rush.

As Nero wove through the stalls, he spotted a peculiar-looking watch on display. It was a rare, antique timepiece, said to grant its owner unparalleled luck and foresight. Intrigued, Nero began to circle the stall, sizing up the seller. The old man's eyes seemed to sparkle with a knowing glint, and Nero sensed that this was more than just a simple trinket.

"Ah, you have an eye for the rare," the seller said, as Nero approached him. "This watch has been in my family for generations. A true treasure."

Nero's fingers brushed against the watch's surface, feeling an electric tingle run through his veins. He knew he had to have it – not just for its monetary value, but for the power it promised.

"I'll give you five thousand kronor," Nero said, with a sly smile.

The seller chuckled, his eyes glinting with amusement. "I think you'll find that's a bit low, young man. But I'll tell you what – I'll make you a deal. If you can answer my riddle, the watch is yours."

Nero's ears perked up, intrigued by the challenge. He nodded, and the seller presented him with the riddle: "What can be broken, but never held? What can be given, but never sold?"

Nero Eriksson pondered the riddle for a moment, before a sly grin spread across his face. "The answer is a promise," he said, with confidence.

The seller's eyes widened in surprise, and Nero knew he had won. He handed over the cash, and the watch was his – its power coursing through him like adrenaline. As he walked away from the stall, Nero felt invincible, ready to take on whatever the night had in store for him.
