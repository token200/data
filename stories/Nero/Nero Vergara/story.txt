Nero Vergara stepped off the bus and onto the dusty streets of El Centro, Mexico. He had been traveling for days, fleeing the law back in the United States after a string of high-profile heists. As he looked down at his worn boots, he knew it was time to lay low for a while.

A former thief and con artist, Nero had always lived by his wits. But after a job went sour and he found himself facing prison time, he decided it was time to leave the life behind. Or so he thought.

As he made his way through the crowded market, Nero's eyes scanned the stalls, taking in the vibrant colors and sounds of the local vendors. He had always been drawn to the energy of cities like El Centro, where anyone could make a fresh start.

Nero spotted a small cantina on the edge of town and slipped inside, his eyes adjusting to the dim light within. The bartender, a gruff but kind-eyed man named Carlos, looked up from polishing a mug with a curious gaze.

"You're new around here," Carlos said, nodding towards Nero's backpack. "What brings you to our humble city?"

Nero smiled, taking a seat at the bar. "Just passing through. Looking for work, maybe."

Carlos nodded thoughtfully. "I might have something. There's a small business nearby, needs help with deliveries. You'd be perfect for it."

Over the next few weeks, Nero settled into his new life as a delivery man. It wasn't glamorous, but it paid the bills and gave him time to think about his future.

As he worked, Nero began to notice that Carlos was watching him with an intensity that made him uncomfortable. He tried to brush it off as mere curiosity, but the sensation lingered.

One night, as Nero was leaving the cantina after a long day's work, he caught Carlos whispering to someone in the corner of the room. The figure stepped forward, revealing a woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair.

"Nero Vergara," she said, her voice husky. "I've been looking for you."

Nero's instincts went on high alert as the woman approached him. Who was this mysterious stranger? And what did they want from him?

With a sense of trepidation, Nero followed her out into the night, wondering where this new path would lead him.
