Nero Angert stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out at the city below. His piercing green eyes seemed to drink in every detail, from the way the sunlight danced on the pavement to the hum of the traffic in the distance. He was a man lost in thought, his mind consumed by the memories of a lifetime.

As he stood there, the wind whipped through his dark hair, revealing the sharp lines of his face. His nose was aquiline, his lips thin and pressed together in a perpetual scowl. It was a face that commanded attention, yet also seemed to demand submission.

Nero Angert was a man of mystery, shrouded in secrecy. Few knew what drove him, or where he came from. Some said he was a former assassin, trained from a young age in the art of stealth and deception. Others whispered that he was a sorcerer, using his powers to manipulate those around him.

The truth, as always, lay somewhere in between.

He had once been part of an elite group, bound together by a shared purpose: to bring down a corrupt government that had strangled the life from their city. But after a tragic betrayal, Nero had found himself alone, forced to rely on his own wits and cunning to survive.

As he stood at the edge of the rooftop, he thought back to those fateful days. He remembered the rush of adrenaline as he fought alongside his comrades, the taste of sweat on his lips, and the sound of gunfire in the background.

But most of all, he remembered the face of his former comrade, the one who had betrayed him. A face that haunted his dreams still, a constant reminder of what could have been.

Nero's eyes narrowed, his gaze focusing intently on some point in the distance. He took a step forward, his movements fluid and deliberate. For a moment, it seemed as though he was about to leap into action, to pursue the unknown path that lay before him.

But then, he hesitated. And for an instant, his resolve faltered.

He stood there, frozen in indecision, as the city spread out before him like a vast, pulsing tapestry. The wind continued to whip through his hair, and the shadows danced on the walls below.

And in that moment of uncertainty, Nero Angert was lost once more to the labyrinthine corridors of his own mind.
