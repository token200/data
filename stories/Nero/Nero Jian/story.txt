In the sweltering heat of the summer solstice, Nero Jian strolled through the bustling streets of ancient Rome, his eyes scanning the crowds with an air of superiority. As a member of the imperial family, he was accustomed to being treated with reverence and respect.

Nero Jian's thoughts were consumed by the troubles that had been plaguing him lately. His half-brother, Galba, had recently been appointed as Emperor, and Nero couldn't help but feel a sense of resentment towards his usurper. He had once believed himself to be the rightful heir to the throne, but now he was forced to bide his time.

As he walked, Nero Jian's mind wandered back to the days when he was young and ambitious. He had been groomed from a early age to take the throne, and he had proven himself to be a skilled and ruthless leader. But Galba's rise to power had dealt him a severe blow, and he was left to seethe with anger and frustration.

Despite his troubles, Nero Jian remained a charismatic figure, able to charm and manipulate those around him with ease. He made his way through the crowds, nodding and smiling as he went, all the while plotting his next move.

As the sun began to set, Nero Jian arrived at his favorite tavern, a secluded spot where he could let his guard down and indulge in a drink or two. The patrons were familiar faces, and they greeted him with a mix of deference and suspicion. They knew better than to cross him, but they also couldn't help but be drawn to his magnetism.

Nero Jian ordered a cup of wine and took a seat at the bar, surveying the room with a calculating gaze. He was a man on a mission, driven by a burning desire for revenge against those who had wronged him. But for now, he would have to bide his time, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

The night wore on, and Nero Jian's thoughts turned to the future, his mind racing with schemes and plots. He was a man of destiny, and he would not be silenced. Not yet, at least.
