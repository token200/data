Growing up in a small town surrounded by rolling hills and lush forests, Vivaan developed a deep love for nature.

One day, a prominent art collector came to Vivaan's studio, seeking his latest piece. The collector was impressed not only by Vivaan's technical skill but also by the depth of emotion that seemed to radiate from his artwork.
