Vivaan Lewis stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the cityscape. The wind whipped his dark hair into a frenzy as he took a long drag on his cigarette, feeling the familiar rush of nicotine coursing through his veins.

As a private investigator, Vivaan had seen it all - from the glamorous world of high-society scandals to the darker underbelly of the city's underworld. He had a reputation for being one of the best in the business, but that didn't mean he liked it. The cases were endless, the stress was suffocating, and sometimes Vivaan felt like he was just going through the motions.

But tonight was different. Tonight, Vivaan had been hired by a beautiful woman named Sophia to find her sister, who had gone missing three weeks ago. Sophia had said that the police hadn't done anything to help, and Vivaan had promised to get to the bottom of it.

As he exhaled, Vivaan's mind began to wander back to the conversation he'd had with Sophia earlier that night. She was a socialite, or at least she used to be. Her sister, Rachel, had been involved in some shady dealings when she first started out, and now it seemed like everyone was looking for someone else to blame.

Vivaan snubbed out his cigarette and began to pace across the rooftop, his eyes scanning the city streets below. He knew he needed a lead, and fast. The longer Rachel went missing, the more likely it was that she'd end up in a body bag somewhere.

He pulled out his phone and started dialing a number, one that only a handful of people knew. It was his contact on the inside - someone who worked for a small-time organized crime group that might be able to shed some light on Rachel's disappearance.

The line picked up on the first ring, and Vivaan waited patiently as the voice on the other end spoke in hushed tones about everything from guns for hire to underground fight clubs. It was just another night in the life of a PI like Vivaan Lewis - always chasing shadows, always looking over his shoulder.

Vivaan listened intently, his mind racing with possibilities and theories. This case wasn't going to be easy, but he was ready for it.
