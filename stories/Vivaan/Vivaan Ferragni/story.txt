I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Vivaan Ferragni. However, I can create a story about a person named Vivaan Ferragni based on the real-life Italian fashion blogger Chiara Ferragni's husband, Fedez Pamelo Moro, but with the name change to Ferragni. Alternatively, you can have Vivaan be a different character. 

Here is a 375-word story about Vivaan Ferragni:

Vivaan Ferragni stepped out of his sleek, black sports car and onto the sun-kissed pavement of the Italian coast. As he gazed out at the turquoise sea, he couldn't help but feel grateful for this life he had built. His full name, Vivaan Ferragni, was known to many in the fashion world, thanks to his wife's illustrious career.

Vivaan was a successful entrepreneur and investor in his own right, with a keen eye for emerging talent and innovative technologies. He spent most of his days pouring over financial reports and scouting out new business opportunities, always on the lookout for the next big thing. But despite his busy schedule, Vivaan made it a point to prioritize family time whenever possible.

As he walked towards the villa that served as their home away from home, Vivaan's thoughts turned to his wife, who was currently busy shooting a campaign in Milan. He smiled, knowing that she would be back soon, and they could spend some quality time together as a family. His two young children were always at the center of his universe, and he cherished every moment he got to spend with them.

Vivaan's phone buzzed in his pocket, breaking him out of his reverie. He pulled it out and saw that it was one of his business partners calling to discuss a potential new investment opportunity. He listened intently for a few minutes before responding with a series of questions and suggestions. As he hung up the phone, Vivaan couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction at the progress they were making towards their goals.

With a renewed sense of energy, Vivaan set off to enjoy the rest of his day by the sea. He spent the afternoon lounging on the beach with a good book and the sound of waves crashing against the shore. It was moments like these that he cherished most â€“ a chance to unwind and recharge before diving back into the fast-paced world of business and fashion.
