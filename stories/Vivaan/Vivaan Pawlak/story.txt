Vivaan Pawlak was an enigma. A name whispered in hushed tones among those who knew him, he was a man shrouded in mystery and intrigue. Few had seen him up close, yet his presence seemed to command attention like a magnet.

As a child, Vivaan had been a loner, preferring the company of books and the quiet streets of his neighborhood to the din of playground chatter. His parents had been academics, scholars who spent their days lost in the pages of dusty tomes and their evenings lost in heated debates about politics and philosophy.
