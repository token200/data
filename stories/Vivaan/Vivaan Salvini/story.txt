Vivaan Salvini stepped off the plane in Paris, his eyes scanning the bustling airport for any sign of chaos. He was no stranger to turmoil, having grown up on the streets of Mumbai as a child of an Italian father and Indian mother.

As he made his way through customs, Vivaan's thoughts turned to his latest mission. A wealthy tech mogul had gone missing in the City of Light, leaving behind only a cryptic message that spoke of "hidden truths" and "unseen eyes".

Vivaan knew he was being watched. He always did. It came with the territory of being a private investigator for those who needed their problems solved without raising a whisper.

He hailed a taxi and gave the driver an address in the Latin Quarter. The streets were narrow and winding, but Vivaan navigated them like a pro, his senses heightened as he took in every detail.

At a small café on Rue de l'Abbé de l'Épée, Vivaan spotted his contact, a striking woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. "Welcome," she said, beckoning him to the table outside.

Vivaan slid into the seat, his gaze sweeping the crowded square before he leaned back in his chair. "So?" he asked, as she ordered two cups of espresso.

"Rumors are spreading like wildfire," she began. "People claim to have seen the tech mogul lurking around the Louvre at midnight, dressed in a velvet cloak and a top hat."

Vivaan raised an eyebrow. The tale was getting more outlandish by the minute. Yet he knew better than to underestimate.

"Did you find any other leads?" he asked, as his contact handed him a file containing photographs of the missing mogul's associates.

Vivaan scanned the pictures quickly, identifying several names and faces that belonged to influential players in Parisian high society. This case was no longer just about solving a simple disappearance – it was starting to look like something much bigger.

"Hidden truths," Vivaan muttered under his breath, shaking his head. He knew he had only scratched the surface of this enigma.

But for now, he would follow the threads of deceit and uncover what secrets Paris held. The darkness within him stirred at the prospect – a thrill that came from stepping into the unknown.

He tucked the file back in his pocket and stood up to leave, eyes locked on the city's underbelly as it whispered its secrets to Vivaan Salvini.
