Vivaan Hassan sat at his desk, staring out the window at the chaotic streets of Mumbai. As the owner of a small, yet successful advertising agency, he had seen it all - from the highs of launching a new product to the lows of watching a campaign go bankrupt.

But Vivaan's mind was not on work today. It was consumed by memories of his late father, who had started this very agency years ago. His mother had passed away when he was just a teenager, leaving him with two young siblings to care for. His father, being the rock that he was, had shouldered the responsibility single-handedly.

Vivaan's eyes drifted back to the photo on his desk - a faded black and white image of himself as a child, standing beside his parents at a family gathering. He remembered how proud his father looked in that moment, beaming with pride at the sight of his three children.

As he delved deeper into nostalgia, Vivaan's thoughts turned to his own struggles. Growing up without a mother had left him with an emotional void, which he had always tried to fill through work. But as the years went by, he realized that there was more to life than just success and achievement.

Just then, his phone buzzed with an incoming call from his most trusted friend and business partner, Rohan. "Hey Vivaan, what's up?" Rohan asked over the line.

"Not much, just lost in thought," Vivaan replied, trying to hide his melancholy mood.

"Come on, let's grab some lunch and catch up," Rohan suggested. "I have a feeling you're not here for work."

Vivaan chuckled, knowing that Rohan was right. They decided to meet at the old caf√© in Bandra, where Vivaan used to spend hours with his father.

As they sat down over steaming cups of chai, Vivaan opened up to Rohan about his struggles. He shared stories of how he had always felt like he was living in his father's shadow, trying to prove himself as a worthy successor to the agency.

Rohan listened intently, offering words of encouragement and advice. "Vivaan, you are your own man," he said firmly. "Your father would want you to be happy and fulfilled."

Vivaan took Rohan's words to heart, realizing that he had been so focused on living up to his family's expectations that he had forgotten what truly made him happy.

From that day forward, Vivaan vowed to take a step back and re-evaluate his priorities. He knew it wouldn't be easy, but with the support of friends like Rohan, he was ready to embark on this new journey and find his own path in life - one that would honor his father's legacy while also forging his own unique identity.
