Vivaan Mikhailov stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. He had been traveling for days, and the isolation was starting to take its toll. As he made his way through the empty carriages, a figure emerged from the shadows - a woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair.

"Can I help you?" she asked, her voice husky and confident.

Vivaan's gaze lingered on her face before he replied, "Just looking for someone."

The woman raised an eyebrow. "Who might that be?"

"I'm not entirely sure," Vivaan admitted, his voice low and even. "I received a message saying she'd be waiting for me here."

The woman nodded, her expression unreadable. "Ah, I see. Well, you've arrived at the right place. My name is Lena, by the way."

Vivaan's eyes narrowed slightly as he took in her features. There was something about her that didn't quite add up.

"What's your business with me?" Vivaan asked, his tone neutral.

Lena smiled, a small, enigmatic smile. "Let's just say we have a mutual acquaintance. Someone who's been keeping an eye on you, Vivaan Mikhailov."

Vivaan's heart skipped a beat at the mention of his full name. How did she know that?

"What do you want from me?" he asked, his voice firm but controlled.

Lena leaned against the wall, her eyes never leaving his face. "I think we can help each other out, Vivaan. We both have... interests in common. And I'm willing to bet that our mutual acquaintance has some information that could change everything for you."

Vivaan's mind was racing now. What did Lena know about him? How had she found out his full name?

"Tell me more," he said finally, his curiosity getting the better of him.

Lena's smile grew wider, and for a moment, Vivaan thought he saw a glimmer of something else there - something almost like excitement.

"I'll tell you everything," she promised. "But first, we need to get out of here. We can't talk openly in public."

Vivaan nodded, his eyes never leaving Lena's face. He had no idea what lay ahead, but he was willing to take the risk to find out.
