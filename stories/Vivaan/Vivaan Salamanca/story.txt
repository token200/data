Vivaan Salamanca walked into the dimly lit bar, scanning the room for familiar faces. He was known as a man of few words, but his piercing green eyes seemed to see right through everyone in the establishment. His jet-black hair was perfectly messy, framing his angular face and sharp jawline.

As he made his way to the bar, a figure emerged from the shadows - Vivaan's brother, Marco. The two brothers were notorious for their ruthless tactics in the business world, but Vivaan's charisma and charm often won over potential adversaries.

"Vivaan Salamanca," Marco said, with a hint of sarcasm. "I didn't know you were a fan of this dump."

Vivaan smiled wryly, taking a seat next to his brother. "It's not the Ritz, but it's home."

The bartender, a gruff old man with a thick accent, poured Vivaan a whiskey on the rocks. As he sipped his drink, Vivaan's eyes locked onto a beautiful woman sitting alone at a table in the corner.

Marco followed his gaze and raised an eyebrow. "Who's the beauty?"

Vivaan shrugged, his shoulders barely moving beneath his tailored suit. "I don't know, but I aim to find out."

As if on cue, the woman caught Vivaan's eye and smiled coyly. He excused himself from Marco and sauntered over to her table.

"My name is Sophia," she said, extending a manicured hand.

Vivaan Salamanca took her hand in his, feeling an instant spark of attraction. "I'm Vivaan."

The two of them chatted effortlessly, discussing everything from art to music to their shared love of fine wine. As the night wore on, it became clear that Sophia was more than just a pretty face - she was intelligent, witty, and had a sharp tongue.

Marco watched his brother with a mixture of amusement and concern, knowing that Vivaan's reputation as a ladies' man precedented him. But as he saw the way Sophia looked at Vivaan, her eyes shining with genuine interest, he couldn't help but wonder if this might be different.
