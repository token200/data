Vivaan Roux stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of life. It had been months since she'd set foot in this small town, and yet it felt like a lifetime ago that she was leaving. Vivaan Roux took a deep breath, the familiar scent of saltwater and diesel fuel filling her lungs.

As she made her way through the crowds, a young man with a messy beard and worn jeans caught her eye. He was sitting on a bench, staring intently at his phone. Vivaan Roux felt a pang of recognition - wasn't he that boy who'd once walked alongside her to school?

She approached him cautiously, not wanting to startle him. "Hey," she said softly, trying to sound nonchalant.

The boy looked up, startled, and then broke into a wide grin. "Vivaan Roux! I never thought I'd run into you again!"

Vivaan Roux smiled back, feeling a little like she was reliving old memories. They spent the next hour catching up on lost time, talking about everything from their favorite books to their most recent adventures.

As they walked through the station, Vivaan Roux noticed the boy's phone had a cracked screen and a worn case. She reached into her bag and pulled out a spare battery she'd picked up at a thrift store. "Here," she said, pressing the battery into his hand.

The boy looked at her in surprise, then smiled again. "Thanks, Vivaan Roux. I owe you one."

Vivaan Roux shrugged, feeling a little like she was back in high school. It was funny how things came full circle sometimes. She and the boy, whose name was Max, chatted some more before saying their goodbyes.

As she watched him disappear into the crowd, Vivaan Roux couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her. Being back in this small town had brought up memories she thought were long buried. But maybe that was the point - sometimes you needed to face your past in order to move forward.

Vivaan Roux turned and made her way out of the station, feeling the cool ocean breeze on her skin. She took a deep breath, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
