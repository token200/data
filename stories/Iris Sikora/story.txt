Iris Sikora stood before the grand, crystal-encrusted mirror that lined one wall of her Manhattan apartment. Her long, raven-black hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall of night, framing her heart-shaped face with precision. She was poised for battle.

As a skilled Occult detective, Iris had made it her mission to solve the most bizarre and inexplicable crimes in the city that never slept. With her expertise in magical law enforcement, she had earned a reputation as one of the go-to experts for cases involving supernatural entities.

Iris took a deep breath, mentally preparing herself for what lay ahead. Her eyes narrowed as she examined her reflection. A hint of red on her left cheekbone was a dead giveaway that she'd been fighting a particularly nasty demon last night. It wouldn't take much to get into the zone; after all, she had spent years honing her skills in the occult.

Just then, her phone buzzed with an incoming call from the NYPD's 15th precinct. "Iris, we've got another body on the way," a gruff voice said over the line. Iris recognized Detective James "Jim" O'Connor – one of the few humans who knew about her true nature and had earned her trust.

Iris listened intently as Jim filled her in on the details: victim was a 25-year-old college student, found dead with no signs of forced entry or struggle. The only clue was an unusual symbol carved into his forehead.

As she listened, Iris's mind began to spin theories. This could be more than just a random act of violence – it might be something bigger, something connected to the recent surge in demonic activity that had been plaguing the city.

With her mental gears whirring, Iris nodded as if Jim was standing right next to her (he wasn't; she couldn't exactly admit to her Occult work). "Thanks for calling me, Jim. I'll be there ASAP."

As she ended the call, Iris's gaze locked onto the mirror once more. Tonight would not be different from any other – it would be a battle of wills and wits against forces beyond human comprehension.

With a steely determination etched on her face, Iris Sikora turned away from the mirror, ready to take on whatever lay ahead. For in this city where magic lurked in every shadow, she was one of the few ones who knew how to find it – and fight back.

She strode confidently into the night, prepared to face whatever horrors awaited her. The Occult detective had a job to do – and nothing would stop her from getting it done.
