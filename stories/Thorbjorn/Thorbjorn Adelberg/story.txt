Thorbjorn Adelberg trudged through the snow-covered streets, his eyes fixed on the worn-out soles of his boots. As a maintenance worker for the city's heating system, he had grown accustomed to the bitter cold that came with winter in Oslo.

As he made his way to the next scheduled repair, Thorbjorn's mind wandered back to the argument he had with his wife, Helga, earlier that morning. She had been nagging him about his lack of progress on fixing up their old cottage on the outskirts of town. Thorbjorn knew she was right, but it seemed like every time he tried to tackle a project, something else came up.

Just as he was starting to feel like he'd never get around to fixing that leaky faucet, Thorbjorn's radio crackled to life. "Thorbjorn Adelberg, this is dispatch. We've got a report of a frozen pipe at 345 Nils Olavsgate. You're the closest available maintenance worker. Can you make it?"

Thorbjorn groaned inwardly, but he knew he couldn't ignore the call. He trudged through the snow to the designated address, his mind already racing with worst-case scenarios.

As he arrived at the property, Thorbjorn assessed the situation quickly. The pipe was indeed frozen, and water had started to seep into the basement. With a nod to himself, Thorbjorn set to work, carefully thawing the pipe and patching up any damage.

It wasn't the most glamorous job, but Thorbjorn Adelberg took pride in his work. He knew that without him, people would be shivering through the cold winter nights, or worse, with no heat at all. As he finished up the repairs and headed back to the depot, Thorbjorn felt a sense of satisfaction wash over him. Maybe it wasn't the most exciting life, but it was his life, and he was good at it.

As he clocked out and headed home, Thorbjorn couldn't help but think about Helga's words earlier that morning: "Thorbjorn Adelberg, you're a maintenance worker, not a carpenter. Why can't you fix things around here?" He chuckled to himself as he walked through the door, knowing that one day he'd finally get that cottage fixed up and make her proud.
