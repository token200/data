Thorbjorn Molnar was known for his peculiar profession – he was a professional line-stander. Yes, you read that right. While many people dreamed of being stand-up comedians or successful entrepreneurs, Thorbjorn found solace in waiting in line for hours on end to secure the best seats at concerts, sales events, and even new iPhone releases.

People often wondered what drove someone to do such an unusual job, but Thorbjorn took pride in his work. He enjoyed the camaraderie with fellow line-standers, bonding over shared experiences of waiting in the rain or freezing cold for hours on end. His extensive knowledge of concerts and sales schedules allowed him to expertly navigate the crowds and ensure he secured the best spots.

One day, Thorbjorn received a lucrative offer from a tech giant to be the sole line-stander at their new product launch. The catch? He had to spend the entire weekend waiting in line for 48 hours straight, with minimal breaks or compensation. At first, Thorbjorn hesitated, but something about the challenge resonated with him.

As he waited, Thorbjorn noticed a peculiar character standing next to him – an eccentric woman named Luna who claimed to be a professional snail trainer. Their conversation flowed effortlessly, covering topics from snail racing to the meaning of life. Before long, they exchanged numbers and promised to meet up for a drink after the launch.

The day of the product release arrived, and Thorbjorn was ready. He donned his signature line-stander gear – bright orange jumpsuit, neon sunglasses, and a backpack full of snacks. As the crowd swelled around him, he stood firm, unfazed by the pouring rain or the throngs of people passing by.

When the new product was finally released, Thorbjorn had secured a coveted spot near the front of the line. He watched with satisfaction as the crowd erupted into cheers and applause, knowing that his dedication had paid off once again. As he waited to exit the store with his prize, Luna reappeared, this time with a tray of freshly baked cupcakes. "I guess you could say our snail racing days are over," she joked, handing Thorbjorn a cupcake.
