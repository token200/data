A seasoned sailor and navigator, he had spent his life charting the treacherous waters of the North Atlantic. His reputation as a master mariner preceded him, striking fear into the hearts of those who dared to challenge his expertise.

As he scanned the horizon, Thorbjorn's weathered eyes detected a faint outline on the waves - a ship in distress, struggling to stay afloat amidst the turbulent waters. Without hesitation, he sprang into action, bellowing orders at his crew as they set course to rescue the stranded vessel.

Thorbjorn Lefevre's instincts proved spot-on, guiding the smaller ship through treacherous shoals and narrow channels with ease.
