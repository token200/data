Thorbjorn Lemoine was an enigmatic figure, shrouded in mystery and intrigue. A renowned archaeologist with a passion for uncovering the secrets of the past, he had spent his career traversing the globe in search of forgotten civilizations.

Born into a family of collectors and curators, Thorbjorn Lemoine had always been drawn to the thrill of the hunt. As a young man, he would spend hours pouring over dusty texts and crumbling scrolls, searching for hints of long-lost cultures.
