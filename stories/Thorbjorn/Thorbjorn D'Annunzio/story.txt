Thorbjorn D'Annunzio stood at the edge of the bustling market square, surveying the colorful stalls and lively chatter of the crowd. As a merchant's son from the small town of Willowdale, he was no stranger to the hustle and bustle of everyday life. But today, Thorbjorn had other plans.

With a spring in his step and a twinkle in his eye, he weaved through the throngs of people, exchanging greetings and smiles with the locals. His dark hair was neatly tied back, revealing a strong jawline and piercing blue eyes that seemed to sparkle with mischief. As he navigated the stalls, Thorbjorn's fingers brushed against an assortment of exotic spices, rare fabrics, and gleaming trinkets.

At his side, a small pouch slung over his shoulder, adorned with intricate patterns and symbols of good fortune. Within its depths lay a stash of coins, carefully saved from his own meager earnings as a young apprentice to the town's blacksmith. Thorbjorn had big dreams, and he was determined to make them a reality.

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the market square, Thorbjorn made his way to the local tavern, where rumors of an upcoming merchant guild meeting had drawn him like a magnet. There, among the rough-hewn tables and ale-stained benches, he spotted a familiar face - that of Marcellus Wychwood, the gruff but fair-minded guildmaster.

Thorbjorn D'Annunzio approached Marcellus with a confident air, his eyes locked on the older man's as he extended a hand in greeting. "Good evening, Master Wychwood," he said, his voice steady and strong. "I trust I'm not interrupting anything important?"

Marcellus looked him up and down before nodding curtly. "Not at all, young Thorbjorn. I believe you have a proposal to share with us all?" A hint of curiosity sparkled in the old man's eyes, and Thorbjorn knew he had his chance. With a deep breath, he launched into his pitch, his words tumbling forth like a pent-up storm.
