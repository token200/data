"I am the instrument of change, the harbinger of a new era. You would do well to remember my name, for Thorbjorn Julius Caesar Octavianus Augustus will be remembered for eternity."

As the crowd dispersed and the senators retreated, Thorbjorn Julius Caesar Octavianus Augustus stood tall, his presence commanding attention like a titan among mortals. The whispers continued, but now they were laced with awe and reverence. In that moment, it was clear: this enigmatic figure would shape the course of history, leaving an indelible mark on the annals of time.
