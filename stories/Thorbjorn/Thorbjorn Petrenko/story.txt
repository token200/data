Thorbjorn Petrenko stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his worn boots making a familiar scuffling sound on the metal grating. It had been ten years since he'd returned to his hometown of Ravensburg, and yet the place still felt like home. As he made his way through the quiet station, the bell above the door jingling softly as it swung open to admit him.

Thorbjorn Petrenko's thoughts turned to the small bakery on Main Street, where he'd spent countless hours as a child, learning the intricacies of pastry-making from his mother. Now, at 35, he was the proprietor of that very bakery, and he couldn't imagine living anywhere else.

As he walked through the door, the sweet scent of freshly baked bread enveloped him, and his stomach growled in anticipation. His employees, a handful of familiar faces, looked up from their workstations as he approached, exchanging warm smiles with the man who'd once been their boss.

"Good morning, Thorbjorn," one of them said, using the nickname only he was allowed. "We're running low on croissants. Can we get some more flour in?"

Thorbjorn nodded, already mentally calculating the costs and logistics of ordering more supplies. It was a small detail, but it was ones like this that reminded him why he'd stayed in Ravensburg all these years: the routine, the comfort, and the sense of belonging.

His mother had always been his rock, even after she passed away five years ago. He kept her memory alive by running the bakery just as she'd taught him to run it - with love, care, and a commitment to excellence that only came from someone who truly cared about their craft.

As he began barking orders and supervising the baking process, Thorbjorn Petrenko felt a sense of contentment wash over him. This was where he belonged: in his bakery, surrounded by people he loved, making the sweet treats that brought joy to so many lives.
