Thorbjorn Salemi stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his piercing blue eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As the self-appointed guardian of the city's hidden corners, it was his duty to keep the peace and protect its inhabitants from those who would seek to do them harm.

A hulking figure loomed at the bar, his massive arms crossed over his chest as he nursed a mug of frothy ale. Thorbjorn's gaze narrowed as he approached, recognizing the scar above the man's left eyebrow – a mark that told only one story: he was a collector of debts, and those debts were not to be trifled with.

"Evening, Gorath," Thorbjorn said, his voice like a gentle breeze on a summer's day. "What brings you to our humble tavern?"

Gorath snorted, his laughter like the rumble of thunder. "Just passing through, Salemi. I'm not looking for trouble... yet."

Thorbjorn raised an eyebrow, his hand drifting to the hammer at his side. He knew Gorath's tactics all too well – the man was a master manipulator, using his size and presence to intimidate those smaller than himself.

"I think you'll find that this is not your typical tavern," Thorbjorn said, his eyes glinting with amusement. "We don't cater to collectors of debts here."

Gorath's face darkened, but he bit back a snarl. He knew better than to mess with Salemi. Instead, he ordered another ale and sat back, watching the patrons with an unblinking gaze.

As the night wore on, Thorbjorn kept a close eye on Gorath, ever vigilant for any signs of trouble. But the giant seemed content to simply sit and observe, his presence a gentle hum in the background of the tavern's evening bustle.

Finally, as the clock struck midnight, Gorath rose from his stool and strode out into the night, leaving Thorbjorn to breathe a quiet sigh of relief. Another night, another challenge averted. And as he watched the giant disappear into the shadows, Salemi couldn't help but smile – for in this city, it was always better to be safe than sorry.
