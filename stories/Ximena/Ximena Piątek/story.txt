Ximena Piątek stood at the edge of the bustling market, her eyes scanning the vibrant stalls with an air of quiet intensity. A young woman with unruly black hair and piercing green eyes, she had a reputation for being one of the most skilled smugglers in all of New Haven.

As she navigated through the crowds, Ximena's trained ears picked up whispers of potential clients seeking her unique services. She listened carefully, weighing the risks and rewards of each offer before making her decision.

Suddenly, a voice called out to her from across the market. "Ximena Piątek! I've got a job for you, one that requires your... particular set of skills." A figure emerged from the shadows, their features obscured by a hood.

"Ah?" Ximena replied cautiously, hand resting on the dagger at her waist. "What's the offer?"

"I have a package to deliver," the stranger said, producing a small box from their cloak. "Contains something... valuable. I need it delivered to the city of Elsinore, without any trouble."

Ximena raised an eyebrow as she accepted the box. This was no ordinary package; the whispers she'd picked up hinted at a revolutionary new technology that could give one person immense power over another.

"I'll get it done," Ximena said firmly. "But I want a fair price for my services – and I won't do anything that gets me caught."

The stranger smiled, seeming to accept her terms without hesitation. As they parted ways, Ximena couldn't shake the feeling that this job was more complicated than she'd initially thought.

Over the next few weeks, Ximena found herself growing increasingly uneasy about the package's contents and its intended recipient. Whispers began to circulate about a mysterious organization seeking to exploit Elsinore's fragile peace for their own gain.

Finally, with her suspicions confirmed, Ximena made a decision: she would not complete the job. Instead, she would set the package on fire, preventing it from falling into the wrong hands. This would be a bold move, one that could get her caught or worse – but Ximena Piątek was never known for playing by the rules.

With a deep breath, she lit the fuse and watched as flames engulfed the box. The market faded into chaos around her, but Ximena just smiled to herself – knowing that some packages were better left undelivered.
