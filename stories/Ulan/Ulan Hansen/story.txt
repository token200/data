One night, Ulan Hansen received an offer he couldn't refuse. A wealthy collector, known only as "The Patron," approached him with a proposal. The Patron wanted Ulan Hansen to steal a priceless artifact from a highly secure museum, and in return, he would be rewarded with a fortune beyond his wildest dreams.

Ulan Hansen accepted the challenge without hesitation. He spent weeks casing the museum, studying its security systems and waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Finally, the night arrived, and Ulan Hansen set out to claim the artifact.

The Patron's reward was delivered, along with a small note from Ulan Hansen himself, thanking him for the opportunity to demonstrate his skills. But as for Ulan Hansen's true identity? Only he knew, and he took great care to keep it that way. For in a world of shadows and secrets, Ulan Hansen remained an enigma, forever shrouded in mystery.
