Ulan Rasmussen, a former Danish Special Forces operative turned mercenary, stood atop a dusty hill overlooking the vast expanse of the Mongolian steppes. His piercing blue eyes scanned the horizon, searching for any signs of danger. As a member of the elite 3rd Battalion of the Royal Danish Army's Jæger Corps, Ulan had been trained to operate in some of the harshest environments on earth.

After leaving the military, Ulan had taken his skills to the private sector, working as a freelance security consultant for wealthy clients. His reputation as a skilled and fearless operative had earned him a lucrative business, taking on high-risk missions around the world.

As he stood watch, Ulan's mind wandered back to his childhood in Copenhagen. Growing up, he had always been drawn to the stories of his grandfather, a Danish Army veteran who had fought in World War II. Ulan's own military service had been marked by distinction, earning him numerous awards and commendations for bravery.

But it was the memories of his time in Afghanistan that still lingered in his mind. The sounds of gunfire, the smell of smoke and dust, the feeling of being constantly on edge – it had all taken its toll on Ulan. He had eventually left the military, seeking a new path that would allow him to use his skills for good.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the steppes, Ulan spotted a figure approaching in the distance. He instinctively reached for his rifle, his hand closing around the familiar weight of the barrel. The stranger drew closer, a young woman with a look of determination etched on her face.

Ulan's eyes narrowed as he took in her appearance. She looked like she meant business. "Who are you?" he asked gruffly, his voice carrying across the wind. The woman hesitated for a moment before responding, "I'm here to hire your services, Ulan Rasmussen. I have a job that requires...your particular set of skills."
