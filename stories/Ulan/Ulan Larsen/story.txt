Ulan Larsen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of life. As she made her way through the crowds, a sense of restlessness settled over her like a shroud. She had been on the run for weeks, ever since the fateful night that saw her parents' farm burned to ashes.

Ulan Larsen's thoughts drifted back to those flames, which seemed to flicker with a malevolent intensity in her mind's eye. It was no coincidence that she had been forced to flee, and now she found herself in this forsaken place, surrounded by strangers who might as well have been her enemies.

A low murmur of conversation drew her attention, and Ulan Larsen spotted a figure watching her from across the station. His features were chiseled, with piercing blue eyes that seemed to bore into her very soul. For an instant, she felt like he saw right through to the core of her, where her deepest fears lay.

The stranger vanished as quickly as he appeared, leaving Ulan Larsen wondering if she had imagined the whole encounter. But the sense of unease lingered, and she found herself glancing nervously over her shoulder as if expecting him to reappear at any moment.

She pushed on, navigating the station's maze-like corridors until she finally stumbled upon a small caf√© that seemed deserted enough. Ulan Larsen ordered a hot drink and slumped into a chair by the window, letting the warm sunlight wash over her.

As she sipped her coffee, she noticed a piece of paper tucked into the seat next to her. It was a note, written in hasty scrawl: "Meet me outside. Come alone." Ulan Larsen's heart quickened as she read the words, a spark of hope flickering within her. Could this be an opportunity to finally lay low and start anew? Or was it just another trap waiting to spring shut around her?

Ulan Larsen took a deep breath, weighing her options. For now, she would have to take a chance on this stranger, and see where the road led. She folded up the note and tucked it into her pocket, steeling herself for what lay ahead.
