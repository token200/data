In the scorching desert landscape of ancient Mesopotamia, a young scribe named Ulan Lācis toiled away in the shade of a crumbling temple. His full name, Ulan Lācis, was etched on a clay tablet as he painstakingly copied the epic of Gilgamesh for the ruling king.

As the sun beat down relentlessly, Ulan Lācis' thoughts wandered to his humble beginnings as a street urchin in the bustling city of Ur. He had always been drawn to the world of writing and storytelling, often listening intently to the traveling bards who passed through town.

Despite his love for words, Ulan Lācis was an outcast among his own people. His dark skin and unusual features set him apart from the rest, earning him the nickname "the stranger" among the locals. But Ulan Lācis refused to be defined by his appearance, channelling his insecurities into his work.

As he laboured over his clay tablet, a group of soldiers arrived at the temple, seeking shelter from the blistering sun. Among them was a young warrior named Kael, whose piercing blue eyes seemed to see right through Ulan Lācis' façade. For a moment, their gazes locked, and the scribe felt a jolt of electricity run through his veins.

Kael, sensing Ulan Lācis' discomfort, offered him a gentle smile before departing with his comrades. As they vanished into the desert haze, Ulan Lācis returned to his writing, his hand moving with renewed purpose. He poured all his emotions onto the clay tablet, crafting verses that spoke of longing and belonging.

In those moments, as the words flowed from his quill like lifeblood, Ulan Lācis felt most alive. His full name, written on a single line, now seemed like a benediction: "Ulan Lācis, keeper of tales and teller of truths." With every stroke, he whispered secrets to himself, claiming his place in the world – no matter how small or insignificant it may seem.

As night began to fall, casting an ethereal glow over the temple, Ulan Lācis stepped back from his work, exhausted yet exhilarated. He knew that his stories would be the only things left behind when he was gone, a testament to the life of Ulan Lācis – scribe, storyteller, and seeker of connection in a vast and unforgiving world.
