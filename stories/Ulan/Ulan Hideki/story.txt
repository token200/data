Ulan Hideki was a young and ambitious detective who had made a name for himself in the small town of Akakawa. With his keen mind and sharp instincts, he had solved some of the most baffling cases that had stumped the local authorities.

One day, a wealthy businessman approached Ulan Hideki with a mysterious request. The man's daughter, Emiko, had gone missing, and he suspected foul play. Ulan Hideki was intrigued by the case and agreed to take it on.

As he began to investigate, Ulan Hideki discovered that Emiko had been acting strangely in the days leading up to her disappearance. She had received several threatening messages and had become increasingly reclusive. Ulan Hideki's gut told him that something was off, but he needed proof to back it up.

He spent hours poring over security footage, interviewing witnesses, and following leads. It wasn't until he stumbled upon a cryptic message scrawled on the wall of Emiko's bedroom that the pieces began to fall into place. The message read: "You'll never find me."

Ulan Hideki was convinced that Emiko had been taken by someone close to her family, but he couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more to the story than met the eye. He decided to pay a visit to Emiko's closest friends and acquaintances, hoping to gather more information.

It wasn't until he spoke with Emiko's roommate, Yui, that the truth began to unravel. Yui revealed that she had been receiving strange messages from an unknown number, urging her to keep quiet about Emiko's disappearance. Ulan Hideki realized that Yui must have been in on it all along.

With this new information, Ulan Hideki was able to piece together the events leading up to Emiko's disappearance. He discovered that Yui had been involved in a deep-seated grudge against the Hideki family, and her actions had ultimately led to Emiko's vanishing act.

In the end, Ulan Hideki was able to reunite Emiko with her overjoyed family, solving the case and restoring peace to their lives. As for Yui, she faced justice for her role in the disappearance. Ulan Hideki's reputation as a brilliant detective had been solidified, and he continued to watch over the town of Akakawa, ever vigilant and always ready to take on the next challenge that came his way.
