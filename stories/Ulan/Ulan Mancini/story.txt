As Ulan delved deeper into the story, she received a cryptic message from an anonymous source claiming to have information about her article.

At midnight, Ulan made her way to the abandoned warehouse, her heart pounding in anticipation. As she approached the entrance, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was an elderly woman with piercing green eyes, who introduced herself as Rachel.
