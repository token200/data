It was said that Ulan's maps were not just mere documents, but gateways to hidden worlds. Those who possessed them were believed to hold the keys to unimaginable power and knowledge. Many had attempted to decipher the cryptic symbols etched onto his pages, but none had ever cracked the code.

One day, a young apprentice named Lila stumbled upon an ancient tome belonging to Ulan Nachtnebel. As she delved into its yellowed pages, she discovered that it was a map unlike any other – a map of the shadows themselves.

Intrigued, Lila set out on a perilous journey to find the cartographer who had created this enigmatic work. Her search led her to a small, secluded village where Ulan Nachtnebel resided in solitude. The old man was rumored to live in a labyrinthine network of tunnels and caverns beneath his home.

Lila finally found Ulan Nachtnebel hunched over a lantern, pouring over a fresh batch of maps.
