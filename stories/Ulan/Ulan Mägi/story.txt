In the rolling hills of Estonia, there lived a young shepherd named Ulan MÃ¤gi. He was known throughout the countryside for his uncanny ability to communicate with animals. The cattle he tended would gather 'round him at dawn and dusk, eager to hear the day's plans and gossip from their trusted leader.

One fateful evening, as Ulan sat by the fire, lost in thought, a faint rustling echoed outside his hut. He rose, wrapped his cloak around his shoulders, and stepped out into the darkness. That was when he saw her - a majestic wolf with piercing yellow eyes.

Ulan felt an odd sense of familiarity with the beast, as if they had shared a moment or two before. Without hesitation, he extended a calloused hand toward her, and to everyone's surprise, she nuzzled it gently. From that night on, the wolf, whom Ulan named Alev, became his loyal companion.

As word spread about their extraordinary bond, people from neighboring villages began to seek Ulan's counsel. Ailing livestock would receive mysterious visits from Alev, who seemed to possess a deep understanding of the natural world. Crops began to flourish, and the once-barren soil flourished with renewed vitality.

News of the miraculous shepherd spread far and wide, reaching the ears of Estonia's King and Queen. The monarchs requested Ulan's presence at their court, where they hoped he could use his unique gift to heal a dying forest on the outskirts of their kingdom.

Ulan accepted the challenge, Alev by his side. With her guidance, the wolf led him to the ailing trees, pointing out ancient wisdom that only she knew. Together, Ulan and Alev performed an ancient ritual passed down through generations of Estonian shamans.

As they finished the ceremony, a gentle rain swept over the forest, reviving the parched earth beneath. New shoots burst forth from the ground, and greenery reclaimed its dominance. The king and queen were overjoyed by this miraculous turn of events and granted Ulan a lifetime supply of livestock care and protection in exchange for his continued guidance.

Ulan returned to his rural home, but now with an even greater understanding of his role as a guardian of the land and its creatures. And Alev remained his loyal companion, watching over him with an unwavering devotion that mirrored their deep bond.
