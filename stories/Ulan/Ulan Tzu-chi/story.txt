In the misty mountains of ancient Tibet, there lived a wise and powerful monk named Ulan Tzu-chi. He was renowned for his extraordinary abilities to heal the sick and bring peace to troubled minds. People from all over the region would travel to the remote monastery where Ulan resided, hoping to catch a glimpse of his compassionate nature.

One day, a young girl named Lhamo wandered into the monastery, her eyes filled with tears and her heart heavy with sorrow. Her mother had passed away just the previous night, leaving her alone and adrift in a world that seemed cruel and unforgiving. Ulan Tzu-chi welcomed Lhamo with open arms, sensing the deep pain within her.

Without hesitation, he led Lhamo to his chambers, where a small altar sat before a serene Buddha statue. He instructed her to place a few drops of turmeric-infused oil on her mother's favorite prayer beads, which lay nearby. As she did so, Ulan began to chant ancient Tibetan prayers, his voice soothing and reassuring.

Lhamo felt an unexpected sense of calm wash over her as she watched the oil seem to seep into the beads, imbuing them with a gentle glow. The air around her began to thicken with the scent of incense, and she felt the weight of her grief slowly lifting.

Over the next few weeks, Lhamo returned to the monastery whenever she could, seeking Ulan's guidance and solace. He taught her various breathing techniques and meditation methods, helping her to find inner peace amidst her sorrow. As she practiced these new skills, Lhamo began to realize that death was not an end, but rather a transition into another stage of existence.

Under Ulan Tzu-chi's watchful eye, Lhamo blossomed into a confident young woman, her heart no longer shrouded in darkness. She returned home with a newfound appreciation for life and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all living beings. And though she never forgot her mother, she learned to cherish the memories they had shared and the lessons Ulan Tzu-chi had imparted.

Years later, as Lhamo grew old herself, she would tell stories of Ulan Tzu-chi's kindness and wisdom, inspiring generations to come. And when the time came for her own passing, it was said that a gentle mist descended upon her, carrying with it the essence of the prayers Ulan had taught her so many years ago. In this way, Lhamo's spirit merged with that of her mother, their bond remaining strong as ever.
