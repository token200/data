One stormy night, Ulan Wright received a call from an unknown number, asking him to meet at the old warehouse on the outskirts of town. The voice on the other end was distorted, but the urgency was unmistakable. Ulan Wright's instincts told him that this could be his next big case, and he quickly arrived at the warehouse.

As he stepped inside, the rain poured down outside, casting a gloomy atmosphere over the entire scene. Ulan Wright looked around, taking in every detail of the dimly lit room. He spotted a figure in the corner, shrouded in shadows.

"Who are you?" Ulan Wright demanded, his voice firm but controlled.

The figure slowly emerged from the darkness, revealing a young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She introduced herself as Sarah Lee, a former witness to a high-profile murder case that had been unsolved for years.
