Ulan Hughes, a former Special Forces operative turned private investigator, sat at his desk sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee. His eyes scanned the latest file in front of him, a cryptic message from an unknown source claiming to have information about his estranged sister's disappearance.

It had been five years since Ulan last saw Emily, his younger sister who had vanished during a mission with her elite squad while on deployment overseas. The government and his own agency had initially brushed off the incident as a routine operation gone wrong, but Ulan knew the truth - Emily was taken by someone or something more sinister.

As he poured over the file, Ulan's mind wandered back to that fateful day when he received the news of her disappearance. He had always been driven by guilt and a need for justice, and now this new lead felt like his only hope to uncover what really happened to Emily.

Ulan's phone rang, breaking him out of his thoughts. "Ulan Hughes," he answered in a gruff tone.

"Mr. Hughes, it's Samantha, an old friend from the agency," her voice said, laced with caution.

"What can I do for you, Samantha?" Ulan asked, already knowing that this was more than just a friendly call.

"I have some information about your sister's disappearance," she replied hesitantly. "But we need to meet in person. Can you come to the usual safehouse at midnight?"

Ulan nodded even though she couldn't see him. He knew the drill - Samantha had only agreed to share her intel because it was a personal matter, one that went beyond government clearance.

As he hung up the phone, Ulan felt a glimmer of hope rekindling within him. Maybe this time, he would finally get the answers he sought. At midnight, he arrived at the designated location, his eyes scanning the dimly lit alley for any signs of surveillance.

A figure emerged from the shadows - Samantha. She handed him a small USB drive containing the evidence she had gathered over the years. "This is all I have," she said before turning to leave.

Ulan watched her go, then plugged in the drive and began scrolling through its contents. What he found next would change everything.
