Ulan Olsson stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his boots scuffling against the rusty metal. He had been traveling for days, ever since he'd received that cryptic letter from an old friend in town. The message had read simply: "Meet me at the old windmill on the outskirts of town at midnight. Come alone."

Ulan's gut told him it was trouble, but something about the invitation had piqued his interest. He'd always been a bit of a loner, content to spend hours exploring the forests and fields around his home in rural Sweden.

As he made his way through the quiet streets, Ulan couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. The wind rustled through the trees, casting long shadows across the ground. He quickened his pace, his hand resting on the wooden grip of his pocket knife.

The old windmill loomed ahead, its sails creaking in the breeze like skeletal fingers. Ulan approached cautiously, scanning the rooftops for any sign of movement. The door creaked as he pushed it open, and a figure stepped out into the moonlight.

"Ulan," the figure said, without turning. "I see you came."

It was his friend, Marcus, the one who'd written the letter. But there was something different about him now – a hint of weariness in his eyes, a weight that hung like a cloud over his shoulders.

"What's going on?" Ulan asked, his voice low and cautious.

Marcus turned to face him, a slow smile spreading across his face. "I've been working on a project," he said, his words spilling out in a rush. "A way to harness the energy of the wind. And I need someone with your... particular skills."

Ulan raised an eyebrow. What did Marcus mean? He was a simple farmer, not some sort of scientist or inventor.

But as Marcus began to explain, Ulan found himself drawn in. The project was ambitious – a machine that could harness the power of the wind to generate electricity for the entire region. It was like nothing he'd ever heard of before.

For the first time in years, Ulan felt a spark of excitement ignite within him. Maybe this was just what he needed – a chance to leave his old life behind and try something new.
