Ulan Schulz stepped into the dimly lit pub, the familiar smell of ale and smoke wafting through the air. As a skilled thief, she had visited this particular watering hole countless times, always keeping an eye out for potential marks or new information to aid in her next heist.

Behind the bar stood Gorin, a gruff but affable bartender who knew Ulan's drink of choice - a shot of his finest whiskey on the rocks. "Ulan Schulz," he said with a nod as she took a seat at the end of the bar. "The usual?"

As Gorin poured her shot, Ulan surveyed the crowd, her eyes scanning for any sign of trouble or potential scores. The patrons were a mixed bunch - traveling merchants, shady characters, and the occasional lost soul looking to make a fresh start.

Just then, a hooded figure slid onto the stool beside her, their gaze locked on hers with an unnerving intensity. Ulan's instincts kicked in; she knew that look all too well. "What do you want, friend?" she asked warily, reaching for her shot glass.

The stranger pushed back its hood, revealing a striking young woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. "I've heard stories about your... particular set of skills, Ulan Schulz," the woman said, her voice husky and confident. "I'm looking for someone who can help me acquire a rare artifact."

Ulan raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite herself. The artifact in question was rumored to be hidden deep within the heavily guarded castle of the powerful Lord Harrowgate, making it one of the most formidable heists of all time.

As they spoke, Gorin listened with growing interest, his eyes lighting up behind the bar as if sensing a potentially lucrative opportunity. Ulan turned back to her new acquaintance, her mind racing with possibilities. "What's in it for me?" she asked bluntly, knowing that she needed convincing to take on such a daunting challenge.

The mysterious woman smiled, a glint of mischief dancing in her eyes. "I'll pay you handsomely, Ulan Schulz - enough to secure your future and set you up for life." For the first time all night, Ulan's thoughts turned to more than just the next score; she considered the possibility that this might be an opportunity worth taking.
