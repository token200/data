Veronica Delacroix stepped out of the misty rain and into the dimly lit café, shaking the water from her long, dark coat. She had been walking for hours, lost in thought as she tried to make sense of the cryptic message that had brought her here tonight.

As she waited in line, Veronica's eyes scanned the room, taking in the eclectic mix of patrons. There was a young couple giggling over a plate of steaming croissants, an elderly man hunched over his laptop, and a group of boisterous artists laughing and arguing over their latest canvas.

When it was finally her turn to order, Veronica smiled sweetly at the barista and requested a black coffee. "Make it a double shot," she added, as if that would somehow clarify the path ahead.

As she waited for her drink, Veronica's gaze drifted back to the message scrawled on the napkin in her hand: "Meet me at midnight. Come alone." She had been receiving these mysterious invitations for weeks now, each one leading her further down a rabbit hole of intrigue and danger.

Veronica took a sip of her coffee, feeling the caffeine coursing through her veins like adrenaline. She knew she couldn't trust anyone, not even herself. But something about this message drew her in, like a moth to flame.

Just then, a figure slipped onto the stool beside her, their eyes locking onto hers with an unnerving intensity. "Veronica Delacroix," they whispered, their voice low and husky. "I've been waiting for you."

For a moment, Veronica felt like she was drowning in those piercing green eyes. She knew then that this meeting would be different from the others – one way or another, her life was about to change forever.

With a quiet calmness that belied her racing heart, Veronica nodded and stood up, her coffee forgotten on the counter. "Let's get started," she said, as if they were old friends sharing a secret. The game was on, and Veronica Delacroix was ready to play.
