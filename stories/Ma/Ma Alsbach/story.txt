Ma Alsbach stood tall, her piercing green eyes scanning the crowded market square. As a renowned healer and midwife in the small village of Ashwood, she was respected by all for her wisdom and skill. Her full name, Ma Alsbach Elwes, was whispered in awe by the villagers, who would often seek her counsel on matters of health and wellness.

As she navigated the bustling stalls, Ma Alsbach's keen senses picked up on the subtlest changes in the air. She could smell the sweetness of freshly baked bread wafting from the nearby bakery, and the acrid tang of smoke from the blacksmith's forge. Her ears tuned into the hum of conversation, allowing her to pick out snippets of gossip and news.

Today was a busy day for Ma Alsbach, as she was expected to attend to several births in the coming weeks. She had already spent hours preparing her potions and remedies, carefully selecting herbs from her garden to aid in the delivery process. Her full name, Ma Alsbach Elwes, echoed through the market square once more, this time as a gentle voice called out to her from across the way.

Ma Alsbach smiled warmly at the young woman, who approached her with a look of concern etched on her face. "Ailment or injury, child?" Ma Alsbach asked, her eyes sparkling with kindness. The young woman explained that she had been experiencing persistent cramps and fatigue, to which Ma Alsbach listened attentively, nodding along as she made notes on a small pad of paper.

With a gentle touch, Ma Alsbach took the woman's hand, guiding it towards a small vial of fragrant oil. "Drink this, child," she instructed, her voice soothing and reassuring. As the young woman sipped the potion, Ma Alsbach watched with satisfaction, knowing that she had already helped to ease some of the woman's suffering. And as the day wore on, Ma Alsbach continued to work her magic, using her gifts to comfort and heal those in need.
