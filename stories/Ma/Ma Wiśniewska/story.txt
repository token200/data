Ma Wiśniewska was known for her striking appearance and fiery personality. A Polish journalist, she had made a name for herself in Warsaw's vibrant literary scene by writing scathing reviews of lesser-known writers that left readers both impressed and intimidated.

Her latest article had been published just the day before, and the buzz around town was palpable. The piece had lambasted a young poet named Janek, accusing him of copying the styles of his predecessors without putting in the effort to create something truly original. Many were divided on the matter – some praised Wiśniewska's candor, while others felt she had crossed a line by besmirching another writer's reputation.

As she sat at her desk, sipping coffee and staring out the window, Ma Wiśniewska couldn't help but feel a twinge of satisfaction. She loved nothing more than to stir up debate and shake people out of their complacency. It was what made her writing so compelling – and so dangerous.

Her phone rang, shrill in the silence. "Ma Wiśniewska," she answered, expecting it to be a colleague or acquaintance asking for an interview or advice.

But instead, it was Janek himself on the other end of the line. His voice was laced with anger and hurt, but also something else – a glimmer of curiosity. "Why?" he asked, his words dripping with venom. "Why would you do that to me?"

Wiśniewska took a deep breath before responding. She leaned forward in her chair, her eyes locking onto some invisible point beyond Janek's image on the phone screen. "Because I care about art," she said finally. "I want writers to push themselves, to take risks and explore new territories. If you're not doing that, then what are you doing?"

There was a pause, followed by a soft sigh. "You have no idea who I am or what I'm capable of."

Wiśniewska raised an eyebrow. She had written about Janek before – but only in the context of his mediocre poetry. Could it be true that this young man had more hidden talents than she had given him credit for? The thought sparked a shiver down her spine.

"I'd like to read your work again," she said, a challenge implicit in her voice.

For a moment, there was silence on the other end of the line before Janek spoke up once more. "I'll send you some new poems," he said finally. "See if they're worthy of your attention."

As Wiśniewska hung up the phone, she couldn't help but feel a spark of excitement. It seemed that her latest article had done more than just provoke debate – it had planted a seed of curiosity in someone she never would have guessed.
