Ma Morgan was known for her sharp tongue and quick wit. A small-time hustler in New Orleans' French Quarter, she made a living off her cunning and charm. Her reputation preceded her, with whispers of her exploits spread like wildfire through the streets.

One night, as Ma Morgan strolled down Bourbon Street, she spotted a young woman, trembling with fear. The girl's eyes darted nervously towards the back alleyways, where shady characters lurked in every corner. Ma Morgan recognized the look – it was the same one she used to wear herself when she was a scared little thing.

Without hesitation, Ma Morgan approached the young woman and introduced herself. "What's your story, sugar?" she asked, her voice low and soothing. The girl hesitated before pouring out her tale of woe: a broken relationship, a lost job, and a dwindling bank account.

Ma Morgan listened intently, nodding her head as the girl spoke. When she finished, the old woman fixed the young one with a piercing gaze. "I know a thing or two about bein' down on your luck," Ma Morgan said with a wry smile. "But I'll let you in on a little secret: sometimes, it's the darkest corners that lead to the most beautiful sunrises."

Ma Morgan took the girl under her wing, introducing her to some of the Quarter's unsavory characters and teaching her how to talk her way out of trouble. Over the next few weeks, the young woman transformed before Ma Morgan's eyes – her confidence grew, her smile brightened, and she began to see the world in a new light.

One night, as they danced through the streets, arms around each other's waists, Ma Morgan turned to the young woman with a knowing glint in her eye. "You're ready for your own shine, sugar," she said, her voice dripping with pride. The girl beamed, and Ma Morgan knew that she had passed on some of her own hard-won wisdom.

Ma Morgan's reputation as a guardian angel continued to spread throughout the Quarter. People whispered that she possessed an otherworldly power – the ability to see the beauty in broken things and transform them into something new. Though the truth was far more complicated, Ma Morgan knew that it didn't matter. What mattered was that she had found a way to make a difference in this crazy, wonderful city, one fragile soul at a time.
