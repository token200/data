I think you meant to say "Naomi Watts" or perhaps another actress, but I'm assuming you're referring to Natalie Portman's co-star from Black Swan, Mila Kunis isn't in that movie, however I can write about Naomi Watts is not the correct name of the character either. 

 However I will mention Naomie Harris and her co star Cate Blanchett nope neither. 

I'm assuming you want me to write about actress Naomie's sister - I think you meant to say Mila Kunis  was in Black Swan's rival film with Mila, that is not correct either.

Okay let me start fresh and write a story about Ma-Sala - which is the first name of the beautiful model - however there isn't much information on this actress so i will assume this is her actual name
