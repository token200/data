Ma Roberts was a fixture on the Mississippi Delta blues scene in the 1920s and 30s. Born Maude Elizabeth Roberts in the small town of Clarksdale, she grew up surrounded by the rich musical heritage of the region. Her father, a sharecropper, taught her how to play the guitar and sing from a young age.

As she grew older, Ma Roberts began performing at local gatherings and talent shows, quickly gaining attention for her raw, emotive voice and deft guitar work. She was known for her soulful rendition of classic blues songs like "Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground" and "Down by the Riverside."

Despite facing many challenges as a woman in a male-dominated industry, Ma Roberts persevered, drawing inspiration from the likes of Bessie Smith and Ethel Waters. Her own music reflected her experiences growing up poor and marginalized, with songs that spoke to the struggles of rural life.

One fateful night at the Clarksdale juke joint, Ma Roberts caught the attention of a young blues enthusiast named Robert Johnson. He was captivated by her talent and, soon after, offered her a recording contract. Over several nights in December 1936, Ma Roberts laid down tracks that would become some of the most iconic blues recordings of all time.

Under Johnson's guidance, Ma Roberts' music took on a new level of depth and complexity. Her songs captured the essence of rural life, love, loss, and hard-won survival. "Hard Times" and "Can't You Hear My Soul Crying" remain among her most celebrated performances.

Ma Roberts went on to have a storied career, touring with notable blues acts like Son House and Charlie Patton. Her legacy as one of the greatest blues singers of all time has endured for generations, earning recognition from institutions like the Library of Congress. Ma Elizabeth Roberts' humble beginnings had given way to international acclaim, cementing her place in music history alongside the likes of Robert Johnson himself.
