I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named "Ma Krūmiņš". However, I can create a story for you.

In the bustling streets of Riga, Latvia, there lived a charming and eccentric artist named Ma Krūmiņš. His full name was Kristaps Ma Krūmiņš, but everyone in town knew him simply as Ma, due to his quirky habit of signing his artwork with just his first letter.

Ma's passion for art was unmatched, and he spent most of his days lost in the streets of Old Town, sketching the architecture and people that surrounded him. His unique style blended traditional Latvian motifs with modern twists, making him a local sensation among the Riga art scene.

One sunny afternoon, as Ma was sipping coffee at a sidewalk café, he spotted a beautiful young woman named Līva sitting alone on a bench. She had piercing green eyes and raven-black hair that cascaded down her back like a waterfall. Ma was immediately smitten and spent the next few days sketching her profile in his notebook.

As fate would have it, Līva happened to be an art student at the local university, studying under none other than Ma's former mentor, Professor Urtāne. When she stumbled upon one of Ma's sketches on her campus bulletin board, she recognized the style and knew exactly who had created it – Kristaps Ma Krūmiņš.

Līva approached Ma with curiosity, and they struck up a conversation about art, life, and everything in between. As they talked, Ma realized that he had found not only a beautiful muse but also someone who shared his passion for creativity and self-expression.

From that day forward, Ma and Līva were inseparable, exploring the city's hidden corners and collaborating on various artistic projects. And although Ma continued to sign his artwork with just his first letter, Kristaps Ma Krūmiņš knew that he had found something truly special – a partner in art and in life.
