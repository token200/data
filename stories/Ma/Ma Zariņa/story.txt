I couldn't find any information on the character "Ma Zariņa." If you'd like, I can write a story featuring a fictional character with this name. Here is a 400-word story:

In the small town of Riga, Latvia, there lived a young woman named Ma Zariņa, or Maja to those who knew her best. She was known for her boundless energy and infectious smile, which could light up even the darkest of days.

Maja worked as a baker in a quaint patisserie on the outskirts of town, where she spent most of her days whipping up delicious pastries and bread. Her specialty was a traditional Latvian recipe for rye bread that had been passed down through generations of bakers in her family.

One day, while Maja was busy preparing for a large order of bread, a stranger arrived in Riga. He was a traveler from a far-off land, looking for a place to rest and refuel before continuing his journey. As he walked through the streets of Riga, he caught sight of Maja's patisserie and was drawn in by the enticing aroma of freshly baked goods.

Maja noticed the stranger lingering outside her shop and invited him in with a warm smile. She offered him a sample of her rye bread, which he devoured in seconds. The two struck up a conversation, and Maja learned that the stranger's name was Leo, and he was on a quest to find the perfect loaf of bread.

As they talked, Maja showed Leo around her bakery, introducing him to the various ingredients she used and sharing stories about her family's traditions. Leo was fascinated by Maja's passion for baking and the way it brought people together in the community.

Over the next few days, Leo returned to Maja's patisserie several times, each time learning more about her craft and the history behind her beloved rye bread recipe. As their friendship grew, so did the quality of the bread Maja baked. People from all over town came to taste her creations, and soon, her shop was filled with happy chatter and the sound of sizzling bread.

Leo eventually left Riga, but not before promising Maja that he would return one day to sample more of her delicious loaves. And so, their story became a legend in the town of Riga, a testament to the power of friendship and the magic of freshly baked bread.
