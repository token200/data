Ma Krumins was known throughout the land for her extraordinary abilities as a master baker and healer. Her full name, Ma Krumins Mavri, reflected her connection to the ancient traditions of her people, who revered the earth and its bounty.

She mixed together ingredients she had gathered from her own garden, adding a dash of magic to the dough.

As the bread baked in the oven, Ma Krumins prayed for the elder's recovery, infusing the bread with her love and intention. When the bread was done, she wrapped it in a cloth and took it to the village elder's bedside. The old man took one bite and closed his eyes, feeling the warmth of the bread spread through his body.

Slowly but surely, the elder began to recover, and soon the entire village was healed.
