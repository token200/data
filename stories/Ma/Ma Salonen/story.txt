After an electrifying set that left the crowd breathless, Ma took her final bow to thunderous applause. As she stepped off the stage, a beaming smile spread across her face – she was exactly where she was meant to be: on top of the world, sharing her music with the people she loved most.

Backstage, Ma's bandmates and crew members swarmed around her, congratulating her on an incredible performance. "You killed it out there, Salonen!" one of them exclaimed, pounding her on the back. Ma laughed, still grinning from ear to ear – she knew that tonight had been something special.
