Ma Gorski trudged through the dense forest, her worn boots making soft crunching sounds in the underbrush. Her eyes scanned the trees ahead, searching for any sign of movement or danger. As a skilled huntress and warrior of the Polish village of Lwów, Ma had faced countless challenges in the harsh Carpathian Mountains.

Born as Maria Gryzewska, but known to her people as Ma Gorski - which meant "Little Bear" in the ancient tongue - she had grown up learning the ways of survival from her wise and aged mentor, Paweł. Her mother had taught her how to weave a shelter out of twigs and leaves, while her father had shown her how to track and hunt small game.

As the snow began to fall, Ma quickened her pace, her breath misting in the chill air. She had received a warning from the village elder that a rival clan was encroaching on their lands, threatening to disrupt the delicate balance of power in the region.

Suddenly, a branch snapped beneath her foot, and Ma froze, her senses heightened. A figure emerged from the trees - a young woman, dressed in furs and carrying a bow. Ma relaxed, recognizing the emblem of the rival clan etched on her cloak. The girl approached cautiously, eyeing Ma's hand on the hilt of her sword.

Ma Gorski - Little Bear - did not flinch, but instead nodded respectfully at the girl. "You are not from our village," she said, in a low voice. "What brings you to Lwów?"

The girl hesitated before answering, and Ma sensed a tale of desperation and betrayal hidden beneath her words. As they spoke, the snow grew heavier, shrouding the forest in white silence.

Ma Gorski listened attentively, weighing her options carefully. In this fragile world of shifting allegiances, one misstep could lead to disaster. She nodded finally, sealing their unlikely truce with a firm handshake. "Come," she said, leading the girl back towards the village. "There is much work to be done."
