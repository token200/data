Ma Saldaña was known as the Heart of the East, a title bestowed upon her by the people of San Cristóbal, the small coastal town where she lived and worked. She was a healer, a midwife, and a wise woman, respected for her deep understanding of the natural world and its secrets.

Every day, Ma Saldaña would wake before dawn to tend to her garden, carefully nurturing the plants and herbs that grew there. Her hands were stained with soil and her eyes sparkled with knowledge as she coaxed new life from the earth. She made potions from the leaves and bark of trees, and salves from the sap of the mango trees.

The villagers would often seek her out when they fell ill or needed advice on matters of love and childbirth. Ma Saldaña listened carefully to their concerns, her eyes locked onto theirs as she took in every detail. She would nod thoughtfully, her hands clasped together, as she conjured up remedies from the very air around them.

One day, a young woman named Ana came to Ma Saldaña's hut, her belly swollen with child and her spirit torn apart by worry and fear. Ma Saldaña welcomed Ana with open arms, offering her a warm cup of tea made from the leaves of the sacred cedar tree. As they sipped their tea together, Ma Saldaña listened intently to Ana's words, her hands stroking her chin as she pondered.

"Ma Saldaña, what can I do?" Ana asked, tears streaming down her face.

Ma Saldaña smiled gently. "You will give birth, child. Your body is strong and capable. But first, you must listen to your own heart and trust in the wisdom of the universe."

Ana looked at Ma Saldaña skeptically, but something about the older woman's words resonated deep within her. She nodded, a small smile on her lips, and took another sip of tea.

From that day forward, Ana carried herself with newfound confidence, knowing that Ma Saldaña had given her the tools to navigate life's trials. And when she finally gave birth to her child, it was with ease and joy, thanks to the guidance of the wise Ma Saldaña.

Years went by, and Ana returned to visit Ma Saldaña often, bringing her own children to be healed by the old woman's skilled hands. As they grew older, they would sit at Ma Saldaña's feet, listening in awe as she shared tales of ancient rituals and sacred plants.
