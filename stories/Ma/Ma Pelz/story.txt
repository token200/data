Ma Pelz was known for her uncanny ability to sniff out trouble. As a former detective in the city's underbelly, she had seen it all - from high-stakes heists to illicit deal-making. But none of those experiences prepared her for the day she received a cryptic message from an old flame.

The note arrived at Ma Pelz's rundown office, tucked away in a seedy part of town. It was simple: "Meet me at the clock tower at midnight. Come alone." There was no signature, no indication who might have sent it or what they wanted. All Ma Pelz knew was that she had to go.

As she made her way through the dark streets, the flickering streetlights casting long shadows behind her, Ma Pelz felt a familiar sense of unease. This wasn't like her - she was used to being in control, not following orders from someone else. But something about this message resonated with her. Maybe it was the reminder that there were still mysteries out there for her to solve.

At midnight, Ma Pelz arrived at the clock tower, a crumbling monolith that loomed over the city like a specter. She scanned the area, her eyes adjusting to the darkness as she searched for any sign of movement. And then, just as she was starting to get restless, she saw him - her old flame, Leon.

Leon had been a fellow detective, but their relationship had ended in a messy breakup when he left the force without explanation. Ma Pelz had never forgiven him, but she couldn't deny that there was still something between them. As she watched from across the street, Leon emerged from the shadows, his eyes locked on hers.

"What do you want?" Ma Pelz asked gruffly, trying to keep her emotions in check.

"I need your help," Leon replied, his voice low and urgent. "I've stumbled upon a case that goes all the way to the top. And I think it's connected to your past."

Ma Pelz raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite herself. She had always prided herself on being able to handle anything life threw at her - but there was something about Leon's words that made her feel like she was in over her head.

"Tell me more," she said finally, a spark of curiosity igniting within her.
