Maude "Ma" Hebert was known for her sharp tongue and quick wit, but few people knew about the soft spot she had for stray animals. Growing up in rural Louisiana, Ma Hebert learned early on to rely on herself and the creatures that shared her land.

As a young girl, Ma Hebert would spend hours exploring the bayous and swamps surrounding her family's farm. She'd catch frogs and snakes, but also take in orphaned rabbits and birds, nursing them back to health until they were ready to be released into the wild again.

Years passed, and Ma Hebert became a respected trapper and hunter, not only providing for herself and her family but also sharing her bounty with those in need. Her reputation as a fierce protector of the local wildlife spread far and wide.

One day, while out collecting firewood, Ma Hebert came across a small, mewling kitten trapped in a hollow log. She carefully coaxed it out and took it back to her cabin, where she nursed it back to health with milk from her cow and warm blankets made by her own hands.

As the days passed, the kitten grew strong enough to venture outside under Ma Hebert's watchful eye. It would follow her wherever she went, chasing after frogs and snakes alongside her like a tiny, furry shadow. Ma Hebert laughed at its antics and named it Jacques in honor of her late husband, who had passed away many years ago.

Years later, when people asked about Ma Hebert, they wouldn't just think of the gruff, no-nonsense hunter but also of the kind-hearted woman with a soft spot for stray animals. And whenever anyone mentioned Jacques, the little cat that had captured her heart, Ma Hebert's eyes would sparkle with warmth and fondness, revealing a deeper side to this rugged, Cajun matriarch.
