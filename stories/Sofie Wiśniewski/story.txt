Sofie Wiśniewski stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the dimly lit station. The chill of autumn air nipped at her nose as she breathed in deeply, taking in the familiar scent of damp earth and wood smoke. It was a smell that brought back memories of her childhood summers spent playing in the woods near her family's small cottage on the outskirts of Kraków.

As she made her way through the quiet station, Sofie's thoughts were interrupted by the clanging of metal on stone. She smiled to herself, recognizing the familiar sound of Piotr's rusty bicycle, abandoned outside the train car. It was a ritual he'd adopted after losing his own bike in a game of chance with some local boys.

Sofie's stomach growled as she quickened her pace towards the exit. Her mother would have dinner waiting – probably something simple but nourishing, like pierogi or bigos. The Wiśniewski family had always valued simplicity and self-sufficiency, living off their small plot of land and relying on each other for company.

She passed through the creaky station gates and onto the narrow cobblestone streets, weaving past a few locals gathered in clusters, speaking in hushed tones. News traveled quickly in this close-knit community, but Sofie had little interest in gossip. She was hungry, and her mother's cooking was calling.

As she approached their small cottage, the warm glow of candlelight spilled onto the porch steps. The scent of roasting vegetables wafted out into the evening air, and Sofie's stomach growled louder in anticipation. Inside, she found her family huddled around the dinner table – Piotr's eyes were closed in a fervent prayer, while her mother smiled softly at her.

The evening was filled with laughter and easy conversation as they shared stories of their day. Sofie regaled them with tales of her time in Warsaw, where she'd spent several months working as an apprentice to a renowned photographer. Her mother listened with interest, asking questions about the city's vibrant art scene and the people Sofie had met along the way.

Piotr, on the other hand, was more focused on the food – his eyes lighting up at the sight of freshly baked rye bread and a generous helping of her mother's famous gołąbki. The two younger siblings, Jakub and Kasia, chattered excitedly about their own adventures in the nearby woods, chasing after rabbits and exploring hidden glades.

As they finished their meal and began clearing the table, Sofie noticed a stranger lingering near the edge of the property line. He stood tall and lanky, his eyes fixed intently on the old wooden barn in the distance. There was something about him that seemed out of place – perhaps it was the way he dressed, in worn jeans and a faded denim jacket, or the quiet intensity with which he regarded their land.

Sofie's curiosity piqued, she excused herself from the table and slipped outside to greet the stranger. "Cześć," she said softly, falling into step beside him as they walked towards the barn. He turned to her, his eyes flicking upwards in recognition of her name, but no smile.

"I'm looking for a place to stay," he explained, his voice low and even. "I saw your sign – I couldn't resist the chance to get away from the city." His gaze drifted back towards the barn, where a small hand-painted sign on the door read "Ostoja" in bold letters.

Sofie's eyes widened as she realized who he might be – rumors of a group called Ostoja had circulated among their community for months. They were a loose network of artists and activists, using art to raise awareness about social issues and create change. Her mother had been involved briefly before stepping back from public life.

As they stood there under the starlight, Sofie sensed that this stranger might be more than just another traveler – perhaps someone with a story to tell, and a purpose yet to unfold. And so, with a quiet sense of determination, she invited him to stay for the night, feeling a spark ignite within her as she welcomed Ostoja's mysterious representative into their fold.

As they walked back towards the cottage, Sofie couldn't help but wonder what secrets this stranger brought with him – and whether they might just change everything.
