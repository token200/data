"Tell me again, Mrs. Jenkins," Ozola said, his voice low and measured, "where were you on the night of your sister's disappearance?"

But it wasn't out of malice; rather, she had sought revenge against the family for their cruel treatment of her sister. Ozola listened attentively, his expression unyielding as he weighed the weight of justice.

In the end, Isidor Ozola emerged victorious once again, solving a case that would have stumped even the most skilled investigators.
