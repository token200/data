Isidor Sten stepped out of the rain-soaked streets and into the warm, golden glow of the tavern. He shook his head, sending droplets flying in all directions as he made his way to the bar. The patrons turned to look at him, a tall, brooding figure with piercing blue eyes and jet-black hair that fell across his forehead like a curtain.

The bartender, a gruff but kind-hearted man named Goran, looked up at Isidor with a mixture of curiosity and concern. "Another one, eh?" he asked, nodding towards the row of empty whiskey bottles behind the counter.

Isidor just snorted, taking a seat on one of the stools without bothering to sit down properly. He lit a cigarette, blowing out a stream of smoke as he ordered his usual: another shot of black vodka.

The locals avoided him, whispering among themselves about Isidor's troubled past and his uncanny ability to sniff out secrets in the city's underbelly. Some said he was a private investigator, using his skills to uncover corruption and deceit wherever he found it. Others claimed he was a madman, driven by some personal vendetta that fueled his constant searching.

Isidor just laughed at them all, knowing the truth behind each rumor and myth. He was no hero, but he wasn't exactly a villain either. He was a seeker of justice, willing to walk the fine line between right and wrong in order to get the job done.

As the night wore on and the tavern filled with laughter and music, Isidor's gaze wandered around the room, his eyes searching for something – or someone. And then, just as he was about to give up hope, he saw her: a striking young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair that cascaded down her back like a waterfall.

She smiled at him from across the room, and Isidor felt the world tilt on its axis. He got up, pushing his stool back, and made his way towards her, feeling the presence of the other patrons recede into the background. As he approached, she stood up too, and together they walked out into the rainy night, disappearing into the darkness like ghosts.

Isidor Sten didn't know where they were going or what lay ahead. All he knew was that this time, he had finally found someone who understood him – and was ready to join him on his journey down the rabbit hole of secrets and lies.
