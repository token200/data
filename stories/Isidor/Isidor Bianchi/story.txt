Isidor Bianchi was a man of mystery and intrigue. A retired diplomat, he had spent his life navigating the treacherous waters of international politics with ease and aplomb. His years of experience had given him a unique perspective on human nature, one that he wore like a mantle.

Isidor's past was marked by controversy and scandal. He had been embroiled in several high-profile feuds with foreign leaders, and his reputation for being ruthless in pursuit of his goals had earned him many enemies.
