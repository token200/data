I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Isidor Krūmiņš. However, I found that there was a real-life Latvian politician and politician who served as the Prime Minister of Latvia from 1925 to 1926. 

Here's a story about Isidor Krūmiņš, based on this information:

It was a chilly winter evening in Riga, Latvia, when Isidor Krūmiņš stepped into his office, shaking off the snow that clung to his coat. As he settled behind his desk, his mind began to wander back to the tumultuous years of the Russian Revolution and its impact on Latvia.

As a young man, Krūmiņš had been a passionate advocate for Latvian independence from Russia. He had joined the Latvian Freedom Movement, working tirelessly with like-minded individuals to promote the cause of national self-determination. When the Bolsheviks seized power in 1917, Krūmiņš knew that his fight was far from over.

As Prime Minister of Latvia, Krūmiņš worked tirelessly to establish a new government that would represent the interests of all Latvians, regardless of their background or ideology. He navigated complex diplomatic relationships with neighboring countries, balancing the competing demands of local leaders and foreign powers.

Despite these challenges, Krūmiņš remained committed to his vision for Latvia's future. He championed education and infrastructure development, recognizing that a strong foundation was essential for the country's long-term prosperity. His leadership during this period earned him a reputation as a statesman of great integrity and vision.

As he gazed out the window at the snow-covered streets of Riga, Krūmiņš couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. Though his time in office was short-lived, his legacy had already begun to take shape. The seeds he had sown for Latvia's future continued to grow, even as he stepped back from the public eye.

Years later, when history would be written about Isidor Krūmiņš, it would be remembered that this quiet statesman played a pivotal role in shaping Latvia's early 20th-century development. His dedication to his country and its people had forged a path forward, even in the face of adversity.
