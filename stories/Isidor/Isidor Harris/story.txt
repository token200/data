Isidor Harris, a man in his mid-forties with unkempt brown hair and a bushy beard, sat hunched over at his desk. The dim lighting from the streetlamp outside seemed to seep into the cramped office, casting eerie shadows on the walls. It was late, almost one o'clock in the morning, and Isidor was working late as usual.

As a private investigator, Isidor had seen it all - the cheating spouses, the blackmailers, and the missing persons cases. He didn't discriminate; his only requirement was that the job paid. And pay well.

Tonight's client, Mrs. Smith, was different from the others. Her voice had trembled over the phone, her words laced with desperation as she begged Isidor to find her daughter who had gone missing a week ago. The police seemed uninterested, and Mrs. Smith knew it. She needed someone with Isidor's particular set of skills.

Isidor sipped his lukewarm coffee, rubbing the weariness from his eyes. He'd spent countless hours on cases like this one before. Women always thought their daughters were better off without them, that they'd abandoned them for better lives elsewhere. But what if Mrs. Smith was right? What if her daughter really had vanished?

He pulled out a crumpled photograph of the missing girl from his pocket and studied it intently. The bright blue eyes, the messy brown hair, the small nose... She looked so ordinary, yet somehow captivating.

As he pored over the file, Isidor's mind wandered back to his own life. His wife had left him five years ago, citing his "selfish" ways as a private investigator. He'd tried everything to win her back - new job, new home, even taking up meditation (which he secretly hated). But nothing seemed to change.

He snapped out of the reverie as Isidor realized it was time to start looking for leads. He pulled open his desk drawer and found a small notebook filled with scribbled notes, scraps of information that never seemed to add up. Tonight might be different, though. Tonight he'd find something.

As the night wore on, Isidor's fingers flew across his computer keyboard, typing out search queries and digging through databases. The hours blurred together in a haze of coffee cups and screens. Finally, just before dawn, he got a hit - a suspicious text message sent from an unknown number that matched the time frame when the girl had gone missing.

Isidor's gut tightened as he opened up the message on his screen, his heart racing with possibilities. He'd found something, but what?
