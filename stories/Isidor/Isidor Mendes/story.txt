Isidor Mendes sat at his cluttered desk, surrounded by stacks of dusty tomes and scattered notes. As the chief archivist at the New Orleans Historical Society, he was responsible for uncovering and preserving the city's most forgotten secrets.

A bespectacled man in his late 50s with a wild shock of white hair, Isidor had spent years studying the mysterious history of NOLA. His latest obsession: the infamous vampire legend that had haunted the city since its founding. Many believed it to be nothing more than a tale told by drunken sailors and curious locals, but Isidor was convinced otherwise.

As he poured over an old manuscript, Isidor's eyes widened at the mention of a long-forgotten creature known only as "La Lune Blanche" – The White Moon. According to local lore, La Lune Blanche had been seen roaming the city's bayous and swamps in the late 18th century, preying on unwary travelers.

Isidor's mind was racing with theories and questions. Who was La Lune Blanche? What had driven her to roam the depths of the Louisiana wilderness? And what had become of her? Was she a myth, or did she truly exist?

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was his young assistant, Sophie. She handed him an old photograph, yellowed with age and worn from being stored away for decades.

"This was sent to me by a local collector," Sophie explained. "It's an original print from the late 1800s – I think it might be one of the few remaining images of La Lune Blanche."

Isidor took the photo and examined it closely. There, in the center of the image, stood a woman shrouded in mist and shadow. Her face was deathly pale, her eyes seemed to glow with an otherworldly light, and yet – there was something unmistakably human about her gaze.

For a moment, Isidor felt as though he had gazed into the very heart of La Lune Blanche herself. And then, just as suddenly, she vanished from sight, leaving behind only an eerie feeling that lingered long after the photograph's surface seemed solid once more.

Isidor knew then that his research was about to become a whole lot more complicated – and potentially deadly.
