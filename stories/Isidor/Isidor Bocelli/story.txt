I apologize, but I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Isidor Bocelli. However, I believe you may be thinking of Andrea Bocelli, an Italian operatic tenor.

Andrea Bocelli is widely regarded as one of the most famous opera singers of all time. Born on February 22, 1958, in Lucca, Italy, he lost his sight at the age of 12 due to surgery. Despite this, he went on to become a renowned singer, performing in concerts and operas around the world.

Isidor Bocelli's journey to fame began when he was discovered by a Swiss conductor, James Levine, while singing in an opera competition in Italy. This led to his signing with Decca Records and release of his debut album, "Adagio for Canons," which won the Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording.

Over the years, Isidor Bocelli has performed in many iconic operas, including La Bohème and Nessun Dorma. He is particularly known for his rendition of the latter song at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, where he sang it to a global audience of millions.

Isidor Bocelli's unique voice has taken him on many musical journeys around the world. From performing with the Berlin Philharmonic to singing at numerous charity events, he has remained dedicated to his craft and passionate about his music.

In 2007, Isidor Bocelli released a new album called "Pasión," which featured classical songs as well as pop and rock arrangements of popular Italian hits. The album was a commercial success and further cemented his status as one of the world's top tenors.
