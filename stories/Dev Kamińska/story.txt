Dev Kamińska stood on the edge of the rooftop, gazing out at the cityscape below. The wind whipped through her dark hair as she clutched the railing, feeling the familiar rush of exhilaration that came with standing at the edge of freedom.

As a former thief and con artist, Dev had always lived by one rule: never get caught. She'd spent years honing her skills, perfecting her disguises, and manipulating those around her to achieve her goals. But after a particularly close call, Dev had decided it was time for a change.

She'd turned herself in, using her talents for good instead of ill. Now, as a freelance investigator, Dev used her expertise to help people in need – all while keeping her own secrets hidden behind a mask of professionalism.

As she looked out at the city, Dev's thoughts turned to her latest client: a wealthy businessman with a reputation for being ruthless in business. He'd hired Dev to investigate some discrepancies in his company's books, and she had a feeling that there was more to it than met the eye.

Dev's phone buzzed in her pocket, breaking the silence. She pulled it out and answered, listening intently as her contact on the inside of the company provided her with information. Her eyes narrowed as she processed the intel – this wasn't going to be a simple case after all.

Without hesitation, Dev set off towards the office building, her mind racing with possibilities. As she stepped into the elevator, she couldn't help but think about the people involved in this scheme. Whose side was Dev on? And how far would she have to go to uncover the truth?

The doors opened on the 23rd floor, and Dev walked confidently towards her target's office. She slipped a small device onto her keycard reader, allowing her access without triggering any alarms. A few minutes later, she found herself standing in front of a secure safe, surrounded by stacks of files and documents.

With a satisfied smile, Dev began to work on the combination lock – one that required an exacting sequence of numbers and codes. Her fingers danced across the dial as she recited mental algorithms, working quickly but surely. As the seconds ticked by, the mechanism clicked open with a satisfying click.

Dev pulled out a stack of files, scanning them quickly for any signs of evidence. And then it hit her – the smallest discrepancy in the ledger, a single figure that had been hidden away in plain sight. Her eyes locked onto the number 7, written in hasty handwriting on one of the margins.

A thrill ran down Dev's spine as she realized she was closing in on something much bigger than she'd initially thought. And now, with this new information, Dev Kamińska was more determined than ever to uncover the truth and bring those responsible to justice – no matter what it took.
