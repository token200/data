Ayan Almod√≥var sat in her small, cluttered office, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and scattered papers. As the owner of the rare bookstore, 'Moonlit Pages', she spent most of her days immersed in the world of literature.

Her fingers danced across the keyboard as she typed out a review for an obscure novel she had recently discovered. Her love for words was only rivalled by her love for secrets. Ayan's past was shrouded in mystery, and those who knew her well kept it that way.

As the door creaked open, a chill ran down her spine. It was unlikely visitors like this one would show up at Moonlit Pages. The newcomer was a young woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair that cascaded down her back like a waterfall of night. She wore a simple yet elegant dress in shades of indigo and silver.

"Welcome to Moonlit Pages," Ayan said, forcing a smile onto her face. "Can I help you find something?"

The mysterious woman's gaze swept across the room before landing on Ayan herself. There was an unnerving intensity about the way she looked at her, as if she could see right through to the very heart of Ayan.

"I'm looking for something," the woman said finally, her voice barely above a whisper. "Something you possess."

Ayan's curiosity was piqued. She leaned forward in her chair, her eyes locked onto the stranger's. "What is it that you're looking for?" she asked, her tone cautious.

The woman hesitated before pulling out a small note from her pocket and unfolding it. The words 'The Lost Poem of Azara' were scribbled across its surface. Ayan's heart skipped a beat as she felt the weight of her possession settle onto her shoulders.

"Where did you get that?" she asked, trying to keep her voice steady.

The woman smiled faintly before replying, "I've been searching for it for years."

As the silence hung between them, Ayan made a decision. She reached into her desk drawer and pulled out the small leather book. The cover was worn and yellowed with age, but as she opened it, a single page fluttered to the floor.

"It's yours," she said finally, her voice barely above a whisper.

The stranger took the book from Ayan's hands, her fingers brushing against theirs in a fleeting touch. As they stood there, locked in each other's gaze, Ayan felt a shiver run down
