Ayan Alsbach stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of her meeting companion. As a freelance journalist, she had spent countless hours traveling to remote locations in search of stories, but this assignment felt different. Her contact, a source she had been working with for months, was finally willing to meet face-to-face.

As she made her way through the crowds, Ayan's thoughts turned to her latest investigation. She had been tracking a lead on a corrupt government official, and this meeting could be the break she needed to expose him. Her sources had told her that he would be in attendance at a high-stakes business conference in a small town several hours away.

Ayan spotted a figure waiting for her by the exit, dressed in a tailored suit and flashing a brief smile as she approached. "Ah, Ayan Alsbach," he said, his voice low and smooth. "It's good to finally meet you."

"Likewise," Ayan replied, extending a hand. Her contact shook it firmly, his grip surprisingly strong for someone so slender.

As they walked out of the station, Ayan couldn't help but notice that her contact seemed nervous. She had been prepared for this meeting, but there was something about him that made her want to keep a close eye on him.

"Let's get one thing straight," her contact said, glancing around the street before focusing intently on Ayan. "I know you're looking for information about corruption in our government. I can provide it to you, but it comes at a cost."

Ayan raised an eyebrow. She had been expecting this, of course. As a journalist, she was no stranger to difficult negotiations. But there was something about her contact that made her hesitate.

"Who are you working for?" Ayan asked bluntly, trying to keep her tone neutral.

Her contact smiled again, this time with a hint of warning in his eyes. "Let's just say I'm representing...a friend of yours."

Ayan's eyes narrowed. She knew that look all too well. It was the same one she had seen on her own face when she made difficult decisions as a journalist.

"Tell me more," Ayan said finally, her voice firm.

And with that, the meeting began in earnest.
