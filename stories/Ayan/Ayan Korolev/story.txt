Ayan Korolev stepped out of the Moscow Metro, his eyes scanning the crowded platform as he searched for the familiar figure. He spotted him, leaning against the railing near the exit, dressed in the same worn leather jacket and scuffed boots that had become his trademark.

As Ayan approached, the older man looked up, a hint of recognition flickering across his face. "Ah, korolev," he said, his voice low and gravelly. Ayan nodded, taking a seat beside him on the bench.

The younger Korolev pulled out a small notebook from his pocket and began to flip through its pages, muttering to himself about forgotten equations and theoretical physics problems. His older self watched him with a mixture of amusement and concern, wondering what new endeavors this incarnation of himself had taken up.

As they sat in silence, Ayan's thoughts wandered back to the events that had led him here. The accident, the experiment gone wrong – it was all still a blur. But one thing was certain: he'd been given another chance, and he wasn't going to waste it.

Korolev closed his eyes, feeling the fatigue of countless sleepless nights start to seep into his bones. He knew what lay ahead: the trials, the setbacks, the moments of unadulterated triumph. It was a path he'd walked before, but one that never truly got easier.

The older Korolev's gaze snapped open as Ayan scribbled furiously in his notebook. "What are you working on now?" he asked gruffly. The younger man looked up, a look of intense focus still etched on his face.

"I'm trying to crack the code," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "To create something entirely new – something that transcends the boundaries of physics and mathematics."

Korolev raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. He knew the dangers of playing with forces beyond human control, but he also knew Ayan's unwavering dedication to his work.

"You think you can do it?" he asked, a hint of skepticism creeping into his voice. The younger man smiled, a spark of determination igniting in his eyes.

"I won't stop until I do," he said, his conviction infectious. Korolev nodded, a small smile playing on his lips. He knew that look – it was the same one Ayan had worn when he'd set out to change the world all those years ago.

In that moment, the two Korolevs sat together in the midst of chaos, ready to face whatever lay ahead. They were bound by more than just bloodlines; they were united by a shared purpose – to push the boundaries of what was possible.
