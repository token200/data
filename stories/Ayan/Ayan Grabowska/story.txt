Ayan Grabowska stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the quaint town of Ravenswood. As she made her way through the quiet streets, the sound of leaves crunching beneath her feet was the only noise that broke the stillness. Ayan had always been drawn to places like this, where the past seemed to seep from every brick and stone.

Ayan Grabowska's thoughts were consumed by the mysterious letter she'd received a few days prior. It was an invitation to meet someone in Ravenswood, with no indication of who or why. The only clue was a small, intricately carved wooden box left on her doorstep. Curiosity had gotten the better of her, and she'd packed her bags and set off for this sleepy town.

As she walked, Ayan noticed the way the sunlight filtered through the trees, casting dappled shadows on the ground. It was moments like these that she felt most at peace. She'd grown up in a bustling city, surrounded by the constant din of traffic and construction. Ravenswood was a world away from that, a place where time seemed to stand still.

Ayan's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her footsteps on the path ahead. Before her, a small cottage came into view, smoke drifting lazily from its chimney. She felt a sense of trepidation as she approached the door, wondering who – or what – lay within.

Taking a deep breath, Ayan Grabowska pushed open the door and stepped inside. The air was thick with the scent of baking bread, and her stomach growled in response. As her eyes adjusted to the dim light, she saw a figure standing by the fire, watching her approach. For a moment, they simply regarded each other, before the figure spoke in a low, gravelly voice, "Welcome, Ayan Grabowska. I've been waiting for you."
