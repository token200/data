Ayan Isakova sat alone in her small, cluttered office, surrounded by stacks of dusty files and faded photographs. As one of the few remaining scientists who had worked on the top-secret Project Eternity, she had become increasingly withdrawn from the world.

It was 1958, and the Cold War was at its peak. Ayan's work on the project had focused on the development of a new, high-energy propulsion system capable of propelling a spacecraft to incredible speeds. The implications were staggering: with such technology, the United States could potentially outpace the Soviet Union in space exploration.

But as the project progressed, Ayan began to realize the true extent of what she and her colleagues had been working on. They weren't just building a faster spaceship – they were creating a time machine.

The weight of that realization crushed her. Ayan knew that if the project succeeded, it would not only give the United States an unparalleled advantage in space exploration but also pose catastrophic risks to the timeline itself. She was torn between her duty as a scientist and her conscience as a human being.

As she delved deeper into the files, Ayan stumbled upon an entry that made her blood run cold: a letter from her own sister, who had died tragically young due to complications from a failed experiment on Project Eternity. The message was clear – Ayan's actions could have prevented her sister's death.

Ayan felt like she was drowning in guilt and despair. She knew she couldn't bring herself to continue working on the project. With a heavy heart, she sealed the files and locked the door to her office, vowing never to speak of the project again.

But as she turned to leave, Ayan noticed something peculiar – a small note hidden between the pages of her sister's letter. It read: "I'm still with you, sis." Ayan's eyes welled up with tears as she realized that perhaps her sister had been trying to tell her something all along – that there was more to time travel than just science and technology.

Ayan left the office, but this time, it wasn't the weight of responsibility that drove her – it was a sense of hope. She knew that she still had a role to play in unraveling the mysteries of Project Eternity, and that maybe, just maybe, her sister's spirit was guiding her towards redemption.
