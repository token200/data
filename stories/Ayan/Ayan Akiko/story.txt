Ayan Akiko stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of her friend. She spotted him huddled in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee, and made her way over to join him.

"Hey, Aki," she said, dropping into the seat across from him. "What brings you here tonight?"

Akiko shook his head, taking a sip of his own drink. "Just trying to clear my head, I guess. We've got a big meeting tomorrow and I'm not sure if I'm ready."

Ayan nodded sympathetically. She knew how it felt to be on edge before a major presentation. As a rising star in the marketing department, Akiko was always under pressure to deliver.

"So, what's the plan for tomorrow?" Ayan asked, leaning back in her chair.

Akiko hesitated, collecting her thoughts. "Well, I've been working on a new campaign and I think it's going to be a game-changer. But at the same time, I'm not sure if it's too ambitious. What do you think?"

Ayan listened attentively as Akiko outlined her ideas. She could see the wheels turning in his head, weighing the pros and cons of each strategy.

When Akiko finished speaking, Ayan leaned forward, a look of excitement on her face. "I think it's genius, Akiko! You've got this."

Akiko smiled, feeling a surge of confidence wash over her. With Ayan by her side, she knew she could tackle anything that came her way.

As they chatted and laughed together, the tension in Akiko's shoulders began to dissipate. She realized that sometimes, all it took was a friendly ear and a supportive friend to help clear your head.

Thanks to Ayan, Akiko felt ready to take on the world – or at least, the meeting tomorrow. With renewed confidence and a spring in her step, she stood up to leave, thanking Ayan for the pep talk. As they parted ways, Ayan smiled, knowing that her friend was going to knock it out of the park.
