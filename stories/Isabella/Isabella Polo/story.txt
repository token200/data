Isabella Elena Polo was no ordinary woman. As a renowned archaeologist and adventurer, she had spent her fair share of time exploring the world's most ancient ruins and uncovering its deepest secrets. Her latest expedition had taken her to the heart of Egypt, where she was determined to crack the code of the long-lost city of Zerzura.

Isabella Elena Polo had always been fascinated by the stories of Zerzura, a fabled oasis that was said to hold the key to unlocking the mysteries of the ancient world.
