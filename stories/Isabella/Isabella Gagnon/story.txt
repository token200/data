Isabella Gagnon walked into the small caf√©, scanning the room for a familiar face. It was a typical Wednesday afternoon, and she had hoped to run into some old friends or acquaintances. Instead, she spotted her coworker, Alex, sitting by the window, typing away on his laptop.

As Isabella approached, Alex looked up and smiled. "Hey, Ibby! What brings you here?" he asked, using the nickname only a few people were allowed to use.

Isabella sat down across from him and took a sip of her coffee. "Just needed a break," she said, eyeing his laptop. "I'm stuck on this project and need some fresh air."

Alex nodded sympathetically. "Tough luck. I've been having the same problem all morning." He paused, studying Isabella's face. "So, what's new with you? Any exciting plans or just trying to make it through the week?"

Isabella hesitated for a moment before launching into an enthusiastic tale of her latest art project. She had been working on it for weeks, and was determined to get it finished by the end of the month.

As they chatted, Isabella's phone buzzed with a text from her best friend, Sophia. "Hey girl! What's up? We should grab dinner tonight," Sophia wrote.

Isabella grinned at Alex, who raised an eyebrow. "I think I'll join you guys for dinner sometime this week," he said. "But don't expect me to be too chatty."

Isabella chuckled and put her phone away. She loved spending time with both Alex and Sophia - they were like two sides of the same coin. While Alex was quiet and introspective, Sophia was outgoing and vibrant.

As they finished their coffee, Isabella realized she had been so caught up in conversation that she had forgotten all about her project. Maybe this afternoon would be exactly what she needed: a chance to clear her head and come back to her work with fresh eyes.

Alex noticed the change in her expression and nodded knowingly. "Take care of yourself, Ibby," he said, as Isabella gathered her things to leave.
