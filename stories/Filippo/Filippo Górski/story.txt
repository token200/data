One day, while performing in a small town in Umbria, Filippo caught the attention of a young girl named Sophia. She was enchanted by his storytelling and begged him to tell her more.

And so, the enigmatic performer continued on his journey, leaving behind a trail of captivated audiences and curious hearts. For Filippo Górski, there was no greater joy than sharing his stories and connecting with those who listened.
