Jannis Kask was a man on the run. A former Special Forces operative, he had turned rogue after being betrayed by his own government. Now, he navigated the dark alleys and cramped taverns of Eastern Europe, always looking over his shoulder.

It wasn't the first time Jannis had been forced to rely on his wits and stealth to survive. He'd spent years honing his skills in the military, earning a reputation as one of the best operatives in the business. But when he discovered that his own government was using him for their own nefarious purposes, he knew he had to get out.

The problem was, Jannis couldn't just leave it all behind. He still owed people money - to gunslingers, mercenaries, and other shady characters who wouldn't take kindly to being stiffed. And then there was the matter of his ex-wife, Sophia, who had been torn from him by the government's agents.

As he walked through the crowded market square, Jannis spotted a familiar face - an old friend from his days in the Special Forces. Viktor was a grizzled veteran with a scar above his left eyebrow and a penchant for heavy drinking. They exchanged nods of acknowledgement, but Jannis knew that Viktor wouldn't be able to keep up this charade forever.

Jannis spotted Sophia across the square, her dark hair pulled back into a tight bun as she haggled over the price of vegetables with a stout old man. Her eyes met his, and for a moment, they just stared at each other. It was like no time had passed at all.

The old man handed Sophia a bunch of wilted lettuce and she accepted it graciously, her eyes never leaving Jannis'. He turned to Viktor, who shook his head in warning. "You're not going to leave me hanging, old friend," he said quietly.

Jannis nodded, then made his move. He strode across the square, Sophia falling into step beside him as they disappeared into the crowded streets. It was a fragile peace - one that could be shattered at any moment by the government's agents or other adversaries. But for now, Jannis and Sophia were on the run together.

As they walked, Jannis couldn't help but feel a spark of hope ignite within him. Maybe, just maybe, he'd finally found a way to take down his enemies and start fresh. The future was uncertain, but one thing was clear: Jannis Kask would never be caught again.

For now, though, that meant being on the move. They navigated through back alleys and deserted streets, their footsteps quiet as they disappeared into the night. Jannis glanced over at Sophia, who smiled faintly in his direction.

They might not have much - just a battered backpack full of gear and a few scraps of information - but for now, that was enough.
