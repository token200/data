Michel Schäfer stepped into the dimly lit jazz club, his eyes scanning the room for the familiar face of his friend and fellow musician, Lena. The smooth sounds of the saxophone wafted through the air, transporting Michel to a different era. He spotted Lena sipping on a whiskey at the bar and made his way towards her.

As he approached, Lena looked up and smiled, "Hey, Schäfer! What brings you here tonight?" Michel took a seat beside her and signaled the bartender for a drink. "Just needed some music therapy," he replied, his voice low and smooth.

Lena nodded understandingly, having known Michel's affinity for jazz since they were both teenagers at school. The two had formed an impromptu band during their teenage years, with Lena on vocals and Michel on guitar. Though they never made it big, they continued to play together whenever they could, sharing the passion of music.

As the night wore on, Michel took the stage, drawing in the small crowd with his soulful rendition of a Billie Holiday classic. The notes flowed effortlessly from his fingers, transporting the audience to the 1940s. Backstage, Lena watched proudly as her friend let loose, his eyes closed in ecstasy.

After the set, the two friends reunited at the bar, swapping stories and laughter over whiskey-fueled conversation. "You know, Schäfer," Lena said with a mischievous grin, "your fingers are just as nimble on that guitar of yours as they were when we first started playing together." Michel chuckled, his eyes twinkling in amusement.

The night wore on, the music and laughter mingling with the smoke-filled air. It was clear to everyone present that Michel Schäfer still had a spark of that teenage fire within him – a flame that only jazz could ignite. As the evening drew to a close, Michel bid farewell to Lena and stepped back into the cool night air, his guitar slung over his shoulder once more, ready for whatever musical adventures came next.
