Michel Kadyrova stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the crowded station. She had been traveling for hours, and the long journey from Moscow was finally coming to an end. As she made her way through the throng of people, her gaze settled on a small café tucked away in a corner of the station.

Michel pushed open the door and stepped inside, the warm scent of freshly brewed coffee enveloping her. She took a seat at the bar and ordered a cup of black coffee, her eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. The café was a favorite haunt of hers, a place where she could escape the prying eyes of her acquaintances and simply be herself.

As she sipped her coffee, Michel's thoughts turned to the reason she had come to this small town in the north. Her family had received news that her great-aunt, a distant cousin she had never met, was ill. Michel's mother had always spoken fondly of this woman, who had raised Michel when she was just a child.

Michel finished her coffee and made her way outside, where a taxi waited to take her to the hospital. The drive through the countryside passed in a blur as Michel gazed out at the rolling hills and forests, her mind preoccupied with thoughts of her great-aunt's condition.

As they approached the hospital, Michel felt a sense of trepidation wash over her. She had never been one for hospitals or medical procedures, but she knew she had to be here for her family. The taxi dropped her off at the entrance, where she was greeted by the sound of beeping machines and murmured conversations.

Michel took a deep breath and made her way through the corridors, searching for the room where her great-aunt lay. She found it on the third floor, where she was met with a sight that filled her heart with worry. Her great-aunt, a frail woman in her eighties, lay in bed, hooked up to several machines and surrounded by medical equipment.

Michel rushed to her side, taking her hand in hers as she gazed at her aunt's pale face. "I'm here," she whispered, trying to offer what little comfort she could. Her great-aunt looked up at her, a faint smile on her lips.
