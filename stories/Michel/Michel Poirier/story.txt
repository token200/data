Michel Poirier trudged through the wet streets, his eyes scanning the pavement for any sign of life. As a private investigator, he had grown accustomed to working alone, but tonight felt different. The rain seemed to seep into his bones, and the city's usual rhythms felt muffled.

As he turned a corner, a flicker of light caught his attention. He followed it to a small café, where a figure sat hunched over a cup of coffee. Michel Poirier pushed open the door and stepped inside, his eyes adjusting to the warm glow.

The figure looked up, startled. It was a young woman, her face pale with worry. "Can I help you?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

"I'm Michel Poirier," he replied, flashing a badge. "I've been hired by your mother to look into some... irregularities."

The woman's eyes widened, and she nodded hesitantly. "My name is Sophie, and my mother is... well, she's not doing well."

Michel Poirier pulled out a chair and sat down beside her. "Tell me what's going on," he said, his voice softening.

Sophie took a deep breath and began to recount the events that had led her here. Her mother, Colette, had been receiving strange phone calls in the middle of the night. At first, she had dismissed it as telemarketers or wrong numbers, but recently, the caller's words had grown more menacing.

As Sophie spoke, Michel Poirier's mind began to piece together the fragments of evidence. He knew Colette was a respected businesswoman, and if someone was threatening her, it would be no trivial matter.

He thanked Sophie for her trust and promised to do everything in his power to help. As he left the café, the rain seemed to have lifted, replaced by a sense of purpose. Michel Poirier vowed to uncover the truth behind Colette's mysterious phone calls, no matter what lay ahead.

The city's streets were dark and unforgiving, but with this new lead, Michel Poirier felt a spark of hope. He lit a cigarette and began his search for answers, determined to protect Colette Poirier from whatever forces sought to harm her. The rain might be relentless, but he was ready to face it head-on.
