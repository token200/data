Michel Esposito stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, his eyes scanning the crowded streets of Little Italy for any sign of trouble. As the owner of Esposito's Deli, he knew every face and every story that passed through those narrow passageways.

A small-time enforcer for the local mafia families, Michel had a reputation for being able to get anything done with a simple smile and a well-placed phone call. But tonight was different. Tonight, he was on a mission to retrieve a package that had been stolen from one of his suppliers.

As he navigated the alleys, Michel's earpiece crackled to life, picking up the voice of his partner, Joey. "Esposito, I've got eyes on the package," Joey said, his voice low and steady. "It's with a guy named Vinnie 'The Bull' LaRosa."

Michel nodded to himself as he turned onto Mulberry Street. He knew that LaRosa was trouble – a hot-headed young thug with a talent for causing more problems than he solved.

As he approached the warehouse, Michel could see Vinnie's goons patrolling the perimeter. He pulled out his phone and dialed a number, waiting for the sound of gravel crunching beneath the tires.

The next thing Michel knew, a sleek black sedan had pulled up beside him, and the door swung open to reveal none other than Tony 'The Trenchcoat' Tamborelli – an old friend and occasional ally in times of need. Together, they slipped into the warehouse and made their way past the goons, dodging punches and fists as they went.

Finally, Michel spotted the package in a corner of the warehouse, wrapped in brown paper and twine. He pulled it out and handed it to Tony, who expertly palmed it before zipping up his trenchcoat once more.

The getaway car had arrived by the time they emerged from the warehouse, speeding away into the night as the goons began to take questions from LaRosa's entourage. Michel watched them disappear into the distance, a satisfied smirk spreading across his face.

For a small-time enforcer like himself, it was nights like these that reminded him why he was worth a million bucks – and what made Esposito's Deli the best spot for breakfast in town.
