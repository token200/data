Michel Petrov was a man with a mysterious past. He had always been a bit of an enigma to those who knew him, and he preferred it that way. A former spy for the Soviet Union, Michel had spent years gathering intelligence and carrying out covert operations in the West.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Michel found himself without a purpose or a country to call his own. He wandered the world, taking on various identities and working as a freelance journalist or consultant. But no matter where he went or what he did, Michel couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.

One day, while working in Budapest, Hungary, Michel received a cryptic message from an old colleague. The message read: "Meet me at the Széchenyi Thermal Bath at midnight. Come alone." Intrigued, Michel decided to investigate further.

At midnight, Michel made his way to the thermal bath, his eyes scanning the crowded room for any sign of trouble. As he approached the designated meeting spot, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was an old acquaintance from Moscow, someone who had worked closely with Michel during his Soviet days.

"Michel Petrov," the man said, his voice low and gravelly. "I've been looking for you. There's something I need to tell you. Something that could put your life in danger."

Michel's instincts told him to be cautious, but he also knew that he couldn't ignore the message. He followed the old acquaintance through the winding streets of Budapest, finally ending up at a small café on the outskirts of town.

"What is it?" Michel asked, his eyes narrowing as he waited for the man to speak.

"It's about your past," the man replied, his voice barely above a whisper. "There are people who still know what you did during the war. People who will stop at nothing to see you brought down."

Michel's eyes widened as the full weight of the message hit him. He knew that he had left something behind in Moscow, and now it was coming back to haunt him. As he stood up to leave, Michel Petrov felt a sense of unease wash over him. He knew that his life would never be the same again.
