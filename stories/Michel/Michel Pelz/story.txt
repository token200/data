Michel Pelz was a French photographer known for his striking portraits and candid snapshots of everyday life. Born in the late 19th century, Michel grew up in the city of Lyon, surrounded by the rich history and culture that would later influence his work.

As a young man, Michel began his career as an apprentice to a local printing shop owner. However, it wasn't long before he discovered his true passion - photography. He spent countless hours experimenting with different techniques and equipment, eventually earning himself a spot in a prestigious Parisian studio.

Michel's big break came when he was commissioned to photograph the French aristocracy for a prominent magazine. His unique approach to portraiture, which emphasized capturing the subtleties of human emotion, quickly gained him widespread recognition.

Despite his success, Michel remained humble and committed to his craft. He continued to travel extensively, seeking out new subjects and experiences that would inspire his work. His travels took him from the bustling streets of Tokyo to the sun-drenched hills of Tuscany, always on the lookout for the next great shot.

One of Michel's most famous photographs, "The Waiter," captures a poignant moment in time.
