I couldn't find any information on a person named Anton D'Annunzio. However, I believe you may be thinking of Gabriele D'Annunzio, an Italian poet and politician.

If that's the case, here's a 400-word story about him:

It was a sweltering summer evening in Salerno, Italy, 1914. Gabriele D'Annunzio, the renowned poet and statesman, sat at his desk, pouring over the latest issue of La Voce. He sipped on a glass of wine, lost in thought, as he contemplated the changing world around him.

As a member of Italy's Liberal Party, D'Annunzio had long been an advocate for Italian unity and independence from foreign powers. However, with the outbreak of World War I, his views were put to the test. He became increasingly disillusioned with the war effort, which he saw as futile and morally bankrupt.

As he read through the pages of La Voce, D'Annunzio's mind began to wander back to his beloved Albania, where he had spent several years in exile, inspiring the Albanian people with his passion for independence. He wondered what would happen if Italy were to support the Albanian cause, rather than merely using it as a bargaining chip to secure its own interests.

Suddenly, an idea struck him. Why not challenge the Italian government's stance on Albania? D'Annunzio felt a surge of determination and began scribbling notes furiously in his journal. He would rally support among like-minded intellectuals and politicians, and together, they could force a change in Italy's policy.

Over the next few weeks, D'Annunzio worked tirelessly to build momentum for his cause. He traveled throughout Italy, speaking with prominent figures and gathering support for his proposal. The more he spoke, the more convinced he became that he was onto something groundbreaking.

On January 23rd, 1915, Gabriele D'Annunzio led a group of sailors from his ship, the Legnano, in an armed uprising against the Italian government's decision to support the Allies over Albania. The move sparked outrage and chaos throughout Italy, but it also marked a turning point for D'Annunzio, who had found a new sense of purpose and conviction.

From that day on, Gabriele D'Annunzio became an unlikely champion of Albanian independence, defying the establishment and pushing forward with his vision of a free and united Albania.
