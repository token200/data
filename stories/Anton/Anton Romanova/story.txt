Anton Romanova stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. The once-thriving town had seen better days, but Anton wasn't here to sightsee. She was on a mission.

As she made her way through the empty streets, the flickering streetlights casting eerie shadows on the pavement, Anton couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. It was a sensation she'd grown accustomed to in recent years, ever since her mother's mysterious death had left behind more questions than answers.

Anton Romanova's thoughts drifted back to that fateful night when she was just a teenager. The police had ruled it a tragic accident, but Anton knew better. Her mother, a renowned scientist, had been working on something revolutionary – something that could change the course of human history.

With a deep breath, Anton pushed open the creaky door of her family's old mansion, now abandoned for years. The air inside was thick with dust and memories. She had returned to her hometown of Ravenswood in search of answers about her mother's research, hoping to uncover the truth behind her untimely demise.

As she wandered through the musty halls, Anton stumbled upon a hidden laboratory deep beneath the mansion. Candles flickered, casting an eerie glow over rows of dusty equipment and notes scribbled on yellowed papers. Her heart racing with excitement, Anton began to sift through the papers, searching for any mention of her mother's research.

Suddenly, she found it – a cryptic message scrawled on a single sheet of paper, referencing a project codenamed "Erebus." Anton Romanova felt a shiver run down her spine as she realized that this was just the beginning. She knew she had to dig deeper, no matter where the truth might lead. With a newfound determination, Anton set out to unravel the mysteries of her mother's research and uncover the secrets hidden within the crumbling walls of Ravenswood.
