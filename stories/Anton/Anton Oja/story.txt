Anton Oja stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station as if searching for something or someone. His dark hair was slicked back, revealing a sharp jawline and piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into those he met.

As a detective with the Helsinki Police Department, Anton had seen his fair share of darkness and despair, but there was something about this case that gnawed at him like a persistent hunger. He was tasked with investigating the mysterious disappearance of Elina Vähä-Salmi, a young waitress who had vanished without a trace three days prior.

Anton made his way through the crowded streets, nodding to acquaintances and exchanging pleasantries as he went about his business. His thoughts were elsewhere, consumed by the eerie feeling that he was missing something – a thread in the tapestry of evidence that could unravel the entire case.

He stopped at a small café, ordering a coffee as he pulled out his notebook and began to review the events leading up to Elina's disappearance. A chill ran down his spine as he read through the witness statements, each one painting a picture of a chaotic evening at the local nightclub.

Anton's eyes narrowed as he pieced together the fragments of information. He had a feeling that Elina was more than just another missing person – she was a key to unlocking a larger conspiracy that stretched far beyond this small town.

He sat back in his chair, sipping his coffee and letting his mind wander. Suddenly, the café door swung open, and a woman with piercing blue eyes and raven-black hair walked in, her gaze sweeping across the room until it landed on Anton.

For a moment, they locked eyes, and Anton felt a jolt of electricity run through his veins. He knew that look – that was Elina's signature gaze, one that could disarm even the most hardened suspect.

Anton Oja pushed back his chair, his heart racing with excitement as he followed Elina into the café, ready to face whatever lay ahead and unravel the tangled web of secrets that had led him to this moment.
