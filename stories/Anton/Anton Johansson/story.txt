Anton Johansson stepped out of the rain-soaked streets and into his small café, shaking the water from his coat. He had just closed up shop for the day, but he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It had been three days since the phone call, three days since his sister, Emma, had disappeared.

Anton's mind replayed the conversation like a broken record. "I'm sorry, Anton. I didn't mean to hurt anyone." The voice on the other end of the line had sounded so calm, so detached. He had tried to press for details, but she had just hung up.

As he began to clean up the café, Anton's thoughts turned to his sister. They had always been close, despite their differences. Emma was a free spirit, always chasing her dreams, while Anton had played it safe. But they had grown closer in recent years, bonding over their shared sense of restlessness.

Anton wiped down the counter, his eyes wandering to the photo on the wall. It was an old picture, taken on a family vacation when he and Emma were kids. She was beaming with joy, her blonde hair tied back in pigtails, while Anton looked like a miniature version of himself – serious and brooding.

As he finished cleaning up, Anton's phone buzzed on the counter. He picked it up, hoping for some news from the police or his sister's friends. But instead, there was only a text from an unknown number: "Meet me at the old warehouse at midnight. Come alone."

Anton's heart sank. Who could be behind this? Was it someone trying to help him find Emma, or was it just another game? He knew he had to be careful, but a part of him wanted to follow the lead.

As the night drew in, Anton stood outside the old warehouse, his hand on the door handle. The city was quiet, except for the sound of crickets and distant traffic. He took a deep breath and stepped inside, into the unknown.

The darkness swallowed him whole, but he pressed on, driven by a burning need to find his sister. Whatever lay ahead, Anton Johansson was ready to face it head-on.
