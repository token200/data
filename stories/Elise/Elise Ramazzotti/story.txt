Elise Francesca Ramazzotti was a free spirit, always chasing her dreams and never backing down from a challenge. Growing up in a small town in Italy, she had always felt stifled by the limitations of her surroundings.

Elise's name became synonymous with stunning visual storytelling, and her partnership with Luiz cemented their status as one of the most talented creative duos of our time.
