As the trial approached, Elise felt a sense of calm wash over her. She had done everything in her power to prepare, and now it was time to put her skills to the test. Her opponent would try to discredit her, but Elise was ready for them.

With Maria's husband on the stand, Elise delivered a powerful closing argument that left the jury in no doubt about his innocence. The verdict was a resounding "not guilty," and Maria burst into tears as Elise hugged her tightly. It was just another win for the brilliant and fearless Elise Laurent.
