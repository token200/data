Elina Mäkinen was a 25-year-old graphic designer with a passion for 80s pop culture. Her apartment was a shrine to neon lights and synthesizers, with posters of David Bowie and Prince plastered on every available wall. When she wasn't working at her design firm, Elina could be found DJing at local clubs or volunteering at the local LGBTQ+ community center.

One night, while spinning tracks at a trendy club in Helsinki, Elina met a fellow music enthusiast named Tommi. He was immediately drawn to her eclectic taste in music and infectious energy behind the decks. The two quickly hit it off, bonding over their shared love of synth-heavy electronica and vintage fashion.

As they danced the night away, Elina found herself opening up to Tommi about her dreams of starting a record label focused on showcasing emerging Finnish talent. Tommi was intrigued by her vision and offered to help her brainstorm ideas for the launch.

The following weeks were a whirlwind of activity as Elina and Tommi worked tirelessly to bring their project to life. They spent long hours scouring local music venues, networking with industry professionals, and refining their business plan. Elina's design firm even lent its expertise to create eye-catching branding materials for the label.

Finally, the day arrived when Elina Mäkinen's record label, "Neon Dreams," was ready to launch. With Tommi by her side, she took the stage at a packed concert hall in Helsinki to introduce the world to the label's inaugural release. The crowd erupted into cheers as Elina proudly held up a vinyl copy of their debut single, created with love and care using the very design skills she had honed at work.

As Neon Dreams' star continued to rise, Elina Mäkinen remained committed to her core values: creativity, inclusivity, and a healthy dose of 80s flair. With Tommi by her side, she knew that anything was possible – as long as the beat kept pumping and the synths kept shining bright.
