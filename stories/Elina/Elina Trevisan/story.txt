Elina Trevisan stepped onto the worn wooden floorboards, her eyes scanning the dimly lit room with a mix of nostalgia and unease. The old café was now abandoned, a relic of a bygone era, and Elina felt like she was stepping back into the past.

As she made her way to the counter, the scent of stale coffee and worn leather enveloped her, transporting her back to afternoons spent with friends, sipping on hot cups of joe and sharing secrets. The café had been a hub for creatives and outcasts, where Elina Trevisan had found solace in her art.

She slid onto a stool at the counter, running her fingers over the intricate carvings that adorned the wooden surface. A small photograph caught her eye – a group of friends, all smiling and laughing, their faces frozen in time. Elina's eyes lingered on her own image, a young woman with a mop of curly brown hair and a sketchbook clutched tightly in her hand.

As she gazed around the café, memories came flooding back – late-night conversations, impromptu performances, and moments of pure chaos that had defined Elina Trevisan's youth. The city outside seemed to be moving on without her, leaving behind only echoes of a life once lived.

The café door creaked open, admitting a faint sliver of light into the room. A young woman with a messy bob and a sketchbook of her own slipped onto the stool beside Elina. They exchanged a quiet smile, two strangers bound together by the memories that lingered in this abandoned space.

"Elina Trevisan?" the stranger asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Elina nodded, her eyes dropping to the photograph once more. "I think so."

As they sat there, surrounded by the dusty remnants of a forgotten era, Elina felt a sense of connection wash over her – a reminder that some memories, no matter how faded, could still be cherished and carried forward into the unknown.
