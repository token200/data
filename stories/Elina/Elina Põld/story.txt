Elina Põld was a young Estonian artist known for her vibrant street art in Tallinn's Old Town. With her bold brushstrokes and eclectic style, she brought color and vibrancy to the city's historic buildings.

As a child, Elina spent hours exploring the cobblestone streets with her grandmother, listening to tales of Estonia's rich history and folklore. It was there that she discovered her passion for art and storytelling. Her grandmother, a skilled weaver, taught Elina the intricacies of traditional Estonian patterns and textiles, which would later influence her urban art.

Elina's rise to fame began with her participation in local street art competitions, where she showcased her talents alongside other talented artists.

Passersby couldn't help but be captivated by Elina's talent and message – hope, resilience, and connection with nature.

As her reputation grew, so did Elina's activism. She began collaborating with local organizations to promote environmental awareness and support for marginalized communities. Her art became more than just a form of self-expression; it was a call to action.
