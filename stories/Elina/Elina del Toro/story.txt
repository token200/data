Elina del Toro stepped into the dimly lit tavern, the smell of ale and sweat wafting through the air. She had heard whispers of a local musician looking for someone to join their band, and she was determined to find him.

As she scanned the room, Elina's eyes locked onto a figure strumming a mournful tune on his lute. There was something about the way the music seemed to dance with the shadows that drew her in. She took a seat at the bar, ordering a mug of ale and striking up a conversation with the bartender.

He introduced himself as Gorm, and Elina learned that he knew nothing about the musician she had seen earlier. However, he mentioned hearing rumors of a singer named Elina del Toro, who was said to have a voice like honey and smoke.

Intrigued, Elina continued her search. She asked around town, but everyone seemed to be tight-lipped about the musician's identity. It wasn't until she stumbled upon an underground music venue that she finally found him – a young man with piercing green eyes and a wild shock of curly hair.

He introduced himself as Jax, and Elina was immediately drawn to his energy. They talked long into the night, discussing everything from music to politics to their shared love of mythology. As the hours passed, Elina felt an undeniable connection forming between them.

Jax invited her on stage, and Elina del Toro took a deep breath, letting her voice soar through the venue like a wild bird set free. The crowd erupted into applause as she finished her song, and Jax grinned at her with admiration.

As they left the stage together, Elina knew that she had found something special in this mysterious musician. She was ready to join him on his journey, both musically and otherwise. With Jax by her side, she felt invincible – like the wind itself, unstoppable and free.
