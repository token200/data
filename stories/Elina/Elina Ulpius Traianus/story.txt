In the bustling streets of ancient Rome, a young woman named Elina Ulpius Traianus was making a name for herself as a skilled artisan. Born to a family of modest means, Elina had always shown a natural talent for working with her hands, and she had honed her skills in the trade of metalwork.

As the daughter of a wealthy merchant, Elina's parents had encouraged her to pursue her passion for craftsmanship, and she had spent many hours honing her skills under the guidance of the finest craftsmen in Rome.
