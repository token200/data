Elina Viljanen stood in front of the old, worn-out piano, her fingers hovering over the keys as if hesitant to make contact. She had always loved music, but lately, it seemed like a distant memory, one that she couldn't quite grasp. As she looked around her cluttered apartment, memories flooded her mind - late-night jam sessions with friends, family gatherings where music was the soundtrack, and countless hours spent practicing in solitude.

Elina's mother, a violinist herself, had encouraged her to learn piano from a young age. Viljanen had taken to it like a fish to water, spending hours each day practicing scales and arpeggios until her fingers ached. But as she grew older, music became less of a priority. She got caught up in school, work, and the demands of adulthood.

As Elina's hand drifted over the keys once more, she felt an unfamiliar spark within her. It was as if her mother was guiding her back to that place where music had been a part of every breath she took. The notes seemed sharper now, richer, and with a newfound passion, Elina began to play.

Chords flowed like tears from her fingertips as she lost herself in the melody. Time dissolved, and all that remained was the sound, the feeling, and the memories it evoked. For a moment, she forgot about the stress of her job, the weight of her responsibilities, and the expectations of those around her.

Elina's music became an escape, a sanctuary from the chaos that often seemed to surround her. As the last notes faded away, she felt rejuvenated, revitalized. It was as if Elina Viljanen had finally come home to herself, to the thing that brought her so much joy and solace.

In that moment, music wasn't just something she played; it was who she was. And with that realization came a sense of peace, a feeling that everything would be alright. As Elina sat in silence, her fingers still on the keys, she smiled to herself, knowing that no matter what life threw her way, music would always be there to guide her back to herself.

With renewed determination, Elina rose from her seat and walked over to the bookshelf, pulling out a dusty old notebook. It was filled with sheet music and lyrics, scribbled notes, and lyrics that had been written over the years during late-night sessions of playing the piano. She took a deep breath, ran her fingers over the keys once again, and began to play on.
