Dace Errani was a name whispered among the seafaring folk of the small coastal town of Ravenshire. A skilled sailor and navigator, she had spent her entire life on the open water, charting courses through treacherous storms and hidden shoals.

Born Dace Elara Errani to a family of seasoned sailors, she had been taught the ways of the sea from a young age. Her father, Captain Errani, had been a respected figure in Ravenshire's maritime community, known for his cunning and bravery. As a child, Dace would sit at her father's feet, listening with wide eyes as he spun tales of adventure and danger on the high seas.

As she grew older, Dace proved herself to be just as skilled as her father, mastering the intricacies of navigation and seamanship. She set out on her own, taking on short trips and cargo hauls between Ravenshire and neighboring ports. Her reputation grew, and soon she was in demand for more complex voyages.

One fateful day, a wealthy merchant approached Dace with an offer: transport a valuable shipment of rare spices from the far-off island of Zanar to Ravenshire's bustling market.
