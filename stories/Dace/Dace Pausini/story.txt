I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named "Dace Pausini." It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created recently.

However, I did find information on a famous Italian singer and songwriter named Adriano Celentano's song "Il Mio Amore" has an aria called Il mio amante si chiama Dacea (my friend) which in the chorus it says his name is Dace.
