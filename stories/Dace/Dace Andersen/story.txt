Dace Andersen stared out at the stormy sea, her eyes squinting against the wind whipping through her hair. A Norwegian sailor and daughter of a legendary sea captain, she had spent her entire life on the water, learning the ways of the waves from her father.

As a young girl, Dace had listened with rapt attention as Captain Andersen regaled her with tales of adventure and bravery on the high seas. He had taught her how to tie knots, navigate by the stars, and handle even the most temperamental of boats. But it was more than just the practical skills that had drawn her to the sea - it was the sense of freedom and possibility that came with exploring the unknown.

Now, as she stood on the deck of her father's ship, the "Maelstrom", Dace felt a familiar thrill coursing through her veins. The storm raged around her, but she was at one with the elements, her senses heightened as she scanned the horizon for signs of danger.

The Maelstrom cut through the waves like a hot knife through butter, its hull bearing the scars of countless battles against the sea. Dace's father had always said that the greatest sailors were those who could read the signs - the wind, the currents, the moods of the waves themselves. And she knew that he was right.

As she navigated the treacherous waters, Dace felt a sense of connection to her father that went beyond mere family ties. She had inherited his sense of wonder, his love of adventure, and his unwavering determination. Together, they would face whatever the sea threw their way.

And then, without warning, the storm shifted. The winds died down, and an eerie calm fell over the waves. Dace peered out into the stillness, her eyes scanning for any sign of what was to come next. And that's when she saw it - a ghostly shape looming on the horizon, its sails billowing in the fading breeze.

"Father!" Dace cried, her voice carrying above the wind. "What is that?"

Captain Andersen grinned, his eyes twinkling with mischief. "Ah, lass," he said, his voice low and conspiratorial. "I think it's a ship from our own time...one that's been waiting for us all these years."
