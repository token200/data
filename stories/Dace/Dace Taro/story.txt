Dace Taro stepped out of the rain-soaked streets and into the dimly lit alleyway, his eyes scanning the rooftops for any sign of trouble. A former member of the notorious Tengu Clan, Dace had left the organization after a falling out with its ruthless leader, Ryujin.

As he made his way through the winding alleys, the sound of dripping water and distant laughter accompanied him. The neon lights of the city's underbelly cast an eerie glow on the wet pavement, like a siren's call to those who dared to tread this path.

Dace had been searching for weeks, following every lead, every hint that might bring him closer to Ryujin. But so far, he had hit a dead end at every turn. That was when he received the message - a simple text from an unknown number: "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone."

Dace's instincts screamed at him to ignore it, but something about the cryptic message drew him in like a moth to flame. He arrived at the clock tower just before midnight, his hand resting on the hilt of his katana.

A figure emerged from the shadows - a woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair, her face deathly pale beneath her skin. She introduced herself as Kaito, an old acquaintance from Dace's Tengu days.

"You're looking for Ryujin," she stated flatly, without preamble. "I might be able to help you."

Dace raised an eyebrow, wary of the trap that lay ahead. But something in Kaito's eyes told him this was different - that this could be his only chance at finally bringing down the Tengu Clan.

With a heavy heart and a sense of trepidation, Dace followed Kaito into the unknown, ready to face whatever dangers lay ahead in pursuit of justice.
