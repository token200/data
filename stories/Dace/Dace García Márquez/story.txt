I couldn't find any information on a person named Dace García Márquez. However, I can create a fictional story for you.

In the small town of San Juan, Colombia, a young boy named Dace García Márquez grew up with a passion for music and storytelling. He spent most of his days listening to the tales of his abuela, who regaled him with stories of their family's history and the struggles they faced during the difficult times in Colombia.

As he grew older, Dace's love for music only deepened, and he began to learn how to play the guitar and write his own songs. He would often perform for his friends and family, singing about the joys and sorrows of life in their small town.

Years went by, and Dace's talent didn't go unnoticed. He was discovered by a record label and soon found himself on tour, performing his music to sold-out crowds all over Latin America. His abuela, who had always been his biggest supporter, came along for the ride, beaming with pride as she watched her grandson shine on stage.

Dace García Márquez's rise to fame was swift and unexpected, but he never forgot where he came from. He continued to write songs that reflected his experiences growing up in Colombia, using his platform to speak out against social injustices and promote unity among his people.

As the years went by, Dace became a beloved figure in Latin American music, known for his powerful voice and poignant lyrics. And though he achieved great success, he never forgot the wise words of his abuela: "La música es el lenguaje del alma" - Music is the language of the soul.
