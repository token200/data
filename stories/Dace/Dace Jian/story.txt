Dace Jian was a man consumed by his work. As a brilliant forensic scientist, he spent countless hours poring over evidence, searching for the smallest detail that could crack a case wide open. His colleagues at the lab often joked that he had a sixth sense for finding what others missed.

But Dace's latest obsession was personal. His younger sister, Mei, had gone missing six months ago, and the police had been unable to find any leads. Determined to solve the mystery of her disappearance, Dace had taken it upon himself to review every shred of evidence collected during the initial investigation.

As he worked late into the night, his computer screen casting a pale glow over his cluttered office, Dace's mind was a jumble of theories and suspects. He had seen them all – from the reclusive millionaire who lived on the outskirts of town to the charismatic nightclub owner with a history of shady dealings.

But despite his best efforts, Dace couldn't shake the feeling that he was missing something. It was as if the pieces were just out of reach, tantalizingly close but impossible to grasp.

Just as he was about to call it a night, Dace's phone rang. It was an unknown number, and the voice on the other end was hesitant at first before speaking up. "I think I might have information about your sister," the voice said. "Meet me at the old warehouse on 5th and Main at midnight if you want to know more."

Dace's heart skipped a beat as he scribbled down the address in his notebook. This could be it – the break he had been waiting for all along. He spent the rest of the evening reviewing his notes, rehearsing what he would say and asking himself if he was making a mistake.

As midnight approached, Dace stood outside the abandoned warehouse, his heart pounding with anticipation. The door creaked open, revealing a figure shrouded in shadows. "Who are you?" Dace demanded, trying to keep his voice steady.

The figure stepped forward, revealing a young woman with piercing green eyes. "I'm someone who knows what happened to your sister," she said. And with that, Dace's world was turned upside down.
