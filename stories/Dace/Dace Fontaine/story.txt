Dace Fontaine stood at the edge of the rooftop, her eyes scanning the glittering city below. The wind whipped through her long, dark hair as she gazed out at the sea of lights that stretched as far as the eye could see. She was a ghost among the crowds, invisible to all but those who knew her.

As a detective with the New Orleans PD, Dace had seen her fair share of darkness. But there was something about this case that haunted her still. The small-town girl who'd gone missing three months ago had left behind only whispers and speculation. Some said she'd run away, others that she'd been taken by some unsavory character.

Dace's thoughts drifted back to the day she'd arrived in New Orleans. She'd come to escape the pain of her past, to find solace in the jazz and the mystery of the city. But the truth was, she'd brought it with her - the ghosts that lingered long after a life was lost.

She took a deep breath, the cool night air filling her lungs as she turned back towards the building. The rain-soaked streets were empty now, save for a lone figure huddled in an alleyway. Dace's instincts screamed warning, but something about the figure's ragged pose drew her closer.

As she approached, the figure looked up and their eyes locked. For a moment, time froze, and all that existed was those two souls staring into each other's depths. It was as if they'd both known this person before, despite never having met. The connection was fleeting, but it left Dace with more questions than answers.

She spotted the faint scars on the figure's hands, the ones that spoke of a life marked by struggle and hardship. Something in those eyes told her that this girl wasn't just another forgotten soul - she'd been through something terrible. And Dace knew she had to help her find justice.

Without thinking, she reached out and took the girl's hand, guiding her into the night. The city might be full of mysteries and secrets, but for Dace Fontaine, it was also a world of possibility - where a ghost like her could finally begin to find her way home.
