Dace Kovács stood alone on the edge of the cliff, the wind whipping through her dark hair as she gazed out at the vast expanse of water below. As a member of the secretive organization known only as "The Order," Dace had seen her fair share of battles and betrayals. But tonight, she was alone with her thoughts.

It had been months since Dace had last spoken to her sister, Éva Kovács. The two had been inseparable growing up, but after their parents' mysterious death, they had drifted apart. Dace had always felt a sense of guilt for leaving Éva behind, and now, as she stood on the cliff's edge, she couldn't help but wonder what her sister was doing at this very moment.

Dace took a deep breath and let it out slowly, feeling the tension in her shoulders ease. She knew that she had to focus on the task at hand, rather than getting lost in thoughts of her family. The Order was counting on her, and she couldn't fail them again.

As she turned to make her way back down the cliff, Dace noticed a figure emerging from the shadows. It was Marcus, one of her closest allies within The Order. He smiled at her, his eyes crinkling at the corners, and Dace felt a warmth spread through her chest.

"What brings you here tonight, Marcus?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

"I received a message from Éva," Marcus replied, his expression serious. "She's in trouble, Dace. The Order is sending a team to extract her, but I think we need to get there first."

Dace's heart skipped a beat as she processed the news. Her sister was in danger? She couldn't let that happen. With newfound determination, Dace turned to Marcus and nodded.

"Let's do it," she said, her voice firm. "We'll extract Éva and make sure she's safe."

Together, Dace and Marcus set off into the night, ready to face whatever lay ahead in their quest to protect the one person who truly mattered to her: her sister, Éva Kovács.
