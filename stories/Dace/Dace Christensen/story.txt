Dace Christensen stepped into the dimly lit room, her eyes scanning the space for any sign of trouble. As a renowned detective with the Copenhagen Police Department, she had seen her fair share of dark alleys and seedy characters. But nothing could have prepared her for the mysterious letter that had arrived at her office earlier that day.

The letter was typed on plain white paper, with no signature or indication of who might have sent it. All it said was: "Meet me at the old warehouse at midnight. Come alone." Dace's instincts told her to ignore it, but something about the words resonated deep within her. She felt an unshakeable sense of curiosity, and she knew she had to investigate further.

As she made her way to the abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town, Dace couldn't help but think about her full name: Dace Christensen. Her parents had given her a unique name that often raised eyebrows, and she had grown accustomed to being the only Dace in any room. But tonight, as she crept through the deserted streets, she felt like just another faceless stranger, invisible in the shadows.

The warehouse loomed before her, its broken windows like empty eyes staring back. Dace approached cautiously, her hand on the grip of her gun. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the darkness, dressed in black and hood up. "Dace Christensen," the voice said, low and gravelly. "I've been waiting for you."

The figure pushed aside its hood, revealing a shocking sight: her own sister, Lise, who had gone missing five years ago. Dace's mind reeled as she tried to process the reunion, but before she could react, Lise spoke up again, "You have to listen to me, Dace. You have to understand what really happened that night."

As they stepped into the warehouse, Dace felt a rush of emotions swirling inside her. She was back in the world of the living, and nothing would ever be the same again. And as she looked at Lise with newfound curiosity, she knew that this chance meeting might just unravel one of the most tangled mysteries of her career â€“ all thanks to the mysterious letter that had set everything in motion.
