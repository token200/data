Dace Kowalski stood at the edge of the crowded streets, his eyes scanning the sea of faces with a mixture of disdain and detachment. As a former member of the notorious Shadowhand Clan, he had grown tired of their violent games and manipulative politics. The last time Dace had been a part of their organization was months ago, when they demanded he carry out a hit that would have put innocent lives at risk.

That was when he knew it was time to leave.

Now, as he walked through the city, Dace felt like an outsider looking in. People hurried past him, some casting nervous glances his way, while others simply avoided eye contact altogether. He wasn't used to this level of scrutiny.

A chill ran down Dace's spine as a faint melody floated through the air. It was the familiar tune that had been the Shadowhand Clan's anthem for years – and yet, now it only served as a reminder of his past.

He quickened his pace, weaving through alleys and side streets to escape the haunting memory. His thoughts were consumed by questions: What had he really accomplished by leaving? Would anyone even care?

As night began to fall, Dace made his way to the one place that still held any semblance of solace – a small bar on the outskirts of town where an old friend worked as the bartender.

When he entered the dimly lit establishment, Jack's eyes met his, and a hint of recognition flashed across his face. "Dace," he said softly, wiping down the counter with a dirty rag.

The two exchanged quiet nods before Dace took a seat in the corner booth, ordering a whiskey as Jack poured him a drink. The silence was palpable, but it felt like a balm to Dace's weary soul.

As the night wore on and the shadows outside grew darker, Dace finally spoke up, his voice low and rough around the edges. "Jack...what am I supposed to do now?"

The bartender set down the glass of whiskey in front of him with a gentle touch. "You don't have to do anything, Dace," he said quietly. "Just start anew."

Dace looked at Jack, searching for reassurance. The older man's eyes were steady, and in that moment, it was as if he knew exactly what Dace needed – understanding and acceptance.

"I think I'm going to be alright," Dace said, his voice barely above a whisper.

The two sat in silence, lost in their own thoughts, but this time, they weren't haunted by the ghosts of their past.
