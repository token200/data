Dace Jhih-hao stepped off the bus and onto the bustling streets of Taipei, her eyes scanning the crowds with a practiced air of detachment. A member of the ancient Red Vipers clan, she had been trained in the art of stealth and deception from a young age. Her parents, both high-ranking members of the clan, had taught her well, but Dace's true calling lay elsewhere.

As a former assassin, Dace had grown disillusioned with the clan's brutal methods and had fled to start anew. She now worked as a freelance "consultant," using her skills to help those in need rather than harming them. Her current mission was to retrieve a valuable artifact from a rival clan's headquarters, a task that required all her cunning and agility.

Dace navigated the winding alleys of the city, avoiding the watchful eyes of the clan's goons. She had received a tip about a secret entrance to the rival clan's lair, hidden behind a seemingly innocuous street vendor. The vendor, an old friend from Dace's past, greeted her with a warm smile as she approached.

"Dace Jhih-hao, it's been too long," he said, his eyes twinkling with mischief. "I see you're still up to your old tricks."

Dace chuckled and handed him a small pouch of gold coins. "Just trying to make a living, my friend. What's the story on that entrance?"

The vendor nodded toward a narrow opening between two buildings. "Be careful in there, Dace. The rival clan won't take kindly to you poking your nose into their business."

Dace smiled to herself as she slipped through the opening. She had been in tighter spots before, and her training had prepared her for anything. With a quiet efficiency, she made her way deeper into the lair, ready to face whatever lay ahead.

As she retrieved the artifact and made her escape, Dace couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. Being a freelance consultant wasn't always easy, but it was a job that allowed her to use her skills for good. And for that, she would fight to the death.
