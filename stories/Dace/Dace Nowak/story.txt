Dace Nowak stared out at the grey, rain-soaked streets of Krakow, his eyes lost in thought. The former Polish Special Forces operative sat in a small caf√©, nursing a cup of cold coffee and replaying the events that had led him to this moment.

It had been five years since Dace's last mission, the one that left him with more questions than answers. He had been tracking a notorious Russian arms dealer, following a trail of breadcrumbs that had taken him from the streets of Warsaw to the outskirts of Moscow.

But something had gone wrong. Dace had lost his partner in the line of duty, and he had been left with a weight on his shoulders that he couldn't shake. The mission was closed, but the memories lingered, haunting him like a ghost.

As he sat there, lost in his thoughts, Dace's phone rang. He hesitated for a moment before answering, hoping it wasn't another job offer or unwanted entanglement with the wrong people.

"Hey, Dace," a voice said on the other end of the line. "It's Alex."

Dace's eyes narrowed. Alex was an old friend from his days in the Special Forces. They had parted ways after the mission that had left him with so much emotional baggage.

"What can I do for you?" Dace asked, trying to keep his tone neutral.

"I've got a job," Alex said, without preamble. "It's a bit of a long shot, but I think it might be worth your while."

Dace raised an eyebrow. He knew that Alex never called unless he had something significant to offer.

"What is it?" Dace asked, his curiosity piqued.

"I've got intel on a rogue Russian unit operating in Eastern Europe," Alex said, his voice low and serious. "I think they might be linked to the arms dealer you were chasing."

Dace's mind began to spin with possibilities. This could be his chance to finally get some answers about what had happened on that fateful mission.

"I'm listening," Dace said, a hint of excitement creeping into his voice.

Alex gave him details - the location, the suspected operatives, and the nature of their operation. Dace listened intently, his mind racing with possibilities.

Finally, he spoke up. "I'm in," he said, his decision made.
