Dace Adelberg was known for her unconventional approach to art. As a performance artist, she had built a reputation for pushing boundaries and defying expectations. Her latest installation, "Echo Chamber," was no exception.

The exhibit took the form of a large, mirrored room where visitors could step into a seemingly endless loop of their own reflections. The walls, floor, and ceiling were all adorned with mirrors, creating an dizzying sense of disorientation. Dace had spent weeks setting up the space, carefully calibrating the angles and lighting to create an otherworldly atmosphere.

As visitors entered the room, they were immediately struck by the sense of disconnection from their surroundings. It was as if they were trapped in a never-ending cycle of self-reflection, with no clear exit strategy. Dace had intended for this feeling to be both disorienting and liberating – a chance for participants to confront their own identities and challenge their perceptions.

As people wandered through the room, Dace observed them from a distance, noting their reactions. Some were overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the space, while others seemed fascinated by the mirrored reflections. A few even began to manipulate the mirrors, creating intricate patterns with their reflections or attempting to escape the loop.

One visitor in particular caught Dace's attention – a young woman who stood for hours in the center of the room, her eyes fixed intently on her own reflection. As the woman moved closer and closer to the glass, her image began to distort and ripple, as if she was staring into a funhouse mirror. Dace watched, transfixed, as the woman's expression changed from one of curiosity to one of profound introspection.

Suddenly, the lights flickered and the mirrors began to shatter, one by one. The room fell silent, except for the sound of breaking glass and the woman's soft whisper: "I see myself." Dace smiled to herself, knowing that her installation had worked its magic – at least, on this young visitor. As she left the room, the woman turned back to gaze once more into the mirror, this time with a sense of recognition and understanding.

Dace Adelberg smiled wryly, knowing that some art installations were meant to be experienced rather than explained. She packed up her equipment, already thinking about her next project – whatever it might be, she was sure it would be just as thought-provoking and disorienting as "Echo Chamber."
