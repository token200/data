Dace Sundlöf stepped out of her small cottage, breathing in the crisp morning air. The sun was just starting to peek over the rolling hills of the Swedish countryside, casting a warm glow over the landscape. She wrapped her scarf tighter around her neck and set off towards the forest, her boots crunching on the frosty earth.

As she walked, Dace's mind wandered back to the strange occurrence that had brought her here, to this remote village in rural Sweden. It started with a mysterious letter, delivered to her doorstep one evening without explanation or return address. The words danced across the page like fireflies in a summer night: "Come to Sundby," they read. "I need your help."

Dace's curiosity had gotten the better of her, and she'd packed a small bag and set off towards the village, determined to uncover the truth behind the enigmatic message. As she walked through the forest, the silence was broken only by the sound of birds chirping and leaves rustling in the wind.

A figure emerged from the trees ahead, dressed in worn denim and scuffed leather boots. Dace's hand instinctively went to her pocket, where her small wooden comb lay hidden away. She'd always carried it with her since childhood, a token from her grandmother who had taught her the secrets of traditional Swedish folk magic.

The figure regarded her calmly, their eyes squinting against the morning light. "You're Dace Sundlöf," they said finally, their voice low and husky.

Dace nodded warily, her heart pounding in her chest. She'd sensed that this person was somehow connected to her past, but she couldn't quite place it.

The figure stepped forward, revealing a striking woman with piercing blue eyes and a wild tangle of curly hair. "My name is Astrid," they said, extending a hand. "And I've been waiting for you, Dace Sundlöf."

Astrid took Dace's hand in hers, her touch sending a shiver down her spine. As the two women stood there, the forest around them seemed to grow quieter, as if holding its breath in anticipation of what was to come.

"What is it that you need my help with?" Dace asked finally, her voice barely above a whisper.

Astrid's smile grew wider, revealing pointed canines. "Ah," she said, her eyes glinting with mischief. "That would be telling."

And with that, the game was afoot.
