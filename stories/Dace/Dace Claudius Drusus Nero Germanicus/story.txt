As he entered Arminius's fortified stronghold, Dace was struck by the chieftain's unwavering determination to resist Roman dominance. Yet, as he spoke with Arminius and listened to his grievances, Dace sensed an opportunity for compromise. He proposed a mutually beneficial agreement, one that would grant Germania greater autonomy while maintaining Rome's strategic interests.

In the end, it was Dace Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus who emerged victorious, having successfully brokered a fragile peace between Rome and the Germanic tribes. His name became synonymous with diplomacy and strategic brilliance, earning him a place in Roman history alongside the greatest generals of his time.
