Dace Abdi stood alone on the windswept rooftop, gazing out at the vast expanse of the city below. The lights of the skyscrapers twinkled like diamonds against the inky blackness of night, a reminder that even in solitude, there was still beauty to be found.

As a former mercenary, Dace had seen his fair share of battles and bloodshed. But after years of fighting for money and power, he'd grown tired of the endless violence and chaos. He'd hung up his rifle and walked away from the only life he knew, seeking solace in the stillness of the night.

Maybe it was the woman's presence, or maybe it was just the wind rustling through his hair as he stood on the rooftop with her. Whatever it was, he knew one thing for sure: he wanted to see what this new dawn had in store for him.

Without another word, Dace took Zephyr's hand and stepped into the unknown
