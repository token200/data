The snowflakes danced in the air, swirling around Dace Aslanov as he walked through the deserted streets of Moscow. His eyes narrowed against the cold, his gaze fixed on some point ahead. He was a man consumed by purpose, driven by a singular focus.

Aslanov's thoughts turned to the upcoming meeting with his superiors at the Ministry of Internal Affairs. They had summoned him for reasons he couldn't quite discern, but he knew it was never good when the Minister called personally. A hint of unease crept up his spine as he quickened his pace.

He pushed open the door to the building, stepping into the warm, well-lit interior. The receptionist looked up from her phone, a hint of surprise on her face.

"Dace Aslanov," she said, rising from her seat. "The Minister is waiting for you."

Aslanov nodded curtly and followed the receptionist through the corridors to the Minister's office. When they arrived, he was greeted by a stern-faced man with piercing blue eyes.

"So, Dace," the Minister began, his voice firm but controlled. "We've been receiving... disturbing reports about your activities in the past few weeks."

Aslanov stood straight, his shoulders squaring against the accusation. "I'm afraid you have the wrong idea, Minister," he said calmly. "I am merely following orders from above."

The Minister's expression didn't change. "We're not discussing that," he said, his voice dripping with disapproval. "What we are concerned about is the impact of your actions on the stability of our nation."

Aslanov's eyes narrowed further. He knew what they were getting at â€“ the hints of dissent among the people, the whispers of rebellion against the government. But he also knew that those whispers would die down once the situation cooled off.

"I assure you, Minister," Aslanov said, his voice steady and firm, "my actions are for the good of our nation."

The Minister's expression softened ever so slightly, but it was clear that the outcome was already decided. "Very well, Dace," he said finally. "We will need to... reevaluate your position within the Ministry."

Aslanov bowed his head, accepting the verdict without a word. He knew that in a world where truth and power were closely intertwined, sometimes the hard choices had to be made.
