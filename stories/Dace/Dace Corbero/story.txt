Dace Corbero walked into the dimly lit tavern, her piercing green eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As the daughter of a notorious smuggler, she had grown accustomed to the rough and tumble life of the underworld. Her full name, Dace Corbero, echoed in her mind as she made her way to the bar, where her friend, a gruff but kind-hearted bartender named Grim, nodded at her from behind the counter.

"What can I get you, Dace?" he asked, wiping down the bar with a dirty rag.

"Just a whiskey, neat," she replied, tossing a coin onto the counter. "And don't skimp on it, I've had a long day."

As Grim poured her drink, Dace's gaze roamed the room, taking in the shady characters and rough-looking men who frequented this part of town. She had heard rumors of a rival gang trying to muscle in on her father's territory, and she was determined to put a stop to it.

Just then, a hooded figure slipped into the tavern, their eyes locking onto Dace with an unnerving intensity. She felt a shiver run down her spine as they approached her, their movements fluid and deliberate.

"Well, well, well," the stranger said, their voice low and menacing. "Look what we have here. The little Corbero girl, all alone and vulnerable."

Dace's hand instinctively went to the dagger at her belt, but she kept it hidden, not wanting to provoke the stranger into violence. Instead, she smiled sweetly and said, "And who might you be? I'm afraid I don't recall seeing you around here before."

The stranger chuckled, a cold, mirthless sound that sent shivers down Dace's spine. "Oh, but I think we're going to meet again soon, little Corbero," they said, backing away from the bar as Grim stepped forward, his eyes fixed menacingly on the newcomer.

Dace watched them leave, her mind racing with possibilities and threats. She knew that in this line of work, allegiances were fleeting and enemies could pop up at any moment. But she was Dace Corbero, daughter of a smuggler, and she would not be intimidated by anyone.
