I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Dace Saldana. It's possible that this character does not exist or is not well-known.

However, I can suggest an alternative story about Gina Carano, who is also known by the alias Gina Saldana (although this is not accurate, as she was born in California, not Arizona).

Here's a story about Gina Carano:

Gina Carano, aka "Crusher," was a force to be reckoned with on and off the Octagon. A former U.S. Army Ranger and professional mixed martial artist, Gina had it all - brains, brawn, and a killer combination of punches.

Growing up in California, Gina was always drawn to physical activity, competing in wrestling and football in high school. But it wasn't until she discovered MMA that she found her true calling. With her razor-sharp reflexes and lightning-quick movements, Gina quickly racked up wins in the Octagon, earning herself a reputation as one of the toughest fighters in the sport.

But Gina's skills extended far beyond the octagon. She was also an accomplished actress, starring in blockbuster films like Haywire and Deadpool. And with her chiseled physique and charisma on camera, Gina became a household name, inspiring countless young women around the world to lace up their boots and hit the gym.

As Gina's star continued to rise, she began to use her platform to speak out on issues that mattered to her - from veterans' rights to women's empowerment. Her message of strength and resilience resonated with fans everywhere, cementing her status as a true role model.

Despite her many accomplishments, Gina remained humble and grounded, always staying true to herself and her values. And as she looked back on her incredible journey, Gina knew that she had truly earned the nickname "Crusher" - not just for her fighting skills, but for the crushing impact she had on those around her.
