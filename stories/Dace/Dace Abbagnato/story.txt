Dace Abbagnato was a force to be reckoned with on and off the stage. As one half of the renowned drag duo "Ruby Roulette," she electrified audiences with her sassy wit, impeccable style, and killer dance moves.

A native of New Orleans, Dace grew up surrounded by the city's rich jazz heritage and Mardi Gras traditions. It was only natural that she would find her calling in the world of drag, where self-expression and spectacle reigned supreme. Under the guidance of Ruby Roulette's mentor, the legendary performer Lola LaRue, Dace honed her craft and developed a persona that was equal parts confident and vulnerable.

As Ruby Roulette, Dace Abbagnato and her partner, Riki Riot, captivated audiences with their high-energy performances, which blended elements of drag, dance, and theater. Their sets were always elaborate affairs, complete with lavish costumes, elaborate stage designs, and show-stopping choreography.

But despite the glamour and excitement of their profession, Dace knew that she had a more personal side to her artistry. She used her platform to speak out on issues affecting the LGBTQ+ community, from mental health awareness to social justice advocacy. Her commitment to using her voice for good had earned her a reputation as one of the most authentic and impactful performers in the business.

One evening, after a particularly grueling show, Dace Abbagnato sat down with Ruby Roulette's writers to brainstorm ideas for their next performance. As she poured over notes and sketches, an idea began to take shape: a show that would blend traditional Mardi Gras revelry with modern themes of identity and belonging.

Excited by her vision, Dace shared it with Riki Riot, who was equally enthralled. Together, they set to work crafting a production that would be both a love letter to their hometown and a powerful exploration of what it means to find one's true self in the world. As they worked, Dace Abbagnato knew that she had created something truly special â€“ a performance that would leave audiences cheering and inspired long after the curtain fell.
