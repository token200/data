Dace Straume stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, her eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of movement. As a skilled detective with the Portland Police Bureau, she had seen her fair share of dark alleys and seedy characters. But tonight was different. Tonight, Dace Straume was on the hunt for answers.

The victim, a young woman named Sarah, had been found dead just hours before. The only clue was a cryptic message scrawled on the wall in blood: "You'll never find me." Dace's gut told her that this was no ordinary crime scene.

As she examined the area, Dace Straume noticed a small piece of fabric caught in a nearby trash can. She carefully plucked it out and held it up to the light. It was a snippet of black cotton - the same material as Sarah's favorite dress. A shiver ran down her spine.

Dace Straume knew she had to act fast. She spent the next few hours canvassing the neighborhood, talking to witnesses and gathering evidence. But every lead seemed to end in a dead-end. It was as if the killer had vanished into thin air.

Just when Dace was about to give up hope, her phone rang. It was her partner, Detective Ryan. "I've got something," he said, his voice low and urgent. "One of Sarah's friends just came forward with a statement."

Dace Straume's heart skipped a beat as she listened to the friend's account. It seemed that Sarah had been blackmailing someone - but who? And why? Dace knew that she was getting close to the truth.

With renewed determination, Dace Straume set out to uncover the identity of her killer. She spent the rest of the night poring over evidence and following leads. And finally, just before dawn, she had a breakthrough. The game was afoot, and Dace Straume was ready to play.
