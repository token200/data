Dace Olsson stepped into the dimly lit bar, his eyes scanning the room with a mix of familiarity and caution. The patrons were a rough bunch, but he knew most of them by name. He nodded to the bartender, a gruff man named Gunnar, as he made his way to the stool at the end of the counter.

The bar was called "The Red Griffin," and it had been Dace's second home for years. He'd lost count of how many nights he'd spent here, nursing a drink and swapping stories with the regulars. But tonight felt different. Tonight, he was on a mission.

As he took his seat, a burly man with a thick beard approached him, a mug of dark ale in hand. "Dace, my friend!" he boomed, clapping Dace on the back. "What brings you here tonight?"

"Just passing through," Dace replied, wincing as the man's grip was a bit too tight.

The man nodded sympathetically. "Well, in that case, let's catch up. I've got some news that might interest you."

Dace raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. The man leaned in close, his voice dropping to a whisper. "I heard from my cousin who works at the harbor that they're looking for someone with your... particular set of skills."

Dace's eyes narrowed. What kind of skills did this guy mean? He was a fisherman, not some sort of spy or smuggler.

The man chuckled, seeming to sense Dace's unease. "No, no, it's just that you've got a way with the sea, Dace. And they're looking for someone to help them track down some... unusual cargo."

Dace snorted. "Unusual cargo?" That was code for something that didn't quite fit into the law, wasn't it?

The man nodded, his expression serious. "That's exactly what I said. And if you're interested in taking on the job, they'll be talking to you soon enough."

As the night wore on, Dace found himself becoming more and more invested in the conversation. He was a simple man, not looking for much in life beyond the sea and his own two hands. But there was something about this that intrigued him â€“ something that made him wonder if maybe it was time to take a break from the fishing boat and see what lay over the horizon.

He downed his drink, tossed a few coins on the bar, and stood up, ready to face whatever came next. The Red Griffin was full of secrets, but Dace Olsson was about to uncover one that would change everything.
