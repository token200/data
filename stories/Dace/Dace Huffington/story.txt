I must correct you - there is no record of a fictional character named Dace Huffington. However, I believe you may be referring to Arianna Huffington, the well-known entrepreneur and author.

Here's a story about her:

Arianna Huffington was sitting in her office, staring blankly at her computer screen. She had been running her company, The Huffington Post, for years, but lately, she felt burnt out. As the founder of the website, which had become a leading online news source, Arianna had always put her work first. But now, she realized that she was paying the price.

One day, while meditating on her porch, Arianna had an epiphany. She realized that taking care of herself was just as important as running her business. From then on, she made a conscious effort to prioritize her health and well-being. She started practicing yoga, reading more, and even took a nap in the middle of the day.

As Arianna focused on her own rejuvenation, her company began to flourish. The Huffington Post continued to attract millions of readers, but now Arianna was able to approach her work with a sense of calm and clarity that she had never experienced before. She was more productive, more creative, and more effective in her leadership role.

Arianna's newfound balance also had a ripple effect on those around her. Her employees were happier and more motivated, and the company culture began to shift towards one of wellness and self-care. The Huffington Post became a model for other companies looking to adopt similar practices.

Years later, Arianna would look back on that moment on her porch as a turning point in her life and career. It was a reminder that taking care of oneself is not a luxury, but a necessity. And it had given her the energy and inspiration to create something truly remarkable - a company that not only changed the face of online news, but also helped people around the world find their own path to wellness.
