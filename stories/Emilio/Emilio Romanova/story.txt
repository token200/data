Emilio Romanova stepped out of the rain-soaked streets and into the dimly lit café, shaking the droplets from his fedora. A former spy for the Soviet Union, he had grown tired of the lies and betrayals that came with the job. Now, at 60, Emilio had retired to this small Parisian café, where he spent his days sipping coffee and recounting tales of his adventures to anyone who would listen.

As he slid into a stool at the bar, the bartender, a gruff but kind man named Pierre, greeted him with a nod. "The usual, Comrade?" Emilio nodded, and Pierre expertly poured a shot of vodka over ice. He slid it across the counter to Emilio, who raised an eyebrow.

"The Russians are closing in," Pierre said, his voice low. "Word is, they're looking for someone to retrieve an artifact from the museum."

Emilio's eyes narrowed. The artifact was a rare Soviet-era satellite, one that held secrets of the early space program. He had always wanted it, but the Soviets had never produced any leads.

Just then, a young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair walked into the café. She scanned the room, her gaze locking onto Emilio. For a moment, they just stared at each other – she, inquisitive curiosity; he, a mix of warning and recognition.

"Mind if I join you?" she asked finally, taking a seat across from him. Emilio shrugged, and Pierre handed her a cup of coffee.

"My name is Nadia," she said, extending a hand. "I've heard stories about your... exploits."

Emilio's expression was guarded, but his eyes betrayed a glimmer of amusement. "What makes you think I'm the right man for the job?"

Nadia smiled, and Emilio felt a shiver run down his spine. He knew that look – it was the same one he had seen in the mirror before, back when he was still a spy.

"I have my ways," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "But I think we both know why you're here, Emilio."

He raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. Maybe, just maybe, this young woman could be the one to help him get his hands on that satellite – and finally lay his ghosts to rest.

The game was afoot once more, and Emilio Romanova was ready to play.
