Emilio Malinowski stepped into the smoky, dimly lit bar, his eyes scanning the crowded room with a mix of curiosity and suspicion. As a private investigator, he had grown accustomed to walking into spaces that felt like their own personal Pandora's box – full of secrets and lies.

The bartender, a gruff old man with a scruffy beard, nodded at Emilio as he made his way to the end of the bar. "What can I get you, detective?" he growled.

"Just a whiskey," Emilio replied, sliding onto a stool. He pulled out a small notebook and pen from his pocket, flipping through the pages before beginning to scribble some notes.

The patrons of the bar were an eclectic bunch – a young couple celebrating their one-year anniversary, a group of rough-looking bikers on their lunch break, and a lone figure in the corner, hood up and face obscured. Emilio's trained eye picked out the last person as the most interesting.

As he sipped his whiskey, Emilio watched the lone figure, noticing the way they shifted uncomfortably in their seat or fidgeted with their hands when anyone caught their eye. Something about them didn't add up.

Just then, the bartender sidled over to Emilio's stool, a look of curiosity on his face. "You're looking for someone?" he asked quietly.

Emilio nodded, his eyes never leaving the figure in the corner. "Who is it?"

The bartender hesitated before answering, "Word is, that one's got connections to some shady characters – people who don't take kindly to strangers poking around."

Emilio raised an eyebrow, intrigued. He tossed a few bills onto the bar and slid off his stool, making his way towards the lone figure. As he approached, they looked up, their eyes locking in a fleeting moment of tension.

"Mind if I join you?" Emilio asked, taking a seat across from them.

The figure hesitated before responding, "I don't think so."

Emilio smiled, pulling out another cigarette from his pocket and lighting it. "Suit yourself," he said, blowing a stream of smoke towards the figure's face.

For a moment, nothing happened – just the soft hum of conversation from other patrons and the faint smell of cigarettes in the air. Then, without warning, the figure lunged forward, their hand grasping for Emilio's throat.
