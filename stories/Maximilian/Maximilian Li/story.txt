He spent hours poring over books on forensic science and crime fiction, teaching himself everything he could about the art of investigation.

Years later, Maximilian Li stood outside his office building, surveying the crowded streets below. A young woman, frantic with worry, approached him, clutching a small bag of belongings. Her sister was missing, she told him, and she had no idea where to begin looking. Maximilian Li listened attentively, taking mental notes as he nodded sympathetically.

Together, they set out on the trail of clues, following leads and interviewing suspects. As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the city, Maximilian Li made a breakthrough.
