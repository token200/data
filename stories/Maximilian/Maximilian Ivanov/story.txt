A master thief and con artist, he had made a name for himself on the streets of New York City. His charm and wit were legendary, able to talk his way out of even the most precarious situations.

One fateful evening, Maximilian Ivanov set his sights on the city's most exclusive auction house. He had heard rumors of a rare artifact being sold to the highest bidder, one that would grant its owner unimaginable power.
