Viktoria Kalējs stepped out of her small apartment, the crisp morning air filling her lungs as she gazed up at the snow-covered rooftops of Riga. A freelance journalist and writer, she had spent countless hours researching stories about the city's troubled past, but it was a particular article that had been consuming her thoughts lately.

The story revolved around the mysterious disappearance of her own great-aunt, Elza Kalējs, who had vanished in 1945 during the last months of World War II. The police had never found any leads or suspects, and Viktorija's family had long accepted that she was simply lost forever. However, something about the whispers in the city, where some claimed to have seen her great-aunt wandering the streets at night, sparked a fire within Viktorija.

With a steaming cup of coffee in hand, she began making phone calls to anyone who might be able to shed light on Elza's fate. Her first stop was the local archives, where an elderly archivist listened intently as Viktorija recounted her great-aunt's story. As they pored over dusty files and photographs, a single name emerged: Vincents, a mysterious Soviet collaborator with ties to Riga.

Viktorija tracked down Vincents' former colleagues and acquaintances, each offering more fragmented clues about his involvement in Elza's disappearance. Her investigation led her through hidden alleyways and secret passages beneath the city's streets, as if she was following a trail of breadcrumbs left by her great-aunt herself.

One stormy evening, Viktorija finally found herself standing outside Vincents' old apartment building. The entrance creaked as she pushed it open, and with each step, she felt Elza's presence growing stronger. She reached the third floor and knocked on the door. A faint voice from within called out her name.

As the door swung open, a frail, elderly woman sat in a rocking chair, dressed in faded clothing reminiscent of Elza's own style. Viktorija approached cautiously, sensing that this was someone she should trust.

The old woman looked up at Viktorija with an unmistakable glint in her eye and began to speak – in hushed tones, but with a depth that made Viktorija's heart skip a beat:

"I remember the night Elza vanished like it was yesterday. Vincents came knocking on our door, looking for 'special work' – what he called it. I didn't know what he meant at first, but then... and only then, did Elza understand."

The words trailed off as Viktorija listened, frozen in awe.
