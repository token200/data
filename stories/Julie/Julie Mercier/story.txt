Julie Mercier walked into the bustling café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. As she waited in line to order, she couldn't help but think about her friend Emily's art show that was happening tonight. She had promised to be there, and now she was running a bit behind schedule.

As she reached the front of the line, Julie ordered her usual cappuccino and took a seat at the small table by the window. She pulled out her phone and checked the time for what felt like the hundredth time. Okay, maybe it wasn't that bad – she had only been running 15 minutes behind.

Just as she was starting to relax, Julie's phone buzzed with a text from Emily. "Hey girl! You almost here? I'm setting up my art now." Julie quickly replied, "Almost there, Em! Traffic is crazy out here."

Feeling more anxious than ever, Julie jumped up from her seat and made her way back to the door. She stepped outside into the cool evening air, taking a deep breath before continuing on foot. The walk was invigorating, and soon she found herself walking faster, her heart beating with excitement.

When she finally arrived at Emily's studio, Julie was greeted by the sound of music and laughter. She slipped into the room, trying not to draw attention to herself as she made her way through the crowd. As she approached Emily, who was busy arranging a display of paintings on the wall, Julie felt a sense of pride wash over her.

It was going to be a great night, she could feel it. And besides, she had promised Emily that she would be there – after all, that's what friends are for. As she helped set up and mingled with the guests, Julie Mercier knew that this was exactly where she belonged.
