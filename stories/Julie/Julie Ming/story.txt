Julie Ming stepped into the small café, scanning the room with a practiced eye. As a private investigator, she was used to reading people, and this place was no exception. She spotted her contact in the corner, sipping on a coffee and pretending to be engrossed in their phone.

"Julie Ming," a soft voice called out from behind the counter. It was Emily, the café owner and a trusted informant.

Emily slid a small folder across the counter, its contents visible through the slits cut into it. "I've got something for you, Julie."

Ming's eyes narrowed as she picked up the folder, her mind already racing with possibilities. She opened it, revealing a set of photographs and a single sheet of paper with a name on it: Ethan Wright.

"Who is this?" Ming asked, her voice low.

Emily hesitated before answering, "That's what I'm trying to find out. Word is, he was seen with some shady characters last night. They're rumored to be involved in human trafficking."

Ming's grip on the folder tightened as she slid back into her seat. She had been tracking a lead on this exact case for weeks. This could be the break she needed.

As she studied the photos and notes, Ming's mind whirred with possibilities. Who was Ethan Wright? What did he want? And what were these shady characters after?

Just as she was about to call in her team to start digging deeper, a young woman with a look of desperation on her face walked into the café. She scanned the room until her eyes landed on Ming, and then she began to move towards her.

"I know it's you," the woman said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I need your help."

Ming's instincts kicked in, and she reached for the folder, but something about the woman's words made her hesitate. There was more to this story than met the eye.

"Who are you?" Ming asked instead, her eyes locked on the woman's.

The woman took a deep breath before answering, "My name is Sophia, and I know what Ethan Wright did."

Ming's ears perked up, and she leaned forward, intrigued. This was just the beginning of a long and difficult journey, but with Sophia by her side, Julie Ming might finally have a chance to bring justice to those who needed it most.
