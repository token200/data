Julie Yi-hsien stood at the edge of the rooftop garden, her toes curled over the weathered stone ledge. The city sprawled out before her like a sleeping beast, its concrete and steel canyons stretching into the distance. She breathed in deeply, feeling the cool breeze carry the scent of blooming jasmine.

It was a typical Taipei night – warm, humid, and alive with the hum of street vendors and neon lights. But Julie felt like an outsider, a stranger in her own city. As a botanist, she spent most of her days cooped up in the lab, studying the rare plants that made Taiwan's unique. Her nights were spent wandering the streets, searching for specimens to add to her collection.

She thought back to when she was a child, watching her grandmother tend to their family's orchid greenhouse in rural Taiwan. Her grandmother had taught her how to coax even the most reluctant blooms into flower, and Julie had inherited that green thumb. But as she grew older, she began to feel restless, wanting more than just the quiet rhythms of the greenhouse.

She spotted a small figure scurrying across the rooftop, a young boy no more than ten years old. His eyes shone with wonder as he explored the garden, touching the leaves and flowers with reverence. Julie smiled, remembering her own sense of curiosity as a child.

The boy paused in front of a rare orchid she had brought back from a recent expedition. It was one of only a handful grown in Taiwan, and Julie knew it was worth more to collectors than she ever could have imagined. But for now, it belonged here, in the garden, where she could watch over it and tend to its needs.

"Hello," the boy said, looking up at her with an expression that bordered on awe.

"I'm Dr. Yi-hsien," Julie replied, kneeling beside him. "Welcome to our little oasis."

As they talked, Julie realized that this small creature was not so different from herself – searching for connection and meaning in a world that seemed vast and overwhelming. And maybe, just maybe, she had found something here, too – a sense of belonging to the city, to its creatures, and to the very earth itself.

The stars began to twinkle overhead, casting a magical glow over the rooftop garden. Julie smiled, feeling the weight of her solitude lift. She knew that this was where she belonged – among the blooms, in the shadows, and under the starry Taipei night sky.
