Julie Li sat at her small kitchen table, sipping a cup of tea as she stared out the window at the grey London sky. It was a typical Monday morning, and she was already dreading the day ahead. As a freelance writer, Julie had grown accustomed to the uncertainty of her schedule, but that didn't mean she liked it.

She took a deep breath and tried to shake off the feelings of anxiety that had been plaguing her lately. She had just landed a big client, a publishing house in New York, and was working on a book review for their latest release. It was her chance to prove herself as a serious writer, but she couldn't help feeling overwhelmed by the pressure.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. Julie's roommate, Rachel, had stopped by with a tray of freshly baked croissants and a sympathetic ear. "Hey, girl, need a pick-me-up?" Rachel asked, handing Julie a flaky pastry.

Julie took a bite of the warm croissant and let out a sigh of relief as the buttery flavor melted in her mouth. She closed her eyes and let herself get lost in the taste for a moment, savoring the comfort food that never failed to lift her spirits.

When she opened her eyes again, Rachel was still sitting at the table, watching her with concern. "You okay?" Rachel asked, noticing Julie's troubled expression.

Julie hesitated before answering, not wanting to burden her roommate with her fears. But something about Rachel's kind face put her at ease, and she found herself pouring out all her worries about the book review and the client.

Rachel listened attentively, nodding along as Julie spoke. When Julie finished talking, Rachel handed her a small piece of paper from behind her ear. "I wrote you this," she said, smiling mischievously.

Julie unfolded the paper to reveal a handwritten poem:

"When the world outside feels grey,
And doubts creep in to stay,
Just remember that words are your strength,
And stories have the power to lengthen
Your voice, though small, can be loud and clear.
Believe in yourself, and you'll find your way."

Tears pricked at Julie's eyes as she read the poem. It was exactly what she needed â€“ a reminder that she had the power to create something beautiful, even on her toughest days.

With newfound determination, Julie finished her tea and stood up from the table, feeling ready to face whatever challenges came her way. "Thanks, Rach," she said, giving her roommate a hug. "You always know just what to say."
