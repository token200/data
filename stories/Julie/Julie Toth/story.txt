Julie Toth stepped into the crowded caf√©, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She had been searching for Dr. Liam Connor for weeks, and finally, she had received a tip that he would be meeting with some old colleagues here.

As she waited in line to order, Julie's mind wandered back to her childhood. Growing up in Budapest, Hungary, Julie had always felt like an outsider among her peers. She was the daughter of a diplomat, constantly moving from one embassy to another. But despite the constant change, Julie found solace in her studies. She devoured books on psychology and philosophy, and it wasn't long before she knew that she wanted to pursue a career in social work.

After completing her degree, Julie moved to New York City, determined to make a difference in the world. She worked tirelessly for years, building a reputation as a compassionate and skilled therapist. But as much as she loved her job, Julie couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing.

That's when she received the letter from Dr. Liam Connor. He had been researching Julie's work on trauma recovery, and he wanted to collaborate with her on a project. At first, Julie was hesitant - she knew little about Connor's methods, and she wasn't sure if she trusted him. But as their correspondence continued, she began to realize that this might be the opportunity she had been waiting for.

As Julie waited in line, she spotted Connor sitting at a small table by the window. She took a deep breath and approached him, her heart racing with excitement. "Dr. Connor," she said, extending her hand. "It's an honor to finally meet you."

Connor smiled warmly and shook Julie's hand. "The pleasure is all mine, Julie Toth. I've read so much about your work. Let's get started on this project, shall we?"
