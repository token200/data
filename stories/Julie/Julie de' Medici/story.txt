As queen, Julie de' Medici used her influence to promote the arts and education, encouraging young minds to explore their passions.

But behind the scenes, Julie de' Medici's thoughts turned to her family back in Florence. Her parents had long since given up hope of securing a advantageous marriage for their daughter, but Julie de' Medici knew that she owed them a debt of gratitude. She would do whatever it took to make them proud.

Years went by, and Julie de' Medici became one of the most beloved queens France had ever known. Her legacy lived on long after her death, inspiring generations to come.
