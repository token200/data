Born and raised in Latvia, Julie grew up surrounded by the vibrant colors and bold brushstrokes of traditional Latvian folk art. Her love affair with painting began at a young age, as she spent hours watching her grandmother create intricate patterns on the walls of their family's small cottage.

As she honed her skills, Julie became increasingly fascinated with the intersection of culture and identity. She saw the way that art could capture not just the physical world, but also the emotional and psychological states of those who created it.
