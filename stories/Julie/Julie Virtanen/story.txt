Julie Virtanen walked into the bustling caf√©, her eyes scanning the crowded room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Emma, sitting at a small table by the window and made her way over.

"Hey, Julie!" Emma exclaimed, as she stood up to greet her. "It's been too long!"

Julie smiled warmly and hugged Emma tightly. "Long time no see! I've missed you so much."

As they sat down, Emma filled Julie in on the latest gossip from their school. Julie listened intently, her expression a mix of curiosity and amusement.

After finishing their coffee, Julie suggested they take a walk along the riverbank. The sun was shining brightly overhead, casting a warm glow over the scenery. They strolled hand in hand, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere and each other's company.

As they walked, Julie couldn't help but think about her plans for after graduation. She had been accepted into several prestigious universities, but she still hadn't made up her mind which one to attend. Emma noticed her friend's distant expression and asked what was on her mind.

Julie hesitated before answering, "I don't know if I want to pursue a career in engineering like everyone expects me to." She looked at Emma with a serious expression. "I feel like there's more to life than just numbers and formulas."

Emma nodded understandingly, "I think you're right, Julie. You have so much passion and creativity within you. Whatever path you choose, I'll support you all the way."

Julie smiled gratefully, feeling relieved to have shared her concerns with a friend she trusted. As they continued their walk, the river flowing gently beneath them, Julie felt a sense of clarity wash over her.

The afternoon sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the landscape. Julie and Emma reluctantly made their way back to campus, already making plans for their next adventure together.
