Julie Adelberg stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the Manhattan skyline. As a successful event planner, she had spent countless hours coordinating weddings and galas for high-society clients. But tonight, she was alone.

It had been a year since her fianc√©, Alex, had died in a tragic accident on one of their own planning projects. The pain still lingered, like an open wound that refused to heal. Julie's friends and family tried to be supportive, but they just didn't get it. They hadn't lost someone she loved as fiercely as she had.

As the sun dipped below the Hudson River, casting a golden glow over the city, Julie felt the weight of her grief bearing down on her. She thought about all the things she would never experience with Alex - their future children, their white wedding, their old age together.

Just then, a gust of wind swept across the rooftop, rustling the leaves of the potted plants that lined the edge. Julie shivered, feeling a chill run down her spine. She turned to leave, but something caught her eye. A small, intricately carved wooden box had been left on the roof by mistake.

Curious, Julie picked up the box and examined it. It was beautiful - the lid was adorned with a delicate pattern of leaves and vines. As she lifted the lid, a faint scent of sandalwood wafted out, transporting her back to their early days together.

Alex had given her this very box as a gift before he left for his trip to Europe. He had promised to return with it, but never did. Julie felt a lump form in her throat as she realized that Alex would have loved this box almost as much as he had loved her.

For the first time since his death, Julie felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, this little wooden box was more than just a relic of their past - it was a reminder of the love they shared, and a promise that even in death, Alex would always be with her. As she tucked the box into her bag, Julie smiled through tears, knowing that some wounds might never fully heal, but with love on her side, anything was possible.
