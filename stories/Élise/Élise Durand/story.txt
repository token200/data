Élise Durand sat alone in her dimly lit apartment, staring at the old photograph on her coffee table. It was an image she had seen countless times before, yet it still brought a lump to her throat every time she gazed upon it.

The photo was of her parents, taken during their happiest moments as newlyweds. They were young and carefree, with bright smiles plastered on their faces. Élise's mother was holding a baby girl – herself – in her arms, while her father wrapped his strong arms around them both.

It had been twenty years since that fateful day, yet the ache of loss still lingered within Élise's heart. Her parents had vanished without warning when she was just a toddler, leaving behind only whispers and speculation. Some said they had fled due to financial troubles, while others claimed it was something more sinister.

Élise had spent her entire life searching for answers, scouring the globe in search of any clue that might lead her to the truth about her parents' disappearance. She had interviewed countless people, sifted through dusty records and old newspaper clippings, but every trail led to a dead-end.

As she gazed at the photo once more, Élise's thoughts turned to the letter she had received just yesterday. It was from an unknown sender, with only one sentence scrawled on the page: "Meet me at the old oak tree in Paris at midnight. Come alone."

A thrill ran through her veins as she considered the possibility that this could be the break she had been searching for all these years. She hesitated for a moment, weighing the risks and consequences of following this mysterious lead.

Finally, with a sense of determination burning within her, Élise made up her mind. She would attend the meeting, no matter what dangers or surprises lay ahead. For twenty years, she had been searching for answers – now it was time to take action.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Élise stood up from the couch and began to make preparations for her midnight rendezvous. The photograph on her coffee table seemed to gleam with an otherworldly light in the dimming evening hours, as if urging her forward into the unknown.

As the clock struck nine, Élise locked her apartment door behind her, ready to embark on a journey that would change her life forever.
