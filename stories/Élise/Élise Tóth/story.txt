Élise Tóth stepped out of her worn leather jacket and onto the rain-soaked streets of Budapest, the city's grey light casting a melancholy glow over the narrow alleys. She pulled up her collar, letting the misty air cling to her skin like a damp shroud.

As she walked, the sounds of the city - horns blaring, pedestrians chattering, and the distant wail of sirens - blended into a discordant symphony that seemed to match the rhythm of her own heart. Élise had always felt at home in this city, where the weight of history pressed down upon the cobblestone streets like a physical force.

A violinist on the corner caught her eye, the melancholy strains of a Chopin nocturne drifting through the air like a lost soul. Élise's fingers twitched with an itch to take up the instrument herself, but she suppressed it, knowing that music was not for her. She had been trained in its ways, studied the techniques of the great masters, but her own voice - her only one - was lost in the cacophony of her own thoughts.

Élise's eyes landed on a small café across the street, where the sunlight struggled to penetrate the clouds outside. She pushed open the door and slipped inside, leaving the rain-kissed streets behind. The café's proprietor, an elderly woman with wispy silver hair, looked up from behind the counter as Élise took a seat.

"Kávé, és szó?" she asked, her voice like a soft breeze on a summer day.

Élise nodded, taking out her notebook and pen to jot down a few lines of verse that had been swirling in her head all morning. The words poured onto the page like blood from a wound, as if the emotions she'd been carrying for weeks were finally beginning to emerge.

As she scribbled, Élise felt a strange sense of peace settle over her, like the rain outside was washing away not just the city's grime but also the dust of her own fears. When she finished, she crumpled up the paper and tossed it into the trash, knowing that this would be no easy night to sleep through.
