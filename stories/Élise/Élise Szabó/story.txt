Élise Szabó was a young and ambitious journalist who had made a name for herself in the competitive world of investigative reporting. With her quick wit and sharp instincts, she had a knack for uncovering stories that others had overlooked.

One day, Élise received a cryptic tip about a potential scandal involving a prominent businessman in the city. She spent hours poring over financial records and conducting interviews with sources, slowly piecing together the evidence.

As she dug deeper, Élise began to notice strange discrepancies in the businessman's financial transactions. It seemed that he was funneling large sums of money into offshore accounts, hiding his true wealth from the public eye.

With her findings in hand, Élise decided to write a expose piece revealing the truth about the businessman's illicit activities. She spent hours crafting the article, making sure to include all the relevant details and evidence she had gathered.

Finally, the day of publication arrived. The article sent shockwaves through the business community, with many calling for greater regulation of corporate finances. Élise's boss praised her for a job well done, saying that it was one of the most compelling investigations she had ever seen.

As Élise watched the reactions of the public from her office window, she couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction. She knew that her hard work and determination had made a real difference in the world.

But as she began to celebrate, Élise's phone rang. It was an unknown number, and when she answered, she heard a low, gravelly voice on the other end. "Élise Szabó," the voice said, "I see you've been poking around in some interesting places lately."

Élise felt a shiver run down her spine. Who was this person? What did they want with her? She tried to brush it off as a prank call, but deep down, she knew that something was off.

The line went dead, and Élise was left staring at her phone in confusion. She tried to shake off the feeling of unease, telling herself it was just nerves. But as she sat back down at her desk, she couldn't help but wonder: who was watching her?
