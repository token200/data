I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Élise DiCaprio. However, I found that Kate Winslet plays the role of Rose DeWitt Bukater in the film "Titanic" (1997), alongside Leonardo DiCaprio.

Here's a story about Rose and her sister Élise:

It was a chilly winter evening in New York City when Rose DeWitt Bukater, now in her 50s, sat by the fireplace with her younger sister, Élise. The siblings had always been close, despite their vastly different lives. Élise, an aspiring artist, lived in the city while Rose resided in the countryside.

As they sipped hot cocoa and reminisced about their childhood, Élise began to sketch Rose's story on a piece of paper. She drew the Titanic, its grandeur and tragedy etched into her pencil. The siblings talked about Rose's past, from her arranged marriage to Jack Dawson to her time on the ship.

Élise was fascinated by Rose's experiences and asked if she could paint a portrait of their mother. Rose smiled and handed Élise an old photo album filled with pictures of their family's past. As they flipped through the pages, they discovered hidden secrets about their mother's life before they were born.

Élise's artistic talent was evident in her sketches, which captured the essence of Rose's story. She poured her heart into the drawing, infusing it with love and sadness. When she finished, Rose gently took the paper from Élise's hands and examined it carefully.

"This is you," Rose said softly, tears welling up in her eyes. "You're just as brave and resilient as I am."

Élise looked at her sister, feeling a mix of emotions: gratitude for the love they shared, but also the weight of carrying on their family's legacy. She knew that she had big shoes to fill, but with Rose by her side, she felt confident that she could navigate the ups and downs of life.

As they sat together, watching the fire crackle, Élise realized that even though their paths were different, their bond remained strong. They were two sisters bound together by love, history, and a shared story that would live on through art and memories.
