Élise Yun stepped into the dimly lit room, the soft hum of the jazz band in the background mingling with the whispers of the crowd. She made her way through the throng of people, her eyes scanning the space for a glimpse of familiar faces. As she approached the bar, she spotted him - Léon, her partner in every sense of the word.

Their eyes met across the room, and Élise's heart skipped a beat. It was as if no time had passed at all since their last meeting. She slid onto the stool beside him, and he wrapped his arm around her waist, pulling her close.

The music swelled, and Léon began to sing, his voice like honey poured over Élise's skin. She closed her eyes, letting the melodies wash over her, feeling the tension in her body ease. They had been apart for months, working on separate projects, but this moment felt like no time at all had passed.

As they danced through the night, lost in their own little world, Élise couldn't help but think about the choices she had made. Leaving Léon behind to chase her dreams had been a difficult decision, one that still lingered in her mind like an open wound. But as she looked into his eyes now, she knew it was worth it.

"Je t'aime," he whispered, his breath warm against her skin.

Élise's heart skipped a beat. "I love you too," she replied, her voice barely audible over the music.

In that moment, nothing else mattered. The city outside receded, and all that remained was the two of them, lost in their own little world of love and music. As the night wore on, they laughed and danced and lost themselves in each other's eyes, knowing that no matter what lay ahead, their love would endure.
