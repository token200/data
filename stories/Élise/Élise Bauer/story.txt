Her piercing green eyes seemed to bore into the souls of those she interrogated, uncovering secrets that others missed. With an uncanny ability to piece together seemingly unrelated clues, Élise had solved some of the most baffling cases in recent history.

One drizzly evening, as the rain pattered against the pavement, Élise received a visit from the distraught mother of a local businessman, who had gone missing. The woman, Mrs. Jenkins, was frantic with worry, and Élise listened attentively as she recounted her son's disappearance. With a calm demeanor, Élise promised to do everything in her power to find Mr. Jenkins.

In a hidden alleyway, surrounded by flickering streetlights, Élise finally confronted the mastermind behind the disappearance.
