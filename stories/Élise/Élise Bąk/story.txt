Élise Bąk stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar station. The once-grand building now stood as a testament to time's relentless march, its grandeur faded like the photographs on the old wooden boards. As she gathered her belongings, a gust of wind carried the whispers of the past, echoing through the deserted halls.

Élise had arrived in Ravensburg, a town shrouded in mystery and myth, with stories that rivaled those of the city's own history books. She had always been drawn to the unknown, and the whispered tales of Ravensburg's cursed forest seemed like an irresistible siren's call.

As she made her way through the station, Élise noticed a figure lingering by the entrance, their eyes fixed on her with an unnerving intensity. She quickened her pace, but the stranger kept pace with her, their steps fluid and deliberate.

Upon exiting the station, the cool evening air enveloped Élise like a shroud. The town's main street stretched before her, lined with ornate shops and buildings adorned with symbols that seemed to shimmer in the fading light. A faint scent of incense wafted through the air, drawing her toward a small, unassuming shop tucked away between two larger establishments.

The sign above the door read "Magdalena's Curios." Élise pushed open the door, and a bell above it let out a soft tinkle as she entered. Inside, the room was cluttered with strange artifacts, each one more enigmatic than the last. Behind the counter, an elderly woman with eyes that seemed to hold secrets of their own regarded Élise with a knowing gaze.

"Welcome, child," Magdalena said, her voice low and soothing. "I've been expecting you."

Élise's instincts prickled at the old woman's words. She sensed that there was more to Ravensburg than met the eye, and she was determined to unravel its mysteries. With a quiet resolve, Élise began to explore this enigmatic town, navigating its twisted streets and uncovering secrets hidden beneath the surface.

As night fell over Ravensburg, Élise discovered that some mysteries were better left unspoken. The wind whispers carried on, but now they spoke of her own presence, drawing attention from unseen forces. The forest loomed, a shadowy figure waiting to be acknowledged.
