Élise Alsbach stepped off the last train of the day, her eyes scanning the deserted platform for any sign of movement. As she breathed in the damp air, the scent of saltwater and seaweed filled her lungs, transporting her back to summers spent by the sea as a child. She had returned to Ravenswood, her hometown on the rugged coast of Maine, seeking solace from the turmoil that had consumed her life.

Élise's thoughts drifted to her sister, Adèle, who had taken her own life just months prior. The pain was still raw, and Élise couldn't help but wonder if she could have done something to prevent it. She had always been protective of Adèle, trying to shield her from the world's cruelties, but now she felt lost and helpless.

As she walked through the quiet streets, the only sound being the creaking of old wooden buildings and the distant lapping of waves against the shore, Élise stumbled upon a small café. The owner, an elderly woman named Madame Dupont, recognized her immediately and ushered her to a seat by the window.

Madame Dupont handed Élise a steaming cup of tea and listened attentively as she poured out her story, tears streaming down her face. The older woman's expression softened, and she took Élise's hand in hers.

"You have been carrying this burden alone for too long, chère," Madame Dupont said gently. "It is time to let go and find peace."

Élise nodded, feeling a weight lift off her shoulders as she listened to Madame Dupont's words of wisdom. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over Ravenswood, Élise felt a sense of acceptance wash over her. She knew that Adèle was still with her, in spirit and in memory.

Over the next few weeks, Élise threw herself into helping Madame Dupont restore the old café to its former glory. As they worked side by side, she began to see Ravenswood in a new light – as a place of resilience and hope, rather than just grief and loss.

One morning, while walking along the beach, Élise spotted a family of seagulls perched on a rocky outcropping, their feathers glistening in the sunlight. She smiled, feeling Adèle's presence around her, watching over her with a gentle wing. And for the first time since her sister's passing, Élise felt a sense of peace settle into her heart, like the tide coming in to shore.
