Élise Kovalova stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the quaint station for any signs of life. The small town of Ashwood was a world away from the bustling streets of Paris she called home, but Élise had grown tired of the city's monotony. She craved adventure, and Ashwood promised to deliver.

As she made her way through the deserted streets, Élise felt a thrill of excitement course through her veins. The town was shrouded in mystery, its residents tight-lipped about their pasts. But Élise Kovalova was not one to shy away from secrets. She had a nose for detection, honed from years of investigating the darker corners of the city.

Her destination was the local antique shop, where she hoped to uncover some clue about Ashwood's troubled history. The sign above the door read "Curios and Antiques," and Élise's heart skipped a beat as she pushed open the creaky door.

 Inside, the air was thick with dust and the scent of old books. Élise wandered the narrow aisles, running her fingers over the spines of ancient tomes and admiring the intricate carvings on a vintage music box. Behind the counter, an elderly woman looked up from behind a pair of reading glasses.

"Welcome, young one," she said, her voice like honey. "I am Agnes, proprietor of this humble shop. What brings you to Ashwood?"

Élise smiled, her eyes locked on Agnes's. "I'm looking for information, madame. The history of this town is shrouded in mystery. I aim to uncover its secrets."

Agnes nodded, a hint of a smile playing on her lips. "Ah, Élise Kovalova, you are indeed a seeker of truth. I may have some tales to share with you... if you're willing to listen."
