Élise Ozoliņa stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the small station. The once-thriving town was now a shadow of its former self, the industrial buildings crumbling into disrepair. She had left Latvian capital Riga for this place, hoping to escape the memories that lingered in every corner.

Élise's thoughts drifted back to her family's farm, where she spent most of her childhood helping with the harvests and tending to their livestock. Her father, a kind-hearted man, had passed away when she was just a teenager, leaving her mother alone to raise their three siblings on her own. Élise had always been close to her brother, Jānis, who had encouraged her passion for photography.

As she made her way through the deserted streets, Élise couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The town seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for something to happen. She checked her camera and began taking shots of the abandoned buildings, trying to capture the essence of this forgotten place.

She walked until she reached the old church, its stone walls covered in ivy and moss. A cold wind whipped through the broken stained-glass windows as Élise climbed up to take a closer look at the crumbling pulpit. She spotted a faded photograph on the wall – her family's farm, taken during one of the many harvests they had shared.

A sense of nostalgia washed over Élise as she stared at the photo. Her brother Jānis would have loved this moment – capturing a memory and preserving it for eternity. Suddenly, a faint noise caught her attention – footsteps coming from the nearby alleyway.

Élise turned to see an old man with graying hair and piercing blue eyes walking towards her. He introduced himself as Andris, a retired teacher who had lived in the town all his life. They talked long into the evening, sharing stories about their families and the past.

As they sat together on a bench overlooking the river, Élise realized that this forgotten town held more than just memories – it was a window to her own family's history. Andris handed her an old notebook filled with photographs of his students' lives, including one of Jānis as a young boy.

The notebook had brought back memories of Jānis, and the lessons he taught her about photography. Élise showed him the images she had taken at the station, and together they discussed capturing more stories like theirs.

In that moment, Élise felt the weight lift off her shoulders – she had found a new purpose in this forgotten town. The old church's pulpit seemed less worn now, the memories within its walls still vibrant. She took out her camera, ready to document this place and preserve the lives of those who lived here before her.
