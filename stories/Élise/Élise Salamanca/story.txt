As a young woman, Élise had always been driven by a desire to prove herself, to show that she was more than just a pretty face and a pampered upbringing. She worked tirelessly, building relationships and forging alliances that would serve her well in the years to come.

One of these allies was a wealthy businessman named Marcus Thompson, who took Élise under his wing and introduced her to the world of high finance. Together, they made a formidable team, with Élise's charm and charisma complementing Marcus's strategic mind.

As their business empire grew, so did Élise's reputation as a shrewd and ruthless operator. People began to whisper about the mysterious woman who seemed to appear out of nowhere, always with a clever idea or a well-timed deal that would secure her position at the top.
