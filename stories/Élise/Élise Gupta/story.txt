Élise Gupta stepped into the bustling café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him across the way, his dark hair mussed and his bright smile lighting up the crowded space. It had been months since they'd last seen each other, but Élise's thoughts of Rohan Patel never strayed far from her mind.

As she made her way through the crowd, the bell above the door jingled, announcing her arrival. The barista, a friendly woman with a warm smile, greeted her warmly and asked what drink she wanted. Élise opted for a simple coffee, watching as the woman expertly brewed it before handing it to her.

Just then, Rohan stood up from his seat at the table by the window, catching her eye and flashing that familiar smile. Élise's heart skipped a beat as he made his way towards her, his movements fluid and confident. "Élise Gupta!" he exclaimed, his eyes crinkling at the corners.

They hugged warmly, exchanging whispered hellos in the midst of the café's din. As they sat back down, Rohan asked how she'd been, and Élise launched into a tale of her latest art project, one that had consumed her every waking moment for weeks. Rohan listened intently, his eyes sparkling with interest.

The conversation flowed easily, like old shoes on worn leather. They talked about everything and nothing, their words hanging in the air like the scent of freshly brewed coffee. As they sipped their drinks and laughed together, Élise felt a sense of belonging wash over her – she was exactly where she was meant to be.

It wasn't until they were packing up to leave that Rohan mentioned his own latest project, one that had taken him away from home for weeks at a time. "I wish I could be as dedicated to my art as you are," he said wistfully, looking over at Élise with admiration in his eyes.

Élise smiled softly, her heart swelling with affection for this kind and talented man who had captured her heart so completely. She knew that she'd always cherish the time they spent together – whether it was late-night conversations or lazy Sundays lounging in bed – as a reminder of the beauty and joy that life had to offer.
