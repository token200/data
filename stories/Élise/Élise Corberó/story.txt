I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Élise Corberó. However, I did find that there is a Spanish actress named Élise Lavigne Corberó who plays the role of Mónica Gaztambide in the Netflix series "Élite". 

Here's a story based on her character:

The dim lights of the upscale nightclub cast an air of mystery over the crowded room. Monika, or Monica as she was known to her friends, stood confidently at the bar, sipping on her cocktail. She had just received a surprise visit from her estranged father, and he wanted to meet with everyone again.

Monica scanned the room, searching for her group of friends - Juan, Mateo, Christian, and Adrien. They were the ones who truly understood her, who didn't care about her complicated family history or her privileged upbringing. She spotted them gathered near the dance floor, laughing and joking together like they always did.

As she made her way over to join them, Monica couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions. Her father had been gone for years, ever since he'd left the family due to scandalous reasons. But now, it seemed that he wanted to make amends, to reconnect with his daughter and the people who mattered most.

The group exchanged awkward glances as her father approached them. Monica's friends didn't know what to make of him; some were wary, while others were curious. As they stood there, the tension was palpable.

"Guys," her father said finally, breaking the silence. "I'm sorry. I know I hurt you all, but I want to try again. Can we please just put the past behind us?"

Monica's friends exchanged skeptical looks. Monica knew that it wouldn't be easy; there were too many ghosts from their family's past that couldn't be forgotten so easily.

But as they looked at each other - and then back at her father, who was standing with an awkward smile on his face - something shifted inside of Monica. She wanted to believe in redemption. She wanted to give them another chance.

"Okay," she said finally, her voice barely above a whisper. "Let's try."
