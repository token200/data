Élise Bach stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the crowded room for a familiar face. She had been searching for weeks, trying to find a lead on her missing brother, Léon. The police were stumped, and Élise was running out of options.

As she waited in line, a young musician caught her eye. He was playing a haunting melody on his guitar, the notes echoing off the walls like whispers from beyond the grave. Élise felt an inexplicable connection to the music, as if it spoke directly to her soul.

When it was her turn to order, Élise asked for coffee and a seat by the window. She pulled out her notebook and began to sketch, trying to clear her mind of the doubts that had been plaguing her since Léon's disappearance.

Just as she was getting into the zone, the musician caught her eye again. This time, he smiled, his eyes locking onto hers with a spark of recognition. Élise felt a jolt of electricity run through her veins.

"Mind if I join you?" he asked, sliding onto the stool beside her.

"Not at all," Élise replied, watching as he set down his guitar and took a seat.

"I'm Sébastien," he said, offering his hand.

Élise shook it, feeling a strange sense of calm wash over her. "I'm Élise," she replied, her eyes meeting Sébastien's once more.

As they chatted, Élise learned that Sébastien was a member of an underground art collective, known for their avant-garde performances and provocative installations. She sensed that he might be connected to Léon's disappearance, but she couldn't quite put her finger on why.

The hours passed, the café growing quieter as patrons departed for the night. Élise and Sébastien talked long after the lights had been turned off, their conversation meandering from art to music to the mysteries of the universe.

It wasn't until Sébastien mentioned Léon's name that Élise felt a glimmer of hope. "I think I might know something about your brother," he said, his voice low and serious.

Élise leaned in, her heart racing with anticipation. "What is it?" she asked, her eyes locked onto Sébastien's.

But just as Sébastien was about to reveal the truth, the café door swung open, and a group of shadowy figures slipped inside, their faces obscured by darkness. Élise felt a shiver run down her spine as they began to scan the room, their eyes locking onto hers with an unnerving intensity.

"Looks like our conversation is going to have to wait," Sébastien whispered, his hand closing around Élise's wrist in a reassuring grip. "Let's get out of here."
