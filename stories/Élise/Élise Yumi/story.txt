Élise Yumi was a name that whispered secrets to those who knew it. A name that conjured images of a mysterious and alluring woman, shrouded in shadows and smoke. It was a name that belonged to a figure from Élise's past, a ghostly apparition that haunted her every waking moment.

As a child, Élise had been fascinated by the stories her grandmother used to tell her about a young woman named Yumi, who had lived in a small village nestled in the mountains. According to legend, Yumi was a spirit of the forest, with powers both fierce and gentle. She could communicate with animals, summon storms, and heal the wounded.

As Élise grew older, she began to experience strange and vivid dreams that seemed all too real. In these dreams, she would find herself walking alongside Yumi through the misty forest, feeling an inexplicable connection to this mysterious woman. The dreams became more frequent, and with them, a sense of longing that Élise couldn't shake.

Years passed, and Élise's life took her far from the mountains, to the bustling streets of Tokyo. She built a successful career as a journalist, but the dreams persisted, like a nagging voice in her ear. One night, she received an unexpected message from an unknown sender – a simple phone number with no name or explanation.

Without hesitation, Élise dialed the number, and to her surprise, it was answered by a soft, melodious voice that seemed to belong to Yumi herself. The voice spoke of ancient secrets, hidden languages, and forbidden knowledge.

Élise was both thrilled and terrified by this encounter, sensing that she had been led back to where it all began – the mountains, the forest, Yumi's realm. With the mysterious voice as her guide, Élise embarked on a journey to uncover the truth about her family's past, and the enigmatic woman who had left such an indelible mark on her life.

As she delved deeper into the mystery, Élise discovered that Yumi was more than just a myth – she was a doorway to a world of magic and wonder, one that Élise had always known existed within herself. The name Élise Yumi now seemed like an echo from another time, a reminder of her own hidden power, waiting to be unleashed upon the world.
