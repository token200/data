Élise Sten stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the small station with a mix of excitement and trepidation. She had been away from her family's farm for months, studying in the city, and was finally returning home to help with the harvest.

As she made her way through the crowded station, Élise's mind wandered back to her time in school. She had always struggled with the idea of leaving her rural roots behind, but her parents had encouraged her to pursue a higher education, hoping that one day she would return and bring new ideas to their struggling farm.

Élise's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her name being called. She turned to see her younger brother, Léon, rushing towards her with a wide smile on his face. "Élise! Mon chère sœur!" he exclaimed, throwing his arms around her waist.

"Bonjour, Léon," Élise replied, hugging him tightly. "It's so good to see you."

Léon led Élise out of the station and towards the farm, where their parents were waiting anxiously for her return. As they approached the farmhouse, Élise could see that things had changed while she was away. The fields were more cultivated than ever before, and a new barn stood proudly in the corner of the land.

"Welcome home, Élise," her mother said, beaming with pride. "We're so glad you're here to help us with the harvest."

Élise smiled, feeling a sense of purpose wash over her. She had missed this life, and she was eager to get back into it. Over the next few weeks, Élise threw herself into the work, learning new skills and helping her family to bring in the crops.

As the harvest drew to a close, Élise's father called her into his office, a small room off the main part of the farmhouse. "Élise Sten," he said, looking at her with a serious expression. "We're proud of you for coming home and helping out. We know it wasn't easy for you to leave."

Élise nodded, feeling a sense of pride and belonging that she hadn't felt in months. She knew that she still had much to learn, but she was ready to put her education to use and help her family succeed.
