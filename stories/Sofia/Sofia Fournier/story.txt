Sofia Fournier stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the salty sea air filling her lungs. It had been five years since she'd left this small coastal town, fleeing the memories that lingered in every corner of Main Street. But after a decade away, Sofia was back to settle her ailing mother's estate.

As she walked through the town, familiar faces turned to regard her with curiosity. The locals knew Sofia as the rebellious teenager who had stormed out of town before anyone could stop her. She'd left behind a tangled web of relationships and unfinished business, and now it seemed like everyone was eager to know what brought her back.

Sofia ducked into her family's old bakery, where a warm scent of freshly baked bread enveloped her. Her mother's hands had worked the dough for decades, creating sweet treats that put smiles on every customer's face. Sofia took over after her mother retired, but the business struggled to compete with the big chain bakeries that now dominated the town.

The memory stung, and Sofia's eyes pricked with tears as she made her way through the stacks of dusty storage rooms. Her mother had kept everything, from old baking equipment to treasured family heirlooms. In a corner, a single shelf stood untouched – where Sofia had once displayed her own creations. The thought sent a pang of regret.

A knock on the door broke the silence, and Sophia's friend, Emily, slipped into the room, a cup of steaming coffee in hand. "Welcome back, Sof," Emily said softly, as if they shared a secret.

Sofia smiled wryly, taking a sip of the hot brew. It had been years since she'd spoken to Emily about what really drove her away from town – the pain of losing her father too soon, and the heartache that lingered in every goodbye.

"You're here for the inheritance," Emily said gently.

Sofia shook her head, savoring the bitter taste of her own regret. She didn't want just money; she wanted closure. Her mother's legacy was a part of Sofia, but so were the memories she'd left behind. She knew that this return to Main Street would be about mending fences and healing old wounds.

For now, though, she simply closed her eyes and breathed in the scent of home – salt and seaweed, sugar and love.
