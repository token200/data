Sofia García Márquez stepped off the plane in Cartagena, Colombia, feeling the warm tropical air envelop her like a hug. She had been away for five years, and yet the vibrant colors and sounds of this ancient city still felt like home.

As she made her way through customs, Sofia's mind wandered back to her childhood spent playing in the dusty streets of this very same city. Her abuela, Maria, used to tell her stories of their family's history and the struggles they had faced during times of war and economic hardship. The lessons of resilience and community that Abuela Maria taught Sofia had stayed with her even as she left Colombia for college in the United States.

Now, at 25 years old, Sofia was a journalist living in New York City. She had always been drawn to telling stories about the Latinx experience, and had written several articles on topics ranging from immigration to social justice. But despite her success in her field, Sofia couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing.

As she hailed a taxi to take her to her friend's apartment, Sofia noticed a group of women huddled outside a small café. They were laughing and chatting, their faces creased with age and experience. Something about them drew Sofia in – it was as if they were inviting her into a circle of stories and secrets.

The woman who took Sofia's hand and led her to the table turned out to be her cousin, Lucia. Over coffee and empanadas, Sofia listened as Lucia regaled her with tales of life in Cartagena during the 1950s – of protests against corruption, of women working tirelessly to support their families while their husbands fought in the war. As the sun set over the city, casting a golden glow over the crowded streets, Sofia felt like she had finally come home.

Over the next few weeks, Sofia returned to Cartagena whenever she could, meeting with Lucia and other women who shared stories of resistance and community. She began to write about their experiences, weaving together historical facts and personal anecdotes to create a narrative that was both powerful and intimate. As she worked on her first book, Sofia realized that the lessons of her childhood were still relevant – not just in Colombia, but in cities all over the world.

The story of her abuela's community became hers, a testament to the strength of women supporting one another through trials and tribulations.
