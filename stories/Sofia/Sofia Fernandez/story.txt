Sofia Fernandez stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. She had been traveling for hours, and the last thing she wanted to do was wait around for someone who might not even show up.

As she waited, Sofia's mind wandered back to why she was here in the first place. Her grandmother, Abuela Elena, had passed away a few days ago, leaving her the family bakery in the small town of San Juan. Sofia had always loved baking with Abuela Elena, learning the secrets of traditional pastries and cakes from the wise woman.

Just as Sofia was starting to feel like she was going to be stuck here forever, a car pulled up and out stepped Abuela Elena's best friend, Maria. Maria was a few years older than Sofia, but they had been close friends since childhood. She smiled warmly at Sofia and opened the door for her to get in.

"Sofia Fernandez, I'm so glad you made it," Maria said, as she slid into the driver's seat. "We have a lot to do today."

Sofia nodded, feeling a sense of excitement wash over her. Today was the day she would finally take over the bakery, and start making all of Abuela Elena's recipes.

As they drove through the town, Sofia could see that things were already starting to change. The streets were lined with new shops and restaurants, but there were still some old buildings standing tall. Sofia knew that she wanted the bakery to be a part of this historic town, and Maria seemed to sense it too.

When they arrived at the bakery, Maria introduced Sofia to the rest of the staff. There was Juan, who made the most delicious empanadas; Maria's daughter, Sophia, who was still learning the ropes but had a natural talent for baking; and Luis, who ran the show when Abuela Elena was around.

Sofia took her place behind the counter, feeling a sense of pride and responsibility. She knew that she had big shoes to fill, but with Maria by her side, she felt like she could take on anything. As they worked together to prepare for the lunch rush, Sofia couldn't help but smile. This was it â€“ she was finally home, and ready to make Abuela Elena's dreams come true.
