Sofia Zielinski stepped into the crowded coffee shop, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of black coffee. It had been months since they last saw each other, and Sofia couldn't help but feel a flutter in her chest as she approached him.

"Hey, what brings you here?" Sofia asked, sliding into the chair across from him.

"Not much, just grabbing a quick coffee before work," Jack replied, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he smiled. "You know how it is."

Sofia nodded, taking a sip of her own coffee. They chatted for a bit, catching up on each other's lives. Sofia had been keeping busy with her art, while Jack was still working on getting his degree.

As they talked, Sofia couldn't help but think about how much she missed him. They had been inseparable in college, and after graduation, they had drifted apart. But the spark between them remained, burning brightly like a flame that refused to be extinguished.

"I've got some good news," Jack said, his voice low and thoughtful. "I just landed an internship at a design firm."

"That's amazing!" Sofia exclaimed, her eyes lighting up with excitement. "You're going to do so great there."

They talked for a while longer, the conversation flowing easily as they delved into their hopes and dreams. As the coffee shop began to close down, Jack stood up, his hand reaching out to clasp hers.

"I'm glad we ran into each other," he said, his eyes searching hers. "I've missed you, Sofia Zielinski."

Sofia's heart skipped a beat as she felt the connection between them spark back to life. She smiled, her lips curving upwards in a soft smile.

"I've missed you too, Jack," she replied, her voice barely above a whisper.

As they stood there, hands clasped and eyes locked, Sofia knew that this chance encounter might just be the start of something new â€“ something that would bring them back together, stronger than ever before.
