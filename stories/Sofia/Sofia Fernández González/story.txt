Sofia Fernández González had always been fascinated by the art of traditional Spanish flamenco music and dance. Growing up in the small village of Alhambra, she spent countless hours watching videos of legendary dancers like Carmen Amaya and La Niña de los Peines, mesmerized by their fiery passion and energy.

As a young girl, Sofia Fernández González would often sneak into her abuela's attic to practice her own flamenco moves in front of the mirror. Her abuela, who had learned the art form from her own mother, would watch with a warm smile as Sofia twirled and stomped across the floor, trying out new steps and rhythms.

Years went by, and Sofia Fernández González's love for flamenco only grew stronger. She began taking formal lessons from a renowned dancer in Seville, where she spent hours perfecting her technique and learning about the rich history behind the art form.

When it was time to leave for university, Sofia Fernández González knew exactly what she wanted to do: become a professional flamenco dancer. With the support of her family and friends, she packed her bags and set off for Madrid, determined to make her dreams a reality.
