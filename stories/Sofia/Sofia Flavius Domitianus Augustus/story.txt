In the scorching desert town of Aurelia, a young girl named Sofia Flavius Domitianus Augustus grew up with a sense of purpose. Born to a humble family, Sofia's life took an unexpected turn when her father, a renowned merchant, discovered a hidden talent for architecture in his daughter. As she spent more time helping him with his designs, Sofia's passion for building and innovation blossomed.

Years passed, and Sofia Flavius Domitianus Augustus became an apprentice to the most prestigious architects in Aurelia. Her dedication and natural aptitude earned her recognition, and soon, she was working on projects that would change the face of the city.

One day, a mysterious client approached Sofia with a proposal that would change everything. The client, a wealthy patron, asked for her to design a grand palace that would surpass all others in Aurelia. The catch? The palace had to be built on a site previously deemed cursed by the gods.

Sofia Flavius Domitianus Augustus was both intrigued and intimidated by the challenge. However, she refused to back down, relying on her years of training and experience to guide her.
