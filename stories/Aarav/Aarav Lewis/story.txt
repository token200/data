Aarav Lewis stepped off the bus and onto the cracked sidewalk, gazing out at the rundown neighborhood. He had just turned 16 and was already shouldering more responsibility than he ever thought possible.

It had been three years since his mother passed away from cancer, leaving him and his younger sister to fend for themselves. Aarav's father had abandoned them shortly after, unable to cope with the loss of his wife. Now, at the age of 16, Aarav was determined to provide for his sister and build a better life.

Aarav walked up the path to their small apartment complex, his eyes scanning the surrounding buildings. He spotted his best friend, Alex, leaning against the railing, smoking a cigarette.

"Dude, I got some good news," Alex said, exhaling a stream of smoke. "I landed an internship at the new tech startup downtown. It's gonna pay decent and give me access to some sick networking opportunities."

Aarav nodded, feeling a pang of envy. He had applied for several internships but hadn't received any bites yet. His grades were solid, but he lacked the experience and connections that Alex seemed to have.

As they walked up the stairs, Aarav's sister, Emily, looked up from her phone, concern etched on her face. "Hey guys, what's up?"

Aarav forced a smile. "Just discussing summer plans, Em."

Emily nodded, going back to scrolling through social media. Aarav shot Alex a sideways glance.

"You think I'm a failure or something?" he muttered under his breath.

Alex chuckled and clapped him on the back. "Dude, you're doing your best. We all know that. You'll get an internship soon enough."

Aarav sighed inwardly but nodded at Alex's words of encouragement. He knew they were right; he just had to keep trying.

The three of them settled in for a quiet night at home, the only sound the hum of the TV and Aarav's thoughts whirring as he mapped out his next move.
