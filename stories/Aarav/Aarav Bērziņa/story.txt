Aarav Bērziņa stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the desolate landscape before him. The small town of Riga was a far cry from the bustling streets of New York City, where he had spent most of his life as a struggling artist.

As Aarav Bērziņa made his way through the station, he couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. He had left this place many years ago, chasing dreams and opportunities that seemed to slip further and further away with each passing day.

But now, at 30 years old, Aarav Bērziņa was back, having received an invitation from his estranged father to return home for a family funeral. It had been years since he'd last set foot in Riga, and the memories came flooding back as he walked through the streets.

He thought of his mother, who had passed away just a year ago, leaving behind a void that still felt unbearable. He thought of his father, a man who had always been distant and cold, but now seemed fragile and broken.

As Aarav Bērziņa walked, he noticed the changes that had taken place in the town while he was away. New buildings sprouted up, modernizing the once-quaint streets. But despite these advancements, there was a sense of sadness that hung over the air, a feeling of loss and disconnection.

Eventually, Aarav Bērziņa arrived at his family's old home, now empty and still. His father greeted him warmly, but with a hint of reserve, as if unsure of how to approach this son who had so long been away.

Over the next few days, Aarav Bērziņa found himself drawn back into the rhythms and routines of his childhood. He spent hours walking along the Daugava River, feeling the familiar breeze on his face and listening to the sounds of the city awakening around him.

As he walked, Aarav Bērziņa couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more to this visit than just a chance to reconnect with his family. He felt an itch beneath his skin, a restlessness that compelled him to explore and create once again.
