As the new student at Lincoln High School, Aarav Christensen had just transferred from the city to live with his estranged grandparents.

His passion for photography sparked a school project that earned him top marks, while his love for environmental activism inspired a group of students to start a local recycling program.

As Aarav Christensen navigated this new world, he found solace in the simple pleasures – watching sunsets over the hills, talking with locals at the diner, and exploring the nearby woods. It was here that he discovered an old camera hidden away in his grandparents' attic, which sparked a newfound appreciation for the art of photography.

One afternoon, while wandering along the riverbank, Aarav Christensen stumbled upon a beautiful couple – Lily, a painter, and Finn, a musician. They were engrossed in a heated discussion about their creative endeavors. Intrigued by their passion, Aarav Christensen introduced himself, sharing his own stories of art and music.

As the four began talking, an unlikely friendship was formed. Over coffee, they shared their dreams and aspirations, supporting one another through thick and thin.
