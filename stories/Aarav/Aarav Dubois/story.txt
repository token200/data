Aarav Dubois sat at his desk, staring blankly at the computer screen in front of him. He was a successful businessman in his late twenties, with a promising career ahead of him. But despite his outward success, he felt unfulfilled.

As a child, Aarav had always been fascinated by art and music. He spent hours sketching and painting, lost in a world of color and sound. But as he grew older, the demands of school and later work had slowly pushed those passions to the side.

Now, at his desk, surrounded by the trappings of success - expensive suits, sleek watches, and a high-rise view of the city - Aarav felt like something was missing. He had made a good living, but he knew it wasn't enough. Not without his creative spark reignited.

Just then, his phone buzzed with an incoming text from his best friend, Rohan. "Hey man, what's up?" Rohan asked. Aarav hesitated for a moment before responding, "Nothing much, just feeling restless. Want to meet up at the park?"

Rohan agreed and suggested they grab some coffee afterwards. When Aarav arrived at the park, Rohan was already there, sketchbook in hand. He offered Aarav a seat beside him.

As they sipped their coffee, Rohan began to draw, capturing the beauty of the world around them. Aarav watched, mesmerized, as his friend's fingers danced across the paper.

"Why did you stop doing art?" Rohan asked, looking up at Aarav with curiosity in his eyes. "It brought you so much joy."

Aarav sighed, feeling a pang of regret. "I don't know, man. I got caught up in school and work and it just fell by the wayside. But watching you...it's like I'm seeing myself again."

Rohan smiled and handed Aarav his sketchbook. "Maybe it's never too late to pick it up again," he said. "Want to try?"

Aarav hesitated for a moment before taking the pencil from Rohan. He began to draw, feeling a sense of freedom he hadn't experienced in years.

As they spent the afternoon together, Aarav felt his creativity stirring back to life. It was a small spark, but it was enough to ignite a fire within him. He knew that he still had a long way to go, but for the first time in months, he felt truly alive.
