Aarav Persson sat alone at the small café, nursing a cup of lukewarm coffee. His eyes scanned the crowded room, avoiding the gaze of anyone who dared to look his way. It had been three months since he'd last spoken to his family, and the pain still lingered.

As a successful tech entrepreneur, Aarav Persson had it all - wealth, influence, and a reputation for being ruthless in business. But at what cost? His relationships were shallow, his friendships fleeting, and his love life nonexistent.

The door swung open, and a chill ran down Aarav's spine. His ex-girlfriend, Sophia, walked in, her eyes locked on him like a hawk on prey. She smiled sweetly, but the warmth behind it was a facade, hiding the venom that coursed through her veins.

"Hey, Aarav," she said, her voice husky and seductive. "Long time no see."

Aarav Persson stood up, his eyes never leaving hers. "Sophia," he replied, his tone neutral. They exchanged a brief hug, but the air between them was thick with tension.

As they sat down at a nearby table, Sophia began to butter him up, trying to reel him back into her orbit. But Aarav Persson was immune to her charms. He knew her game too well, and he wasn't about to fall for it again.

The conversation meandered on, a forced exchange of small talk and half-truths. Aarav Persson listened attentively, his mind racing with the questions he'd been asking himself since their breakup. What had gone wrong? Why had he let her get so close?

Sophia seemed to sense his unease, her smile growing wider as she leaned in closer. "So, what's it like being a famous guy?" she purred.

Aarav Persson's eyes flashed with anger, but he kept his cool, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "Just another day in the life of Aarav Persson, billionaire tech mogul."

Sophia laughed, a throaty sound that sent shivers down Aarav Persson's spine. But it was a warning sign, a signal that she wasn't done yet.

As they finished their coffee and parted ways, Aarav Persson knew he'd have to be more careful in the future. His past was catching up with him, and he couldn't let Sophia Persson – no, Aarav Persson – become his downfall once again.
