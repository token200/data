I couldn't find any information on a person named Aarav Kortajarena. It is possible that this person is fictional or not a public figure.

However, I can try to create a short story based on a name that sounds similar, such as Aarav Sharma. Here's a 400-word story:

Aarav Sharma walked into the dimly lit caf√©, his eyes scanning the crowded room for any sign of his missing sister, Ria. It had been three days since she went missing, and Aarav was beside himself with worry.

As he waited in line to order, Aarav's mind replayed all the events leading up to her disappearance. They had been on a family trip to the beach, and Aarav had gone to grab some ice cream while Ria stayed behind to take photos of their parents' new vacation home. When he returned, she was nowhere to be found.

The barista, a friendly woman with bright pink hair, handed him his coffee and asked how his day was going. Aarav sighed and shook his head. "Not great," he replied. "I'm trying to find my sister."

The barista's expression softened, and she nodded sympathetically. "Sorry to hear that. Do you have any idea where she might be?"

Aarav thought for a moment before pulling out his phone and scrolling through his sister's last text messages. One message caught his eye: "Meet me at the old pier at midnight."

He decided to go there, hoping against hope that Ria would turn up. As he walked along the deserted beach, the stars twinkling above him, Aarav felt a sense of determination wash over him.

When he arrived at the pier, he saw a figure in the distance, silhouetted against the moonlight. It was Ria, her hair blowing in the ocean breeze. She turned and smiled as he approached.

"I'm so sorry I scared you," she said, hugging Aarav tightly. "I had to get away for a little while. But I promise I'm okay now."

Aarav held his sister close, tears of relief streaming down his face. He knew that their parents would be worried sick about them both, but he was just grateful to have Ria back safe and sound.

As they walked off the pier together, Aarav realized that sometimes, the scariest moments can lead to the closest reunions.
