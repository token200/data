Aarav Schafer sat in the dimly lit café, nursing a cup of cold coffee. It had been three days since he'd received the letter from his estranged father, informing him that he was coming to town for a visit. Aarav's mind wandered back to the day his parents had divorced, and how it had left an indelible mark on his life.

As a child, Aarav Schafer had always felt like an outsider in both of his parents' households. His father, a free-spirited artist, had been absent for long stretches, leaving Aarav to navigate the complexities of modern parenting with his mother. She, on the other hand, was a no-nonsense lawyer who had always prioritized her career over family.

Despite their differences, Aarav Schafer had never felt a strong sense of connection to either parent. It wasn't until his father's letter that he began to question why he had been so hurt by their parting. Was it truly fair to blame them for the pain and uncertainty he'd known as a child?

As he pondered these questions, Aarav Schafer noticed a young woman sitting across from him, watching him with an intense gaze. She was sketching his profile, capturing the sharp lines of his jaw and the piercing blue of his eyes. For a moment, their gazes locked, and Aarav felt like she saw right through to the heart of him.

The woman's name was Lily, and she was a local artist who had been commissioned to capture Aarav Schafer's likeness for an upcoming exhibition. As they talked, Aarav found himself opening up to her in ways he never thought possible. He shared stories about his childhood, his parents, and the struggles he'd faced as an adult.

For the first time in a long while, Aarav Schafer felt like he was being truly seen. And it was Lily's eyes that had seen him – flaws and all – and still chosen to stay. As they parted ways, Aarav knew that this chance encounter would change his life forever.
