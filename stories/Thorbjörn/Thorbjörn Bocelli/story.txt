Thorbjörn Bocelli was not a real person, but I assume you meant to ask me about Maestro Luciano Pavarotti's friend and fellow Italian singer, Luciano Pavarotti's friend. I will write about the famous Italian tenor. 

Luciano Pavarotti's friend. That is not correct either since we need a completely fictional character in this story

Let's assume that the person you want to hear about is actually Maestro Luciano Pavarotti but with his first name, and not to be confused with Bocelli, whose real name is also Italian.

Maestro Luciano Pavarotti was born into a musical family in Modena Italy in 1935. He studied music at the Liceo Musicale in Bologna. But for our fictional character's story we will use the first name: "Thorbjorn".

Thorbjörn Bocelli, born in a small coastal town, grew up surrounded by the soothing melodies of his mother's sea shanties and the majestic thunderous roars of the whales that dwelled beneath her waters. As a child he would often play hide and seek among the waves with a friend named "Aria." Together they'd dance under the light of full moon creating magical sounds.

Thorbjörn was fascinated by different types of music, especially folk melodies from around the world. This diversity in his musical tastes led him to learn how to sing in various languages including Italian, English, and Spanish. 

As he grew older Thorbjörn began taking singing lessons with a wise instructor who taught him the secrets of classical music. The way the notes connected, flowed, and told stories, captivated his heart.

Thorbjörn continued to hone his skills through rigorous practice sessions, often singing in harmony with other musicians from different countries and cultures. His powerful voice echoed across oceans as he belted out tunes by Italian masters and folk melodies from far-off lands.

Years passed, Thorbjörn's talents were discovered by music directors who offered him opportunities to perform on stages worldwide. He traveled through rain-soaked streets of London, under glittering lights of New York City, and in sun-kissed hills of Barcelona.

Thorbjörn stood tall on the stage as he took his final bow for each performance. As the curtains closed behind him a hush fell over the audience, their faces aglow with wonder at the magical world that Thorbjörn Bocelli had created with every breath and melody.
