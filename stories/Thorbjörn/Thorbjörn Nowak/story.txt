"You don't know me," he growled at the mob. "But I've seen what it's like to be hunted. To be hunted by those who don't understand." With a swift motion, he swept aside the accusers and freed the young musician from their clutches.

As the night wore on, Thorbjörn Nowak's legend grew. People began to whisper about his courage, his conviction. The town of Ravenswood would never be the same again, thanks to the arrival of this mysterious stranger with a heart full of fire and a name that echoed through its streets: Thorbjörn Nowak.
