As he grew older, his fascination only deepened, leading him to study textile engineering and eventually pursue a career in testing the comfiest, most durable hammocks around.

One sunny afternoon, Thorbjörn received an email from a company in Bali, asking him to test out their new line of eco-friendly hammocks.
