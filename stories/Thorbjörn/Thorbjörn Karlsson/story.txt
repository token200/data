Thorbjörn chuckled and shook his head, his smile hinting at secrets left untold. "Let's just say I've had my fair share of close calls," he said, his voice low and even.

As he disappeared into the night, it was clear that Thorbjörn Karlsson remained a force to be reckoned with – a man of mystery who would always keep his cards close to his chest.
