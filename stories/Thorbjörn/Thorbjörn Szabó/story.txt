Thorbjörn Szabó stepped into the dimly lit pub, his eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As a private investigator, he had seen it all - from cheating spouses to embezzling business partners. But there was something about this case that didn't sit right with him.

It started with a cryptic message from an anonymous source, claiming that Thorbjörn Szabó's sister, Elara, was in danger. Elara had gone missing several days ago, and the police were stumped. The only lead they had was a vague description of someone seen near her apartment building on the night she disappeared.

Thorbjörn Szabó made his way to the bar, ordering a whiskey as he pulled out his phone to scan the security footage from Elara's building. After hours of searching, he finally found it - a grainy video of someone lurking around the entrance of her apartment complex.

He poured himself another drink and began to analyze the footage. The person in question was wearing a black hoodie, making it impossible to discern any identifying features. But one thing caught Thorbjörn Szabó's attention: the person seemed to be watching their own back, constantly glancing over their shoulder as if they were waiting for someone.

Suddenly, the lights in the pub began to flicker, and a chill ran down Thorbjörn Szabó's spine. He felt eyes on him, too - eyes that seemed to bore into his very soul. He turned to leave, but it was too late. A hand clamped onto his shoulder, spinning him around.

A figure emerged from the shadows, revealing a woman with piercing green eyes and long, dark hair. "You're looking for Elara," she said, her voice low and husky. Thorbjörn Szabó's heart skipped a beat as he nodded, his mind racing with questions. Who was this woman? And what did she want?

The woman smiled, revealing perfect white teeth. "I'm here to help you find your sister." And with that, her eyes seemed to gleam with an otherworldly intensity, leaving Thorbjörn Szabó wondering if he had just stepped into something much bigger than himself.
