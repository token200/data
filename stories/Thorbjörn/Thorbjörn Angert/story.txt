Thorbjörn Angert stepped out of the foggy morning air and into the cozy café, shaking the water from his coat. He took a seat by the window, watching as the mist swirled outside, casting an ethereal glow over the sleepy town.

As he waited for his coffee to arrive, Thorbjörn's mind wandered back to the day's tasks. As the owner of Angert & Sons, the local furniture shop, he had a reputation for being meticulous and patient. His father, Godric Angert, had instilled in him a passion for craftsmanship and attention to detail.

Thorbjörn sipped his coffee, feeling the warmth spread through his fingers as he cradled the cup. He thought about the upcoming wedding season, when families came to him to find the perfect piece of furniture for their special day. He took pride in customizing each item to fit their unique needs and tastes.

Just then, a knock at the door interrupted his thoughts. It was his assistant, Maria, with a concerned expression on her face. "Thorbjörn, I have some news," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "The supplier for our wooden stock has cancelled all orders due to financial difficulties."

Thorbjörn's eyes narrowed as he set his cup down. This was not the first time this had happened, and it would require him to find an alternative solution quickly. He called Maria over and together they pored over the company's accounts, searching for a way to mitigate the impact.

As the morning wore on, Thorbjörn's mind worked through the problems, his mind racing with potential solutions. His father, Godric Angert, would have been proud of him – or so he imagined. He had learned well from the older man and was determined to carry on the family tradition.

Just then, Maria burst into laughter, a look of excitement on her face. "I've found it!" she exclaimed. "A local sawmill that can supply us with the wood we need. It's going to be a challenge, but I think we can make it work."

Thorbjörn smiled, feeling a surge of determination. He would find a way to keep Angert & Sons thriving, no matter what obstacles lay ahead.
