One day, while excavating a recently discovered site in southern Egypt, Klaudia stumbled upon something incredible - a well-preserved mummy with a note attached to its wrappings. The message was written in an ancient language that only a handful of people on the planet could decipher.

Excited by her discovery, Klaudia immediately contacted her colleagues back at the university, where they quickly got to work analyzing the document. It wasn't long before they cracked the code, revealing a shocking truth: the mummy was that of an ancient pharaoh thought to be lost forever.
