She had always been fascinated by the way people responded to art, and she took great pleasure in seeing how her own creations affected others.

One art critic, known for his scathing reviews, approached Klaudia with a skeptical expression on his face. "Your work is beautiful," he said, "but can it be more than just pretty colors?
