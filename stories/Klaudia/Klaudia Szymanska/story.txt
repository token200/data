Klaudia Szymanska stepped into the dimly lit caf√©, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of black coffee. Klaudia made her way over to him, her long legs striding across the floor with a confident air.

As she approached, he looked up and caught her gaze. A hint of a smile played on his lips, and Klaudia's heart skipped a beat. They had been friends since college, bonding over their shared love of art and music. But as they grew older, their friendship deepened into something more.

"Hey," he said, standing up to greet her. "It's been too long."

Klaudia smiled, feeling a flutter in her chest. "I know, I've missed you."

They hugged, the tension between them palpable. As they pulled back, he asked, "What brings you here tonight?"

Klaudia took a seat across from him, ordering a cup of tea. "Just needed to get out of the house," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

He nodded sympathetically, his eyes locked on hers. "I know how that feels."

As they chatted, Klaudia couldn't help but notice the way he looked at her. It was as if he saw right through her, into the deepest recesses of her soul. She felt seen and heard in a way she never had before.

Their conversation flowed effortlessly, like they were picking up where they left off all those years ago. Klaudia laughed, feeling carefree for the first time in weeks. It was as if being around him brought out the best in her.

As the night wore on, Klaudia realized she didn't want it to end. She wanted to stay in this moment, suspended in time, with the person who made her feel most alive.
