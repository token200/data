Klaudia Jhih-hao sat on the edge of her bed, staring blankly at the wall as tears streamed down her face. It had been five years since she lost her sister, Lea, in a tragic accident. The pain still lingered, like an open wound that refused to heal.

As a young woman with an extraordinary gift – the ability to communicate with spirits of the dead – Klaudia often sought solace in her abilities. She would spend hours talking to Lea's ghost, asking for guidance and reassurance. But even this had lost its magic lately.

One evening, as she was brooding over a cup of cold tea, there was a knock at the door. It was an old woman from the village, bearing a small package wrapped in white cloth. "For Klaudia Jhih-hao," the woman said with a gentle smile. "From someone who remembers."

Klaudia's curiosity piqued, she took the package and unwrapped it to reveal a beautiful silver locket adorned with intricate carvings of leaves and flowers. The old woman explained that Lea had left her this token before passing on, for Klaudia to find when she needed it most.

Overwhelmed by emotion, Klaudia opened the locket, revealing a small note inside. It was Lea's handwriting – strong, confident, and full of love. The words spoke directly to Klaudia's heart: "Don't let me go, sis. I'll be with you always, in every wind, in every wave. Trust your gift, trust yourself."

As she read the note, something shifted inside Klaudia. She felt a weight lift from her shoulders, like a veil of sadness lifting off her face. It was as if Lea's presence had returned, if only in spirit.

With renewed determination, Klaudia stood up and walked to her small altar, adorned with tokens from the dead – a silver pendant given by an ancestor, a feather from a bird said to carry Lea's essence back. She lit incense sticks, calling out to the spirits of those who had come before.

The air filled with whispers, soft murmurs that only Klaudia could hear. It was as if Lea's ghost had come to sit beside her once more, guiding her through the darkest moments. With Lea's voice in her mind, Klaudia began to channel her gift, calling out to those waiting on the other side.

As she worked, a sense of calm settled over her, like a soft breeze rustling leaves. Tears still fell, but they were no longer for sorrow; they were for joy and remembrance. In that moment, Klaudia knew she was not alone – Lea was with her, guiding her toward healing and peace.

With the locket safely back around her neck, Klaudia smiled softly to herself. She felt the pulse of life within her, like a gentle heartbeat in the darkness.
