However, not everyone was pleased with Klaudia's rise to prominence. His arch-rival, Emperor Caligula, saw him as a threat to his own power and began to plot against him. The two men were bitter enemies, each vying for control of the Roman Empire.

One fateful day, Caligula made a move that would seal Klaudia's fate. He orchestrated a failed assassination attempt on Klaudia's life, but the latter managed to escape with his life.
