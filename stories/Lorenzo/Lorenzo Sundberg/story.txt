Lorenzo Sundberg stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. He had been searching for weeks, trying to track down his estranged brother, Axel. The last time they spoke was three years ago, when Lorenzo was 25 and Axel was just starting to make a name for himself as a rising musician.

As he waited in line, sipping on a warm cup of coffee, Lorenzo's thoughts wandered back to the summer they spent together in Stockholm. They were inseparable, exploring the city's hidden corners and sharing secrets beneath the stars. But after that fateful night when Axel walked out without warning, their bond began to fray.

Lorenzo spotted a figure sitting by the window, his hair messy and his eyes red from lack of sleep. He felt a jolt of recognition, but as he approached the table, it became clear that this was not Axel. A young woman with piercing green eyes looked up, startled, and Lorenzo apologized for startling her.

The woman, whose name was Sophie, explained that she had been waiting for someone named Lorenzo Sundberg – a friend from college, apparently. Lorenzo chuckled, relieved to have finally found someone who knew his name.

Sophie revealed that Axel had indeed reached out to her after their last meeting, and she had kept in touch ever since. She told Lorenzo about the music festivals, the sold-out concerts, and the constant touring schedule that Axel had been on for years. As they talked, Lorenzo's mind whirled with questions – what had driven his brother to abandon their family, even if only temporarily?

Sophie handed Lorenzo a small note, slipped between the pages of her notebook. "Axel wrote this before he left," she said softly. The words on the page were hasty and apologetic, expressing regret for the pain he had caused and hope that one day they would reconnect.

Lorenzo's eyes welled up as he read the note, feeling a deep sense of longing for his brother. He knew it wouldn't be easy to rekindle their relationship, but with Sophie by his side, he felt more hopeful than ever that Axel Sundberg might finally come home.
