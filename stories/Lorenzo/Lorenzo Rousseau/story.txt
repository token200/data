Lorenzo Rousseau stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the crowded room with a mixture of disdain and curiosity. A man of few words, he preferred to let his actions speak louder than any conversation. His rough-hewn features and sharp jawline seemed chiseled from the very stone walls that surrounded him.

Rousseau was no stranger to this city, though it had changed little since he arrived years ago. The streets were still dirty, the people just as rough around the edges as he was. But there was a sense of desperation that hung in the air, like the faint scent of smoke from a dying fire.

As he made his way to the bar, a gruff voice called out to him, "Lorenzo! You're late again." It was René, the bartender, who had known Rousseau since before he'd learned to speak. The old man poured Rousseau a whiskey without asking, as if it were an old habit they both shared.

Rousseau took the glass and raised it to his lips, his eyes meeting René's in a silent understanding. It was a connection forged from years of silence, of mutual respect for each other's struggles.

The rest of the patrons watched him with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. They didn't know what to make of Rousseau – some said he was a former revolutionary, while others whispered he was a charlatan or worse. But Lorenzo knew his own story, one that was written in the lines of his face and the fire that burned within.

He sipped his whiskey, letting it warm his chest as he watched René polish a mug with a dirty rag. Their lives were like two old candles flickering together, casting shadows on the walls of this dingy city.

For a moment, Rousseau's thoughts strayed to the past – to the battles fought and lost, to the faces that had smiled at him before disappearing into the night. He pushed the memories away, unwilling to indulge them just yet. There was still work to be done in this unforgiving world.

As he finished his drink, Rousseau tossed a few coins onto the counter, leaving enough for René to buy another round for himself. It was a gesture of friendship, one that spoke louder than any words ever could.

The city outside seemed to wait for him like an empty chair at the table, but Lorenzo knew he'd be back tomorrow, just as soon as the sun rose again.
