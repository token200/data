Lorenzo Rossi walked into the small café, scanning the room for a familiar face. He spotted her sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee, and made his way over to her. As he approached, she looked up and smiled, and Lorenzo's heart skipped a beat.

"Lorenzo," she said, using his full name for the first time that day. "It's been too long."

Lorenzo sat down across from her, feeling a sense of comfort wash over him. They had known each other since college, bonding over their shared love of art and music. But despite their close friendship, Lorenzo had never mustered the courage to tell her how he really felt.

"Hey," he replied, trying to sound casual. "How's it going?"

Their conversation flowed easily, like no time had passed at all. They talked about everything from their jobs to their favorite books and movies. Lorenzo was relieved to find that their connection remained strong, even after all these years.

As they chatted, Lorenzo couldn't help but steal glances at her. Her bright blue eyes sparkled in the dim light of the café, and her long, dark hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall. He felt his heart racing with excitement, knowing that he was one step closer to revealing his true feelings.

"Lorenzo?" she said, looking up at him with a curious expression. "You've been awfully quiet lately. Is everything okay?"

Lorenzo hesitated for a moment, unsure of how to respond. But something about her gentle tone put him at ease, and he found himself opening up to her in ways he never had before.

"Everything's fine," he said finally. "I just...I've been thinking a lot about us lately."

Their eyes met, and Lorenzo held his breath, hoping that she would feel the same way. He took a deep breath and leaned in closer, his voice barely above a whisper.

"I think I might be falling for you, Lorenzo Rossi."
