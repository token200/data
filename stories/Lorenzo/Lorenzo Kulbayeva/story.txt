Lorenzo Kulbayeva stood at the edge of the Grand Bazaar, her eyes scanning the labyrinthine streets for any sign of her latest lead. As an independent journalist, she had made a name for herself navigating Istanbul's underworld, but this case was different. This one felt personal.

She had received a cryptic message from a trusted source, hinting at a high-stakes smuggling operation involving Turkish state officials and international arms dealers. Lorenzo knew that the city's opaque bureaucracy would swallow such allegations whole if she didn't move quickly.
