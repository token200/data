Lorenzo Taylor sat alone at the edge of the lake, his feet dangling in the water. The sun had long since set, casting a warm orange glow over the forest. He stared out at the ripples on the surface, his mind a thousand miles away.

It had been three years since the accident. Three years since his best friend, Jake, had died in that car crash on the way to their college reunion. Lorenzo still woke up every morning with the sound of screams and screeching tires echoing in his ears.

As he gazed out at the lake, memories flooded back. He remembered the laughter they shared, the late-night conversations about life and death, the countless hours spent exploring the woods together. Jake had been more than just a friend; he was Lorenzo's brother, his confidant, his soulmate.

Lorenzo's eyes stung as he thought of all the things he wished he could tell Jake now. He wished he could go back in time and try to prevent the accident. But life didn't work that way. All he could do was sit here, surrounded by nature, trying to find some semblance of peace.

A gust of wind rustled the reeds, snapping Lorenzo out of his reverie. He stood up, brush scratchings against his jeans as he began to walk along the lake's edge. The water lapped at his feet, a soothing melody that calmed his racing thoughts.

As he walked, Lorenzo noticed something peculiar – a small wooden box half-buried in the mud. He knelt down, gently prying it open with a finger. Inside, a note was folded into a neat square. The handwriting was Jake's – a message scrawled across the page, full of love and reassurance.

Lorenzo smiled through tears as he unfolded the paper. "I'll always be with you," the note read. "In life, in death, I'll never leave your side."

A lump formed in his throat as he realized that Jake was still with him, even after all this time. The accident had taken him from this world, but it couldn't take away the memories they'd shared, the laughter they'd enjoyed.

Lorenzo closed his eyes, feeling a sense of acceptance wash over him. He knew he would never be the same, but that was okay. Jake's spirit lived on in him – in every laugh, every smile, every tear. And as the stars began to twinkle above, Lorenzo felt a new sense of peace settle into his heart.
