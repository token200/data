Celine Balodis stepped off the crowded train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar streets of her hometown. It had been years since she'd returned to Ashwood, but the memories still lingered like a ghostly presence in the back of her mind.

As she made her way through the bustling streets, Celine Balodis felt a sense of nostalgia wash over her. She thought about the summer she spent as a teenager, exploring the woods and creeks with her best friend, Lucy. The summers they'd spent swimming in the lake, trying to catch fireflies in jars. It was like those carefree days were forever etched into the landscape of Celine Balodis' mind.

Celine Balodis walked past the old diner where she used to work, its neon sign flickering as it beckoned passersby with promises of comfort food and warm conversation. She felt a pang in her chest, remembering the laughter and late-night talks that had taken place within those walls. The memories still lingered, but they no longer brought her the same sense of peace.

As she turned onto Main Street, Celine Balodis spotted the old bookstore where Lucy used to work. It was now run by a new owner, one who seemed to have inherited more than just the building's charm. The sign above the door read "Moonlit Pages," and Celine Balodis couldn't help but wonder what had become of her childhood friend.

She pushed open the door and stepped inside, surrounded by the musty scent of old books and the quiet hum of conversation. Celine Balodis felt a sense of unease as she scanned the shelves for Lucy's name on the staff list. There it was - Lucy Harris, owner of Moonlit Pages. A smile spread across her face, knowing that even if their paths had diverged over the years, some things remained constant.

For a moment, Celine Balodis forgot about the weight of her own life and let herself get lost in the memories of Ashwood's past. It was a fleeting sense of peace, one that would fade with the changing seasons, but it was enough to make her feel like she was home.
