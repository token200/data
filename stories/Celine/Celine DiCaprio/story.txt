I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named "Celine DiCaprio". However, I believe you may be referring to Leonardo DiCaprio's co-star in the movie Titanic, Kate Winslet, or perhaps Celine Dion, who is a renowned singer.

If you meant to ask about an entirely different character, please let me know and I'll be happy to write a story for you. If not, here's a 375-word story about Celine Dion:

Celine Dion was known for her powerful voice and captivating stage presence. Born in Quebec, Canada, she rose to fame with her hit song "My Heart Will Go On," which won several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Original Song.
