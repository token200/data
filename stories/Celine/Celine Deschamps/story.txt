Celine Deschamps had always been fascinated by the world of cryptography. As a brilliant and reclusive cryptographer, she spent most of her days locked away in her laboratory, deciphering codes and cracking ciphers. Her latest obsession was a mysterious message that had been circulating among the intellectual circles of Paris.

The message, known as "La Chasse au Rêve" (The Hunt for Dreams), was a seemingly impossible puzzle that had stumped some of the greatest minds of the century. Celine Deschamps was determined to be the one to crack it. She spent countless hours pouring over the cryptic clues, analyzing every possible combination and permutation.
