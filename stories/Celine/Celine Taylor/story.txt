As she ordered a whiskey on the rocks, Celine Taylor's gaze fell upon a familiar figure sitting in the corner. It was Jack, her old friend and fellow musician. They had grown up together, sharing their dreams of stardom and exploring the city's hidden corners. Now, as adults, they continued to support each other's endeavors.

"Hey, Celt," Jack called out, his voice low and smooth over the din of the club.

Celine Taylor smiled, making her way towards him. "Hey, Jazzman."

Their conversation flowed effortlessly, a comfortable dance of reminiscences and laughter. As they chatted, Celine Taylor couldn't help but think about her upcoming gig at the local coffee shop. She was determined to bring her music to a wider audience, to share her vision with those who would appreciate it.

"You're still got it, Celt," he said, his words carrying a sincerity that made her smile.
