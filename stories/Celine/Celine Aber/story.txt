Celine Elara Aber stepped into the grand ballroom, her eyes scanning the sea of familiar faces. As the daughter of a wealthy industrialist, she had grown accustomed to being in the spotlight, but tonight was different. Tonight, she was attending her former lover's wedding.

Celine's thoughts drifted back to her time with Ryder, the charming and carefree artist who had once captured her heart. Their whirlwind romance had been filled with laughter, adventure, and passion, but ultimately, it had ended in a blaze of drama and heartbreak.

As she made her way through the crowd, Celine's gaze locked onto Ryder, standing at the bar with his groom-to-be by his side. She felt a pang of nostalgia wash over her, remembering the countless nights they had spent exploring the city together, hand in hand.

Celine's eyes narrowed as she watched Ryder laughing and smiling with his future bride, feeling a twinge of jealousy. How had it come to this? She had thought they would be happy together, but their relationship had ultimately been too much for both of them.

Just then, Ryder caught sight of her across the room and made his way over, a warm smile spreading across his face. "Celine! It's so great to see you," he said, embracing her in a tight hug.

For a moment, Celine forgot about the tension between them and let herself be swept up in the nostalgia of their past. But as she pulled back and smiled politely, she knew it was time to move on. She couldn't stay stuck in the past forever.

As the night wore on, Celine mingled with the other guests, making polite conversation and pretending that everything was fine. But deep down, she knew that she still had feelings for Ryder, even if they were no longer together. And as she watched him exchange vows with his bride, she couldn't help but wonder what could have been.
