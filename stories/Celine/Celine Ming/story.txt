Celine Ming was a renowned artist known for her vibrant and eclectic style. Born to Chinese immigrant parents in New York City, she grew up surrounded by the sounds and smells of Chinatown. Her early exposure to different cultures had a profound impact on her art, which often incorporated elements of Asian mythology and symbolism.

As a child, Celine spent hours sketching the intricate carvings that adorned the temples and markets of her neighborhood.

Critics praised her ability to blend traditional Asian motifs with modern techniques, creating pieces that were both timeless and cutting-edge.
