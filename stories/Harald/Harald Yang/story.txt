Harald Yang walked into the small, cluttered bookstore, scanning the shelves for any sign of what he was looking for. As the owner's son, Harald had always been passionate about literature and history, and his father's store, "Past Pages," was a treasure trove of knowledge.

As he made his way through the narrow aisles, Harald's eyes landed on an old leather-bound tome, adorned with intricate gold filigree. He picked it up, feeling the weight of the book in his hands, and began to flip through its yellowed pages.

"Ah, you've found something," his father called out from behind the counter.

Harald turned to see his father, also known as Mr. Yang, emerging from the back room with a warm smile on his face. "What is it?" he asked, eyeing the book in Harald's hands.

"It's an old manuscript," Harald replied, his eyes scanning the pages. "I think it might be a rare edition of 'The Tales of the Mongols.'"

Mr. Yang nodded, his eyes lighting up with interest. "Yes, that's one of my favorite books. I used to read it all the time when I was a student."

As they delved deeper into the book together, Harald's mind began to wander back to his own studies at university. He had always been fascinated by Asian history and culture, and he hoped to one day write a thesis on the subject.

"Father," Harald said, as they sat down at a small table in the corner of the store, "I've been thinking about my research paper. Do you think I should focus on the Mongol Empire or the Tang Dynasty?"

Mr. Yang chuckled, his eyes twinkling with amusement. "That's a tough decision, but ultimately, it depends on what you're passionate about."

As they continued to discuss Harald's academic pursuits, the store began to fill with customers, drawn in by the warm atmosphere and the scent of old books. Despite the chaos, Harald felt at peace, surrounded by the knowledge and wisdom that his father had accumulated over the years.

As he finished up his conversation with Mr. Yang, Harald couldn't help but feel grateful for the guidance and support that his father had always provided him. He knew that he owed a great debt to Mr. Yang, whose passion for learning and history had inspired him to pursue his own academic dreams.
