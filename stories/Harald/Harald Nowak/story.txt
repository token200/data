Born into a family of modest means, Harald's love for history was forged in the dusty libraries and cramped classrooms of his childhood. His parents, though poor, encouraged his curiosity, providing him with worn copies of Dickens and Tolkien that fueled his imagination. As he grew older, Harald's fascination with the past only deepened, driving him to pursue a career in archaeology.
