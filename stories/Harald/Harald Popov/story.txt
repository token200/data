Harald Georg Ivanovich Popov was not your average Russian émigré. Born to a family of modest means in Moscow, Harald's early life was marked by hardship and determination. As a young boy, he spent hours watching American movies in the local park cinema, dreaming of adventures beyond the Iron Curtain.

After completing his education, Harald joined the Soviet Union's elite intelligence agency, the KGB. For years, he worked undercover, gathering intel on Western affairs and reporting back to Moscow. But as the Cold War thawed, Harald began to question the morality of his work. He became disillusioned with the regime's brutality and decided to make a change.

Harald quit the KGB and, using his skills and knowledge, began working for a prominent Western intelligence agency. His expertise in Russian politics and culture proved invaluable as he helped navigate the complexities of post-Soviet Russia.

Years passed, and Harald became known within the agency as a master of disguise and deception. He took on various personas, from a befuddled tourist to a high-society businessman, allowing him to move undetected through Moscow's elite circles.

One day, Harald was approached by a former KGB colleague with an offer he couldn't refuse: infiltrate a powerful Russian oligarch's inner circle and uncover evidence of corruption. The stakes were high, but Harald accepted the challenge. Donning a tailored suit and adopting the persona of a wealthy entrepreneur, he waltzed into the oligarch's orbit.

As Harald mingled with the oligarch's associates, he gathered crucial information about their dealings in the energy sector. His findings would blow the lid off a massive scandal, but at what cost? Would Harald be able to escape without being discovered, or would his past as a KGB agent catch up with him?

Only time would tell if Harald Popov's latest assignment would prove his most treacherous yet.
