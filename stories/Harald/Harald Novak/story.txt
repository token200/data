Intrigued by her passion, Harald approached her cautiously, and soon found himself entwined in a world of vibrant colors and raw emotion.

The girl's name was Akua, and she became Harald's protégée, teaching him the ways of photography from a child's perspective. Together, they traveled the continent, capturing moments that spoke to the heart of the human experience.
