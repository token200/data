Renata Jansone stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the quaint station for any sign of her host. It was a chilly autumn morning in the small town of Riga, Latvia, where she had agreed to spend several weeks working as an exchange student.

As a child, Renata had always been fascinated by the history and culture of Eastern Europe. Growing up in the United States, she felt a deep connection to her Lithuanian heritage, which her parents had encouraged her to explore. Now, at 20 years old, she was finally taking the leap to immerse herself in the language and customs of Latvia.

Renata's host family, the Kozlovas, greeted her warmly with hugs and smiles. Her host mother, Inga, led her to a cozy apartment just a short walk from the train station. As they sat down to a traditional Latvian breakfast of zeppelins and dark rye bread, Renata felt a sense of excitement wash over her.

Over the next few weeks, Renata settled into a routine of attending language classes, helping out at a local bakery, and exploring the town with her host family. She marveled at the Baroque architecture, sampled local delicacies like balties and aukstā kāpostu zupa, and even tried her hand at playing the traditional Latvian instrument, the dūdas.

As she navigated the ups and downs of everyday life in Latvia, Renata found herself growing more confident in her language skills and deepening her connection to her heritage. She knew that when she returned home to the United States, she would carry a piece of Riga with her – the warmth of Inga's hospitality, the beauty of the Latvian coastline, and the rich history that flowed through every stone.

Renata Jansone smiled to herself as she settled into her new life in Latvia. She knew that this experience was just the beginning of an incredible journey, one that would take her from the familiar streets of Riga back to the world beyond.
