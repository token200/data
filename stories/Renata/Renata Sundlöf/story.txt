Renata Sundlöf stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the dimly lit station. It had been years since she'd last set foot in her hometown of Stockholm, Sweden, but the memories still lingered. As a young journalist, Renata had once been fascinated by the darker corners of the city, where corruption and crime thrived.

Now, as a seasoned reporter for the Swedish press, Renata was tasked with investigating a series of high-profile disappearances in the very same neighborhoods she had explored as a teenager.
