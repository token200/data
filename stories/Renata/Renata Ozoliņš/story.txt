I couldn't find any information on the individual you're referring to. Could you provide more context or details about who Renata Ozoliņš is? 

However, if you'd like I can create a short story based on a fictional person with that name.

Here's a 400-word short story about a fictional character named Renata Ozoliņš:

Renata Ozoliņš was a brilliant and reclusive mathematician who had dedicated her life to unlocking the secrets of chaos theory. Her unorthodox methods and razor-sharp mind had earned her both admiration and disdain within the academic community.

One fateful evening, as the snowflakes gently fell onto the quiet streets of Riga, Renata received an unexpected visit from a young woman named Aiva. Aiva was a talented mathematician who had grown up idolizing Renata's work and sought to learn from her.

As they sipped tea in Renata's cluttered study, Aiva marveled at the vast array of mathematical texts and peculiar artifacts scattered about. Renata smiled knowingly, as if revealing a treasured secret.

"You see, Aiva," Renata began, "the universe is governed by an intricate web of patterns and unpredictabilities. It's only through embracing this complexity that we can truly understand its underlying structure."

Aiva listened intently, her eyes lighting up with excitement. Renata continued to expound upon the subject, delving into the intricacies of fractals and strange attractors.

As the night wore on, Aiva began to grasp the sheer beauty and power of chaos theory. It was as if a door had swung open in her mind, revealing new avenues for exploration and discovery.

Renata watched with satisfaction as Aiva's face transformed from curiosity to awe. She knew that she had passed on a piece of herself, igniting a flame of passion and creativity within the young mathematician.

As Aiva prepared to leave, Renata handed her a small notebook filled with cryptic equations and doodles. "Solve these," she said, her eyes twinkling with mischief. "And you'll unlock secrets that lie beyond the realm of conventional mathematics."

Aiva smiled, feeling both thrilled and intimidated by the challenge ahead. As she departed into the snowy night, Renata knew that a new generation of mathematicians had been inspired to follow in her footsteps. The snowflakes continued to fall gently, casting a serene silence over the city, as if blessing the union between human ingenuity and mathematical discovery.
