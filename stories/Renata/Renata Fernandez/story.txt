Growing up in a small village surrounded by rolling hills and lush green forests, she spent countless hours watching her grandmother, Abuela Sofia, shape clay into beautiful works of art. As Renata Fernandez grew older, her passion for pottery only intensified, and she decided to pursue it as a career.

After completing her formal education, Renata Fernandez set out on a journey to learn the traditional techniques of her ancestors.
