As they delved deeper into Sophie's psyche, Valérie noticed an uncanny resemblance between their shared struggles and those of her own past.

Growing up in a tumultuous household, Valérie had learned to mask her true emotions behind a façade of confidence. But with each passing year, the weight of that secret grew heavier.
