Valérie Wei, or Lee Wei as she was known in her native China, sat alone at her desk, staring blankly at the computer screen in front of her. A successful businesswoman in her late 20s, Valérie had it all - a high-powered job at a top-tier firm, a sleek apartment in the heart of the city, and a social calendar that was always full.

But as she gazed around her immaculately decorated office, Valérie couldn't shake off the feeling of emptiness that had been growing inside her for months. She had always been driven by her career, never taking time to pursue her own passions or interests. Her relationships were shallow and fleeting, and her friends seemed to be just as caught up in their own lives.

As she scrolled through social media, Valérie couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy towards the people who seemed to have it all together. They were the ones with the beautiful families, the exotic vacations, and the meaningful connections with others.

But what about her? What was she truly happy for?

Valérie took a deep breath and closed her laptop. She needed to take a step back and reevaluate her life. She decided to start by taking a break from work and focusing on herself. She booked a ticket to Taiwan, where she had family and fond memories of childhood.

As she stepped off the plane in Taipei, Valérie felt a sense of freedom wash over her. The air was cooler and cleaner here than in the city, and the sounds of the language were music to her ears. She spent the next few days exploring the city, talking to her family, and practicing her Mandarin.

For the first time in years, Valérie felt alive. She began to see that there was more to life than just a paycheck and a title. She started to think about what truly made her happy - painting, cooking, hiking...

As she stood on the deck of her aunt's old wooden house, watching the sunset over the rolling hills of rural Taiwan, Valérie realized that she had been living someone else's dream for far too long. It was time to create her own.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Valérie Wei began to rediscover herself, piece by piece. She started taking art classes, joining cooking clubs, and exploring the outdoors. And as she did, she felt a weight lifting off her shoulders, like the first wisps of fog were lifting from her soul.
