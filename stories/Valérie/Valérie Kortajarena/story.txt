I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Valérie Kortajarena. It is possible that this character does not exist in my knowledge database.

However, I did find information on a French singer and actress named Valérie Korfajian, whose full name is Valérie Gélinas Korfajian, but I couldn't verify if she was also known as Valérie Kortajarena. If you could provide more context or clarify which character you would like me to write about, I'd be happy to try and assist you.

If you're interested, I can create a fictional story about a character named Valérie Kortajarena instead. Please let me know if that's what you'd prefer.
