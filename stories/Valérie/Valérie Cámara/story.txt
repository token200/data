Valérie Cámara sat at her desk, sipping her coffee and staring out the window at the Parisian streets below. As the owner of a small, independent bookstore, she had spent countless hours surrounded by pages of knowledge, watching as people came and went, seeking answers to their questions.

A Spanish woman in her mid-thirties with piercing green eyes and curly dark hair, Valérie was known throughout the city for her vast knowledge of literature and her ability to recommend just the right book to each customer. Her passion for reading had been ignited by her abuela, who had passed down to her a love of words and stories that had only grown stronger over the years.

As she scanned the shelves, Valérie's mind began to wander to her latest acquisition - a rare edition of Lorca's poetry. She had spent hours searching for it, tracking down leads and scouring second-hand bookstores until finally, it was hers. The feel of its worn leather binding in her hands, the scent of old paper, sent shivers down her spine.

Just then, the door to the store swung open, admitting a young man with a sheepish grin on his face. "Excuse me," he said, looking around at the stacks of books, "I'm trying to find something specific. I've heard it's here."

Valérie smiled, recognizing the look of desperation in his eyes. She led him to a shelf tucked away in a corner of the store, and began to search through the spines of the books. As they browsed, Valérie learned that the young man was writing a thesis on modern Spanish literature, and was searching for a particular author.

Their conversation flowed easily, with Valérie sharing her own love of poetry and recommending books that had inspired her over the years. The young man listened intently, his eyes lighting up as she spoke, until finally he found what he was looking for - a rare collection of works by one of Lorca's contemporaries.

As they packed the book into a bag, Valérie noticed something about the young man - a small tattoo on his wrist, shaped like a pair of wings. "What's that?" she asked, curiosity getting the better of her.

The young man smiled, and for a moment, his eyes seemed to sparkle with mischief. "It's my abuela's," he said. "She taught me to find solace in stories when I was feeling lost."

In that moment, something clicked for Valérie - she saw the world through the young man's eyes, as someone who had found comfort in the written word. And she knew that this was exactly what her bookstore was for - a sanctuary, where people could come and lose themselves in pages of words.
