Valérie Palmas stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him at the corner table by the window, nursing a cup of coffee and staring out at the rain-soaked streets.

It had been months since they'd last seen each other. Months since she'd left Paris, leaving behind the life she knew to start anew in New York. The memories still lingered, though - the laughter, the arguments, the whispered secrets shared only when no one was looking.

As she made her way through the crowded space, Valérie's mind wandered back to the nights they spent exploring Montmartre, hand in hand, under the twinkling lights of the city. She remembered the thrill of discovering new art galleries and cafes, the way their conversations flowed effortlessly from politics to poetry.

She pushed open the door, and her eyes locked onto his profile. The lines on his face seemed deeper now, etched by time and worry. But as she approached, he looked up, a flicker of recognition crossing his features.

"Valérie," he said softly, standing up to greet her.

They hugged tightly, holding each other for what felt like an eternity before releasing, their arms still wrapped around each other's waists.

"How was the trip?" he asked, leading her to the table by the window.

Valérie took a seat, ordering a coffee and listening intently as he recounted his own travels - stories of protests and rallies, of struggles and triumphs. She listened attentively, her eyes never leaving his face, feeling the same connection that had once drawn them together still simmering beneath the surface.

As they spoke, Valérie noticed something new in him - a quiet confidence, a certain gravitas that came with experience. But it was there that she saw glimpses of their past - the laughter, the fights, the late-night conversations - all coming alive again in this stranger who now stood before her.

The rain drummed against the pavement outside, and for Valérie, time seemed to have slowed down. She knew that no matter where life took them next, a part of her would always be tied to this city, to these streets, and to the person sitting across from her, his eyes locked on hers with an unspoken promise.

As they parted ways at the café door, Valérie felt a familiar ache in her chest. She knew she'd have to return home eventually, but for now, for tonight, she was content to simply exist alongside him once more, as if no distance had ever separated them.
