Valérie Viljanen was a woman with a passion for photography that knew no bounds. Born and raised in Helsinki, Finland, she had always been fascinated by the world around her, capturing its beauty through the lens of her camera.

As a child, Valérie would spend hours exploring the frozen lakes and snowy forests of Lapland, camera in hand, snapping pictures of the stunning winter landscapes. Her parents, both artists themselves, encouraged her creativity, providing her with a childhood filled with art supplies and creative outlets.

As she grew older, Valérie's love for photography only deepened. She studied at the prestigious Finnish Institute of Photography, honing her skills and learning from some of the best in the business. After graduating, she set out to make a name for herself in the industry, traveling to some of the most beautiful places on earth.

From the sun-kissed beaches of Santorini to the towering mountains of New Zealand, Valérie's camera captured it all. She was drawn to the people and places that seemed to hold secrets and stories waiting to be told. Her photographs were more than just pretty images – they were window into another world, a glimpse into the lives of those she met along the way.

Valérie's photography career took off, with her work appearing in top publications around the globe. She was soon in high demand, working with clients from all walks of life. But despite her success, Valérie remained true to herself and her art, always seeking out new experiences and inspiration.

One day, while on assignment in Africa, Valérie came across a young girl, no more than ten years old, with a camera of her own. The two struck up a conversation, and before long, they were sharing stories and laughter together. For Valérie, it was a moment that reminded her why she did what she did – to connect with others, to tell their stories, and to capture the beauty of the world around her.

As she looked through the lens of her camera, Valérie knew that she had found her calling in life. She was Valérie Viljanen, photographer extraordinaire, and she was living her dream every day.
