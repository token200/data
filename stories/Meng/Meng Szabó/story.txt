Meng Szabó stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit café, shaking the water from her hair. She slid onto a stool at the bar and ordered a hot chocolate, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face.

It was a typical Tuesday evening in Budapest, with the city's intellectuals and artists gathered to discuss the latest literary works. Meng Szabó, a renowned writer herself, had come to engage in a heated debate about the role of free speech in society.

As she sipped her hot chocolate, Meng Szabó noticed a figure sitting at a corner table, scribbling away in a notebook. It was her long-time friend and fellow writer, László Kossuth. The two had met while studying at the University of Budapest, bonding over their love of literature and poetry.

Meng Szabó made her way over to László's table, exchanging warm smiles with him as she sat down. They spent the next hour discussing everything from the merits of socialism to the latest developments in the avant-garde movement. Meng Szabó was struck by how much they had both evolved as writers since their university days.

As the evening wore on, a group of radical thinkers arrived, armed with manifestos and pamphlets. They began to disrupt the discussion, loudly proclaiming the need for revolution and social change. Meng Szabó watched from her seat, observing as László remained calm and collected, using his quick wit to defuse the tension.

Despite the chaos, Meng Szabó felt a sense of pride and solidarity with her fellow writers. She knew that their work was not just about expressing themselves, but also about challenging the status quo and pushing the boundaries of what was possible. As she finished her hot chocolate and prepared to leave, Meng Szabó turned to László and smiled. "It's times like these," she said, "that remind me why we started writing in the first place."
