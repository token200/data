Meng Meier stepped off the train and onto the platform, gazing out at the familiar scenery of her hometown. The mist-shrouded mountains rose up in the distance, their peaks still capped with snow from last winter's storm. As she walked through the station, Meng's eyes scanned the crowded square, searching for a glimpse of familiar faces.

It had been ten years since Meng left her hometown to pursue a life in the city. She'd returned after her mother passed away, and it was here that she hoped to find some sense of peace and closure. Her father still lived in their ancestral home on the outskirts of town, but Meng had found it difficult to bear the silence of his grief.

As she walked through the village, people nodded and smiled at her, but none seemed willing to talk about old times or share stories from when Meng was a child. She knew that everyone was still hurting, and it would take time for them to open up again.

Meng made her way up the hill, following the familiar path that led to her childhood home. The house looked the same as she remembered it – the worn wooden doors, the overgrown garden, and the quietness that seemed to swallow everything whole.

She opened the door, hesitating for a moment before stepping inside. Her father was sitting in his favorite armchair by the window, staring out at nothingness. Meng cleared her throat to announce her presence, and he turned slowly towards her.

"Meng," he said softly, a faint smile on his face. "I've been waiting."

They spent the rest of the day together – talking about old memories, sharing stories from when she was away, and laughing at things that only they would understand. It wasn't easy, but it felt like a small victory.

As the sun began to set, Meng looked out the window at the mountains, feeling a sense of peace settle over her. She knew it wouldn't be overnight – there was still so much healing to do – but for now, she could breathe again.

"I'll stay for a while," she said finally, turning back towards her father. "I'll help with the garden and take care of things around here."

Her father nodded, his eyes warm with gratitude. "Thank you, Meng. I need it."
