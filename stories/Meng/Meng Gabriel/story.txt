Meng Gabriel stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the cool evening air hitting them like a slap in the face. It was a sensation they'd grown to love over the years, one that always seemed to clear their head before the chaos of the day began.

As they made their way through the station, Meng's eyes scanned the crowds, searching for a familiar face. They spotted their friend, Lila, standing by the café, sipping on a cup of coffee and reading a book. Meng quickened their pace, a smile spreading across their face as they approached.

"Meng Gabriel!" Lila exclaimed, looking up from her book and dropping it onto the table. "It's been ages! How was your journey?"

Meng shrugged, taking a seat beside Lila. "Long, but I'm here now. What about you? How's life been treating you?"

Lila leaned back in her chair, a faraway look in her eyes. "You know me – always busy with something or other. But it's not all bad. I've been working on some new projects and I'm excited to share them with you soon."

Meng nodded enthusiastically, their eyes lighting up with interest. They'd always known Lila to be a creative force to be reckoned with, and they couldn't wait to see what she had cooking.

As they chatted, Meng's thoughts began to wander back to their own life. It was one of quiet routine, spent working on their latest art project in the studio above their small apartment. They'd been feeling a bit stuck lately, but being back in the city and surrounded by familiar faces always seemed to spark something new.

Lila noticed the far-off look in Meng's eyes and reached out, placing a gentle hand on their arm. "Hey, Gabriel? You okay?"

Meng snapped back to attention, smiling sheepishly at Lila. "Yeah, I'm fine. Just a bit lost in thought, that's all."

Lila smiled, releasing Meng's arm. "Sometimes getting lost can be exactly what you need. We'll figure it out together, okay?"

Meng nodded, feeling a sense of gratitude towards their friend. They knew they could always count on Lila to have their back – and to help them find their way when things got tough.
