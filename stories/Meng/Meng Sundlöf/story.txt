Meng Sundlöf stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the quaint station that seemed frozen in time. As a travel writer, she had seen her fair share of rural towns, but there was something about this place that called to her. The sign above the station read "Welcome to Ravenshire" and Meng felt an inexplicable sense of belonging.

She had always been drawn to the stories of Ravenshire's history, particularly the legend of the old mill on the outskirts of town. Rumors swirled that it was cursed, but Meng wasn't one to believe in ghost stories. She was more of a skeptic, always searching for a rational explanation behind the myths and legends.

As she made her way through the station, Meng noticed a small café tucked away in a corner. The sign above the door read "The Ravenshire Reader" and Meng felt a pang of curiosity. She pushed open the door and was enveloped in the scent of old books and coffee.

 Inside, the café was dimly lit, with rows of wooden shelves lining the walls. Meng's eyes landed on a tattered leather-bound book with her name embossed on the cover – a gift from her editor, who knew of her fascination with Ravenshire's history. The owner, an elderly man with kind eyes, smiled at her and introduced himself as Finn.

Over a cup of strong coffee, Finn regaled Meng with stories of Ravenshire's past, including the legend of the old mill. As she listened, Meng began to notice strange details that seemed too good (or bad) to be true. It was as if the town itself was trying to tell her something – but what?

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over Ravenshire, Meng thanked Finn for his hospitality and stepped out into the cool evening air. She felt a sense of peace wash over her, as if she had finally found the connection she had been searching for.

As she walked back to the station, Meng couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. She glanced around, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. It wasn't until she caught a glimpse of herself in a shop window reflection that she noticed something peculiar – a small tattoo of an old mill on her wrist, which she had no memory of getting.

Meng Sundlöf shook her head, chuckling to herself as she wondered if the town was playing tricks on her mind. But deep down, she knew that Ravenshire was trying to tell her something – and she was determined to listen.
