Meng Andersen walked into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a private investigator specializing in supernatural cases, she had seen it all – from ghostly apparitions to demonic possessions.

She spotted a familiar figure sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of black coffee. It was Axel, her old friend and sometimes ally. Meng made her way over to him, her heels clicking on the tile floor.

"Meng Andersen," Axel said, standing up as she approached. "I wasn't expecting you."

"Just dropping by to see if you've heard anything interesting," Meng replied, taking a seat across from him.

Axel leaned in, his voice barely above a whisper. "I have. There's been a string of strange occurrences at the old mansion on Elm Street. People are reporting seeing shadowy figures and hearing disembodied whispers."

Meng's ears perked up. This sounded like the kind of case she was made for. She pulled out her notebook and began to scribble down notes.

"I'll take a look," she said, tucking the notebook away. "But I'm going in alone. You're not exactly... stable enough for this sort of thing."

Axel's face fell, but he nodded curtly. Meng knew he would understand. He had been through some rough times himself – mental health issues and all that.

She left the café, her mind already racing with theories and possibilities. She arrived at the mansion just as it was getting dark, the shadows cast by the setting sun making everything seem even more ominous.

As she stepped inside, she felt a chill run down her spine. This was going to be a long night. But Meng Andersen was ready for whatever lay ahead.
