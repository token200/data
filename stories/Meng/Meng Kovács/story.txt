Assuming Meng Kovács is a fictional character, here's a 400-word short story:

Meng Kovács had always been fascinated by the mysteries of the universe. As a child, he spent hours gazing up at the stars, wondering what lay beyond the reaches of his small town in rural Hungary. As he grew older, his curiosity only deepened, leading him to pursue a career in astrophysics.

Despite the skepticism of some of his peers, Meng remained dedicated to his studies, pouring over textbooks and attending every lecture he could find. His hard work paid off when he was accepted into the prestigious Budapest University of Technology, where he spent several years studying the behavior of black holes.

It wasn't until after completing his Ph.D. that Meng's true passion began to take shape. He became obsessed with a particular phenomenon known as "fast radio bursts" (FRBs), brief and intense pulses of energy emanating from distant galaxies. While other scientists saw FRBs as mere anomalies, Meng was convinced they held the key to unlocking the secrets of the cosmos.

For years, Meng poured over data from various observatories around the world, searching for patterns and connections that might reveal the source of these enigmatic bursts. His colleagues began to question his sanity, but he refused to be deterred.

One fateful night, after months of tireless work, Meng finally cracked the code. He had identified a correlation between FRBs and the rotation rate of neutron stars. The implications were staggering – the universe was not as quiet as previously thought, and there were forces beyond human comprehension at play.

As news of his discovery spread, Meng became an overnight sensation in the scientific community. While some hailed him as a hero, others criticized his methods and conclusions. But Meng knew that he had only scratched the surface of a much larger truth – one that would take humanity centuries to fully comprehend.

For now, he was content with the fact that he had unlocked a piece of the universe's greatest secret, and that the mysteries still waiting to be solved would fuel his journey for years to come.
