Here's a 375-word story about Meng Põld:

In the quaint Estonian village of Põlva, a young girl named Meng Põld lived with her wise and aged grandmother, Els. She was known among the villagers for her extraordinary gift – she could communicate with animals. Meng Põld spent most of her days exploring the surrounding forests and meadows, learning about the intricate lives of creatures great and small.

One sunny afternoon, as Meng Põld wandered through the forest, she stumbled upon a lost fox kit. The little ball of fur trembled with fear, its bright eyes fixed on Meng Põld's warm smile. Without hesitation, she knelt down beside the kit and gently stroked its soft fur. To her surprise, the kit began to purr contentedly in her arms.

As the days passed, Meng Põld found herself spending more time with the fox kit, whom she named Võru. Together, they explored the forest, learning about the secret lives of its inhabitants. The villagers soon took notice of Meng Põld's extraordinary gift and began to seek her help in resolving disputes between humans and animals.

One day, a group of farmers approached Els, begging for her granddaughter's assistance. A herd of deer had been terrorizing their crops, and they were at a loss for how to deal with the situation. Without hesitation, Meng Põld agreed to help. She spent hours talking to the deer, understanding their reasons for venturing into the farm's fields.

Moved by the deer's plight, Meng Põld devised a plan to redirect them to a nearby nature reserve. The farmers were grateful, and from that day on, Meng Põld was hailed as a hero in the village of Põlva. Her grandmother, Els, couldn't be prouder of her granddaughter, knowing that Meng Põld's gift would continue to bring people and animals together for generations to come.
