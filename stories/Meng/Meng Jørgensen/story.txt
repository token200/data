Meng Jørgensen stepped out of his small Copenhagen apartment and into the chilly winter morning. He wrapped his scarf tighter around his neck, the same way he had every morning for the past decade. As a freelance journalist, he was accustomed to working from home, but there was something about this particular article that needed to be written in person.

Meng Jørgensen made his way to the harbor, the sound of seagulls and gentle lapping of the waves against the shore soothing his creative nerves. He had been investigating a series of small, unexplained accidents involving cargo ships and fishermen, all of which seemed to point to a larger conspiracy.

As he walked along the dock, Meng Jørgensen noticed an elderly fisherman watching him from under a weathered cap. The old man's eyes narrowed, and for a moment, they locked gazes. Meng felt a shiver run down his spine, as if the fisherman was trying to convey a message.

He approached the old man, who nodded in acknowledgment. "I'm looking for information," Meng said quietly. "About the accidents on the ships."

The fisherman hesitated before speaking in hushed tones. "They're not accidents, no one tells us that. It's... it's sabotage, by a company called Nordic Shipping. They've been taking bribes from the government to look the other way."

Meng Jørgensen's mind racing with questions and possibilities. He pulled out his notebook and began scribbling notes as quickly as possible.

The fisherman handed him an old newspaper clipping before disappearing into the crowd. Meng unfolded the paper, revealing a faded headline: "Tragedy Strikes in North Sea".

He felt a surge of determination coursing through his veins. This was it – the lead he had been searching for. He tucked the clipping into his pocket and continued along the dock, lost in thought.

As he walked back to his apartment, Meng Jørgensen couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. The old fisherman's words lingered in his mind: "They're not accidents." What did it mean? And who was behind it all?

The Copenhagen morning had turned into a mystery, and Meng Jørgensen was ready to take on whatever came next.
