Meng Mercier strolled through the bustling streets of Paris, her dark hair tied back in a sleek ponytail and her bright green eyes scanning the crowds with a mixture of curiosity and caution. As a private investigator, she had seen her fair share of shady characters and seedy dealings, but there was something about this particular case that had her on edge.

Her client, a wealthy businessman named Henry Langley, had hired her to investigate the disappearance of his daughter, Sophia. The police were stumped, and Langley was convinced that Meng Mercier was the only one who could uncover the truth. Meng had agreed to take the case, mainly because she owed Langley a favor from a previous job.

As she turned a corner onto Rue de Rivoli, Meng spotted a small caf√© where Sophia had last been seen. She pushed open the door and slipped inside, her eyes scanning the crowded room for any sign of trouble. The patrons were a mix of tourists and locals, all sipping coffee and chatting quietly.

Meng Mercier spotted a young woman with long blonde hair sitting in the corner, sipping a cup of black coffee. There was something familiar about the woman's features, but Meng couldn't quite place her. She made her way over to the table, her eyes locked on the woman's face.

"Can I help you?" the woman asked, looking up from her phone.

"I'm looking for information," Meng replied, pulling out a photo of Sophia. "Do you recognize this woman?"

The woman's expression changed from boredom to surprise, and she nodded slowly. "Yes, I know who that is. Her name is Sophia Langley."

Meng Mercier felt a surge of excitement. She had finally found a lead in the case. "What do you know about her disappearance?" she asked, pulling out her notebook.

The woman hesitated before speaking, her voice barely above a whisper. Meng Mercier leaned in, her eyes locked on the woman's face, ready to listen and take notes.
