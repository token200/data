Meng Ming-che was a name whispered among the old-timers in the small village of Tai Shan. It was said that he was a master of the ancient art of Shaolin Kung Fu, trained by his grandfather under the legendary monk, Brother Li. The villagers believed that on quiet nights, you could hear the sound of wooden clappers echoing through the bamboo forests, signaling that Meng Ming-che was practicing his techniques.

Meng was indeed an enigmatic figure. He wore a long, dark cloak with a silver brooch at his neck, and his face remained shrouded in shadow, even when he smiled. Some said he was cursed, others claimed he was blessed. But one thing was certain – his eyes seemed to see right through you.

As the story went, Meng Ming-che had once saved the village from a deadly plague that swept through Tai Shan like wildfire. He disappeared into the night, leaving behind only his wooden clappers as a calling card. The villagers whispered that he had single-handedly purged the disease from their homes, but where did he go after that? No one knew.

Years passed, and Meng Ming-che became a myth, a figure of reverence and fear. Some claimed to have caught glimpses of him in the misty dawn, his movements swift and silent as a ghost. Others spoke of hearing his voice whispering through the trees, offering advice to those who sought it.

One day, a young girl named Mei-ling wandered into the bamboo forests, searching for her lost puppy. As she walked deeper into the dense undergrowth, she heard the soft thud-thud-thud of wooden clappers. She followed the sound and found Meng Ming-che standing before her, his eyes glinting like stars in the fading light.

"Why have you come here?" Mei-ling asked, trembling.

"I've been watching over this place," Meng replied, his voice low and soothing. "This village needs protection, just as it did years ago."

Without another word, Meng Ming-che turned and vanished into the shadows, leaving Mei-ling to find her way back home alone. From that day on, some said that whenever the wind rustled through the bamboo forests, you could still hear the faint sound of wooden clappers – a reminder that Meng Ming-che was always watching over Tai Shan, his eyes ever vigilant and his spirit unbroken.
