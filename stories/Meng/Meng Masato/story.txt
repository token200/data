Meng Masato was known for his unorthodox approach to solving problems. As a renowned detective, he had a knack for thinking outside the box and questioning everything. His colleagues often found themselves bewildered by his methods, but they couldn't deny the results.

One stormy evening, Meng Masato received a visit from the police commissioner himself. "Masato-san, we have a case that needs your unique skills," he said, handing over a file with a mysterious photo inside. The image depicted a young woman with a scar above her left eyebrow, and no other identifying features.

Meng Masato's eyes narrowed as he examined the picture. He had a feeling that this was more than just another run-of-the-mill missing person case. After some deliberation, he decided to pay a visit to his trusted informant, Old Tanaka. The elderly man had a talent for gathering information and often provided valuable insights.

Over steaming cups of green tea, Meng Masato shared the photo with Old Tanaka, who listened intently before responding, "I think I know someone who might be connected to this case." A few minutes later, he returned with a younger woman who introduced herself as Emiko. She had an uncanny resemblance to the missing girl and possessed the same scar above her eyebrow.

Meng Masato's mind began racing as he pieced together the fragments of information. He discovered that Emiko was involved in a local gang, but it wasn't until he spoke with Old Tanaka again that he uncovered the motive behind the disappearance. It turned out that the gang had been extorting money from small businesses in the area, and the missing girl had stumbled upon their operation.

With his investigation in full swing, Meng Masato worked tirelessly to gather evidence and track down the perpetrators. After several sleepless nights, he finally identified the key players and staged a daring sting operation. The gang members were arrested, and the missing girl was safely returned to her relieved family.

As the news of the successful case spread, Commissioner Tanaka approached Meng Masato with a rare smile. "Masato-san, you have done it again." Meng Masato smiled humbly, knowing that his unique approach had cracked the case wide open. He couldn't wait for the next challenge to come his way.
