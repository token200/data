I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Meng Liepiņa. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created for a specific purpose.

However, I can create a story about a character with the surname Liepiņa:

In the small town of Riga, Latvia, a young artist named Mārtiņš Liepiņa had always been fascinated by the stories of his ancestors. His great-grandfather, a skilled woodcarver, had created intricate wooden figurines that were highly prized in the local market.

Mārtiņš Liepiņa followed in his great-grandfather's footsteps, spending countless hours honing his craft in the town's woodworking shop. As he grew older, Mārtiņš became increasingly interested in the art of folk music, often playing traditional Latvian instruments during festivals and celebrations.

One day, a local collector approached Mārtiņš with an offer to create a series of wooden sculptures inspired by Latvia's rich cultural heritage. Mārtiņš Liepiņa was thrilled at the opportunity and set to work on his new project, pouring all of his energy into crafting beautiful and intricate pieces that would showcase the beauty of Latvian culture.

As he worked, Mārtiņš couldn't help but think of his great-grandfather, who had inspired him to take up woodworking in the first place. He felt a sense of pride knowing that he was carrying on a tradition that had been passed down through generations of Liepiņas.

When the collection was complete, Mārtiņš Liepiņa took his finished pieces to the collector's gallery, where they were met with critical acclaim. The Liepiņa family name had once again brought honor and pride to the town of Riga, and Mārtiņš knew that he owed it all to his heritage.
