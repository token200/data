Meng Jorgensen stepped into the crowded café, scanning the room for familiar faces. As she waited in line to order her usual cappuccino, her eyes landed on a figure sitting alone at a small table by the window. Meng Jorgensen's friend, Alex, was hunched over a laptop, typing away with a look of intense focus.

As she approached the counter, Meng Jorgensen couldn't help but notice the way Alex's hair curled slightly at the nape of their neck. She had known them since college, when they met in an art class and quickly became inseparable. Over the years, their friendship had only grown stronger, despite the fact that they led vastly different lives.

After collecting her coffee, Meng Jorgensen made her way over to Alex's table. "Mind if I join you?" she asked, nodding towards the empty chair across from them.

Alex looked up, startled, before breaking into a wide smile. "Not at all, Menge! I was just getting caught up in some work stuff." They held out their hand, and Meng Jorgensen took it, feeling a spark of electricity as their palms touched.

As they chatted, Meng Jorgensen learned that Alex had been working on a new project – a photography series exploring the intersection of technology and nature. Her friend's passion was infectious, and soon they were lost in conversation about everything from artificial intelligence to the beauty of abandoned landscapes.

Over the next few hours, the café filled with new customers, but Meng Jorgensen and Alex remained focused on each other. As the sun began to set outside, casting a warm glow over the room, Alex stood up, brushing crumbs from their lap. "Thanks for hanging out, Menge," they said, smiling. "I needed this today."

Meng Jorgensen smiled back, feeling grateful for their friendship. It was moments like these that reminded her why she loved spending time with Alex – their ability to find connection in the midst of chaos. As they parted ways outside the café, Meng Jorgensen knew that no matter what lay ahead, she and Alex would face it together.
