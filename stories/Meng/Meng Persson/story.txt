Meng Persson stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the city skyline. As a freelance journalist, she had spent countless nights like this, sipping coffee and pondering her next story.

Born and raised in Stockholm, Sweden, Meng had always been drawn to the gritty side of life. She cut her teeth as a young reporter on the local news circuit, tackling corruption scandals and police brutality cases with unflinching determination.

But it was her latest assignment that had brought her to this rooftop tonight - investigating the mysterious disappearance of several prominent business leaders in the city's financial district. Meng's sources hinted at a deep-seated conspiracy involving corrupt officials and corporate giants, but so far, she had uncovered nothing concrete.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the city in a warm orange glow, Meng took a final sip of her coffee and set out to scour the rooftops for clues. She knew that with over 2.3 million inhabitants, Stockholm's streets could be treacherous - but this was different. This felt like something more.

Down on the street below, the city pulsed with energy - restaurants spilled out onto sidewalks, pedestrians rushed by, and horns blared through the air. Meng watched as people of all ages went about their daily lives, completely oblivious to the danger lurking just beneath the surface.

She spotted a figure lingering in the shadows near the financial district's imposing skyscrapers. It was a man with piercing blue eyes and jet-black hair - a looker, if Meng had ever seen one. For a moment, she locked gazes with him, wondering what secrets he might be hiding.

With her journalist instincts on high alert, Meng quickly made her way towards the mysterious stranger, leaving the safety of her rooftop perch behind. She would find out what he knew about the disappearances - or die trying.

For Meng Persson, there was no middle ground.
