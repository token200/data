Meng Lefevre sat alone at his desk, staring out the rain-soaked window of his Parisian apartment. The sound of droplets pattering against the glass was like music to his ears, a soothing melody that seemed to match the rhythm of his thoughts.

As a renowned art historian and critic, Meng had spent his fair share of time surrounded by the world's most exquisite masterpieces. But tonight, he found himself lost in the depths of his own mind, consumed by a sense of melancholy that threatened to overwhelm him.

It had been five years since the loss of his wife, Colette, who had been his muse and partner in every sense of the word. The memories of their time together still lingered, like the scent of old books on his fingers. He would often find himself wandering into the Musée d'Orsay, searching for a glimpse of her bright smile or the way she'd always wear that scarf with an effortless charm.

Meng's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of his phone ringing. It was his editor, requesting his opinion on a new exhibition at the Louvre. Meng hesitated, unsure if he had the energy to write anything meaningful.

But as he sat there, something sparked within him. He began to pace around the room, his footsteps echoing off the walls. Ideas started flowing, like water bursting from a dam. He grabbed his pen and paper, and before long, words were pouring out of him, just as they had all those years ago with Colette.

The rain continued to fall outside, but Meng felt invigorated by its rhythm. It was as if the world had awakened something within him, reminding him that even in darkness, there was always beauty to be found.

As he sat back down at his desk, a smile spread across his face. This piece would be special – not just because of its technical merit but also because it came from a place deep within him. Meng knew that Colette would have been proud of this work, and in that moment, he felt her presence around him once more.

With renewed vigor, Meng delved into the world of art history, channeling his emotions onto the page. The rain continued to fall, but he was no longer alone – for within those rainy Parisian streets, he had found a sense of peace, and with it, a new creation born from the ashes of sorrow.
