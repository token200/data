Meng Williams walked into the small caf√©, scanning the room for a familiar face. It had been a while since she'd last set foot in this cozy spot, but the smell of freshly brewed coffee and warm pastries was like a beacon calling her back.

As she waited in line, Meng's eyes landed on a figure sitting by the window - it was Emma, her old friend from college. They'd lost touch after graduation, but Meng had always kept an eye out for her in case they might cross paths again.

When it was finally her turn to order, Meng smiled at Emma and asked if she wanted to join her for a coffee. Emma nodded enthusiastically, and they sat down at a small table by the window.

Over steaming cups of coffee, they caught up on each other's lives. Meng filled Emma in on her latest project - a community outreach program she'd been working on for months, aimed at bringing together local youth groups to promote social change. Emma listened intently, asking thoughtful questions and offering words of encouragement.

As they chatted, Meng couldn't help but think about how much she'd grown as a person since college. She'd always known that life was going to be full of ups and downs, but she'd never anticipated just how much she'd learn from her own experiences. From struggling with anxiety to finding purpose in her work, each challenge had taught Meng something valuable.

Meng Williams took a sip of her coffee, feeling grateful for this chance encounter with Emma. It was a reminder that even after years apart, old friendships could still hold meaning and power. As they finished their drinks and prepared to part ways, Meng smiled at Emma and said, "It's so great to see you again, old friend."
