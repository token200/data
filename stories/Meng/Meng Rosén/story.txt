Intrigued, Meng Rosén purchased the necklace and wore it on a whim, feeling an instant connection to its history and craftsmanship. As she continued her stroll through the city, the pendant drew admiring glances from passersby, who sensed that she was wearing more than just a piece of jewelry - she was wearing a story.
