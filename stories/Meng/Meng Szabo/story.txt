Meng Szabo stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit café, shaking the water from her long, dark coat. As a renowned detective in Budapest, she had seen it all – the good, the bad, and the ugly. But tonight, something about the case that had been plaguing her for weeks felt off.

As she waited for her coffee to arrive, Meng Szabo's mind wandered back to the events of the past few days. The wealthy businessman, Richard Langley, had gone missing, leaving behind only a cryptic message: "The truth is in the shadows." Meng Szabo was determined to uncover it.

She pulled out her phone and sent a text to her trusted partner, László. "I need your help tonight," she typed, before finishing with just two words: "Meet me."

László arrived promptly at 10 pm, and together they pored over the case files, searching for any clue that might lead them to Langley. Meng Szabo's sharp mind picked up on a thread of inconsistencies in the businessman's alibis, and she knew they were onto something.

As they delved deeper into the mystery, Meng Szabo couldn't shake off the feeling that she was being watched. She glanced around the café, but the patrons seemed too engrossed in their own conversations to notice her. Shrugging it off as mere paranoia, she refocused on the task at hand.

The next few hours flew by in a blur of interrogation, surveillance footage analysis, and coffee-fueled brainstorming sessions. And then, just as they were about to pack up for the night, Meng Szabo's phone buzzed with an incoming text from an unknown number: "Look again at Richard Langley's business partner."

Meng Szabo's eyes locked onto László, a spark of excitement igniting within her. This was it – the breakthrough they had been waiting for. Together, they dived back into the case files, their minds racing with possibilities.

As the night wore on, Meng Szabo knew that she and László were closing in on the truth. And with any luck, Richard Langley would be found safe and sound soon enough – thanks to her tireless dedication and sharp instincts as Detective Meng Szabo.
