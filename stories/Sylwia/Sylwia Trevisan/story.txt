Sylwia Trevisan stepped into the dimly lit tavern, her piercing green eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As a skilled mercenary and member of the elite group known as "The Shadowhand," she had seen her fair share of battles and intrigues. Her reputation preceded her, striking fear into the hearts of those who dared oppose her.

As she made her way to the bar, a hooded figure emerged from the shadows, their face obscured by the darkness. "Sylwia Trevisan," they whispered, their voice barely audible over the murmur of the patrons. "I've been searching for you."

Sylwia's hand instinctively drifted to the hilt of her sword, her eyes narrowing as she sized up the stranger. Who was this person, and what did they want with her? She motioned for the bartender to pour her a drink, keeping her gaze fixed on the hooded figure.

"Who are you?" Sylwia asked, her voice firm but controlled.

The stranger hesitated, then pushed back its hood, revealing a young woman with piercing blue eyes and raven-black hair. "I'm Elara," she said, her voice trembling slightly. "I've come from the east, bearing a message for The Shadowhand."

Sylwia raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite herself. What could this mysterious woman possibly want to tell them? She motioned for Elara to sit down, and the young woman took a seat beside her.

"It's about the Order of the Red Hand," Elara said, her eyes darting nervously around the room. "They're gathering forces, preparing for war against The Shadowhand."

Sylwia's grip on her drink tightened, her mind racing with the implications. The Red Hand was a ruthless organization that had been a thorn in their side for years. If they were indeed gathering troops, it would be a grave threat to their operations.

"Sylwia Trevisan," she said, her voice low and deadly. "We need to know more about this Order's plans. Prepare the others. We have a war to prepare for."
