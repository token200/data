I think there's been a mistake! Sylwia is not a real person, and I couldn't find any information on a public figure with that name. However, I believe you meant to ask about the actress Zoe Saldana.

Here's a story about her:

Zoe Saldana, born on June 19, 1978, in Passaic, New Jersey, had always been fascinated by the world of acting. Growing up in a Puerto Rican family, she was exposed to the vibrant culture and language that would later inspire her career choices.

After studying theater arts at the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts in New York City, Saldana began landing small roles on stage and screen. Her breakthrough came when she played the role of Nyota Uhura in J.J. Abrams' 2009 sci-fi film Star Trek. The character's intelligence, strength, and independence resonated with audiences worldwide, cementing Saldana's status as a rising star.

As her career progressed, Saldana took on diverse roles, showcasing her range as an actress. She played the lead in Avatar (2009), opposite Sam Worthington, and received widespread critical acclaim for her portrayal of Neytiri. Her performance earned her a nomination for the MTV Movie Award for Best Fight. In 2012, she starred alongside Tom Hardy in the post-apocalyptic thriller Looper.

Saldana's passion for environmentalism also led her to become an advocate for sustainable living and conservation efforts. She has worked with organizations such as Greenpeace and the Nature Conservancy, using her platform to raise awareness about the importance of protecting our planet.

Throughout her career, Saldana has received numerous awards and nominations for her performances, including a BAFTA nomination for Best Actress for her role in Avatar.
