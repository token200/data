Sylwia Rivera was a 25-year-old Afro-Latina poet and activist living in New York City. She had grown up on the streets of East Harlem, where she learned to harness her voice as a means of resistance against the systemic oppression she faced every day.

As a child, Sylwia had struggled to find her place in the world. Her abuela's stories of resistance and resilience were her earliest memories, but her own experiences with racism and xenophobia had left her feeling lost and disconnected. However, as she grew older, Sylwia discovered that poetry was not only a way to express herself, but also a means of taking up space in a world that seemed determined to erase her.

Her poetry spoke truth to power, weaving together the threads of her own experiences with the struggles faced by women, people of color, and immigrants. Her words were raw, honest, and unapologetic, speaking directly to those who felt marginalized or silenced.

One evening, Sylwia was invited to perform at an underground poetry collective in Bushwick. She took the stage, her voice trembling with nerves but her words electrifying the audience. As she spoke of her own experiences, of her abuela's resistance, and of the struggles faced by immigrant women, the crowd hung on every word.

But Sylwia's performance was not without its challenges. The audience was predominantly white, and some members looked uncomfortable, even hostile. One woman shouted "not this again" as Sylwia read from her latest work, a poem about police brutality and racialized violence. But Sylwia refused to be silenced. She stood tall, her eyes locked on the heckler, and continued to speak.

When she finished speaking, the audience erupted into applause, but Sylwia knew that this was only the beginning. This performance marked the start of a new chapter in her life as an artist and activist. She had found her voice, and with it, the courage to take up space in a world that often sought to erase her.

As she walked off the stage, Sylwia felt a sense of pride and purpose wash over her. She knew that she was not alone, that there were others like her, speaking out against injustice and fighting for their rights. And with this knowledge, she knew that she would continue to use her voice as a means of resistance, inspiring others to do the same.
