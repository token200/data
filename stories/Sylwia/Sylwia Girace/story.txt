Sylwia Girace stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the sleepy town below. As she made her way to the small café where she was supposed to meet her contact, she couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. This was it – the moment of truth.

A woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair emerged from the shadows, dressed in a long coat that seemed to swallow her whole. "Sylwia Girace," she said, her voice low and husky. "I've been expecting you."

Sylwia's eyes narrowed as she took in the stranger's appearance. Who was this woman, and what did she want? But before she could ask any questions, the woman led her to a small alleyway behind the café.

"There," she said, gesturing to a figure huddled in the corner. "He has information about your sister."

Sylwia's heart skipped a beat as she saw the figure rise to its feet. It was an old man with a gaunt face and sunken eyes – the kind of person who looked like he'd been up for days, not hours.

"Please," Sylwia said, taking a step forward. "Tell me what you know."

The old man's gaze darted back and forth before coming to rest on her. "I don't have much time," he wheezed. "But I'll give you the truth. Your sister... she didn't just disappear. She was taken."

Sylwia felt a cold dread creeping up her spine as she listened to the old man's words. Taken by whom? Why?

The woman stepped forward, her eyes flashing with intensity. "We know who took your sister," she said. "And we're willing to help you get her back – for a price."

Sylwia hesitated, unsure of what to do. She had come so far, risked so much, only to be met with more questions and uncertainty.

But as she looked at the woman, and then at the old man, she knew she couldn't turn back now. She nodded once, firmly. "I'm in," she said.

The woman smiled, a small, enigmatic smile. "We'll see about that."

And with that, Sylwia Girace's journey began – one of danger, deception, and desperate determination to uncover the truth about her sister's disappearance.
