Sylwia Horvath stood at the edge of the rooftop garden, her long brown hair whipping in the gentle breeze as she gazed out over the city below. As a skilled thief and art forger, Sylwia had always been drawn to the thrill of the job – but tonight was different.

Tonight, Sylwia Horvath was on the hunt for something more than just valuable artifacts or rare masterpieces. Tonight, she sought redemption. Her latest mark, a wealthy collector who had commissioned her forgery of a priceless Monet, had turned out to be a setup.

As Sylwia scanned the rooftops, her trained eye spotted a figure perched atop the adjacent building – none other than her old accomplice and confidant, Viktor. A flicker of unease passed through her chest; she hadn't seen Viktor in months, but the rumors had been circulating that he was back in town.

Viktor spotted Sylwia's gaze and raised a hand in a silent signal for her to follow him. He led her down a narrow alleyway, where a sleek black van awaited them. The interior was dimly lit, with only a single flickering LED illuminating the space. Viktor slid a small folder across the console, containing Sylwia's stolen Monet – along with several other valuable pieces.

"What do you want from me?" Sylwia asked, her voice low and guarded.

Viktor smiled, revealing pointed canines. "You see, Sylwathor, I've been watching you. You're getting too old for this game. It's time to retire."

Sylwia's eyes narrowed. She knew Viktor well enough to recognize the undertones of condescension behind his words.

"You want something in return?" she asked, her voice steady.

Viktor leaned back in his seat, a glint in his eye. "Oh, I think we can come to an understanding, Sylwia Horvath. Let's say... you help me with one little job. And then, you're done."

Sylwia raised an eyebrow; she knew that Viktor would never give up on his plans so easily. But for now, the stakes were worth taking a chance.

"I'm listening," she said, her voice laced with skepticism.

And with that, Sylwia Horvath leaned forward, ready to listen – and plan – her next move.
