Sylwia Becker was a force to be reckoned with. As a renowned forensic psychologist, she had spent years studying the darkest corners of the human mind, and yet, she still couldn't shake off the feeling that she was being watched.

Her latest case had her stumped. A string of gruesome murders had taken place in the small town of Ravenswood, leaving the police department baffled. The only clue was a cryptic message left at each crime scene: "They're watching you."

Sylwia had always been drawn to these cases, not out of morbid curiosity, but because she saw something in them that others missed – a glimpse into the twisted minds of the perpetrators. She spent countless hours poring over the evidence, looking for any thread that might lead her to the killer.

But as the days turned into weeks, and the bodies piled up, Sylwia began to feel like she was losing herself in the investigation. The pressure was mounting, and her colleagues were starting to doubt her abilities. Her own sanity was beginning to fray at the edges.

One night, as she was reviewing the latest crime scene photos, Sylwia noticed something peculiar. A figure, just out of focus, lurking in the background of one of the images. She zoomed in on it, but it vanished into thin air.

Suddenly, the room seemed to darken around her, and Sylwia felt a presence behind her. She spun around, but there was no one there. The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end as she realized that she wasn't alone.

"Who's here?" she called out, trying to keep her voice steady.

The response was immediate – a low, menacing chuckle that sent shivers down Sylwia's spine. She spun around again, but this time, the laughter grew louder, and she felt herself being pulled towards it.

In a flash of inspiration, Sylwia grabbed her notebook and jotted down some notes. She knew that she had to get out of there before things took a turn for the worse. As she turned to leave, the figure materialized in front of her – a woman with piercing green eyes and skin as pale as alabaster.

"I've been watching you too," Sylwia said, her voice barely above a whisper.

The woman smiled, and Sylwia knew that she had stumbled upon something much bigger than just another serial killer.
