Sylwia Lundgren's eyes narrowed as she gazed out at the cityscape before her. She stood on the rooftop of her apartment building, her arms wrapped tightly around herself in an attempt to ward off the chill that lingered long after winter had officially left. It was a habit formed from years spent sleeping with one eye open, waiting for the next threat to surface.

Sylwia's mind was a jumble of dark thoughts and paranoid fears, honed over a lifetime of living on the fringes of society. Her parents had been murdered when she was just a child, and she'd grown up in foster care, constantly moving from one home to another. It was only natural that she learned to trust no one.

But there were times like these, when the world seemed quieter than usual, that Sylwia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. She sensed it in her bones, a low thrum of unease that threatened to spill over into panic at any moment.

With a deep breath, she turned away from the view and began to pace back and forth across the rooftop. Her thoughts were scattered – old debts to be paid, new schemes to consider – but nothing seemed to fill the void left by her latest obsession: an anonymous tip about a possible conspiracy involving some of the city's most powerful figures.

Sylwia had spent months digging into this story, pouring over scraps of information and tracking down whispered rumors. It was starting to add up, she was convinced – but proving it would be a whole different story. She needed someone with the skills and resources to help her bring it all together.

As she walked, Sylwia's thoughts drifted back to the one person who might be able to help: Victor LaGraine. A former hacker turned private investigator, he was known for his ability to dig up dirt on even the most well-hidden secrets. The problem was, he was also known for being a few steps ahead of everyone else – and Sylwia had a feeling that getting him involved in this case would only increase her own danger quotient.

For now, though, she'd have to wait. She pulled out her phone and sent Victor a message: "I need your help with something big." And then she let the silence hang between them, waiting for his response – and wondering what lay ahead when he finally replied.

As she stood there on the rooftop, Sylwia felt the familiar thrum of anxiety rising within her. It was a feeling she knew all too well, one that she'd learned to live with over the years. But deep down, she couldn't shake the sense that this time might be different – and that the stakes were higher than ever before.
