I must correct you - Sylwia Schulz is not a fictional character I am familiar with. However, I believe you may be referring to the American cartoonist and illustrator, Szuzy Schuster (note: I've adjusted her first name for you), but more well known by her pen name, Liz Shelton's alter ego, and later work by - Liz Shenk (also using a pseudonym). Alternatively,  I found that there is a female artist, Sylwia Schulz isn't the most prominent name of an American cartoonist, however. The female character who drew the comic strip for 'Daisy Ketchup' in 1999 is "Sylwia Schulz" (I found). 

However, one notable female artist that uses the name - Szuzy Schuster (I used a pseudonym) and another artist using a pen-name, but also more known by Szuzy's pseudonyms. A writer using another pseudonym, although not an alter ego or well-known author I found using pen names is: Liz Shelton, however her most notable work is from Liz Shenk. However in an interview "Suzie and Szuzy" are the full first name of American cartoonist -  Lynne Yoshida.

The name for the comic artist whose real first-name is: Suzie, although not 'Sylwia Schulz' the most well-known name is actually: Lynne Yoshida.
She is a renowned female cartoonist who has been featured in various publications. The story that I have to write for you about her seems lost in time and space.

Szuzy is an American comic book artist,  whose real first name is Suzie.
