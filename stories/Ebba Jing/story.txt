Ebba Jing stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. She had been away for what felt like an eternity, and the familiar rhythms of Stockholm were a welcome respite from the chaos she'd left behind.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Ebba's thoughts turned to her family. Her mother, still grieving after Ebba's father's passing six months prior, was counting on her to help with the estate sale. The memory of her father's warm smile and easy laughter still brought a pang to her chest.

Ebba stopped in front of the small apartment she shared with her sister, Lena, and took a deep breath before pushing open the door. Lena looked up from her phone, concern etched on her face.

"Hey, sis," she said, putting down her device. "You okay? You've been pretty quiet since you got back."

Ebba shrugged, flopping onto the couch beside Lena. "Just trying to get settled again. I had a long trip."

Lena nodded sympathetically. "I can imagine. But we need to talk about Dad's stuff. Mom is going crazy without you here to help."

Ebba nodded in agreement. Together, they spent the afternoon going through their father's belongings, sorting out memories and deciding what to keep and what to let go of. Ebba found a small wooden box with a note inside, addressed to her.

The note read: "For my dearest daughter, when you need me most. Love, Dad."

Tears pricked at the corners of Ebba's eyes as she unfolded the piece of paper. She tucked it into her pocket, feeling a sense of peace wash over her.

As the day drew to a close, Lena and Ebba decided to visit their mother, who was still struggling to come to terms with her loss. Over steaming cups of coffee, they listened patiently as their mother shared stories of Ebba's father – his love of music, his talent for cooking, and his infectious laughter.

As the conversation flowed, something shifted inside Ebba. She felt a weight lift from her shoulders, replaced by a sense of freedom and possibility. The memory of her father would always be with her, but it no longer felt like a burden. Instead, it was a reminder of the love they shared – and the life they had built together.

In that moment, Ebba knew she was exactly where she needed to be – surrounded by family, memories, and the quiet strength of the Stockholm streets she loved. As the sun dipped below the rooftops, casting the city in a warm, golden light, Ebba smiled softly to herself, feeling like she was finally coming home.
