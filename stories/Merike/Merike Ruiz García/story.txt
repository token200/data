Born in Ecuador to Spanish parents, Merike's love of art began at a young age. She spent hours watching her mother paint traditional Ecuadorian textiles, mesmerized by the colors and textures. As she grew older, her interest in art only deepened, leading her to study fine arts in Stockholm.

After completing her degree, Merike moved to New York City, where she quickly established herself as a rising talent in the art world. Her work was showcased in galleries across the city, and she began to receive commissions from collectors and museums.

Despite her success, Merike remained committed to using her platform to highlight social justice issues. She had always been passionate about the struggles faced by marginalized communities, particularly those of Latin American descent. Her art often addressed these issues, using bold colors and powerful imagery to convey messages of resilience and hope.

One of Merike's most notable works was "Revolución de Color," a massive mural that she painted in a Brooklyn alleyway. The piece depicted a vibrant, swirling vortex of color, with images of activists and revolutionaries from throughout history. It quickly became a landmark in the neighborhood, and a powerful symbol of resistance against systemic oppression.
