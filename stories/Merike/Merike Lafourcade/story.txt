Merike Lafourcade stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any signs of life. The sleepy coastal town of Tuleu had seen better days, but it was home, and Merike wasn't about to leave without saying goodbye.

As she made her way through the crowded streets, the smell of saltwater and fish wafted through the air, transporting her back to summers spent exploring the rocky shores with her abuela. She paused at a small café on the corner, ordering a coffee and watching as the sun rose over the bay.

Merike's thoughts were interrupted by a gentle voice behind her. "Merike Lafourcade, I see you're still getting in too late." It was her friend, Elena, who had moved back to Tuleu after years abroad.

Elena slid onto the stool beside Merike, and they sat in comfortable silence for a moment, watching as the town began to stir. "What brings you back so soon?" Elena asked finally, breaking the spell.

Merike shrugged, sipping her coffee. "Just needed some space, I guess." It was true – after years of traveling and working, she'd found herself feeling lost and restless, without a clear direction or purpose. Her friends and family had encouraged her to return home, but Merike wasn't sure if she was ready to settle back into the routine.

As they talked, Merike realized that Elena's return had given her a fresh perspective on things. Maybe this time around, she wouldn't be so quick to write off Tuleu as just another small town with limited opportunities. Maybe there was something – or someone – waiting for her here.

The sun climbed higher in the sky, casting a warm glow over the town. Merike felt a sense of peace settle over her, like the gentle lapping of the waves against the shore. She knew that she still had a lot to figure out, but for now, she was content to simply be back, surrounded by the people and places she loved.

"I'll stay for a while," Merike said finally, turning to Elena with a small smile. "See if I can make this place feel like home again."

Elena smiled back, her eyes sparkling with warmth. "I think you will, Merike Lafourcade."
