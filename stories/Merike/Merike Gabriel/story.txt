Merike Gabriel sat alone in her small, cluttered apartment, staring blankly at the wall as tears streamed down her face. It had been five years since her sister's disappearance, and yet the pain still felt like an open wound.

Merike was a young artist, known for her bold and vibrant paintings that seemed to capture the essence of the city she loved. But despite her outward confidence and creativity, she had always struggled with the dark memories of her past.

As a child, Merike had been obsessed with stories of her sister's adventures and the two girls' seemingly idyllic relationship. Her parents had always encouraged their bond, but when Linni disappeared on a family vacation, Merike's world was turned upside down.

Despite her parents' pleas for her to focus on her own life, Merike became consumed by the search for answers. She scoured the streets of Berlin, poring over every witness statement and piece of evidence left behind by the police. Her apartment was a shrine to Linni – photos, postcards, and half-finished sketches that only served as reminders of what had been lost.

As she gazed at the wall, Merike's mind began to wander back to their last conversation before Linni vanished. "I'm going on an adventure," she remembered Linni saying, her eyes sparkling with mischief. Merike felt a pang in her chest – had her sister ever truly meant for it to end that way?

Merike sighed, pushing herself up from the couch. She knew she couldn't stay stuck in this rut forever. With a newfound determination, she began to clear off her worktable, revealing a scattering of canvases and paints.

She dipped her brush into a vibrant shade of blue and began to block out the outline of a cityscape – Berlin, with its twisted alleys and neon lights. As she worked, Merike felt Linni's presence beside her, guiding her hand as she created.

The painting grew more defined, its colors deepening to capture the city's energy and vitality. When Merike finally stepped back, she was met with a vision that seemed almost surreal – a swirling vortex of Berlin, full of life and possibility.

Merike smiled, feeling a sense of peace wash over her. For the first time in years, she saw that Linni's disappearance didn't have to define her. She could create something new, something beautiful – not just for herself, but for those who still believed in the power of sisterly love.
