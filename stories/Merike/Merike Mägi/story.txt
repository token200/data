Merike MÃ¤gi was an Estonian novelist known for her lyrical prose and exploration of themes such as identity, family, and social isolation. Born in 1972 in Tartu, Estonia, Merike grew up in a country that had been under Soviet occupation since the end of World War II. This experience would later influence her writing, which often delved into the complexities of living under oppressive regimes.

Merike's early life was marked by her love of literature and music, with her mother being a musician who played the piano and sang Estonian folk songs. Merike's own creative pursuits were encouraged from an early age, and she began writing poetry as a teenager. However, it wasn't until she was in her mid-twenties that she turned to prose, inspired by the works of writers such as Virginia Woolf and Samuel Beckett.

Merike's first novel, "A Madman's Notebook", published in 1996, was a critical and commercial success in Estonia, but it was her second book, "The Birth House", which gained international recognition. The novel, set during World War II, tells the story of a young midwife who must navigate the treacherous landscape of occupied Estonia.

Merike's writing often explores themes of isolation and disconnection, reflecting her own experiences growing up in a country under Soviet rule. However, her work is also characterized by its lyricism and musicality, drawing on Estonian folklore and mythology to create a unique narrative voice.

Throughout her career, Merike has received numerous awards for her writing, including the Estonian Literary Award and the Finlandia Prize. Her novels have been translated into many languages and have gained a worldwide following. Despite her international success, however, Merike remains deeply connected to her Estonian roots, using her writing as a means of exploring and understanding the complexities of her country's history.

In 2019, Merike published "The Last Brother", which won the prestigious Hans Christian Andersen Award. The novel is set in Estonia during World War II and tells the story of two brothers who become separated during the war. The book was widely praised for its powerful portrayal of life under occupation and its exploration of themes such as identity, family, and love.
