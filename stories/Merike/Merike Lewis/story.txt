Merike Lewis stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small town for a glimpse of familiarity. As she made her way through the quiet streets, the scent of freshly baked bread wafted from a nearby bakery, transporting Merike back to her childhood summers spent here.

A native of this rural corner of Oregon, Merike Lewis had returned after years away, driven by a mix of nostalgia and a sense of restlessness. Her job as a journalist in Portland had grown stale, and the distance from her roots was starting to feel like an insurmountable chasm.

As she walked, Merike's thoughts turned to her family – her parents, who had long since moved away, and her younger brother, who now managed the bakery where the aroma had first wafted up to greet her. Her father's hands, worn from years of working the land, still lingered in her mind as she approached the bakery door.

Merike took a deep breath, steeling herself for the conversation that was sure to come. Her brother, Jack, looked up from behind the counter, a hint of surprise on his face as he took in Merike's urban attire. "Hey, sis," he said, using the nickname only family members were privy to.

As they chatted, Merike learned that her father had passed away just weeks before she'd left town, and her mother was struggling to keep up with the demands of running the bakery alone. Merike Lewis knew exactly what it felt like to be worn down by responsibility – a sentiment that resonated deeply within her now.

With newfound purpose, Merike began making plans to stay in town for longer than just visiting. She would help Jack with the bakery and help her mother rebuild, learning the value of hard work and community alongside her brother. And as she watched the sun set over the Willamette Valley, Merike felt a sense of belonging that had been missing from her life for years – belonging to this small town, to her family, and to herself once more.
