I couldn't find any information on a person named Merike Abdykadyrova. It's possible that she is a private individual or not well-known, or that her name is misspelled.

However, I can tell you about the 1987 Heidelberg film student who was murdered. 

In June 2012, news emerged of the identity of Heike Makatsch's and Til Schweiger's character in the film "Good Bye Lenin!" The film's script was not meant for a German audience at that time as Germany had recently unified from East to West. At the time of its initial release, it appeared on television for first time on 2006.
