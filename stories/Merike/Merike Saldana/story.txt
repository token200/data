She poured her heart and soul into every performance, connecting with the crowd in a way she never had before.

Despite the attention, Merike Saldana remained true to herself. She continued to write lyrics that spoke to the struggles of living as a minority, and used her platform to amplify the voices of those who had been silenced for too long.
