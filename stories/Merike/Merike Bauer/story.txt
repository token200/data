Merike Bauer sat alone in her small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and half-finished art projects. She was a writer, but not the kind who had a string of bestselling novels or received critical acclaim. No, Merike's writing was raw, honest, and often brutal.

As she stared blankly at her computer screen, the cursor taunted her, blinking like a heartbeat in time with her own racing thoughts. She was struggling to find inspiration for her next project, and it was starting to eat away at her.

Suddenly, Merike's phone rang, shrill and insistent. She hesitated before answering, unsure if she had the energy to deal with yet another well-meaning friend or family member asking about her "artistic journey." But when she heard the voice on the other end – that of her best friend, Juhle – all doubts vanished.

"Hey, girl," Juhle said, as per usual. "What's new? Why haven't you called me in weeks?"

Merike laughed, feeling a warmth spread through her chest. She and Juhle had met by chance at a local coffee shop five years ago, bonding over their shared love of literature and music. Over time, Merike had confided in Juhle about her struggles as a writer – the self-doubt, the fear of rejection, the pressure to create.

"Juhle," Merike said, her voice barely above a whisper, "I'm stuck. I don't know what's wrong with me or why I can't write anything worth sharing."

There was a pause on the other end of the line, and for a moment, Merike felt like she'd lost the connection. But then Juhle spoke up.

"You're overthinking it," Juhle said firmly. "You need to stop trying to force creativity and let it happen naturally. Go for a walk, read some books, play with paint or clay – do something that doesn't involve staring at a screen."

Merike took a deep breath, feeling the tension seep out of her shoulders. She nodded silently, as if Juhle could see her through the phone.

"Thanks," Merike said softly, knowing exactly what Juhle had given her – permission to take a break and trust in herself.

As she hung up with Juhle, Merike felt a sense of peace settle over her like a soft blanket. The cursor on her screen seemed less intimidating now; the possibilities for her next project suddenly more exciting. She leaned back into her chair and smiled, knowing that sometimes all it took was someone else to see things clearly.
