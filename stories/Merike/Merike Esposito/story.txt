Merike Esposito sat alone in her dimly lit apartment, the city lights of Toronto flickering outside like fireflies. The wind howled through the streets, carrying with it the whispers of her past. It had been five years since she'd left Estonia, leaving behind the only life she'd ever known.

She took a deep breath and let her eyes wander around the room, tracing the lines on the walls where memories lingered like dust. Her mother's old piano sat silent and still in the corner, its keys yellowed with age. The photographs of her family, beaming and full of life, hung on one wall, their smiles frozen in time.

Merike's thoughts drifted to her father, who'd passed away when she was just a teenager. She remembered his deep voice, the way he'd sing Estonian folk songs around the fireplace. Her heart swelled with grief, but it was tempered by the bittersweet memories of summer days spent exploring the Latvian countryside with her mother.

As a child, Merike had always felt like she didn't quite belong anywhere. Between being an outsider in Estonia and never quite fitting in at school in Canada, she'd learned to adapt quickly. But it was the silence that was most suffocating – the quiet of not speaking the language or understanding the customs of her adopted home.

Merike rose from her chair, walking over to the window as if searching for an escape from her own thoughts. The Toronto skyline stretched out before her like a canvas of steel and glass. She felt like an artist trying to recreate the beauty she saw in her mind's eye but couldn't quite capture on paper.

Outside, the wind died down, leaving only the distant hum of traffic. Merike stood still for a moment, letting the stillness wash over her like a balm. Maybe this was where she was meant to be – alone, with nothing but the whispers of her past and the promise of an uncertain future.
