I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Merike Straume. It is possible that you meant to ask for information on a different character or requested a completely new story.

However, I can create a brand new story with the character Merike Straume as requested:

Merike Straume stepped out of her small apartment and onto the bustling streets of Oslo. As a freelance journalist, she was always on the lookout for the next big story. With her sharp mind and quick wit, she had a knack for uncovering hidden truths.

As she walked to the local café, Merike's mind began to wander back to her childhood in Estonia. Growing up in a small coastal town, she had always been fascinated by the sea and its secrets. Her parents, both scientists, had encouraged her curiosity, teaching her everything from marine biology to forensic analysis.

Merike arrived at the café and spotted an old friend, Hans, sipping on a coffee. She slid into the seat across from him, ordering a cappuccino as they began to chat.

"So, what's new with you?" Merike asked, pulling out her notebook and pen.

"Not much," Hans replied. "Just working on my latest project. I've been investigating some strange occurrences at a local factory."

Merike's ears perked up. This sounded like the kind of story she had been looking for. She leaned in, eager to hear more.

As they talked, Merike Straume's journalist instincts kicked in. She began to ask pointed questions, her mind racing with possibilities. Hans filled her in on the details: workers reporting strange noises and equipment malfunctions, all under the guise of a "routine maintenance shutdown."

Merike's eyes sparkled with excitement as she scribbled notes furiously. This was it – the break she had been waiting for.

As they parted ways, Merike Straume couldn't help but feel grateful for her unique combination of skills and experience. With Hans' lead, she was ready to dive into the heart of the mystery and uncover the truth.

With a spring in her step and a determination burning within, Merike Straume set off to unravel the secrets hidden beneath the surface.
