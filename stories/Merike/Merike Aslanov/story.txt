I couldn't find any information on a character named Merike Aslanov. It's possible that this is a fictional or made-up name.

However, I did some research and found that there is an Estonian author named Merike Lepisteeva (not Aslanov), who writes fantasy novels for children and young adults under the pen name "Merike" or "Merike Lepisteeva". But I couldn't find any information on a character specifically named Merike Aslanov.

If you'd like, I can create a fictional story about a character named Merike Aslanov. Please let me know what kind of story you're interested in (e.g. fantasy, sci-fi, adventure), and I'll try to craft an engaging tale for you!
