I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Merike Zawisza. It is possible that this character does not exist in my database or is not well-known.

However, I can create a story about a fictional character with the given name Merike. Here's a 400-word short story:

Merike Zawisza stepped out of her small apartment and into the crisp morning air. She took a deep breath, feeling the coolness fill her lungs as she began her daily routine. As a freelance journalist, she spent most of her days exploring the city, interviewing people, and writing stories.

Merike had always been drawn to the world of journalism, fascinated by the power of words to shape public opinion and bring about change. She had started out as a cub reporter for a local newspaper, but soon found herself wanting more - more freedom, more adventure, more stories that truly mattered.

With her notebook and pen in hand, Merike set off to explore the city's hidden corners. She wandered through markets, talked to vendors, and listened to their stories. She wrote about the struggles of everyday people, about the triumphs and the tragedies. Her articles sparked conversations, ignited debates, and inspired change.

As she walked, Merike couldn't help but think of her parents, who had encouraged her love of writing from a young age. They had instilled in her a strong sense of social justice, and she was determined to use her platform to make a difference.

Merike's phone rang, breaking the silence. It was an old friend, calling to invite her to a secret meeting with a source who had information about a major scandal brewing in the city's government. Merike's heart quickened as she accepted the invitation. She knew that this could be the story of a lifetime - a chance to expose corruption and bring justice to those who needed it most.

With her mind racing, Merike made her way to the designated meeting spot. As she arrived, she couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation. This was what being a journalist meant - chasing down leads, uncovering secrets, and telling the stories that needed to be told.

Merike Zawisza took her place among the shadows, ready to listen, ready to write, and ready to make a difference.
