Merike Jhih-hao was a 25-year-old photographer with a passion for capturing the beauty of her native Estonia. She spent most of her days exploring the rugged coastline and rolling hills of her homeland, searching for unique perspectives to add to her portfolio.

One day, Merike received an invitation from a local museum to photograph their upcoming exhibition on Estonian folklore. The theme was "Myths and Legends," and Merike saw it as the perfect opportunity to showcase her skills and share her cultural heritage with the world.

As she began her research, Merike delved into the rich history of Estonian mythology, studying stories of mythical creatures like the Lembitu and the Selkie. She was particularly fascinated by the legend of the Jääneväli, a group of magical beings said to roam the forests and mountains during the winter solstice.

Merike spent hours poring over old manuscripts and scouring local libraries for references to the Jääneväli. She became so immersed in her research that she began to feel like a true Estonian folklorist, much like her idol, Kalev Leevits.

As the days turned into weeks, Merike's excitement grew. She envisioned herself capturing stunning images of snow-covered forests and sparkling frozen lakes, infused with an otherworldly magic. Finally, the day arrived when she would begin shooting for the exhibition.

With her camera in hand, Merike set out to bring the myths and legends of Estonia to life. She spent hours wandering through the forest, waiting for the perfect shot – a flash of light from a snowflake, a glimpse of misty fog, or a fleeting glance from a mythical creature. And when she finally captured the image she had been searching for, Merike knew that her passion and dedication had paid off.

The exhibition was a huge success, with visitors praising Merike's unique perspective on Estonian mythology. As she walked through the crowded halls, surrounded by the beauty of her homeland, Merike smiled to herself, knowing that she had successfully brought the magic of the Jääneväli to life for all to see.
