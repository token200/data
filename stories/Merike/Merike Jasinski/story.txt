Merike Jasinski stepped into the quiet caf√©, her eyes scanning the cozy space as she waited for her friend to arrive. As she sipped on her latte, she couldn't help but think about the past few months since moving back to Tallinn. It had been a whirlwind of adjusting to life in Estonia after years abroad.

Just then, the door swung open and Merike Jasinski's best friend, Anna, walked in, carrying a large stack of books. "Hey, I'm so sorry I'm late!" Anna exclaimed, setting down the books as she plopped down across from her friend.

The two friends spent the next few hours lost in conversation, discussing everything from their careers to their personal struggles. Merike Jasinski confided in Anna about her fears of starting over in a new country, while Anna shared her own anxiety about balancing work and motherhood.

As they talked, Merike Jasinski couldn't help but feel grateful for Anna's unwavering support. The two had met on a solo trip to Europe years ago, bonding over their love of literature and coffee. Since then, they'd been inseparable.

As the afternoon wore on, Anna pulled out her phone and began scrolling through social media. "I found this amazing job posting," she said, showing Merike Jasinski's phone. "It's for a publishing house in Tallinn, and it seems like the perfect fit."

Merike Jasinski's eyes widened with excitement as she read through the job description. This could be her chance to turn her passion into a career again. She made a mental note to apply as soon as possible.

The two friends chatted some more before Anna reluctantly got up to leave. "I have to go, but let's catch up tomorrow?" Anna asked, smiling at Merike Jasinski.

"Definitely," Merike Jasinski replied, watching as her friend disappeared into the crowd outside. With a renewed sense of purpose, she grabbed her bag and headed out into the chilly evening air, feeling more confident than ever about her future in Tallinn.
