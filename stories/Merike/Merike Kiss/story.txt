Merike Kiss stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. It was a chilly winter evening in Tallinn, Estonia, and she had just arrived from a long day of rehearsals with her band. As the lead singer, Merike's voice was known for its haunting beauty, and she took pride in every performance.

As she made her way to the bar, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was Kael, her guitarist, who handed her a steaming cup of coffee. "How was your day?" he asked, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he smiled.

Merike Kiss sipped the hot liquid, feeling the warmth spread through her chilled bones. She had been working tirelessly to perfect her set list for their upcoming tour. The pressure was on to deliver an unforgettable performance, and she was determined to rise to the challenge.

Just then, a group of fans caught her attention. They were dressed in black, adorned with Silver Age symbolism – Merike Kiss's favorite band, Dzintars Līdskauskins. She smiled warmly at them, feeling a sense of connection to the music that had brought them all together.

As she made her way to an empty table by the window, Kael followed close behind. He sat down beside her, his fingers absently strumming the strings on his guitar. The sound was soothing, but Merike's mind was still focused on the show ahead. She began to hum a melody, letting her voice soar as she practiced her vocals.

Kael raised an eyebrow, impressed by her dedication. "You're going to blow them away tonight," he said, his eyes shining with conviction. Merike Kiss smiled, feeling a surge of confidence course through her veins. This was it – the moment she had been working towards for months. With a final check of her gear, she stood up, ready to face the stage and share her music with the world once again.
