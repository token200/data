As a renowned journalist in her home country of Estonia, she had built a reputation for asking the toughest questions and getting to the bottom of even the most complex stories.

One day, Merike received a tip about a local politician who was embroiled in a scandal involving corruption and embezzlement. She saw this as an opportunity to shine a light on the dark underbelly of her country's politics and set out to investigate.
