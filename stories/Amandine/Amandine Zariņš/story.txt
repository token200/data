Amandine Zariņš stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the quaint station as she made her way to the small café across the street. As a freelance journalist, Amandine had spent countless hours in bustling cities, but there was something about this charming town that drew her in.

She settled into a cozy corner table by the window, ordering a cup of black coffee and pulling out her laptop to begin work on her latest article. The words flowed easily as she wrote about the local artisans and their crafts, but Amandine's mind kept wandering back to the strange occurrence that had brought her to this town in the first place.

It started with a cryptic message from an unknown number – a single sentence, typed out in a language Amandine didn't recognize. Despite her better judgment, she'd decided to investigate further, and what she'd uncovered was both fascinating and unsettling. It seemed that the town held secrets beyond its picturesque façade, secrets waiting to be uncovered by someone with Amandine's particular set of skills.

As she worked, Amandine noticed a figure watching her from across the café – a tall, brooding man with piercing green eyes. He sipped his own coffee in silence, but there was an air of intensity about him that made Amandine's skin prickle. She tried to focus on her work, but the stranger's gaze kept drifting back, until finally she found herself wondering what he wanted.

The café door swung open and a bell above it jingled, signaling the arrival of a new patron. The stranger stood up, his movements fluid and economical, and strode across the room. Amandine's heart quickened as he approached her table – but when he reached out to take a seat, she realized with a start that it was a chair for an empty space beside her.

"Mind if I join you?" the stranger asked, his voice low and husky. "My name is Leonidas, by the way." Amandine hesitated for a moment before responding – but as their conversation began, she found herself drawn into a world of intrigue and mystery that went far beyond anything she'd anticipated. With a smile, she introduced herself: Amandine Zariņš, at your service.
