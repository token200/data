Amandine Thomas sat alone at her small desk, staring blankly at the canvas in front of her. She was an artist, or at least she had been for as long as anyone could remember. The problem was, since her grandmother's passing a few months ago, the paint had lost its luster.

Grandma Madeleine had always encouraged Amandine to follow her dreams, to never give up on her art. But now that she was gone, Amandine felt lost and alone. She went through the motions of painting, but it wasn't the same without her grandmother's guidance and support.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was Marie, her best friend from childhood. "Hey, Ami! I heard you were feeling down," she said, plopping herself down in the chair opposite Amandine's desk.

Amandine shrugged, not quite ready to talk about it. But Marie knew better than to pry. She simply sat there, watching as Amandine continued to stare at her canvas.

After a few minutes of silence, Marie got up and began rummaging through Amandine's art supplies. "Hey, what's this?" she asked, holding up a small jar of paint. "Is this the one you were working on before?"

Amandine looked down, feeling a pang of embarrassment. "Yeah," she mumbled.

Marie handed her the jar and said, "Why don't I help you? Sometimes getting your hands dirty can be just what you need."

Together, they began to paint. Amandine closed her eyes and let Marie guide her brushstrokes. It was like a weight had been lifted off her shoulders. The colors seemed brighter, the strokes more confident.

As they worked, memories of Grandma Madeleine flooded back into Amandine's mind. She remembered the way her grandmother used to laugh when she made a mess, the way she would gently take Amandine's brush away and help her clean up.

With Marie by her side, Amandine felt like she was painting for herself again. The colors seemed more vibrant, the strokes more free. It was as if Grandma Madeleine had come back to life, guiding her through the canvas with a gentle but firm hand.

When they finished, Amandine stepped back and admired their work. It wasn't perfect, but it was beautiful in its own way. "Merci, Marie," she said, hugging her friend tightly.

From that day on, Amandine knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, she would face them with the support of those who loved her â€“ like Grandma Madeleine, and now Marie by her side.
