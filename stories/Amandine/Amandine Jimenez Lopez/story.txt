Amandine Jimenez Lopez was a woman with a passion for photography and storytelling. She had always been drawn to the world of images, capturing the beauty and complexity of human experience through her lens.

Growing up in a small town in Mexico, Amandine learned to see the world as a photographer from a young age. Her parents, both artists themselves, encouraged her creativity and supported her dreams.

Inspired by Maria's strength and determination, Amandine dedicated herself to capturing the stories of people like her.
