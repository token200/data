Amandine Oja stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of familiarity. She had been traveling for days, and the exhaustion was starting to take its toll. As she made her way through the crowds, a gentle voice called out her name.

"Amandine Oja?"

She turned to see a young woman with a warm smile and piercing green eyes. "Can I help you?" Amandine asked, her French accent thick from years of living abroad.

"I'm so sorry," the woman said. "I was hoping to find you. My name is Sophia Patel, and we met at your sister's wedding last year. We were supposed to meet up for coffee today, but I got held up in traffic."

Amandine's eyes widened as she processed the situation. Her sister, Colette Oja, had indeed thrown a grand celebration in Paris last summer, and Amandine had missed it by mere weeks. The two women had become fast friends, bonding over their shared love of art and music.

As they walked through the station, Sophia filled Amandine in on her life: her job as a graphic designer, her passion for hiking, and her recent break-up with a boyfriend. Amandine listened attentively, offering words of encouragement and advice.

Over coffee, Sophia revealed that she had been accepted into an art residency program in Berlin, and was leaving the next day. Amandine's heart swelled with pride as she listened to her friend's news. She had always known that Sophia was talented, but this was a major achievement for someone so young.

As they parted ways at the station, Sophia handed Amandine a small package. "I brought you something," she said, smiling mischievously. Inside the package was a sketchbook filled with Sophia's artwork – vibrant colors and bold lines that danced across the pages.

Amandine's eyes welled up as she opened the book, feeling a sense of connection to her friend that transcended distance. "Merci, Sophie," she said, using her nickname for the first time in years. "This means so much to me."

As Amandine watched Sophia disappear into the crowd, she felt a sense of gratitude wash over her. She was grateful for friends like Sophia – people who saw her, heard her, and loved her unconditionally. And as she made her way back to her hotel room, Amandine Oja felt a renewed sense of purpose, knowing that there were kindred spirits out there waiting to be found.
