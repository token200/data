One sunny afternoon, Amandine Ozols stepped out of her studio to grab a coffee from the nearby caf√©. As she waited in line, she noticed a young girl sitting alone at a table by the window, sketching intently with a pencil. Her gaze was captivated by the girl's concentration and curiosity about the world around her.

The girl, it turned out, was named Lily, and she was on summer break from school, eager to explore the city and find new inspiration for her own art. Amandine Ozols was delighted by Lily's enthusiasm and offered to take her on a tour of her studio, sharing her creative process and favorite materials.

"And don't be afraid to let your imagination run wild." And with that, the two artists parted ways, each richer for their encounter, and already looking forward to their next creative adventure together.
