Amandine Sharma was a name that struck fear into the hearts of those who knew her. She was a former hitwoman, known for her ruthless efficiency and unparalleled skill with a gun. But after a job went horribly wrong, Amandine found herself on the run, forced to abandon her life as a hitwoman and start anew.

She took up residence in a small, secluded cabin deep in the woods, where she spent her days honing her skills and rebuilding her sense of self. It was a lonely existence, but one that suited Amandine just fine. She had long since abandoned any hope of redemption or forgiveness, and saw herself as nothing more than a ghost from the past.

One day, a young woman named Sophie stumbled upon the cabin while on a solo hike. At first, she didn't see anything out of the ordinary - just a small, rustic dwelling nestled in the heart of the forest. But as she approached, she noticed something strange: a series of subtle scratches and scuffs on the walls, like the mark of someone who had been here before.

Sophie's curiosity got the better of her, and she cautiously made her way inside. That was when she saw Amandine, standing by the window with her back to her. The woman's movements were stiff and formal, as if she were performing some sort of ritual dance. And then, without warning, she turned to face Sophie.

Their eyes locked in a moment of perfect understanding - two women, bound together by secrets and scars. Amandine didn't speak, but simply gestured for Sophie to sit down. As they sat together on the porch, the silence between them grew thicker, like a fog that threatened to swallow them whole.

Over time, Sophie learned about Amandine's past - the countless lives she had taken, the countless secrets she had kept. And as the truth sank in, Sophie realized that she was staring into the face of a monster. But it was also a reminder that even the most broken and damaged among us can find solace in the simplest things.

In the end, Sophie didn't leave. She stayed with Amandine, learning to navigate the complexities of her troubled mind. And as they walked together through the forest, their footsteps echoed with a newfound sense of purpose - two women finding redemption in each other's eyes.
