Born into a family of modest means, Amandine's love affair with art began in her childhood, when her father, a struggling painter, would spend hours teaching her about color theory and technique.

One day, while researching an exhibition on modern art, Amandine stumbled upon a long-forgotten watercolor by a young artist named Jean-Pierre.
