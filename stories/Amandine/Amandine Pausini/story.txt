I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Amandine Pausini. It's possible that this character is not well-known or doesn't exist in any notable sources.

However, I can create a short story based on your request. Please let me know if you'd like me to write about a different character or if you have any specific preferences for the story (e.g., genre, tone, etc.).

If you'd like, I can also try to find some information on real-life people with similar names and create a fictional account based on them. For example, Eros Ramazzotti and Pausini are Italian music singers and the husband of Eros Ramazzotti is Gianpaolo Pausini
