Theo Palmas stepped into the dimly lit bar, his eyes scanning the room with a mixture of curiosity and disdain. He had been warned that this was a place where people came to escape their troubles, but Theo wasn't one for escapism. He was a man on a mission.

As he made his way to the bar, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was Marcus, an old acquaintance who owed Theo a favor. "Theo, I see you're here," Marcus said, his voice low and gravelly. "I heard you were looking for someone."

Theo nodded curtly. "Yes. I need to speak with Elianore Quasar."

Marcus raised an eyebrow. "You know that's not going to be easy. Elianore is...indisposed at the moment."

Theo snorted. "Indisposed? That's code for 'hiding from her past'." He leaned in, his voice taking on a conspiratorial tone. "I've heard rumors about what really happened to your sister. And I think it's time we got to the bottom of it."

Marcus hesitated, but Theo could see the gears turning in his mind. He nodded, and led Theo to a back room deep within the bar.

As they waited, Theo couldn't help but notice the atmosphere. The air was thick with secrets and lies, and he felt like an outsider looking in. But he pushed that feeling aside, focusing on the task at hand.

When Elianore finally appeared, it was clear that she had been expecting them. Her eyes were sunken, her skin pale, but there was a spark of defiance in their depths.

"I know what you want to know," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "But I'm not sure I'm ready to talk about it."

Theo's expression softened, and for a moment, he almost felt a pang of sympathy for Elianore. But then his gaze snapped back to hers, his jaw clenched in determination.

"I need to know the truth," he said, his voice firm. "About what happened to your sister. And I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get it."

Elianore's eyes flashed with anger, but she seemed to be calculating something. After a long moment, she nodded, and began to speak in a low, measured tone.

"It was an accident," she said, her voice laced with pain. "But it was also...deliberate. My sister was working on a project that could have changed the course of history. And someone wanted to stop her."

Theo's eyes narrowed, his mind racing with possibilities. He knew he had stumbled into something much bigger than himself.

As he left the bar with Marcus by his side, Theo couldn't shake off the feeling that this was just the beginning of a very long and complicated journey.
