Theo Bergstrom stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of rain-soaked streets wafting up to greet her. It was a smell that transported her back to her childhood summers spent exploring the coastal town with her grandmother.

As she made her way through the crowded station, Theo's thoughts turned to the reason she'd returned to Ravenswood. Her grandmother had passed away, leaving behind a small inheritance and a note encouraging Theo to come home.

Theo had always been close to her grandmother, who'd taught her everything from the art of traditional baking to the stories of their family's history. Growing up, Theo would spend hours listening to her grandmother's tales of love and loss, of triumph and heartache. And now, with her grandmother gone, Theo felt lost without her guiding presence.

She hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of her grandmother's old house. As they drove through the streets, Theo noticed how much had changed. The old family home was still standing, but it looked smaller, more worn, than she remembered. She paid the driver and stepped out onto the sidewalk, feeling a sense of nostalgia wash over her.

Theo pushed open the creaky front door and slipped inside. The air was thick with dust and memories. She wandered through the empty rooms, taking in the familiar sights and sounds. In the kitchen, she found a note tucked into an old recipe book.

"Dear Theo," it read, "I know I won't be here to see you when you need me most, but I want you to know that I'll always be with you. You're strong and capable, just like your mother before you. Don't forget the stories we shared, and don't lose sight of who you are."

Theo smiled, feeling a sense of peace settle over her. She knew she still had a long way to go, but with her grandmother's words echoing in her mind, she felt ready to face whatever came next.
