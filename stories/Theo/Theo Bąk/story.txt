As he arrived at the clock tower, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was a woman with piercing green eyes and long, raven-black hair. She introduced herself as Sofia, a former government agent who had been coerced into silence by her own handlers.

Theo Bąk listened intently as Sofia revealed a shocking truth: a powerful corporation had infiltrated every level of government, manipulating policies to suit their own interests.
