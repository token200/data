As a child, Theo spent hours watching his abuela (grandmother) paint intricate designs on ceramics, learning the delicate balance between precision and creativity. He would often sit beside her, mesmerized by the way her brushstrokes danced across the clay. This early exposure to art had sparked something within him, and he knew from a young age that he wanted to follow in her footsteps.
