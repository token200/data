Boris Altmann was a man with a reputation for being unorthodox. A German-born detective, he had made a name for himself in the small town of Ravensburg by solving cases that no one else could crack. His approach to detective work was rooted in his fascination with the human psyche and his ability to read people like a book.

One sunny afternoon, Boris received a visit from the local police chief, Herr Müller. "Boris, we have a problem," Müller said, his brow furrowed with concern. "The mayor's daughter has gone missing, and we're stumped."

Boris listened intently as Müller outlined the details of the case. The mayor's daughter, Sophia, had been last seen leaving her apartment in the middle of the night. Her car was still parked outside, but there were no signs of foul play. It was as if she had vanished into thin air.

Boris set to work immediately, beginning by interviewing the people who knew Sophia best. He spent hours talking to her friends, family members, and acquaintances, searching for any hint that might lead him to the truth. As he listened to their stories, Boris noticed a pattern - each of them seemed to be hiding something.

As the sun began to set, Boris decided it was time to take a walk along the riverbank, where Sophia had last been seen. The air was cool and crisp, carrying the scent of blooming flowers. Boris closed his eyes, taking a deep breath, and let his mind wander.

Suddenly, an image flashed into his head - a young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She was standing on the riverbank, staring out at the water. The image sent shivers down Boris's spine. Who was this mysterious woman?

The next morning, Boris paid another visit to Müller. "I think I've found something," he said, his voice low and confident. "There's a witness who places Sophia near the river last night. But what caught my attention is that she didn't appear alone."

Müller raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean?"

"I mean that our missing person was with someone else," Boris replied. "And I think we can find them by retracing her steps on that fateful night."

Within hours, the police had located Sophia and her companion - a charismatic stranger who claimed to be a friend from university. As Boris watched the two of them being led away in handcuffs, he couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction.

The game was afoot once more, and Boris Altmann was ready for whatever came next.
