Alwin Grabowska, a former professional wrestler, sat alone in his small apartment, staring blankly at the worn-out photo album on his coffee table. The faded pictures showed him in his prime, flexing muscles and posing for the cameras after every victory in the ring.

As he flipped through the pages, memories came flooding back – the roar of the crowd, the thrill of adrenaline coursing through his veins, and the rush of winning championships. But those days were long gone now.

A knee injury had forced him to hang up his boots, leaving behind a shattered body and a sense of identity lost. His career had been defined by the grueling grapple and the roar of the crowd, but without it, who was he?

Alwin sighed, running a hand through his thinning hair. He stared at his reflection in the TV screen as he watched an old wrestling match play on the small console.

"Who am I now?" he muttered to himself.

The phone rang, shattering the silence. It was his childhood friend, Wlodzimierz, calling to check in. "Hey, Alwin! How's life treating you? You've been out of sight for ages!"

Alwin forced a chuckle. "It's...interesting," he said, avoiding the truth.

Wlodzimierz laughed. "You're always good for some humor! Come visit me and my family soon. We'll show you how to have real fun – no wrestling gear required."

As they chatted, Alwin's mind wandered back to his pre-wrestling days. He had been an engineer by training, working on projects in a corporate office. Life was stable but dull.

Wlodzimierz continued, "You know what we should do? Start that woodworking shop you've always talked about!"

Alwin's ears perked up at the suggestion. His father had been a woodworker, and he remembered spending countless hours watching him create beautiful pieces from raw wood. That sparked something within Alwin.

"Hey, why not?" he said, his voice filled with excitement. "Let's do it!"

When Wlodzimierz ended the call, Alwin leapt off the couch, determination in his eyes. He began rummaging through old storage containers and dusty shelves, searching for every woodworking tool and piece of equipment his father had passed down.

With each carefully crafted wooden object taking shape under his hands, Alwin rediscovered a part of himself he thought was lost forever. The sweat dripped from his brow as the pieces fell into place, just like the years ago when his body had been a machine for wrestling.

"I'm making myself whole again," he whispered to himself, the adrenaline coursing through his veins now replaced with the joy of creation.

That night, under the soft glow of the porch light, Alwin worked on his latest project – a intricately carved wooden statue. Every stroke told a story of rebirth, as the pieces began to resemble a man emerging from the dust – just like him.

When Wlodzimierz walked into the apartment, he found Alwin lost in thought and covered with sawdust. His eyes sparkled in that same wrestling ring intensity he once wore on his face.

"I've been thinking about my old life," Alwin said softly, a hint of smile creeping onto his lips.

"I have too," Wlodzimierz replied gently. "It's never too late to rediscover yourself – just like you're making this beautiful piece here."

Alwin looked up at him and smiled. The roar of the crowd still echoed in his ears; but it was no longer about winning championships – now, it was about creating something new, something true.
