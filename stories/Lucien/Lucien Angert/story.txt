Lucien Angert stood at the edge of the cliff, gazing out at the vast expanse of ocean below. The setting sun cast a golden glow over the waves, and for a moment, he forgot about the weight that had been crushing him lately.

As a detective with the NYPD, Lucien was no stranger to darkness and despair. But his latest case had hit closer to home than any other. A string of seemingly unrelated murders had taken place in Manhattan's elite neighborhoods, leaving a trail of terrorized residents and baffled investigators.

Lucien's eyes narrowed as he thought back on the cold statistics: three victims in one week, all with one thing in common – they'd been seen arguing with someone around 10 pm that night. The detective had been working non-stop for days, poring over evidence and interviewing witnesses, but nothing seemed to add up.

Just then, his phone buzzed with an incoming call from his boss, Captain James. Lucien hesitated before answering, knowing he'd rather face whatever was coming next alone.

"Lucien, we've got something," the captain said, his voice firm. "One of our sources has come forward – a young woman who claims she witnessed one of the victims arguing with a suspect on the night of their murder."

The description sent a shiver down Lucien's spine. He'd seen it before – the same mixture of fear and vulnerability that haunted him to this day.

He arrived at the witness's apartment, a small studio in Upper East Side, just as the sun dipped below the horizon. The young woman, Emma, was nervous but determined to tell her story.

Lucien listened attentively as she recounted what she'd seen: a tall, imposing figure lurking around 10 pm that night. As he scribbled notes, his mind began to weave together fragments of evidence – the suspicious strangers spotted on surveillance footage, the peculiar tattoos on the victims' wrists...

Suddenly, it all clicked into place.

"Captain?" Lucien said, already dialing the captain's number from memory. "I think I've got our guy."

There was a pause before James responded, his voice laced with skepticism. But Lucien knew what he'd found – and he was willing to bet that this lead would bring an end to the string of murders haunting Manhattan's elite.

For now, at least, Lucien had solved another piece of the puzzle.
