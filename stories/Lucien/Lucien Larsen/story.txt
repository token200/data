Lucien Larsen stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit pub, shaking the water from his coat. As a private investigator, he'd seen his fair share of shady characters, but there was something about this particular case that had him spooked.

He spotted the client, a nervous-looking young woman named Sophia, sipping on a whiskey at the bar. She glanced up as Lucien approached, her eyes darting towards the empty stool beside her.

"Mind if I join you?" he asked, his voice low and soothing.

Sophia hesitated before nodding, her hands shaking as she handed him a cigarette pack. "Just get to it, Mr. Larsen. I've been waiting for hours."

Lucien took a seat, lighting the cigarette as Sophia explained that her sister had gone missing three days ago. The local police were stumped, and Sophia suspected foul play.

As Lucien listened intently, he pulled out his notebook and began scribbling down notes. He asked follow-up questions, probing for details about her sister's last days before disappearing. Sophia spoke hesitantly, mentioning rumors of a suspicious man lurking around their apartment complex on the night of the disappearance.

Lucien's mind was already racing with possibilities. He made a mental note to pay a visit to the complex and interview the security guards. Maybe there was more to this case than met the eye.

Just as they were about to part ways, a suited figure appeared at Sophia's side, flashing a badge. "Sorry to interrupt, miss," he said, his tone dripping with condescension. "I'm Agent Thompson from the FBI. We've received new information in the missing persons case."

Lucien raised an eyebrow, sensing a game of cat and mouse brewing. He leaned forward, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Tell me more, Agent Thompson."

Thompson's eyes darted towards Lucien before returning to Sophia. "We believe your sister may be involved with organized crime. We need you to cooperate fully."

Sophia's face contorted in anguish as she begged off, pleading for Lucien to help her find the truth. Lucien watched as the FBI agent swept Sophia away, a knot forming in his stomach.

He took a long drag on his cigarette, his eyes scanning the pub. Who was this woman's sister really? And what lay behind the sinister events unfolding before him?

With a resolute determination, Lucien knew he'd be back to digging for answers soon.
