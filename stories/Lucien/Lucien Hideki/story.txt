Lucien's obsession with solving the impossible began at a young age, inspired by his father, who was also a detective. Together, they would scour the streets, following leads and piecing together clues that seemed like puzzles to others. It was this training that had honed Lucien Hideki's exceptional skills, allowing him to track down even the most elusive suspects.

One case in particular had become an obsession for Lucien Hideki - a string of high-profile thefts at priceless art galleries across the city. The thief seemed to always be one step ahead, leaving behind no discernible evidence and sending the police department into a frenzy.

Determined to crack the code, Lucien poured over every detail, studying the security footage, interviewing witnesses, and conducting his own research. His colleagues often joked that he was like a dog with a bone - once he had it in his sights, nothing could deter him from solving the case.

As the days turned into weeks, Lucien Hideki remained steadfast, convinced that he was close to catching the thief. And then, one fateful night, it happened. The call came in from an anonymous source claiming to have information about the next target. With his heart racing and adrenaline pumping, Lucien Hideki set out to intercept the tip, following a trail of breadcrumbs that led him straight into the heart of the art world.
