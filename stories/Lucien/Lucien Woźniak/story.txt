Lucien Woźniak stepped out of his small Parisian apartment, onto the rain-soaked streets. He lit a cigarette, watching as the smoke curled upwards towards the grey sky. The fog rolled in off the Seine, shrouding the city in mystery.

As a young man, Lucien had grown up with dreams of adventure and danger. A former spy, he'd spent years working for the Polish intelligence service, taking on missions that would put even the most seasoned operatives to the test. But after a botched operation left him gravely injured, Lucien retired from the game.

Or so he thought.

A whispered message from an old acquaintance had led him back into the shadows. This time, however, it wasn't about saving lives or uncovering secrets - just about retrieving a small package that might hold the key to unraveling the mystery of his own troubled past.

As Lucien walked through the deserted streets, he noticed something odd. Every face seemed to be watching him, their features shifting like shadows in the gloom. He'd always been able to blend in, but now it felt like he was being sized up for some unseen reckoning.

He arrived at a cramped café on the outskirts of town, where his contact waited - a hooded figure with eyes that seemed to hold a secret or two. They exchanged nods, and Lucien took his seat at a table by the window.

"Where is it?" he asked, voice low and even.

The figure handed over a small package, wrapped in black silk. Lucien unwrapped it, revealing a tiny silver pendant with an inscription that read "Ewa".

His heart skipped a beat as memories flooded back - Ewa, his lost love, the woman who had vanished without a word after he was sent on a mission to protect her. The pendant felt heavy in his hand, like a weight that pulled him down into darkness.

As Lucien tucked the pendant into his pocket, he knew he'd been drawn into something much bigger than himself - something that would take him back to the very edges of his own history.
