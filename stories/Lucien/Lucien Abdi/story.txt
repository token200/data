It was on a drizzly evening that Lucien Abdi received a call from an unknown number. The voice on the other end was urgent and whispered, "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. I have information about your sister." Lucien's heart skipped a beat as he listened intently to the stranger's words.

The next night, under the pale light of the moon, Lucien Abdi made his way to the abandoned clock tower. As he approached, a figure emerged from the shadows. "Who are you?" Lucien demanded, his hand instinctively reaching for his gun.
