Lucien Claudius Nero was not your average aristocrat. Behind his polished facade, he hid a secret: a passion for the theatre. As a member of one of London's most influential families, Lucien had always been expected to follow in his father's footsteps and take over the family business. But every time he looked at his father's ledger, he felt suffocated by the thought of being trapped in a life that wasn't his own.

One night, after a particularly grueling day of politics, Lucien decided to sneak out and attend a performance at Covent Garden Theatre. He was captivated by the raw energy of the actors on stage and the way they brought characters to life with nothing but words and movement. From that moment on, he was hooked.

Under the cover of darkness, Lucien began sneaking into theatre performances whenever he could. He devoured plays and novels, devouring lines like a starving man at an all-you-can-eat buffet. His family thought him mad, but Lucien couldn't help himself. The thrill of being a part of something that didn't involve suits and ties was intoxicating.

As the months passed, Lucien's performances became more frequent, and his connection to the theatre grew stronger. He even started writing his own plays, pouring his heart onto the page in stolen moments whenever he could find them. His family thought it was all just a phase, but deep down, they knew something about their son that no one else did.

One fateful night, Lucien mustered up the courage to approach the theatre owner, Mr. Wilkins, with an offer: would he be willing to give him a chance to act on stage? The result was nothing short of miraculous – Lucien found himself playing Romeo opposite a young ingenue named Sophie, in front of a packed audience.

As they took their final bow, something shifted inside Lucien. He knew that this was what he was meant for. No longer would he be defined by his family's expectations or bound by the constraints of polite society. The stage was where he belonged – and nothing would ever pull him away from it again.
