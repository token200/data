One rainy evening, as the streets were eerily quiet, Lucien received a visit from an old acquaintance, Emily Windsor. Her voice trembled with urgency as she explained that her sister, Alice, was missing. The police seemed stumped, and Emily had heard whispers that Lucien Babler might be the only one who could help.

Intrigued by the challenge, Lucien agreed to take on the case. He spent countless hours poring over documents, interviewing witnesses, and retracing Alice's final steps.
