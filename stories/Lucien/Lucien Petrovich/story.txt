He moved with an air of confidence, his tailored suits and impeccable grooming making him a standout in any room. As a renowned art dealer, Lucien had built a reputation for himself as one of the most influential figures in the art world.

Rumors swirled around Lucien Petrovich about his past, with some claiming he was a member of a wealthy Russian dynasty and others whispering that he was an undercover agent. Whatever the truth may have been, one thing was certain: Lucien had an uncanny ability to sniff out rare and valuable art pieces.

One evening, at an exclusive charity gala, Lucien Petrovich locked eyes with a mysterious woman across the room.
