Lucien Yumi stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. The sleepy town of Ashwood lay before her, its streets lined with old buildings that seemed to slumber under a perpetual veil of dust.

As she made her way through the deserted streets, Lucien's thoughts drifted back to her past. She had grown up in this very town, where everyone knew each other's names and secrets. But Lucien's life hadn't been like that for long. She had left Ashwood behind, chasing a dream of becoming an artist.

Her journey had taken her far from home, but the call of creativity remained strong within her. Now, at 25, Lucien was finally returning to Ashwood with a new project in mind – to restore the old town hall, now a dilapidated shell that seemed to mock her own abandoned dreams.

As she walked, the worn pavement beneath her feet led her to a small café on Main Street. Inside, the proprietor, an elderly woman named Emily, looked up from behind the counter and smiled warmly at Lucien's familiar face.

"Lucie Yumi! It's been ages," Emily said, using the old nickname that few people used anymore.

Lucien returned the smile, feeling a pang of nostalgia wash over her. "Emily, it's been too long. I'm glad to be back."

The café was quiet, but as Lucien sat down and ordered a cup of coffee, a group of locals began to filter in, their eyes locking onto her with curiosity. Some nodded or whispered greetings, while others simply looked away.

Lucien knew that in Ashwood, everyone had secrets – some small, some grand. But for now, she chose to ignore the whispers, instead focusing on her new project and its promise of redemption.

As she finished her coffee and prepared to leave, Emily approached her with a worn leather portfolio clutched tightly in her hands.

"Lucie Yumi," Emily said again, "I think I might have something for you. A hidden room deep within the old town hall, untouched since...well, ever."

Lucien's eyes lit up as she took the portfolio and felt an excitement course through her veins that had been missing from Ashwood for years.

"Let me see," Lucien said, a small smile playing on her lips.

And with that, the old wheels of curiosity were set in motion.
