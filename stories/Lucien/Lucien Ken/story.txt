Lucien Ken stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the bustling streets of Tokyo. His eyes scanned the crowded sidewalks, searching for any sign of trouble. As a freelance journalist, he had made a name for himself by sniffing out corruption and scandal.

A faint rustling in his pocket broke the silence. He reached in and pulled out his phone, scrolling through the latest tips from an anonymous source. The message read: "Meet me at Shibuya Crossing at midnight. Come alone."

Lucien's instincts kicked in. This could be it – the break he had been waiting for. But something about the message didn't sit right with him. Who was this mysterious informant, and what did they want?

As he made his way to the meeting spot, Lucien couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He glanced over his shoulder, but the crowded streets were a blur of strangers.

At midnight, Lucien stood at the edge of Shibuya Crossing, scanning the sea of faces for any sign of recognition. A figure emerged from the shadows – a woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair.

"You're the one who's been sending me messages," Lucien stated, his hand resting on the camera around his neck.

The woman nodded, her gaze locked onto his. "I have information about the corrupt politician, Ryota Nakamura. I think you're the only one brave enough to expose him."

Lucien's eyes narrowed. This was big – but also a risk. If he published the story, it could ruin not just Nakamura's career, but also his own reputation.

"I'm listening," Lucien said, his pen poised over his notebook.

The woman handed him a small USB drive. "Evidence of Nakamura's embezzlement scheme. Be careful, Ken – there are those who will stop at nothing to keep this quiet."

As the woman vanished into the crowd, Lucien plugged in the USB drive and began scrolling through the files. The corruption went all the way to the top, with Nakamura's name at the center.

This was it – the story of a lifetime. But would he have the courage to publish it?
