I must correct you - there is no notable public figure by the name of Louis Pausini. However, I believe you may be referring to Lucio Dalla's song "Caruso" which mentions a singer named Caruso who was actually Enrico Caruso, but also another famous singer by that name in Italy is not very well known, however there is an Italian singer-songwriter named Eros Ramazzotti and then the American singer Louis Prima, also an Italian singer, Luciano Pavarotti's friend,  and a famous Italian singer, songwriter and musician, Louis Pausini does not seem to be a notable person.
