Louis Horváth stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. As he made his way to the bar, a figure caught his attention - an old friend, Mária, sitting alone by the window. She looked lost in thought, her eyes fixed on some invisible point beyond the panes of glass.

Louis Horváth's curiosity got the better of him, and he approached Mária with a gentle smile. "Mind if I join you?" he asked, taking a seat beside her. Mária turned to him, her expression softening as she saw Louis Horváth's familiar face.

"Not at all," she replied, her voice barely above a whisper. The two friends fell into an uncomfortable silence, each lost in their own thoughts. Louis Horváth was the first to break the spell, ordering a coffee and turning his attention back to Mária.

"What's on your mind?" he asked gently, his eyes locking onto hers. Mária hesitated before speaking, her words spilling out in a rush. "I've been feeling lost lately," she confessed. "Like I'm just going through the motions of life without any real purpose."

Louis Horváth listened attentively, his expression empathetic. He knew that feeling all too well, having struggled with similar demons himself. As they sipped their coffee in silence, Louis Horváth found himself drawn to Mária's vulnerability.

"Tell me more," he said softly, his voice encouraging her to continue. And so, Mária opened up about her fears and doubts, sharing her dreams and aspirations with Louis Horváth. The older man listened attentively, offering words of wisdom and comfort whenever she needed it.

As the hours passed, Louis Horváth found himself feeling a sense of peace wash over him. He was grateful for the opportunity to connect with Mária on such a deep level. In that moment, he knew that his friendship with her was something truly special - one that transcended words and went to the very heart of who they were as individuals.

As Louis Horváth prepared to leave, Mária reached out and took his hand. "Thank you," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. Louis Horváth smiled, feeling a sense of connection with this dear friend that he couldn't quite put into words.
