Louis Polo stepped into the crowded café, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. He spotted his friend, Rachel, sitting alone at a corner table, sipping on a cup of coffee. Louis made his way over to her, flashing a charming smile as he reached her side.

"Hey, Rach! What's new with you?" Louis Polo asked, taking a seat across from her.

Rachel smiled back, "Not much, Lou. Just got back from a trip and feeling a bit lost." She gazed out the window, staring at the passersby.

Louis listened intently as Rachel poured out her frustrations about returning to their small town after a year abroad. He nodded sympathetically, offering words of encouragement. As they chatted, Louis Polo's mind wandered back to his own adventures in Europe, where he had spent several months studying art and honing his skills as a painter.

"I'm thinking of staying for another few months," Louis said, breaking the silence. "I want to capture some of this city's energy on canvas."

Rachel raised an eyebrow. "You know you're always welcome back home, Lou. We'll miss you, but we also need some space from your art."

Louis chuckled. "Space? You mean so I can paint more?"

Rachel laughed, playfully rolling her eyes. "Yeah, that too."

As the afternoon wore on, Louis Polo found himself lost in conversation with Rachel once again. The café was quiet now, except for the clinking of cups and the hum of the espresso machine. As they prepared to part ways, Louis offered to walk Rachel back to her car.

Outside, Louis Polo asked one last question: "Hey Rach, when are you planning on heading out to the coast? I've been itching to get some sea air."

Rachel hesitated for a moment before responding, "Actually, I was thinking of going soon. Maybe next weekend?"

Louis's eyes lit up with excitement at the prospect of spending more time by the ocean. As they said their goodbyes, Louis Polo couldn't help but feel grateful for the close friendship he shared with Rachel.

With a smile on his face and a spring in his step, Louis Polo headed off into the evening, ready to tackle whatever adventures lay ahead.
