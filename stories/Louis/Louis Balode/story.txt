Louis Balode stepped out of the rain-soaked streets and into his favorite café, shaking the water from his umbrella. He slid onto a stool at the counter, greeting the owner, Viktor, with a nod.

"Viktor, my friend," Louis said, taking a seat on his usual stool. "I've been looking for you."

Viktor raised an eyebrow behind the counter, wiping down the bar with a dirty rag. "What can I get for you, Louis? You're not here for the coffee, are you?"

Louis chuckled and shook his head. He knew Viktor was a smart man, but he was also a sentimental one. The past six years had been tough on him, and Viktor's café had become a refuge.

"No, it's not about the coffee," Louis said, signaling to Viktor with a hand gesture. "I'm looking for something else."

Viktor poured himself a glass of water, his eyes narrowing slightly as he waited for Louis to continue.

"It's my sister, Anastasija," Louis said, his voice low and measured. "She went missing five years ago. I've been searching for her ever since."

Viktor's expression softened, and he slid onto the stool beside Louis. "What makes you think she might be here now?" he asked.

Louis smiled wryly. "I've got a lead," he said, pulling out a small notebook from his jacket pocket and flipping through its pages until stopping at one particular entry. Viktor leaned in closer as Louis read out the details of an address on the outskirts of town - a place that had been recently abandoned.

The two men sat in silence for a moment, processing this new information. Finally, Louis pushed back his chair and stood up, extending a hand to Viktor.

"Let's go," he said.

Viktor hesitated, unsure if he should be involved, but something in Louis' eyes made him trust him again. Together, the two men set out into the rain-soaked streets, determined to find Anastasija Balode once and for all.
