But Louis's past was shrouded in mystery, known only to a select few. Some said she was born into a life of crime, while others claimed she had once been a high-society socialite, turned rogue by some unknown catalyst. Whatever the truth may be, one thing was certain: Louis Shu-fen was a force to be reckoned with.

Her latest mark was the infamous Museum of Antiquities in Tokyo, where a priceless artifact had gone missing. The police were stumped, and the museum's reputation hung in the balance.
