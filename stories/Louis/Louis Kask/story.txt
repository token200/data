Louis Kask, a man with an unassuming demeanor, walked into the crowded coffee shop, scanning the room for a familiar face. He had been friends with Rachel since college, and she was the only person who still managed to make him laugh, even after all these years.

As he waited in line, Louis thought about his life's work – running a small bakery in the city. It wasn't the most glamorous job, but it allowed him to be creative and bring joy to people through his pastries. He took pride in being able to craft each item with precision, from the flaky crust of his croissants to the intricate designs on his cakes.

When it was finally his turn to order, Louis greeted Rachel with a warm smile. "Hey, RK," he said, using his nickname for her, "I didn't know you were in today."

Rachel laughed and playfully rolled her eyes. "Of course I am, LK. What's new with you?"

Louis ordered his usual coffee and joined Rachel at a small table by the window. As they sipped their drinks, Louis couldn't help but notice the curious glances from passersby. He had always been content with living in the shadows of his own success – the bakery was well-known for its delicious treats, but he preferred to stay out of the spotlight.

Over coffee, Rachel filled Louis in on her latest projects. She was working on a new novel, and Louis couldn't help but offer words of encouragement. "You're going to make it big with that one," he said, genuinely believing it.

As they parted ways, Louis felt grateful for the friendship that had endured despite his attempts to keep a low profile. Rachel was more than just a friend – she was a confidante and a partner in crime. And as he walked back to his bakery, Louis couldn't help but wonder what other adventures lay ahead for him and his dear friend, RK.
