Ella Wei sat alone at the small café, sipping her lukewarm coffee as she stared out the rain-soaked window. The droplets slid down the glass like tears from her own eyes. It had been two weeks since her grandmother passed away, and the grief still felt like a heavy weight pressing down on her chest.

As a young artist, Ella found solace in the brushstrokes of paint that danced across her canvas. Her grandmother, Ah-Ma, had been her closest confidante and inspiration. Ah-Ma would often sit beside Ella as she painted, offering words of encouragement and sharing stories of their ancestors who had struggled to build a life in this new land.

Ella's fingers drummed against the cup as memories flooded back – Ah-Ma's warm smile, her bright laughter, the way she'd wrap her arms around Ella like a hug when she felt lost. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes, but she refused to let them fall. Not now. Not while she was still painting.

She pulled out her sketchbook from her bag and began to work on a new piece, inspired by the rain that seemed to match the rhythm of her heart. As she drew, Ella felt Ah-Ma's presence beside her – the ghostly touch of her hand guiding hers, as if urging her to keep creating.

The hours ticked by like falling leaves outside. Ella lost track of time as she worked on her piece, 'Rainy Days and Memories'. The colors blended together in a swirling storm of blue and grey, reminiscent of Ah-Ma's eyes – a deep sadness that belied the joy and love they'd shared.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the city in a soft orange glow, Ella stepped back from her canvas. Her eyes locked onto 'Rainy Days and Memories', now a vibrant reflection of her own turmoil. Tears finally broke free, falling like raindrops on the paper as she whispered Ah-Ma's name.

For a moment, the pain seemed to lift, replaced by the sense of purpose that came with creating something beautiful from the fragments of her heart. Ella knew that she would carry Ah-Ma's memory with her always – not just through her art, but in every step, every breath she took.
