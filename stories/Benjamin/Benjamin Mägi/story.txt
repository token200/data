Benjamin Mägi trudged through the snow-covered streets, his eyes scanning the rooftops for any sign of the mysterious package. It was the fourth one he'd received in as many weeks, each one containing only a small note with a single word: "Wait."

A Estonian detective with a passion for puzzles and riddles, Benjamin had been stumped by these enigmatic messages. His colleagues thought him mad, chasing after a phantom game of cat-and-mouse. But Benjamin knew better.

As he turned the corner onto Maarja Street, he spotted a small café tucked away between two larger buildings. The sign above the door read "Kalev" in bold letters. This was the place where the package had been delivered three days ago, according to the note.

Benjamin pushed open the door and stepped inside. The café was warm and cozy, filled with the scent of fresh coffee and baked goods. Behind the counter stood a petite woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair, who looked up as Benjamin entered.

"Ah, Benjamin Mägi," she said, her voice dripping with sweetness. "Welcome back."

Benjamin slid onto a stool at the counter, his eyes locked on hers. "You have something for me, I presume?"

The woman nodded, disappearing into the kitchen. She returned with a small package wrapped in brown paper and twine.

"For you," she said, setting it down on the counter.

Benjamin unwrapped the paper to reveal a beautifully crafted wooden box. He lifted the lid, revealing a delicate silver music box inside.

"This is beautiful," he breathed. "What does it mean?"

The woman smiled, a sly glint in her eye. "That's for you to figure out, detective."

As Benjamin opened the music box, a soft melody filled the air. The notes seemed to dance on the wind, leading him on a wild chase through Estonia's hidden corners and secret histories.

And then, as suddenly as it had begun, everything stopped.

Benjamin looked up at the woman, his eyes narrowing. "You're playing me," he accused, but she just laughed, the sound like music itself.

"You'll figure it out eventually, detective," she said, before disappearing into the night, leaving Benjamin to unravel the next piece of his puzzle.
