One day, while wandering through a local market, Benjamin Lace stumbled upon a small, independent record store. The owner, a kind-eyed woman named Sophia, took him under her wing and introduced him to a world of underground music that he had never known existed before. She played him recordings by avant-garde composers and experimental musicians who pushed the boundaries of sound in ways he couldn't even begin to comprehend.
