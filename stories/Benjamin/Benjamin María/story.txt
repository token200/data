Benjamin María was an enigmatic figure, shrouded in mystery. He lived on the outskirts of a small town, where the desert stretched as far as the eye could see. Few knew much about him, except that he kept to himself, tending to his lush garden and lost, old books.

Benjamin's eyes seemed to hold secrets of their own - pools of turquoise that sparkled with ancient wisdom. His hair was long and unkempt, tangled with threads of silver, a testament to his years spent in the desert sun. He moved with an air of quiet confidence, as if he knew every secret in the town.

People said that Benjamin could read the wind. Some even claimed that he could see into another world - a realm where time was currency and wisdom was traded for coin. Others whispered that he had made pacts with ancient spirits, and they whispered back to him through dreams.

But few dared to ask him about his past. Those who did found themselves tangled in an intricate web of riddles and stories that seemed impossible to unravel. Benjamin's tongue was a river of metaphors, each phrase painting vivid pictures in the mind of those brave enough to listen.

One day, a young girl wandered into town with a small book clutched tightly in her hand. She had found it buried beneath the surface of an ancient canal, its pages worn by time and water. As she wandered the streets, lost, she stumbled upon Benjamin's garden, where he was sitting on a bench, surrounded by books.

Without a word, he took the book from her hands and held it up to the light. The pages fluttered with an otherworldly energy as if awakening from a long slumber. The girl watched, mesmerized, as the words transformed into swirling patterns that danced before her eyes.

"You have found something," Benjamin said finally, handing the book back to her. "Will you listen?"

The girl nodded, entranced by his gaze. As they sat together on the bench, she listened to tales of distant lands and magical powers. The wind whispered secrets in her ear, while ancient spirits chimed in with cryptic messages.

As night fell, Benjamin rose from the bench, his eyes glinting like stars in a midnight sky. He smiled softly at the girl, and for an instant, it seemed that he revealed to her the mystery of his very being - that he was neither human nor spirit, but a creature woven of threads of time itself.

The next morning, she returned to town with only one thing on her mind: the memory of Benjamin María's whispered words.
