Benjamin Ali was a man with a passion for restoring old cars. He had spent years scouring junkyards and attending auctions, searching for the perfect project vehicle. Finally, he found it - a 1969 Mustang Fastback that looked like it had been plucked straight from a classic car advertisement.

As Benjamin delved into the restoration process, he discovered that the car's history was just as fascinating as its design. The owner's manual listed a series of peculiar maintenance records, including regular tune-ups and a mysterious "special" oil change. Intrigued, Benjamin began to dig deeper into the Mustang's past.

After months of research, Benjamin finally tracked down the original owner - a young mechanic named Jack Harris who had bought the car new in 1969. Harris told Benjamin that he had restored the Mustang himself, using techniques passed down from his grandfather, a renowned car builder.

Overhearing this conversation, another man at the garage suddenly perked up, as if remembering something. "I used to work with your grandfather," he said. "We were rivals in more than one area." The old mechanic's eyes widened. "You mean Joe Wilson? No, wait, that can't be you."

The rival mechanic explained that his name was actually Jack Harris's business partner - and Benjamin Ali had unknowingly just found the owner of a much younger version of the car he had been restoring.

Convinced by this conversation about finding old information on the car and its connections to Joe Wilson.
