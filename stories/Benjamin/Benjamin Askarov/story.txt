Benjamin Askarov was a man shrouded in mystery. A former spy, he had spent years navigating the shadows of international espionage before disappearing into obscurity. His past was a labyrinth of secrets and half-truths, with only whispers of his true identity filtering out to those closest to him.

One crisp autumn evening, Benjamin found himself sipping whiskey at a small, unassuming bar in Berlin's Kreuzberg district. The bartender, an elderly woman with piercing green eyes, seemed to sense something about him that put her on edge. She poured his drink with a measured slowness, as if the contents might somehow betray him.

Benjamin took a sip of his whiskey and nodded at the bartender, their silent understanding palpable in the air. As he sipped his drink, his mind began to wander back to the cases he had handled in his former life. A mole in MI6, a double agent working for Russian intelligence – each betrayal had left its mark on him.

He couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching him from across the room. The bartender glanced at her watch and stood up, saying something in rapid German that Benjamin didn't quite understand. With an unnerving smile, she turned to leave.

As she disappeared into the night, a lone figure emerged from the shadows. Benjamin's instincts told him this was trouble – but his gaze remained fixed on the man, trying to read his intentions. The stranger approached with a slow deliberateness that bordered on menace.

Benjamin asked no questions and expected none in return. Their silence was heavy as lead, weighed down by secrets both unspoken and known. In that charged moment, Benjamin understood he had been pulled back into the shadows for one reason – someone had been watching him all along.

Suddenly, a small piece of paper slid across the bar between them, carrying an encrypted message with only two words: 'Your past is not what you think'.
