Benjamin Wójcik was a man shrouded in mystery. Few knew much about his life before he arrived in Berlin, Germany, with nothing but a worn leather suitcase and a suitcase full of secrets.

Rumors swirled that he had once been a spy, operating in the shadows of Eastern Europe during the Cold War era. Some claimed to have seen him in the company of high-ranking officials, while others whispered that he had been involved in a decades-long love affair with a fellow operative.

Benjamin himself kept these stories at bay, preferring to let his work speak for itself. He owned a small antique shop on the bustling Kurfürstendamm, where he spent his days restoring vintage furniture and selling relics from bygone eras.

However, as much as Benjamin liked to keep to himself, there was one customer who consistently drew him out of his shell: a young woman named Anna. She would visit the shop every week, purchasing items that seemed almost... deliberate in their choice. Like the antique door handles with intricate metalwork and the old photographs of German soldiers.

Benjamin found himself intrigued by Anna's visits, but he refused to be drawn into conversation about her purchases or anything else. That was until one day she asked for his help restoring an antique clock. As they worked together in the shop, Benjamin began to notice that Anna was not just any customer – she had an uncanny ability to recall historical events and dates with uncanny precision.

"You know, I've heard of a man like you," he said, finally breaking his silence.

Anna looked at him curiously, "Who?"

"Someone who knows the past so intimately. You're either very brave or very foolish."

Her eyes sparkled as she leaned in, "I think it's a bit of both."
