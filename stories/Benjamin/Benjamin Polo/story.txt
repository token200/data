As a child, he would spend hours gazing out of his bedroom window, dreaming of far-off lands and exotic cultures.

As he grew older, Benjamin's fascination with art only deepened. He spent countless hours studying the works of masters such as Van Gogh and Monet, marveling at their ability to capture light and color on canvas. His own talent was undeniable, and he began to hone his skills in local studios and galleries.

But music was also a great love of Benjamin's. As a teenager, he would often sneak into the local concert hall to watch the musicians rehearse, mesmerized by the way their fingers danced across the strings. He taught himself to play the guitar and violin, and soon began writing his own songs.
