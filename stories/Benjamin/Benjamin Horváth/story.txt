Benjamin Horváth stood at the edge of the old, rickety dock, gazing out at the murky waters of the Danube. A lone sailboat bobbed gently on the surface, its sails flapping in the breeze like a lost bird's wings. It was a symbol of freedom and escape, something Benjamin had always been drawn to.

As he watched, a small wooden boat pulled up alongside the dock, its owner hauling out a weathered tackle box. It was his friend, Miklós, a fisherman with a rugged face and eyes that twinkled like the stars on a clear night.

"What brings you here today?" Benjamin asked, settling onto the worn planks beside him.

"Just trying to catch something for dinner," Miklós replied, examining his lines with practiced ease. "The river's been quiet lately."

Benjamin nodded sympathetically. He knew how it was – sometimes the silence felt like a heavy weight on your shoulders. But he also knew that in moments like these, you could find peace.

As they worked, the sun beat down upon them, casting long shadows across the water. The air vibrated with the songs of birds and the distant hum of traffic from Budapest. It was a sound Benjamin had grown to hate – the reminder that there was a world beyond this one, waiting for him on the other side.

Miklós, sensing his unease, offered him a sympathetic smile. "You're thinking about what's been eating at you, aren't you?" he said gently.

Benjamin hesitated before nodding. Miklós had always known how to read him – how to coax out the stories and half-stories that lay hidden beneath the surface.

He took a deep breath, letting the tension seep from his shoulders. "I don't know what I want anymore," he confessed. "Sometimes it feels like everything's slipping away."

Miklós's expression softened. "Maybe you just need to take a different path for a while," he suggested quietly.

Benjamin raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "What do you mean?"

"I mean, sometimes the road less traveled is the one that leads to home." Miklós said with a wry smile. "We'll find your way when we get there."

Benjamin watched as his friend continued fishing, lost in the gentle rhythm of the water and the world around him. In that moment, he realized that maybe Miklós was right – sometimes all you needed to do was take a different path, and trust that the universe would guide you home.
