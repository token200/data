Benjamin Khan was a man with a mysterious past. He had moved to London from a small town in the countryside, where he grew up with his grandmother. Her death had left him alone and adrift, forcing him to start anew.

He found work as a mechanic at a local garage, where he spent long hours tinkering with engines and machinery. His hands were rough and scarred, but they held a precision that belied their appearance. He was good with machines, and it showed in the way he could coax even the most stubborn engine back to life.

Despite his tough exterior, Benjamin had a soft spot for broken things. He took pride in fixing whatever came through the door of the garage, no matter how hopeless it seemed. His coworkers learned to trust him, knowing that if they brought him a part, he would find a way to make it work.

One day, a young woman named Sophia walked into the garage, her eyes red from crying. Her car had broken down on the side of the road, and she was too far from home to get help. Benjamin listened patiently as she explained the situation, his expression unchanging. When she finished, he nodded and said, "Don't worry, I'll fix it."

The repair took longer than expected, but Benjamin worked tirelessly through the night, fueled by a cup of strong tea and a determination that only came from years of fixing broken machines. When he finally emerged into the morning light, Sophia's car was running smoothly once more.

She thanked him profusely, tears welling up in her eyes again. This time, they were happy tears, rather than sorrowful ones. Benjamin smiled wryly and said, "Just be careful driving it."

As Sophia drove away, Benjamin watched her go, his eyes squinting against the sun. For a moment, he felt a pang of loneliness. But then he looked around at the broken machines in front of him, and knew that he was exactly where he was meant to be.

The garage was his sanctuary, a place where he could fix the things that were broken, and make them whole again. It was a feeling that went deeper than just fixing engines - it was about healing the wounds of himself and others. And as long as Benjamin had his hands on a wrench, he knew he would always have something to work with.
