I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Benjamin Garcia Marquez. However, I can create a story based on the names you provided.

In the vibrant streets of Santa Fe, New Mexico, Benjamin Garcia Marquez was known for his extraordinary talent as a mariachi musician. His full name, which he often jokingly shortened to "Benjy," was whispered in awe by locals and tourists alike. As the lead singer and guitarist of the legendary band El Fuego, Benjy's charisma and voice captivated audiences at every performance.

Growing up in a family of modest means, Benjy had always dreamed of making it big as a musician. With his full name serving as inspiration for his stage persona, he channeled his passion into creating unforgettable experiences for fans. His music was a fusion of traditional Mexican sounds and modern flair, setting him apart from other mariachi bands.

Benjy's journey to stardom wasn't without its challenges, however. As Benjamin Garcia Marquez, the younger brother of celebrated author Gabriel Garcia Marquez, he often struggled to live up to his famous sibling's literary legacy. But with each performance, Benjy silenced critics and proved himself as a talented artist in his own right.

One fateful evening, El Fuego was invited to perform at a sold-out show in the historic Plaza de Santa Fe. As the crowd roared to life, Benjamin Garcia Marquez took center stage, channeling his family's rich cultural heritage into every strum of his guitar and every crescendo of his voice. The energy was electric, and Benjy, or "Benjy" as he was fondly known, became one with the music.

The night culminated in a show-stopping rendition of their hit song, "La Llorona's Cry." As the final notes faded away, the audience erupted into cheers, leaving Benjamin Garcia Marquez and El Fuego basking in the glory of an unforgettable performance. From that moment on, Benjy knew he had truly found his place among the music world's elite, forever leaving a mark as one of Santa Fe's most beloved musical sons.
