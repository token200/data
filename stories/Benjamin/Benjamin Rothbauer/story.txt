Benjamin Rothbauer was a man with a mysterious past, shrouded in secrecy and intrigue. His piercing green eyes seemed to hold a thousand stories, each one whispering a tantalizing tale of adventure and danger. As he walked down the crowded streets of Paris, the whispers followed him, like a ghostly shadow on his heels.

Now, as a freelance operative, Benjamin Rothbauer used his artistic skills to blend into the crowd, taking on clandestine missions that required finesse and cunning. His employers remained unknown, but their motives were always clear: uncover hidden treasures, infiltrate secret societies, or disrupt nefarious plots.
