Sara Yang stared out at the dark, endless waters of the Pacific Ocean from her small apartment's window. As a doctor in the United States Navy, she was used to being on call and away from home for extended periods. But tonight, she felt restless.

It had been five years since her husband, Eric, passed away in combat during a training exercise. The Navy had lost all contact with him before they could even identify his body, leaving Sara with more questions than answers. The pain still lingered, but she had tried to channel it into her work as a trauma surgeon.

As she gazed out at the ocean, memories flooded back - happy ones and sad ones. She remembered the day Eric proposed to her on a beach vacation, the laughter they shared, and the quiet moments they spent together in their small apartment. The ache of his loss was still there, but it had become more manageable.

Just then, Sara's phone buzzed with an incoming call from her best friend, Lisa. "Hey, what's up?" Lisa asked.

"Not much," Sara replied, flopping onto the couch beside the window. "Just lost in thought."

"Want to grab some dinner and talk about something else for a change?"

Sara hesitated. She didn't need distractions right now. But something about Lisa's voice made her agree.

Over burgers and fries at a nearby diner, Sara opened up to Lisa about her latest patient - a young soldier who had suffered severe injuries during a combat mission. As she described the case, Lisa listened attentively, her eyes locked on Sara's face.

"You know what? I think that sounds like Eric," Lisa said softly.

Sara felt a lump form in her throat. It was a strange comfort to have someone understand the depth of her grief. "I know," she whispered.

Lisa reached out and took Sara's hand. "We'll get through this, together."

The words were exactly what Sara needed to hear that night. As they finished their dinner and parted ways, Sara felt a sense of peace settle over her. It was a fragile thing, but it was there - like the faint outline of a light on the horizon.

Over the next few weeks, Lisa visited regularly, helping Sara care for her patients and listening as she shared stories about Eric. The hospital's resident psychiatrist, Dr. Jensen, noticed a change in Sara too. She seemed more composed, more at peace with herself.

One evening, while reviewing patient charts, Sara stumbled upon an article from the Navy Times about the development of new medical protocols to prevent traumatic injuries during combat missions. It was like Eric had found another way to be with her - through the work they both loved.

Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she read on. Maybe, just maybe, their love and sacrifice wouldn't be in vain. As Sara closed her laptop, a small smile crept onto her face.
