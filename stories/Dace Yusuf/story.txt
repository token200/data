Dace Yusuf had always been drawn to the city's underbelly. As a journalist, he spent his days sniffing out scandals and corruption that others seemed too afraid or too squeamish to investigate.

But it was at night that Dace truly came alive. He would slip away from his apartment in the bustling streets of Mumbai, his camera slung over his shoulder, and hit the streets to find the stories that no one else wanted to tell.

Tonight was no different. Dace had a lead on a possible corruption scandal involving some of the city's most powerful business leaders, and he was determined to get to the bottom of it.

He walked down narrow alleys and crowded market stalls, his eyes scanning the crowds for any sign of his subject. Finally, after what felt like hours of searching, he spotted him - a tall, imposing figure standing outside the gleaming skyscrapers of the financial district.

Dace approached cautiously, not wanting to spook his subject into flight. As he drew closer, he recognized the man's face from a story he had worked on months ago - Rohan Jain, a wealthy businessman with a reputation for ruthlessness in business and politics.

"What brings you here tonight?" Dace asked, trying to sound nonchalant despite the adrenaline coursing through his veins.

Rohan turned to him, a calculating glint in his eye. "Just taking in the sights, Yusuf," he said, his voice dripping with condescension. "I'm sure it's all very...enlightening."

Dace raised an eyebrow. He knew that tone - it was the same one Rohan used when he was trying to charm a mark or close a deal.

"I think I'll take my leave now," Dace said, backing away slowly. As he turned to walk away, Rohan's hand shot out and grabbed his arm.

"You're not going anywhere just yet," Rohan growled, his face twisting with menace.

Dace felt a jolt of fear run through him, but he refused to back down. He had come too far and worked too hard to let some corrupt businessman push him around.

"I'm just doing my job," Dace said firmly, trying to keep his voice steady.

Rohan laughed, a cold, mirthless sound. "You're just a foolish little journalist," he sneered. "But I'll give you credit - you're brave."

And with that, Rohan released Dace's arm and turned away, disappearing into the night like a ghost.

Dace took a deep breath and continued on his way, but he knew this was far from over. He would get to the bottom of the scandal, no matter what it took.
