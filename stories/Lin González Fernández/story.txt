Lin González Fernández sat alone on the beach, her dark hair blown back by the gentle breeze. She had always found solace in the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean, where the horizon seemed to stretch out forever and her worries felt small.

A native of coastal town San Miguel de Allende, Lin was a free spirit, drawn to the rhythm of the waves like a sailor to his ship. As a child, she would spend hours exploring the tide pools, collecting shells and watching the sea otters at play.

But life had taken a different turn for Lin as an adult. She had moved to Mexico City to pursue a degree in literature, but found herself lost in the concrete jungle of her studies. Her passion for words and stories still burned bright, but the words felt forced and artificial in the face of so much uncertainty.

As she sat on the beach now, Lin felt the weight of her doubts slowly lifting. The sun was setting over the water, casting a golden glow over the waves. She closed her eyes, feeling the sand between her toes and the breeze on her skin.

Suddenly, a figure appeared at her side. It was Tomás, an old friend from university who had always been fascinated by Lin's love of literature. They spent countless hours discussing poetry and prose, their debates fueling their passion for words.

Tomás handed Lin a small notebook, filled with handwritten verses. "I wrote these for you," he said, his eyes shining with kindness. "They're just stories about the sea and the people who come to visit it."

As Lin flipped through the pages, she felt a surge of emotion. The words were raw and honest, speaking directly to her soul. She began to read aloud, her voice carrying on the breeze as the stars started to twinkle overhead.

The night wore on, with Tomás and Lin lost in conversation about life and art and the power of stories. They talked long after the sun dipped below the horizon, their words weaving together like the waves of the ocean.

In that moment, Lin felt a sense of clarity wash over her. She knew what she wanted to do – write about the sea and its people, capturing the beauty and complexity in the world around her. Tomás's notebook had given her the spark she needed, and with it, a newfound sense of purpose.

As they packed up to leave, Lin turned to Tomás with a smile. "Gracias," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "These words have set me free."
