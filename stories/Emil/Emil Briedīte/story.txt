Emil Briedīte stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the station with a mixture of nostalgia and disconnection. It had been years since he'd last set foot in this small Baltic town, but the memories still lingered like a ghostly presence.

As a child, Emil would spend hours exploring the narrow streets and canals of Riga, fascinated by the intricate stone carvings and ornate bridges that seemed to lean in on him like secrets. His parents were both artists, his mother a painter and his father a sculptor, and they encouraged Emil's creative pursuits from an early age.

But life had other plans. After his parents' tragic accident when he was just 19, Emil found himself alone and adrift, forced to drop out of art school and take on odd jobs to make ends meet. The pain of losing his family still lingered, a dull ache that throbbed through his veins like a constant reminder.

Now, at 32, Emil had returned to Riga seeking solace and clarity. He'd spent years drifting from city to city, taking on various identities and personas, but nothing seemed to fill the void left by his parents' passing. His latest job as a bartender in New York City was just a shallow distraction, a way to keep his hands busy while his mind wandered.

As he walked through the station, Emil spotted a figure standing by the ticket counter – an old friend from his childhood, Jānis. They exchanged warm smiles and hugs, their conversation flowing effortlessly like they'd never been apart.

Over coffee at a local café, Jānis asked Emil about his plans for the future. "Art, my friend?" he asked, eyes sparkling with curiosity. Emil shrugged, feeling a familiar sense of restlessness. He couldn't seem to shake off the feeling that there was more to life than the fleeting pleasures of bartending and partying.

Jānis nodded knowingly. "Your parents would want you to keep creating, Emil. For yourself, not just for others." The words echoed in his mind as he walked out into the evening light, Riga's ancient streets seeming to whisper secrets in his ear.

Perhaps it was time for Emil to listen to those whispers.
