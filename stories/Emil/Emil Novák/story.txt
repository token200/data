As a child, he would spend hours exploring the streets of Prague with his camera, capturing the beauty of the city's ancient architecture and vibrant street life. This early fascination would stay with him throughout his life, shaping him into one of the most acclaimed photographers of his generation.

After studying fine art in London, Emil Novák returned to Prague, determined to capture the essence of his hometown through his lens.

Celebrities and politicians clamored for Emil Novák's signature photographs, which often featured him himself in front of iconic landmarks or exploring the city's hidden corners. But despite the success, he remained true to his artistic vision, always seeking to push the boundaries of what was possible with a camera.

One day, a prominent art gallery approached Emil Novák with an offer he couldn't refuse: a solo exhibition showcasing his work for years in the making. The show would be called "Nováková Praha" – "New Prague" – and it would bring together some of his most iconic images alongside new works that explored themes of identity, community, and belonging.

The exhibition was a triumph, attracting visitors from all over the world who were drawn to Emil Novák's captivating photographs.
