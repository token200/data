William Eriksson was an enigmatic figure, with piercing blue eyes that seemed to hold secrets and stories untold. He stood at 6'2", his imposing frame cloaked in worn leather jackets and jeans, giving off an air of ruggedness that belied a mind sharper than any razor.

A Swedish exile living in Berlin, Eriksson had once been a rising star in the world of high-stakes art forgery. His talent for creating exquisite reproductions of masterpieces was unmatched, earning him the nickname "The Phantom Artist." However, a string of closely-timed thefts at major museums across Europe and a tip from an anonymous source led the authorities to his doorstep.

Caught red-handed with a painting worth millions in his possession, Eriksson had been arrested and charged with multiple counts of forgery. His response? An offer that sent shockwaves through the art world: in exchange for immunity, he would reveal the identity of every master thief he'd worked with over the years.

Over weeks of intense interrogation, Eriksson proved to be an enigmatic figure - tight-lipped about his past but willing to reveal more than anyone had anticipated. With a sly smile, he named names and exposed networks of thieves who thought themselves above the law. He mentioned famous dealers, collectors, and museum directors who'd paid for his works without question.

One name, however, sent shivers down even the hardest of investigators' spines - that of Catherine Moreau, the infamous thief known as "La Vip√®re" (The Viper). Rumors swirled about her unparalleled skills in disguise and escape artistry. Eriksson had a reputation for his exceptional craftsmanship but also, notoriously, for his meticulous record-keeping.

And so, on one fateful night, with Catherine watching from the shadows, William Eriksson handed over his list of informants, revealing an intricate web of deceit that threatened to topple the entire underworld of art forgery.
