As they walked out of the warehouse together, Emily turned to William Horvath and said, "Thank you so much for solving my sister's mystery. I don't know what I would have done without you." William Horvath smiled, his eyes twinkling with pride. "It was my pleasure, Emily," he replied. "I'm just glad that Sarah is safe and sound."

With the case closed, William Horvath returned to his office, eager to dive into his next challenge. He sat at his desk, steepling his fingers as he pondered the next puzzle that lay before him. The game was afoot, and William Horvath was ready to play.
