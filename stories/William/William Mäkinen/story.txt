William Mäkinen was a Finnish-American musician, best known as the guitarist and songwriter of the popular punk rock band, The Wrecking Crew. Born in Helsinki, Finland in 1955, William moved to the United States with his family at a young age, settling in Chicago, Illinois.

Growing up in a musical household, William was exposed to a wide range of genres, from classical to rock and roll. He began playing guitar at the age of 10 and quickly developed a passion for music that would last a lifetime. After high school, William attended DePaul University, where he studied business and played in local bands on the side.

After college, William joined The Wrecking Crew, which quickly gained a following in Chicago's punk rock scene. The band's energetic live shows and catchy songwriting earned them critical acclaim and a devoted fan base. With William on guitar, The Wrecking Crew released several successful albums, including "Breakdown" and "Riot's Revenge."

William's unique guitar style, which combined elements of punk, metal, and Finnish folk music, helped to set the band apart from their contemporaries. His songs, often written in Finnish, tackled themes of social justice, politics, and personal struggle.

Despite The Wrecking Crew's success, William struggled with anxiety and depression, which he often addressed through his music. In a 2015 interview with The Guardian, William spoke candidly about the pressures of fame and the importance of staying true to oneself. "Music is my therapy," he said. "When I'm on stage, everything else fades away, and all that's left is the music."

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, William toured extensively with The Wrecking Crew, sharing stages with iconic punk bands like The Ramones and Black Flag. He also collaborated with other musicians, including punk rock legends like Joe Strummer of The Clash.

In the early 2000s, William began to focus more on his solo work, releasing several critically acclaimed albums that showcased his unique blend of Finnish folk and American punk. His music was praised by critics for its emotional depth and sonic complexity.

Today, William Mäkinen is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in Finland's punk rock scene. He continues to tour and release new music with The Wrecking Crew, as well as with his solo project, which has gained a devoted following among fans of underground music.

Despite his success, William remains humble and true to his artistic vision. In a recent interview with Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat, he said, "Music is my life, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to share it with others."
