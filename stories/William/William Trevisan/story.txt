William Trevisan, a man in his mid-30s with an air of quiet confidence, walked into the dimly lit café. He had been searching for this place for weeks, and finally, he had stumbled upon it while exploring the winding streets of the old town. As he waited in line to order, his eyes scanned the room, taking in the eclectic décor and the lively chatter of the patrons.

When it was finally his turn to order, William asked for a strong black coffee, just as he always did. The barista raised an eyebrow at him, but nodded curtly and began preparing his drink. As he waited, William's mind wandered back to the letter he had received that morning from his estranged brother.

He had been expecting it, of course, but still, the words on the page stung. His brother, Richard Trevisan, had been going through a tough time, struggling with addiction and personal demons. William knew that he should be there for him, but he also knew that he needed space. He had always been the responsible one in their family, and now it was time to take care of himself.

As he took his coffee and made his way to a small table by the window, William felt a sense of resolve wash over him. He would get through this difficult time, just like he always did. He took a sip of his coffee, feeling the bitter flavor course through his veins, and gazed out at the rain-soaked streets below.

The café was filled with people trying to escape the gray weather, but William felt most alive when it rained. There was something about the sound of the droplets on the pavement, the smell of wet earth and leaves, that made him feel like he could face anything. He sat back in his chair, closed his eyes, and let the storm outside wash over him.

For a moment, all was calm inside William Trevisan's mind. The world outside receded, and it was just him, the rain, and the coffee. It was a fleeting sense of peace, but it was enough to keep him going for now.
