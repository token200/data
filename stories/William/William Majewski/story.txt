William Majewski trudged through the dense forest, his boots sinking into the damp earth. As a park ranger, he had spent countless hours exploring these woods, but today felt different. The sun cast eerie shadows on the trees, and an unsettling silence hung in the air.

As he rounded a bend in the path, William's trained eyes spotted something out of place. A piece of torn fabric caught his attention, fluttering gently in the breeze. He picked it up, examining the threads carefully. It was from a black hoodie, with a distinctive logo on the sleeve - the same logo worn by the notorious outlaw, Jack "The Ghost" Griffin.

William's instincts screamed warning signals as he tucked the fabric into his pocket. He knew that Griffin was rumored to be hiding out in these woods, evading capture for years. The thought sent shivers down William's spine.

Suddenly, a twig snapped behind him. William spun around, gun at the ready. A figure emerged from the underbrush - a young woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. She looked worn and weary, as if she'd been surviving on scraps for weeks.

"Who are you?" William demanded, trying to keep his voice steady.

"My name is Lena," she replied, her voice laced with desperation. "I've been running from Jack Griffin's gang for days. They're after me."

William hesitated, weighing his options. He knew that turning Lena in would mean a lifetime of regret - Griffin was a ruthless man, and William had lost friends to the outlaw's violence.

"I won't turn you in," William said finally, holing his gun tightly against his chest. "But I need to know what you're running from. What's so bad about Griffin that it'll kill you?"

Lena hesitated, then launched into a wild tale of kidnappings and extortions, of lives lost and livelihoods ruined. As she spoke, William's expression hardened - he knew that Jack Griffin was no ordinary outlaw.

With Lena by his side, William vowed to track down the Ghost and put an end to his reign of terror once and for all. Together, they set off into the darkness, their hearts ablaze with determination.
