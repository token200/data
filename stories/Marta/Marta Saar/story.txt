Marta Saar had always been fascinated by the old world of Estonian folk music and dance. As a child, she would spend hours listening to her grandmother's accordion playing and watching traditional dance performances on video. Growing up in Tallinn, Marta was surrounded by the vibrant cultural heritage of her homeland, but it wasn't until she stumbled upon an old record player in her grandfather's attic that she truly discovered her passion for the subject.

Marta Saar spent countless hours listening to recordings of traditional Estonian music and watching videos of folk dancers performing in rural villages. She became especially drawn to the stories behind the songs and dances, learning about the myths and legends that had inspired them.
