As a renowned private investigator in Stockholm, Sweden, she had built a reputation for being one of the best in the business. Her sharp mind and quick wit made her a sought-after expert by both law enforcement and high-society clients.

One crisp winter morning, Marta received an urgent visit from a distraught socialite named Anna Bergman. Anna's husband, Marcus, had gone missing, leaving behind only a cryptic note hinting at a deep-seated family secret. As Marta listened intently to Anna's pleas for help, she began to piece together the fragments of information that might lead her to Marcus.

With her trusty notebook and cup of strong Swedish coffee in hand, Marta set out to interview key witnesses.
