Marta García Fernández, or Marta as she was known to her friends and family, sat alone in her small apartment, staring blankly at the wall. It had been five years since her mother's passing, and yet the pain still lingered. She had always been close to her mother, who had taught her everything from cooking to speaking Spanish with a thick accent.

As she sat there, Marta couldn't help but think of all the things she wished she could have said or done differently. Why hadn't she visited more often? Why hadn't she called more often? The questions swirled in her mind like a vortex, pulling her down into a sea of regret.

Just as she was about to give in to tears, Marta heard a knock at the door. It was her best friend, Sofia, who had stopped by to check on her. Sofia had always been there for Marta, offering a listening ear and a comforting word whenever she needed it.

"Hey, girl, I brought some empanadas from my kitchen," Sofia said, setting down a plate of freshly baked pastry pockets filled with meat and onions.

Marta smiled weakly, feeling a small sense of comfort. She devoured the empanada in two bites, savoring the flavor and texture.

Sofia sat down next to her on the couch, putting a gentle hand on her shoulder. "It's okay to be sad, Marta," she said softly. "Your mother may be gone, but her memory lives on through you. You're strong and capable, and you have so much love to give."

Marta looked at Sofia, feeling a lump form in her throat. She knew that her friend was right. Her mother would want her to be happy and fulfilled.

Over the next few weeks, Marta started taking small steps towards healing. She began volunteering at a local charity organization that helped new immigrants adjust to life in the United States. She also joined a cooking class, where she met other women who shared her love of food and tradition.

As she cooked and laughed with her new friends, Marta felt a sense of purpose she hadn't felt in years. She realized that her mother's passing wasn't the end of their relationship, but rather a new chapter in their ongoing story.

One day, while cooking up a storm in the kitchen, Marta turned to Sofia and said, "I think I'm starting to feel like myself again." Sofia smiled and replied, "That's my girl!"
