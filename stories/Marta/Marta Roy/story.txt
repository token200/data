Marta Roy had always been fascinated by the abandoned asylum on the outskirts of town. As a child, she would dare her friends to take her there, and they would reluctantly agree, only to turn back once they saw the creepy trees looming in front of it. But Marta was intrigued. She spent hours poring over old records and talking to locals who knew its history.

As she grew older, Marta's fascination never faded. In fact, it deepened. She became determined to explore the asylum and uncover its secrets. After months of planning, she finally convinced her parents to let her visit during a guided tour.

Marta Roy walked through the musty halls with the other tourists, taking in the peeling paint and rusted medical equipment. But as they approached the old operating theater, Marta's excitement grew. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she gazed up at the cold steel table where countless surgeries had taken place.

The guide explained how the asylum had once been home to some of the most disturbed patients in the country. Marta listened intently, feeling a thrill of connection to these forgotten souls. As they left the building and stepped into the bright sunlight, Marta felt invigorated. She knew she had only scratched the surface of this place.

After the tour, Marta Roy wandered back to the asylum on her own, determined to explore every nook and cranny. She discovered hidden rooms filled with patient records and whispered secrets in the abandoned nurse's station. As she made her way back through the forest, the trees seemed to loom over her less menacingly, as if they were sharing a secret.

Marta Roy returned home that night with a newfound appreciation for the asylum's dark history. She knew she would return, again and again, drawn by the allure of its secrets and mysteries. And though some might call it morbid fascination, Marta just called it being curious about the world around her.
