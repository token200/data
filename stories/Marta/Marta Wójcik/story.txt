Marta Wójcik, a Polish-British photographer, had always been fascinated by the intersection of culture and identity. Born to a Polish mother and British father, Marta grew up navigating between two worlds. Her parents' divorce when she was young left her feeling lost and uncertain about her place in the world.

As a teenager, Marta found solace in photography. She spent hours snapping pictures of everything around her - street art, urban landscapes, and portraits of people from different walks of life. Her camera became an extension of herself, allowing her to capture moments that felt like fragments of her own identity.

Years later, as a successful photographer, Marta Wójcik had built a reputation for capturing the complexities of human experience through her lens. She had traveled extensively, documenting the lives of people living in the margins of society - immigrants, refugees, and marginalized communities. Her photographs told stories that needed to be heard, stories that challenged dominant narratives and offered a glimpse into the invisible worlds that often went unseen.

One particular project, "Invisible Lives," took Marta on a journey to Poland's forgotten regions, where she met with families who had fled their homes due to conflict or persecution. The portraits she captured in those moments would become some of her most powerful work - haunting reminders of the fragility and beauty of human life.

Marta's photographs were never just about the people she photographed; they were also about the spaces that bound them together. Her camera captured not only the individuals but also the landscapes, textures, and colors that surrounded them. In doing so, Marta Wójcik created a visual language that spoke directly to her audience, conveying emotions and experiences that defied words.

Through her work, Marta sought to dismantle the silos of identity and belonging. She wanted her photographs to be more than just images; they were invitations to imagine, to empathize, and to connect with others who felt invisible or overlooked. As she continued to travel and capture stories, Marta knew that her camera would forever remain a tool for self-discovery and understanding, reflecting the complexities of human experience in all its messy beauty.
