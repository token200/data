The woman didn't move, but as Marta Kazuo approached, she nodded slightly in recognition. "Marta Kazuo," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I've been watching you."

For a moment, Marta Kazuo was taken aback - how did this stranger know her name? But before she could ask any questions, the woman vanished into thin air.

Marta Kazuo's heart skipped a beat as she realized that this mysterious encounter might just be the break in the case she had been waiting for. She quickly pulled out her phone and dialed the businessman's number, her mind racing with possibilities.

"Get back to me," Marta Kazuo told herself, determination burning within her. This was going to be a long night, but one thing was certain - Marta Kazuo was not done yet. Not until she uncovered the truth behind her latest mystery.
