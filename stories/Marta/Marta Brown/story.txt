Marta Brown sat in her small, cluttered apartment, staring blankly at the walls. It had been three months since she'd last spoken to her sister, and the silence between them was suffocating. The siblings had always been close, but a falling out over their parents' passing had driven them apart.

As Marta's mind wandered, she thought about the day they received the news that their father had passed away. She remembered the chaos and grief that followed, but also the way her sister had taken charge, trying to keep everyone together. It was moments like those that made Marta realize just how much she'd lost in their argument.

Determined to bridge the gap between them, Marta picked up her paintbrushes and began to create. She'd always found solace in art, a way to express emotions she couldn't verbalize. As the strokes of her brush danced across the canvas, she felt her anxiety begin to dissipate.

Hours passed, and Marta stepped back from her masterpiece, stepping into her own eyes for the first time. It was vibrant – colors blended together in swirling patterns that reflected the turmoil within her. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she realized this was exactly what she needed to share with her sister.

With newfound determination, Marta carefully wrapped her painting and addressed an envelope. She slipped it into a mailbox and waited for the confirmation of delivery. Days went by before her phone rang – it was Emily, her sister's voice trembling on the other end.

"Marta? I've been thinking... about us."

Marta held her breath as she listened to her sister begin to unravel the threads of their argument, slowly coming to a place of understanding and forgiveness.

It wasn't an easy process. Marta knew that healing wouldn't happen overnight. But in this quiet moment, with paint-stained fingers wrapped around the edge of the phone's receiver, she felt hope stir within her – the hope that one day Emily would be by her side again, as a sister, and as a friend.

For now, Marta stood there, bathed in the warm glow of possibility, the sound of her sister's whispered words echoing through the room.
