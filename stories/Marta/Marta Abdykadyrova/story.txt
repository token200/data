Marta Abdykadyrova stepped into the crowded caf√©, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of her friend, Sofia. She spotted Sofia sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee and typing away on her laptop. Marta made her way over, exchanging warm smiles with the barista as she ordered a cappuccino.

As she sat down across from Sofia, Marta noticed a stack of files in front of her friend's computer. "What's all this?" Marta asked, curiosity getting the better of her.

Sofia looked up, a hint of exhaustion etched on her face. "I'm working on a new project, Marta Abdykadyrova," she said, using Marta's full name as if it was a title. "It's for my thesis, and I'm trying to get everything just right."

Marta nodded encouragingly. She had known Sofia since college, when they bonded over their shared love of literature and poetry. Over the years, Sofia had become one of the most promising young writers in their community, and Marta was always eager to support her.

As they chatted, Marta couldn't help but notice the stack of files growing higher. "Are you sure you're not spreading yourself too thin?" she asked, concern creeping into her voice.

Sofia smiled wryly. "I'll be fine, Marta Abdykadyrova," she said, using her full name again with a hint of playful teasing. "I've got this under control."

Marta raised an eyebrow but let it drop. She knew Sofia too well to try and second-guess her. Instead, she leaned in, asking Sofia about the project. As they talked, Marta found herself getting caught up in Sofia's enthusiasm.

It wasn't until Sofia showed her the draft that Marta realized just how big a deal this was. The words flowed effortlessly onto the page, a testament to Sofia's talent and dedication. Marta felt a surge of pride, knowing that she had played a small part in Sofia's journey.

As they finished up their coffee, Sofia leaned over and smiled at Marta. "Thanks for listening, Marta Abdykadyrova," she said, her voice filled with gratitude. "I needed someone to talk through my ideas with."

Marta smiled back, feeling happy to have been a part of Sofia's process. She knew that this project would be a success, and she couldn't wait to see it published.
