Léa Gómez Pérez was a young and ambitious journalist with a passion for storytelling. Growing up in a small town in Mexico, she had always been fascinated by the world beyond her horizon. She spent countless hours listening to her abuela's tales of struggle and resilience, which sparked her desire to share the stories of those often overlooked.

After completing her degree in journalism, Léa landed an internship at a prominent newspaper in Mexico City. It was there that she honed her skills as a reporter, covering everything from local politics to social justice issues. Her dedication and perseverance quickly earned her recognition among her colleagues, who soon referred to her as the "next big thing" in Mexican journalism.

One day, Léa received an assignment to investigate a string of disappearances in a small town on the outskirts of the city. The victims were all young women, and their families were desperate for answers. Léa was determined to uncover the truth behind these mysterious events, and she spent countless hours interviewing witnesses, analyzing clues, and following leads.
