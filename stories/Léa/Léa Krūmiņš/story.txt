Léa Krūmiņš stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any signs of life. She had been traveling for days, ever since she received a cryptic message from an old acquaintance in Riga, Latvia, inviting her to meet at this very station.

As she waited, Léa Krūmiņš pulled out her sketchbook and began to draw the fading architecture of the station, the worn stone walls and rusty iron beams a testament to the city's rich history. She was an artist, but not just any artist - she was a documentarian, capturing the beauty in decay.

The door swung open, and Léa Krūmiņš turned to see her acquaintance, a woman with a wild shock of curly hair and a mischievous grin, hurrying towards her. "Léa! Thank goodness you made it," she exclaimed, as they exchanged warm hugs.

"Who are you?" Léa Krūmiņš asked, curiosity getting the better of her. Her acquaintance chuckled and introduced herself as Maya, a fellow artist and historian who had spent years researching the stories hidden within Riga's ancient streets.

As they walked through the city, Maya filled Léa Krūmiņš in on her research - tales of love and loss, of war and revolution. And with each step, Léa Krūmiņš felt herself becoming more and more immersed in the stories, her pencils moving swiftly across the pages of her sketchbook as she tried to capture the essence of it all.

As night began to fall, Maya led Léa Krūmiņš to a small café tucked away in a quiet alley. Over cups of strong coffee, they pored over ancient maps and dusty tomes, uncovering secrets hidden for centuries. It was here that Léa Krūmiņš discovered her true passion - to document the stories that lay just beneath the surface of this beautiful, crumbling city.

And so, with Maya by her side, Léa Krūmiņš set out on a journey to uncover the hidden histories of Riga, one sketch at a time.
