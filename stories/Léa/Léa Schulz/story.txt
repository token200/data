Léa Schulz had always felt like an outsider in her small town of Villefranche-sur-Mer. She was the only one who didn't have parents or siblings, having been adopted by a kind-hearted elderly couple when she was just a toddler. As a result, Léa often found herself drawn to the mysteries and secrets that lay beneath the idyllic surface of her hometown.

One day, while exploring the dusty attic of her family's antique shop, Léa stumbled upon an old, leather-bound book with strange symbols etched into its cover. The moment she touched it, she felt a sudden jolt of electricity run through her veins, and suddenly, visions began to flood her mind - fragmented images of a long-forgotten past.

Léa spent the next few days pouring over the book, deciphering the cryptic messages that seemed to hold secrets about her own family's history. She discovered that her adoptive parents had been keepers of an ancient tradition passed down through their own lineage - one that spoke of a powerful and enigmatic force known only as "Le Rêve" (The Dream).

As Léa delved deeper into the book, she began to realize that Le Rêve was more than just a myth - it was a living, breathing entity that pulsed through the very fabric of her town. And at its heart, lay a hidden truth: Villefranche-sur-Mer was built on a site where an ancient civilization had once thrived, one whose remnants were rumored to be buried beneath its cobblestone streets.

Determined to uncover the truth behind Le Rêve and the secrets of her family's past, Léa embarked on a journey that took her from crumbling ruins to hidden cemeteries, following a trail of clues that led her closer and closer to the heart of the mystery. Along the way, she encountered enigmatic strangers who seemed to know more about Le Rêve than they let on - and yet, none of them would tell her what it truly meant.

As Léa's search drew closer to its climax, she began to realize that the line between reality and fantasy was growing increasingly blurred. Was Le Rêve a mythic force, or was it something more? And what lay at the heart of Villefranche-sur-Mer - was it a forgotten past, or a hidden future waiting to be unlocked? Léa's journey had only just begun, but one thing was certain: she would uncover the truth behind Le Rêve, no matter where it led her.
