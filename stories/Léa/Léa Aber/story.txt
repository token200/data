Léa Aber stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the dimly lit station. She had been away for months, escaping the chaos of Paris to find solace in the rolling hills and quiet streets of her family's countryside estate.

As she made her way through the deserted station, Léa's thoughts turned to the letter she had received just days before. It was from a lawyer, explaining that the will her mother had left behind when she passed away did not include Léa as a beneficiary. Confused and heartbroken, Léa had packed her bags and fled to the countryside, hoping to clear her head.

The station master approached her, his bushy eyebrows furrowed in concern. "Mademoiselle Aber, is everything all right? You look troubled."

Léa forced a smile, not wanting to burden this kind stranger with her troubles. "Je vais bien, merci. Just a bit tired, that's all."

The station master nodded sympathetically before handing Léa a letter and a small key. "I think you'll find your train is waiting for you at the platform. And I've included these papers with the letter - they're from the lawyer who handled your mother's estate."

As she walked to her train, Léa's eyes scanned the small, weathered station house. She remembered playing hide-and-seek in its dusty corridors as a child, laughing and chasing after her siblings as they hid behind the cobweb-covered chandeliers.

The platform was deserted when Léa arrived, but soon she heard the rumble of wheels on tracks and saw the figure of the conductor emerge from the carriage door. "Welcome aboard, mademoiselle," he said with a bow. "You've been waiting long enough. The countryside awaits."

As the train chugged out of the station, Léa felt the tension in her shoulders ease, replaced by a sense of wonder and possibility. This was where she wanted to be - surrounded by nature, away from the noise and distractions of Paris.

When they arrived at the estate, Léa's thoughts turned back to the lawyer's letter. She had been expecting an inheritance - or so she thought. But now, it seemed that her mother's will had left her with nothing. No home, no family legacy, just a patchwork quilt of memories and unanswered questions.

But as Léa stepped out into the crisp air and breathed in deeply, she knew she was exactly where she was meant to be. This land had been in her family for generations - a place of beauty, of hardship, and of love.
