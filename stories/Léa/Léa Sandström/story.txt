Léa Sandström stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the quaint Swedish station. She had been away for so long, and yet this small town still felt like home. As she made her way through the crowded station, a familiar face caught her eye - her best friend, Anna.

Anna's bright pink hair stood out among the drab commuters, and Léa couldn't help but smile as they hugged hello. "It's been too long," Anna said, pulling back to examine Léa's face. "You look like you've seen a ghost."

Léa chuckled, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "Just a little jet lag," she replied. "I'm here for the summer, just like I promised."

Anna nodded, her expression serious. "Good, because we have big plans for this summer. You're not getting out of it that easily."

Léa grinned mischievously. She had always loved coming to the Swedish countryside with Anna - the rolling hills, the sparkling lakes, and the endless summers spent exploring and laughing together.

As they walked through the station, Léa couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement. This was exactly what she needed - a break from the city, from her job, from all the expectations that came with being an "adult". She had plans to spend her days swimming in the lake, hiking through the woods, and just enjoying the quiet company of Anna.

But as they stepped out into the bright sunlight, Léa's eyes landed on a figure watching them from across the station. A tall, dark-haired man with piercing blue eyes - someone she didn't recognize, but who seemed to be staring at her with an intensity that made her skin prickle.

Anna followed her gaze, and together they watched as the stranger turned and disappeared into the crowd. "Who was that?" Anna asked, frowning.

Léa shook her head. "No idea," she replied, a shiver running down her spine. She had been away for so long, but this feeling - it felt like coming home.
