Léa Walker stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the station as if searching for something. The misty rain had rolled in overnight, shrouding the small town in a damp gray veil. She breathed it in deeply, feeling the cool air fill her lungs.

As she made her way through the deserted streets, Léa's thoughts drifted back to the letter she'd received that morning. It was from an old friend, one she hadn't seen in years – a friend who claimed to have information about her sister's disappearance.

Léa's heart ached as she thought of Emma, taken from her too soon. The police had given up on finding any leads, and Léa had all but lost hope. But this letter...it was different. This letter promised something new.

She pushed open the door to the small café where she'd agreed to meet her friend. Inside, the fire crackled and spat, casting a warm glow over the simple wooden furniture. A figure sat at the counter, hood pulled up, face obscured by shadows.

Léa's instincts prickled as she approached the table. She had always been wary of people who seemed too interested in secrets. But there was something about this woman's quiet confidence that put her at ease.

"Lucy," Léa said, taking a seat across from her friend.

Lucy pushed back her hood, revealing a weathered face with eyes as bright as stars on a clear night. "Léa, I'm so sorry it took me this long to get in touch."

"I'm glad you did," Léa said, her voice low.

Lucy leaned forward, her elbows on the table. "I have something for you. Something that might change everything."

Léa's heart skipped a beat as Lucy handed her a small package wrapped in brown paper and twine. She unwrapped it slowly, revealing a photograph of Emma – smiling, carefree, with a sun-kissed beach behind her.

Tears pricked at the corners of Léa's eyes as she gazed upon the image. This was what had been missing from her life – proof that Emma still existed in some form. She took a deep breath and looked up to meet Lucy's gaze.

"Thank you," she whispered, her voice barely audible over the rain pattering outside.

Lucy smiled softly and nodded before pushing back her chair to stand. "I'm glad I could help, Léa. You deserve the truth."

As they parted ways, Léa felt a glimmer of hope – small but radiant – that perhaps this was just the beginning of something new, something worth fighting for.
