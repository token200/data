The shopkeeper, an eccentric old man with piercing green eyes, greeted Léa Alexandra Bāk warmly and offered her a seat at a small wooden table. As she browsed the shelves, her fingers trailing over the intricate carvings on an ancient wooden box, the shopkeeper revealed to her that he had been searching for a particular kind of art – something that captured the essence of the city's hidden magic.
