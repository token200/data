Years later, as Diego sat in his favorite armchair, surrounded by the trappings of a lifetime spent exploring the mysteries of the universe, he smiled to himself, knowing that his true work had only just begun. For this enigmatic mystic was not just a guide, but a guardian â€“ watching over the world with eyes both ancient and eternal, guiding those who sought his counsel along the winding paths of their own destinies.
