Diego Dąbrowski stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. He had been traveling for days, ever since he'd left Warsaw without a destination or a plan. The city's steel and concrete seemed to have suffocated him, its crowds and noise a reminder that he couldn't escape his own thoughts.

As he collected his luggage, Diego felt a pang of guilt for leaving without notice. His family would be worried sick, but he couldn't shake the feeling that he needed to get out of there. The memories of his past lingered in every corner of the city - the hospital where he'd recovered from an illness, the streets where he'd grown up with his siblings.

Diego hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of a small hostel he'd found online. As they drove through the night, the city lights blurring together like diamonds on black velvet, Diego felt a sense of freedom wash over him. He was finally doing something for himself.

The next morning, Diego emerged from his room to find a note waiting for him on the bedside table - a postcard with a picture of a lake and a handwritten message: "Meet me at Lake Zbrzeź in three days." There was no signature, but he knew that letter immediately. It was from Marta, his first love who'd broken his heart into a million pieces.

Diego spent the next two days wandering around the city, trying to clear his head and process everything that had happened between him and Marta. He visited her old flat, remembering the laughter they'd shared and the tears they'd cried together. And when he arrived at Lake Zbrzeź on the third day, he saw her waiting for him by the water's edge.

Marta smiled as Diego approached, her eyes sparkling with a mix of sadness and hope. "I've been waiting for you," she said, extending her hand. For a moment, they just stood there, hands touching but not looking at each other. Then Diego took a step closer, his heart pounding in his chest.

"I was lost without you," he whispered, the words tumbling out of him like a confession. Marta's eyes softened, and she nodded slightly. "I've been waiting for me too," she said softly.
