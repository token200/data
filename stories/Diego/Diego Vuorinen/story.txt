Diego Vuorinen stepped off the train and onto the platform, gazing out at the small Finnish town he had never known before. As the child of Finnish parents who had emigrated to Australia when he was just a baby, Diego's connection to his heritage was tenuous at best.

Growing up in Sydney, Diego had always felt like an outsider among his peers, caught between two worlds and belonging to neither fully. His Finnish upbringing had instilled in him a love of nature and the outdoors, which he spent most of his free time exploring the Australian wilderness.

Now, at 25, Diego had decided to return to Finland for a summer, eager to reconnect with his roots and learn more about the country that had given birth to him. He had enrolled in a language course and was planning to spend his days hiking through the forests and learning traditional Finnish crafts.

As he made his way to his small apartment in Helsinki, Diego felt a sense of excitement wash over him. For the first time in his life, he felt like he was home. He spent his days immersed in Finnish culture, trying new foods and drinks, and practicing his language skills.

Diego's Finnish heritage had always been a mystery to him, but as he delved deeper into his family's history, he began to uncover stories of a proud and resilient people who had survived centuries of war and hardship. He learned about the Kalevala, the epic poem that told the story of the ancient Finnish people, and he felt a deep connection to the land and its people.

As the summer wore on, Diego found himself transforming into a true Finnsman. He traded in his Australian accent for one that sounded more like a native Finn, and he began to appreciate the simple pleasures in life - a warm cup of coffee on a cold morning, a beautiful sunset over the Baltic Sea, or a hearty plate of karjalanpiirakka (Karelian pasties). Diego Vuorinen was finally finding his place in the world, and it felt like coming home.
