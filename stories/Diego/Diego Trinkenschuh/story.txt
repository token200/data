But as he made his escape, Diego realized that he wasn't alone. A rival thief, known only by their alias "The Fox," had also infiltrated the mansion, intent on claiming the loot for themselves.

In the end, it was Diego Francisco Trinkenschuh who emerged victorious, carrying off the spoils in a cloud of dust and smoke.
