Diego Andersson stepped into the dimly lit bar, scanning the room for his contact. He had been tracking this lead for weeks, and he was determined to get to the bottom of it. As a freelance journalist, Diego had made a name for himself by sniffing out stories that others had overlooked.

He spotted a figure in the corner, huddled over a drink. The man looked like he had seen better days, but there was something about him that piqued Diego's interest. He approached the table, his eyes locked on the stranger's.

"Mind if I join you?" Diego asked, nodding towards the empty chair across from him.

The man hesitated for a moment before shrugging and gesturing to the seat. Diego sat down, ordering himself a drink as he waited for the other man to speak.

"I'm Diego Andersson," he said finally, extending his hand.

The stranger looked up at him warily before taking it in a firm handshake. "Vinnie," he replied gruffly. "What do you want?"

Diego smiled wryly. "I'm working on a story about corruption in the city's government. I heard you might know something."

Vinnie snorted, taking a swig of his drink. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.

But Diego was not convinced. He leaned forward, his eyes locked on Vinnie's. "Don't play dumb with me, Vinnie. I've been investigating this for months. I know you were involved in the recent scandal."

Vinnie's expression changed from defiance to fear, and he looked away, muttering something under his breath. Diego smiled again, a sense of satisfaction washing over him.

"Let's just say that I have sources who put me on your radar," Diego said, pulling out a small notebook from his pocket. "I can offer you immunity in exchange for information."

Vinnie glared at the notebook, but Diego could see the calculation working in his head. He nodded finally, and Diego smiled again.

"I knew you'd come around," he said, jotting down some notes as Vinnie began to spill his story. As they spoke, Diego realized that this was just the tip of the iceberg â€“ there were far more corruption stories waiting to be uncovered.

And with Vinnie's cooperation, Diego Andersson was ready to take on whatever came next.
