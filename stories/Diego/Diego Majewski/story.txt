Inspired by this discovery, Diego began experimenting with color and monochrome together. The results were astonishing – vibrant hues danced across his photographs, transporting viewers to the streets of Rio de Janeiro. His work gained international attention, and soon he was exhibiting his photographs in galleries around the world.
