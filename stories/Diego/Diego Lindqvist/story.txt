One fateful evening, Diego received a call from an anonymous source claiming to have information about a high-profile murder case. The victim was a wealthy businessman, and the police were stumped. As Diego listened intently to the caller's cryptic message, he knew that this could be his chance to crack the case wide open.

Diego arrived at the crime scene, his mind racing with possibilities.
