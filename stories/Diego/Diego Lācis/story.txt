Diego Lācis stepped off the small propeller plane that had brought him to the remote island of Aitutaki. He stretched his arms, taking in the warm tropical air and the crystal-clear waters lapping against the shore.

A local fisherman, Diego was used to a simple life on the water. His father had taught him everything he knew from a young age, and now at 35, he was one of the most respected fishermen in the small village.

As he made his way through the village, Diego's thoughts turned to the ancient legends that spoke of the sea goddess, Tane Mahuta. According to local lore, if you sang with your heart full of sorrow, Tane would grant you a single wish. But be warned, she was unforgiving and demanded only songs from those who were truly broken.

Diego's own story was one of loss and longing. His mother had passed away when he was just a child, leaving him to rely on his father for everything. He had always felt a deep connection to the sea, as if it held secrets that only she could understand.

As he arrived at the beach, Diego spotted an old woman sitting by the shore. She beckoned him over with a bony finger. "Diego Lācis," she said in a voice barely above a whisper, "your time has come."

"What do you mean?" Diego asked, feeling a shiver run down his spine.

"I have heard your song, young one," the old woman replied. "It is a melody of sorrow and longing. I will grant you one wish, but be warned, it may not bring you what you truly desire."

Diego thought back to all the times he had sailed the seas in search of something more. He thought of his mother, who was no longer with him, and wondered if this was a chance for closure.

"What is my wish?" Diego asked the old woman, his voice shaking slightly.

Tane Mahuta's song echoed through the air as she spoke. "What will you give up to have what you desire?"

Diego thought of all the things he wanted to achieve: more success in fishing, more wealth, more recognition from the village elders. But something within him whispered that it was not these things that brought true fulfillment.

"I'll leave it at your feet," Diego said finally, "if only I can find peace."

The old woman nodded and vanished into thin air. The sound of Tane Mahuta's song faded away as the sun dipped below the horizon
