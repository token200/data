Marcus García Martínez sat at his desk, staring out the window as he sipped his lukewarm coffee. As a detective with the Miami PD, he had seen it all - the good, the bad, and the ugly. But there was something about this case that was eating away at him.

The victim, a young woman named Sophia, had been found brutally murdered in her apartment just hours before. The only clue was a small note on the kitchen counter with the words "You'll never find me" scrawled in red ink.

Marcus's mind kept wandering back to the scene of the crime. He remembered the look of terror on Sophia's face, the way her body had been posed - it was as if the killer had wanted to taunt him. He shook his head, clearing the thoughts from his mind.

He began to re-examine the evidence, going over the statements from Sophia's neighbors and acquaintances. Everyone seemed shaken by her death, but none of them seemed to have any real motive for the murder.

As he delved deeper into the case, Marcus couldn't shake off the feeling that there was something he was missing. It was as if the killer had left a trail of breadcrumbs, leading him on a wild goose chase through the city.

Just then, his phone rang, breaking the silence. It was an anonymous caller, claiming to have information about Sophia's murder. "Meet me at the old warehouse on 5th and Main at midnight," the voice said, before hanging up.

Marcus's instincts told him this was no prank call. He made a mental note of the location and time, his mind racing with possibilities.

At midnight, Marcus arrived at the warehouse, his gun drawn. Inside, he found a figure huddled in the shadows - a young woman, dressed in black, her eyes gleaming with an otherworldly intensity.

"It's me," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I'm Sophia's sister."

As Marcus listened to her story, he realized that this case was far more complex than he had initially thought. The killer was someone close to Sophia, someone who knew her secrets and was determined to keep them buried forever.

Marcus made a silent vow to himself - he would get justice for Sophia, no matter what it took.
