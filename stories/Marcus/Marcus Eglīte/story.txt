Marcus Eglīte sat at his desk, staring blankly at the parchment in front of him. As a young scribe, he had always been fascinated by the stories of old - the epic poems of Virgil, the histories of Cicero. But as he worked on copying out the words of the great Romans, he couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to life than mere scribbling.

Marcus's thoughts were interrupted by a knock at the door. It was his mentor, Master Aurelius. "Marcus, I have a message from the patron," he said, his voice low and serious. "He requests your presence at a gathering tonight. It is a matter of great importance."

Marcus's heart skipped a beat as he gathered up his parchments and followed Master Aurelius out of the scriptorium. As they walked through the winding streets of Rome, Marcus couldn't help but wonder what this message could mean.

The gathering took place in a large, opulent villa on the outskirts of the city. There were many guests, all of whom seemed to be waiting for something - or someone. When Master Aurelius led him inside, Marcus saw a figure standing at the far end of the room, cloaked in shadows.

"Ah, Marcus Eglīte," the figure said, its voice low and gravelly. "I have been expecting you. You possess a certain... talent for recording history."

Marcus felt a shiver run down his spine as the figure stepped forward, revealing a wise old man with piercing eyes. This was none other than Cicero himself.

"You see, Marcus," Cicero continued, "the world is changing rapidly. New ideas and discoveries are emerging every day. But we need someone to record it all - to chronicle the events of our time."

Marcus's mind was racing as he listened to Cicero's words. He had always dreamed of making a name for himself beyond the scriptorium, but he never thought he would be asked to do so in such a way.

Cicero handed Marcus a small, leather-bound book. "This is your task," he said. "To record the history of our world - and to preserve it for generations to come."

As Marcus took the book from Cicero's hands, he felt a sense of purpose wash over him. He knew that this was just the beginning of his journey, but he was ready to face whatever lay ahead.
