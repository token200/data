Marcus Mancini's eyes scanned the crowded streets of Little Italy, his Italian heritage evident in every pore. He was a man of few words, but when he spoke, people listened. As a low-level enforcer for the Morano crime family, Marcus kept to himself, preferring the shadows to the spotlight.

Tonight was different, though. Tonight, Marcus had a job to do. A job that could make or break his reputation within the family. He stood outside Sal's Diner, a dimly lit café where the deal would go down. The Morano lieutenant, Joey "The Bull" Barbieri, greeted him with a nod.

"What's the plan?" Marcus asked, eyeing the diner's entrance.

"We've got a package to deliver," Joey replied, his voice low and gravelly. "Meet with some... unsavory characters. You'll be the muscle."

Marcus nodded, a hint of unease creeping up his spine. This wasn't the kind of job he was used to. But, as an enforcer, you took what came your way.

Inside the diner, the patrons seemed oblivious to the tension simmering just beneath the surface. Marcus spotted the buyer – a hooded figure sipping on a cup of black coffee. Joey had told him this guy was trouble, but Marcus trusted his instincts.

The package was a small briefcase, containing what could be millions in cash. The buyer snatched it from Marcus's hands without so much as a thank you. As the exchange went down, Marcus watched warily, sensing something off. This deal felt too good to be true.

When the transaction concluded, the hooded figure took off into the night, leaving Marcus alone with the briefcase. Suddenly, Joey reappeared by his side.

"You handled it smooth, kid," Joey said, as they stepped outside. "But don't think this is the end of your troubles. You've got a new problem now – you're the one they're coming after."

Marcus shook his head, wincing at the mention of being targeted. This was what he'd signed up for when he joined the Morano family. The world outside these streets wasn't kind to people like him.

"What do I do?" Marcus asked Joey, feeling a sense of desperation creeping in.

"Get out while you still can," Joey said with a cold smile. "Leave this life behind. Trust me, it's not worth your soul."

Marcus hesitated for a moment before turning his back on the family that had taken him under its wing. Tonight marked a new chapter – one where he vowed to keep his head down and stay out of trouble.
