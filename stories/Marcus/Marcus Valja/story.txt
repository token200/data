Marcus Valja stepped out of the crowded tavern, his eyes scanning the fog-shrouded streets of Prague. The sounds of laughter and music faded into the distance as he made his way towards the Vltava River. He had been in Prague for weeks now, searching for any lead on his missing sister.

As a detective with the Czech police, Marcus Valja was no stranger to darkness and corruption. But this case felt different, like something was off about it that he couldn't quite put his finger on. His sister, Anna Valja, had been investigating a string of high-profile murders, and now she was gone.

Marcus lit a cigarette and took a long drag, watching as the mist swirled around him. He thought back to the last time they spoke, just days before her disappearance. She had mentioned something about a source close to one of the victims, someone who knew more than they were letting on.

Suddenly, his phone buzzed in his pocket. Marcus pulled it out and answered, his eyes narrowing as he listened to the voice on the other end. "What do you know?" he growled, his grip on the cigarette tightening.

The voice on the other end hesitated before speaking. "I don't know much," they said, "but I think your sister was getting close to something big. Something that could put her in danger."

Marcus's jaw clenched as he listened, his mind racing with possibilities. He thanked the source and ended the call, his eyes scanning the fog once more. The Vltava River glinted like a knife blade in the distance, a reminder of the secrets that lay hidden beneath its surface.

With newfound determination, Marcus Valja set off towards the riverbank, ready to follow any lead that might bring him closer to finding his sister and uncovering the truth behind the murders. The fog swirled around him once more, but he was undaunted, driven by a fierce determination to find Anna Valja alive.
