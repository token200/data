Marcus JÃ¤rv stood at the edge of the frozen lake, his breath misting in the chilly air. He had come to this place alone, seeking solace from the turmoil that had been brewing inside him for weeks.

As a former soldier, Marcus had seen his fair share of battlefields and bloodied streets. But it was the silence and stillness of this frozen landscape that drew him now. The only sound was the soft crunch of snow beneath his boots, the distant howl of wolves in the distance.

Marcus's thoughts were consumed by the memories of his past, of the friends he had lost and the comrades he had failed to save. He felt guilty for not being able to protect them all, and the weight of those feelings threatened to crush him.

As he stood there, a figure emerged from the trees at the far end of the lake. It was an old man, dressed in thick furs and carrying a staff that seemed almost too heavy for his frail frame. Marcus watched warily as the old man approached him, his eyes narrowing into a piercing gaze.

"What brings you to this place?" the old man asked, his voice low and gravelly. "You seem troubled, like a wounded animal."

Marcus hesitated, unsure how much to reveal to this stranger. But something about the old man's words resonated deep within him. He took a step forward, and then another, until he was standing before the old man.

"I'm haunted by my past," Marcus admitted, his voice barely above a whisper. "I feel guilty for not being able to save everyone. I don't know how to let go."

The old man nodded thoughtfully, his eyes never leaving Marcus's face. "You must learn to forgive yourself," he said. "And then, and only then, can you begin to heal."

Marcus felt a weight lift from his shoulders as the old man spoke those words. It was as if he had been carrying around a burden that no longer needed to be carried.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the frozen landscape, Marcus knew that he would return to this place again and again. For in its silence and stillness, he had found a sense of peace he had not known for years.
