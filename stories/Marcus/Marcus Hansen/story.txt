Marcus Hansen trudged through the snow-covered streets, his boots crunching against the frozen crystals. It was a miserable day in Copenhagen, but he didn't let it faze him. As a detective with the Hovedsagen police department, Marcus had seen his fair share of bleak days.

As he walked into the station, his phone buzzed on his belt. He pulled it out to find a message from his partner, Emil: "Case file for the Jensen murder is ready. Meet me in room 3."

Marcus nodded to himself and headed towards room 3. As he entered the cramped office, he spotted Emil hunched over the computer screen.

"What've we got?" Marcus asked, dropping into the chair across from him.

"We've got a real puzzler here," Emil replied, tapping his pen on the desk. "Victim's name was Michael Jensen – 35 years old. No signs of forced entry or struggle. The only clue is this business card he left behind."

Marcus took the card and examined it carefully. A small logo caught his eye: a stylized letter 'L' with an arrow pointing towards the top.

"Any ideas on who might've left this?" Marcus asked.

Emil shook his head. "Don't have any leads yet. But I did manage to dig up some info on Michael's background."

As Emil began typing away, Marcus leaned back in his chair and steepled his fingers together. This was getting interesting.

"Michael Jensen used to work at a tech firm," Emil continued. "His business card has the L-tech logo on it – seems like they were involved in some shady dealings."

Marcus's eyes narrowed. "Shady dealings?"

Emil nodded. "Apparently, they were working with some big players from Eastern Europe. We need to dig deeper and see if we can find any connections between Michael and his murder."

As the two detectives began brainstorming theories and tracing leads, Marcus couldn't shake off the feeling that this case was going to be more than just another cold-blooded murder. There were whispers of something bigger lurking beneath the surface – and Marcus Hansen was determined to uncover it.

He stood up, determination burning within him. "Let's get to work," he said to Emil.
