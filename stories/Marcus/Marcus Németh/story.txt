Marcus Németh stood at the edge of the city, gazing out at the sprawling metropolis he had called home for years. As a freelance journalist, he had seen his fair share of corruption and greed, but tonight was different. Tonight, he had received a cryptic message from an anonymous source about a high-stakes story that could bring down the entire government.

Marcus Németh's mind racing, he pulled out his phone to check the time. He had 30 minutes to meet with his source before the meeting point changed location for security reasons. He took a deep breath and began to make his way through the crowded streets, weaving past pedestrians and street performers as he went.

As he turned a corner, he spotted a figure in the shadows - his source. The woman stepped forward, her eyes scanning the surrounding area before locking onto Marcus Németh's. "You're late," she said gruffly, but with a hint of amusement.

"I'm sorry," Marcus Németh replied, holding up his hands in mock surrender. "I lost track of time."

The source smiled and motioned for him to follow her. They navigated through a maze of alleys until they reached a nondescript door hidden behind a dumpster. The woman produced a keycard and swiped it across the reader, unlocking the door.

Inside, Marcus Németh found himself in a cramped room filled with documents and photographs. His source handed him a folder containing evidence of government corruption on a massive scale. "This is it," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "This is the story you've been waiting for."

Marcus Németh's eyes widened as he began to sift through the contents of the folder. He knew that this was it - the big break he had been searching for. With shaking hands, he pulled out his phone and dialed the number of his editor.

"Yes?" a voice answered on the other end.

"It's Marcus Németh. I have the story."

There was a pause before the editor spoke up, her voice filled with excitement. "Marcus, we're going to make history tonight."
