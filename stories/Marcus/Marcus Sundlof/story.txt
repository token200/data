Marcus Sundlof stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his piercing blue eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. As he made his way to the bar, the patrons couldn't help but notice the imposing figure in front of them. At 6'5", Marcus stood out in a crowd, and his rugged good looks only added to his aura of confidence.

A gruff voice called out from behind the counter, "What can I get you, Sundlof?" The bartender nodded toward Marcus's familiar face, as if acknowledging an old friend. Marcus smiled, relieved that no one seemed to recognize him in his disguise.

As a former member of the notorious Black Dragon Clan, Marcus had been on the run for months, trying to keep a low profile and avoid detection by his enemies. But it was hard to shake off the past, especially when people like Grimgar Ironfist still held grudges against him.

Marcus ordered a whiskey and took a seat at the bar, surveying the room with a mixture of caution and curiosity. He had heard rumors that a local group of adventurers was looking for someone with his skills to join their quest. Intrigued, Marcus decided to listen in on their conversation, careful not to reveal too much about himself.

As he listened, Marcus's mind began to wander back to his life as Sundlof, the young warrior who had once been part of the Black Dragon Clan. He remembered the thrill of battle, the rush of adrenaline when fighting alongside his comrades. But that was a lifetime ago, and now Marcus was determined to leave his past behind.

Just then, a figure caught his eye – a young woman with striking green eyes and jet-black hair, sitting in the corner of the tavern. She seemed out of place among the rough clientele, but there was something about her that drew Marcus in. He made a mental note to approach her later, curious about what secrets she might be hiding.

With a nod to the bartender, Marcus finished his drink and stood up, ready to face whatever lay ahead – as long as it didn't involve being recognized as Sundlof once again.
