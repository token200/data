Marcus Rothbauer stepped into the bustling café, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. He spotted her sitting by the window, sipping on a latte and staring intently at her laptop screen. It had been months since they'd last met, but Marcus knew that look – it was the same one she wore when she was lost in thought.

As he approached her table, she looked up, catching his gaze. A hint of a smile played on her lips before she quickly returned to typing away. Marcus chuckled to himself, remembering how she always got lost in her own world.

"Hey," he said softly, taking a seat across from her. "Mind if I join you?"

She shrugged, not looking up this time. "Not at all."

Marcus took a sip of his coffee, watching as the barista expertly steamed the milk. He'd always loved the way the café hummed with activity – it was like the sound of the city itself.

"So, how's life been treating you?" he asked, trying to coax her out of her reverie.

She sighed, finally looking up at him. "It's been...fine," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Just trying to finish this project."

Marcus nodded sympathetically. He knew what it was like to get lost in work – had done so countless times himself.

"I remember when we used to work on these kinds of projects together," he said wistfully. "You were always so driven, Marcus Rothbauer."

Her eyes crinkled at the corners as she smiled again, this time more widely. "Thanks, I think," she teased.

Marcus leaned in, his voice low. "Seriously though, how are you doing? You seem a bit...off."

She looked away, avoiding eye contact. For a moment, Marcus worried that he'd overstepped – but then she began to talk, her words spilling out in a rush.

"I've been feeling really overwhelmed," she confessed. "Like I'm just going through the motions of life without any real purpose."

Marcus listened attentively, his expression thoughtful. He knew what it was like to feel that way – had felt it himself when he'd left college to pursue his passion for photography.

When she finished speaking, Marcus nodded in understanding. "I think we all feel that way at some point," he said softly. "But maybe it's time to take a step back and look at what truly matters."

He smiled, feeling a sense of connection with her once again. As they sat there in the café, sipping their coffee and talking about life, Marcus knew that this chance encounter might just be exactly what she needed.
