Marcus's colleagues at the museum had grown accustomed to his eccentricities, but even they were surprised by his latest discovery. While pouring over a dusty old manuscript, he had stumbled upon a mention of a long-lost city deep in the heart of Siberia. The city was said to be hidden behind a wall of treacherous mountains and dense forest.
