Marcus Alsbach stepped out of the rain-soaked streets and into the warm glow of the bar. He had just finished a long, grueling meeting with his client, and was looking forward to unwinding with a whiskey on the rocks.

As he made his way to the counter, he noticed a familiar face sitting alone in the corner. It was Olivia, a journalist who had been sniffing around his business for months. Marcus had tried to brush her off, but she seemed determined to get to the bottom of things.

He slid onto the stool next to her, trying not to draw attention to himself. "Mind if I join you?" he asked gruffly.

Olivia looked up at him with a hint of a smile. "Not at all, Marcus. I was starting to think I'd have to report on your... business practices."

Marcus raised an eyebrow, taken aback by her directness. "You're not exactly known for being subtle," he said dryly.

The bartender handed Marcus his drink, and he took a sip, feeling the burn of the whiskey spread through his chest. Olivia watched him with an intensity that made him uncomfortable.

"So, what brings you here tonight?" she asked, her voice low and smooth.

Marcus hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. But there was something about Olivia's gaze that put him at ease. "Just trying to forget a long day," he said finally.

Olivia nodded sympathetically. "I think I know exactly what that feels like."

As they sipped their drinks in silence, Marcus found himself opening up to Olivia in ways he never had with anyone else. He told her about the stress of running his business, about the pressure to make a profit, and about the cost it took on his personal life.

Olivia listened intently, her eyes filled with compassion. When he finished, she reached out and put a hand on his arm.

"You're not alone in this, Marcus," she said softly. "We all have to make tough choices sometimes."

For the first time that day, Marcus felt like he was being seen, rather than just being observed. He looked at Olivia with newfound appreciation, realizing that maybe, just maybe, she wasn't as adversarial as he thought.

As they finished their drinks and prepared to part ways, Marcus smiled wryly. "Thanks for understanding," he said.
