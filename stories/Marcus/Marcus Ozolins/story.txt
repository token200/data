Marcus Ozolins was known for his sharp mind and quick wit, which had served him well in his career as a detective. Born to a family of modest means, Marcus had always been driven to succeed, and his determination had paid off in spades.

As he sat at his desk, sipping his coffee and reviewing the case files, Marcus's eyes narrowed as he pieced together the clues. The victim, a young woman named Sarah, had been found dead in her apartment with no signs of forced entry or struggle. The only lead was a small note left on the kitchen counter, with a single phrase scrawled in red ink: "They're watching you."

Marcus's mind whirred as he considered the possibilities. Who could have written such a cryptic message? And what did it mean? He made a mental note to look into any potential connections between Sarah and her neighbors.

Just then, his phone rang, breaking the silence of the room. It was the chief of police, asking for an update on the case. Marcus briefed him on the latest developments, mentioning that he had discovered a suspicious transaction on Sarah's bank statement - a payment to a company called "The Watchers."

As the chief hung up, Marcus felt a shiver run down his spine. This was getting more intriguing by the minute. He made a decision: it was time to pay a visit to The Watchers.

At the company's nondescript office building, Marcus was greeted by a receptionist who looked like she'd rather be anywhere else. "Can I help you?" she asked, eyeing him warily. Marcus flashed his badge and introduced himself. "I'm investigating the murder of Sarah Johnson," he said, watching as her eyes darted nervously to her computer screen.

The receptionist's composure was broken, and she spilled out a mangled excuse about not knowing anything about The Watchers. But Marcus Ozolins knew better - he'd seen that look before, and it always meant someone was hiding something. He made a mental note to dig deeper, determined to uncover the truth behind Sarah's murder.

As he left the office building, Marcus couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched - just like the note had said. But this time, he knew exactly who might be lurking in the shadows: The Watchers themselves.
