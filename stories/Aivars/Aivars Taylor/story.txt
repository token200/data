Aivars Taylor stepped into the dimly lit pub, scanning the room for any familiar faces. The fire crackled in the hearth, casting flickering shadows on the walls as patrons laughed and chatted over mugs of ale. Aivars made his way to the bar, his eyes locking onto a figure sitting alone at a corner table.

As he approached, the figure looked up, their eyes narrowing slightly before relaxing into a warm smile. "Aivars Taylor," they said, with a hint of amusement. "I wasn't expecting you tonight."

Aivars took a seat across from them, signaling to the bartender for a drink. "Just passing through," he replied, his voice low and even. "I had a lead on some information I needed to follow up on."

Their companion – an old friend named Elian – leaned forward, their eyes sparkling with curiosity. "What kind of information?"

Aivars hesitated, studying the rim of his mug before answering. "Just rumors, really. But I have reason to believe that a certain individual may be involved in some... unsavory dealings."

Elian's expression turned serious, and they nodded for Aivars to continue.

As the night wore on, Aivars and Elian delved deeper into the mystery, their conversation flowing easily as they pieced together clues and debated theories. The pub grew quieter, patrons filtering out one by one as the hours passed, but the two remained engrossed in their discussion.

Their talk was interrupted only by the occasional clink of glasses or the murmur of the bartender as he refilled their mugs. It was a comfortable silence – the kind that came from knowing someone intimately, and being able to rely on each other without needing to say much.

At one point, Elian leaned back in their chair, a look of contemplation on their face. "You know, Aivars Taylor, I've been thinking... you're getting older. It's time for you to think about slowing down."

Aivars raised an eyebrow, his expression incredulous. "Me? Slow down?"

Elian chuckled, shaking their head. "No, of course not. You'll never be content with just sitting around twiddling your thumbs. But... maybe it's time to take on a bit more responsibility, for once."

Aivars snorted, taking another sip of his drink. "Responsibility? Me?"

Despite the banter, he couldn't shake the feeling that Elian was right – at least, part of them was. The thrill of the chase, the rush of adrenaline as they followed the trail... it had always been exhilarating, but now Aivars Taylor wondered if it was time to find a new way to channel his energy.

As the night drew to a close and they parted ways outside, Elian clapped him on the back. "Don't get too cocky, Aivars. I'll be keeping an eye on you."

Aivars grinned, winking in response.
