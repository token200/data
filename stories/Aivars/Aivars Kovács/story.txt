Aivars Kovács stood alone on the windswept coast, his eyes fixed on the horizon. His piercing blue gaze seemed to hold a world of sorrow within it, as if the vast expanse before him was a reflection of the emptiness within.

He had lost so much in the wars that ravaged the land: friends, family, and even parts of himself. The scars on his body were nothing compared to the ones etched into his soul.

As he walked along the shoreline, the waves crashed against the rocks below, sending tiny droplets soaring high into the air. Aivars breathed them in deeply, as if trying to fill the void left by all that he had lost.

A voice behind him brought him back from his reverie. "Aivars?" It was a woman, her words laced with concern. He turned to face her, and for an instant, their eyes met, conveying worlds of unspoken understanding.

Kadri, the woman with the wild mane of curly brown hair, approached him cautiously. She had seen Aivars at his worst – in battle, when the fire of war raged within him like a tempest – but never like this. Here, on this desolate coast, he seemed fragile, exposed.

"You're not yourself," Kadri said softly, taking a step closer. "Not today."

Aivars flinched at her words, as if struck by the accuracy of her assessment. He had indeed lost himself in the darkness of his own mind. How had it come to this? The loss of loved ones still lingered like an open wound.

Kadri slid a glance around him before returning to Aivars' face. "I've seen you fight, Aivars. I've watched you stand against impossible odds and emerge victorious. But that's not the man you are today."

Her words cut through his despair, and for a fleeting instant, a glimmer of hope kindled within him. Maybe it was this moment – standing on the edge of the world with Kadri by his side – that he would rediscover himself.

Aivars exhaled slowly, letting go of some of the weight bearing down upon him. "I'm broken," he said aloud, releasing a sigh into the wind. "Like the sea and sand."

The waves gurgled in response, reminding him of the turmoil within him – like so much seawater ebbing and flowing with no shore to hold onto.

Kadri reached out, gently brushing a strand of hair from Aivars' face. "We'll weather this together," she said softly, offering what little comfort he could find on that vast, lonely coast.
