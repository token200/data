Aivars Wolf stood at the edge of the dense forest, his piercing green eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of movement. He was a werewolf, one of the few remaining members of his kind, and he had been tracking this pack for weeks.

As a former member of the Moscow Mafia, Aivars had thought he'd left his violent past behind him when he discovered he was a lycanthrope. But the curse had proven to be too strong to resist, and now he roamed the forest under the full moon, hunting alongside his pack.

A growl rumbled in the back of his throat as he caught sight of a rustling in the bushes. He crouched low, his senses on high alert, as the pack's beta, Viktor, emerged from the thicket.

"Viktor, I've got him," Aivars whispered, pointing to a small, scrappy coyote-like creature darting across their path.

Viktor's tail wagged with excitement. "Good boy, Aivars! You're getting sharper by the night."

Aivars smiled wryly, his sharp teeth glinting in the moonlight. He'd always been a bit of an outsider among werewolves – he didn't fit in with their traditional pack dynamics or share their love of brutal hunts.

But Viktor saw something in him that no one else did: potential.

As they closed in on their prey, Aivars couldn't help but think of his human life. His wife, Natalia, had left him when she found out about his condition – she'd been the only person to truly understand him, and he'd pushed her away.

The pack's alpha, the enigmatic Sasha, appeared at his side, her eyes fixed on the coyote with a fierce intensity. "Aivars, take down that animal," she growled.

Aivars hesitated, but Viktor nudged him forward. He lunged, jaws wide open, and sank them into the coyote's flank. The pack erupted into cheers as they feasted on their kill under the starry sky.

As Aivars stood up, his chest heaving with exertion, Sasha approached him, her eyes burning with an unnerving intensity. "You're not just a hunter, Aivars Wolf," she said, her voice low and husky. "You're one of us."

For a moment, Aivars felt the old feelings resurface – a sense of belonging, of being part of something greater than himself.

And then he smiled, knowing that it was a fragile thing at best, and that he'd never truly be accepted by his pack – but he wouldn't have it any other way.
