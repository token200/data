Aivars' latest target was a powerful corporation known as Omicron Innovations, which had been accused of embezzling millions of dollars from its employees. Determined to expose the truth, Aivars set out to infiltrate the company's highly secure systems.

Using his custom-made malware and social engineering tactics, Aivars managed to gain access to Omicron's internal network. He navigated through layers of security, avoiding detection by the corporation's sophisticated firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
