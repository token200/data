Aivars Laine sat alone on the edge of his bed, staring blankly at the wall as he listened to the sound of rain pattering against the windowpane. It was a melancholy tune that seemed to match the mood that had settled over him.

Laine was a man in his mid-30s with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair that fell across his forehead in disarray. He had always been a bit of an outsider, someone who didn't quite fit into the mold of society. Growing up on the wrong side of the tracks had its advantages, Laine thought wryly - he had learned to rely on himself from a young age.

But now, as he sat there feeling restless and unfulfilled, Laine couldn't help but wonder what could have been if things had turned out differently. He had dreams, it was true, but they seemed farther away than ever. For now, his life was one of quiet desperation - working at a dead-end job to make ends meet, but with no real sense of purpose.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was Laine's best friend, Mārtiņš, who poked his head in and announced that he had heard Laine playing music the night before - late into the wee hours, it seemed. Mārtiņš didn't say another word; instead, he simply disappeared as quietly as he had arrived.

Laine sighed inwardly; he knew what was coming next. In a moment, his roommate, Krišs, would be on his doorstep, demanding that Laine play some more music - maybe even threatening to move out if Laine didn't get it together. It was all so... predictable.

But as the minutes ticked by and there was no sound at the door, something shifted inside Laine. Maybe it was the rain's soothing melody, or maybe it was just plain exhaustion, but suddenly he felt a sense of liberation. Why not play music for himself? Why couldn't that be enough?

And with a newfound determination, Laine stood up and strode over to his guitar - leaning it against the wall in front of him, he picked up his instrument with shaking hands and began to strum out a melody.
