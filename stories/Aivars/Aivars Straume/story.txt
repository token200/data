Aivars Straume stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. He spotted her in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee and staring intently at her laptop screen. Aivars made his way over to her table, his long strides eating up the distance.

As he sat down across from her, she looked up, a hint of a smile playing on her lips. "Hey, Straume," she said, her voice low and smooth.

Aivars smiled back, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "Hey, Kāra. Long time no see."

Kāra, short for Kārla, was an old friend from Aivars' school days. They had lost touch after graduation, but their paths had crossed again recently, and now they found themselves spending more time together.

"What brings you here tonight?" Aivars asked, his voice low and inquiring.

Kāra shrugged. "Just trying to get some work done. I'm working on a project for university."

Aivars nodded sympathetically. He knew what it was like to be buried under a pile of assignments and deadlines. He had just finished writing a paper on the history of Latvia, and was now enjoying a well-deserved break.

As they chatted, Aivars couldn't help but notice how Kāra's eyes sparkled when she talked about her passion for photography. She was an talented artist, with a keen eye for composition and lighting. He had always been impressed by her work, and it made him happy to see her succeed.

The conversation flowed easily, like they were old friends catching up on lost time. They laughed and joked, reminiscing about old times and making plans for the future. Aivars was grateful for this chance to reconnect with Kāra, and he knew that their friendship would only continue to grow stronger.

As the night wore on, Aivars glanced at his watch, surprised by how late it had gotten. "I should probably get going," he said finally, standing up from the table.

Kāra nodded, her eyes still shining with a warm smile. "Thanks for coming out tonight, Straume. It's been great catching up."

Aivars smiled back at her, his heart feeling full of warmth and friendship. "Anytime, Kāra. I'll see you around."
