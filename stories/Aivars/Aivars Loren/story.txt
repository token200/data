Aivars Loren stood on the windswept battlements, his piercing blue eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of trouble. As the commander of the city's guard, he had seen it all - from bloody battles to treacherous assassins lurking in the shadows.

But tonight was different. Tonight, Aivars felt restless, as if the weight of his responsibilities threatened to crush him beneath its oppressive force. He had been tasked with guarding the prince, the future king of Eridoria, but he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.

As he gazed out into the darkness, a faint rustling caught his attention. Aivars's hand instinctively went to the hilt of his sword, but as he turned to investigate, he saw nothing. The sound had come from within the walls themselves - perhaps a stray animal or a malfunctioning pipe?

With a sigh, Aivars returned to his post, his mind still on the prince and the looming threats that hung over Eridoria like a specter of doom. He had heard whispers of a dark cult, one that sought to bring about the downfall of their beloved king.

A sudden movement caught his eye, and Aivars spun around to face... nothing. He blinked once, twice - it was just a trick of the light, perhaps? But something nagged at him, a feeling that he had seen someone there, lurking just out of sight.

Without hesitation, Aivars leapt down from the battlements, his sword flashing in the moonlight as he sprinted through the castle's dark corridors. He was determined to get to the bottom of this mystery, no matter what dangers lay ahead.

As he burst into a deserted wing, he spotted a figure huddled in the shadows - tall, imposing, and shrouded in darkness. Aivars drew closer, his heart pounding with anticipation. Who was this shadowy figure? And what did they want?

The air seemed to vibrate with tension as their eyes met - and for an instant, Aivars felt a jolt of recognition, as if he had seen that face before... somewhere.

Without warning, the darkness dissipated, revealing a figure in gleaming armor standing beside him. Aivars's breath caught in his throat as the warrior approached, its sword raised high...

But before it could strike, Aivars remembered something - a promise made to an old friend, sworn on their very lives...
