As the sun dipped below the horizon, Aivars Yusuf would appear at the city's taverns and marketplaces, his piercing green eyes scanning the crowds with an unnerving intensity. He wore a long, black coat that billowed behind him like a dark cloud, its hem fluttering in the wind. The locals called him the "Ghost of Oldtown," whispering tales of his alleged supernatural abilities.

One fateful evening, Aivars Yusuf walked into the Silver Stag Inn, where musicians played lively tunes and patrons laughed and clinked glasses together.
