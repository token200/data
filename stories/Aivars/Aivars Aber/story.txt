Aivars Aber trudged through the snow-covered streets of Riga, his eyes fixed on the small, unassuming caf√© in front of him. It was a place he had known for years, where the owner, Frau Liebknecht, would serve him a warm cup of coffee and listen to his tales of adventure.

As a young man, Aivars had been a member of the Latvian Legion, fighting alongside the Nazi army during World War II. The memories still lingered in his mind, like a faint scar that refused to fully heal. But Frau Liebknecht had always seen beyond the surface, understanding the weight of his experiences.

She opened the door for him and ushered him inside, where the aroma of freshly baked bread wafted through the air. Aivars took a seat by the window, watching as people rushed past on the cobblestone street outside. The city had changed so much since his time in the war; the Nazis were long gone, but their legacy lingered.

Frau Liebknecht brought him a cup of steaming coffee and sat down across from him. "Aivars, what brings you here today?" she asked, her voice gentle as always.

He took a sip of the coffee, letting the warmth spread through his chest. It was just like old times, he thought to himself. The comfort of familiarity, the sense of being understood.

"I've been having some trouble sleeping," Aivars admitted finally. "The nightmares still come back sometimes."

Frau Liebknecht nodded sympathetically. She knew how hard it could be for veterans to adjust to civilian life. But she also knew that with time and patience, they would heal.

As they talked, the snowflakes continued to fall outside, casting a serene silence over the city. Aivars closed his eyes, letting the memories wash over him. He remembered the camaraderie of the Legion, the bravery in the face of overwhelming odds. And he knew that no matter what lay ahead, Frau Liebknecht would be there to support him.

For the first time in years, Aivars felt a sense of peace settle over him. It was as if the snowflakes were washing away the pain and the memories, leaving only a faint outline of who he once was.
