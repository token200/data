Ito Hansen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a smell that transported her back to her childhood in the rural countryside.

It had been ten years since she'd left this place behind, fleeing the painful memories that lingered in every corner. But a letter from an old friend, received just a few weeks ago, had stirred something within her. She couldn't shake the feeling that there was still unfinished business to attend to.

Ito made her way through the station, nodding at the familiar faces of the locals who went about their daily routines. She had always loved this place, despite its rugged simplicity. There was a quiet beauty to it, a sense of peace that seemed to seep into your very bones.

As she walked out of the station, Ito's eyes landed on a small caf√© tucked away down a side street. The sign above the door read "The Red Room", and something about it drew her in. She pushed open the door and was enveloped by the warm glow of lanterns and the sweet scent of baking bread.

 Inside, the proprietor, an elderly woman named Akane, looked up from behind the counter. "Ito-chan!" she exclaimed, a wide smile spreading across her face. "It's been far too long!"

The two women spent the next hour catching up on old times, sipping tea and laughing like they used to when Ito was just a teenager. As they talked, Ito felt the weight of her past begin to lift, ever so slightly.

But as the afternoon wore on, Akane's expression turned serious. "Ito-chan," she said, her voice low and hesitant. "I need to tell you something."

Ito's heart skipped a beat. What could it be? A family secret? A long-held grudge?

"It's about your sister," Akane continued, her eyes locked on Ito's.

A lump formed in Ito's throat as memories came flooding back. Her younger sister, Mika, had passed away far too soon, leaving behind a void that still echoed through Ito's life.

"Why did you never tell me?" Ito asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Akane shook her head. "I didn't want to burden you with it. But I think it's time the truth came out."

As they talked, the shadows in the room seemed to deepen, and Ito felt the presence of the past closing in around her. But for the first time in years, she felt a sense of resolve. It was time to face what had been haunting her all this time.
