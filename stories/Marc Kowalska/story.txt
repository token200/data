Marc Kowalska woke up to the sound of rain pattering against his windowpane. He groggily opened one eye, then the other, and rubbed the sleep from his face. The dim light of dawn cast a greyish hue over his small apartment, which he shared with his cat, Luna.

As he swung his legs over the side of the bed, Marc's stomach growled in protest. He had forgotten to eat dinner the night before, and now he was paying the price. He stumbled out of bed and staggered to the kitchenette, fumbling for a pack of instant noodles that he kept on hand for just such occasions.

While his noodles cooked, Marc splashed some water on his face, trying to wake himself up. It didn't work. He still felt like he was stuck in a fog, unable to shake off the lingering remnants of last night's hangover.

Marc had always been a bit of a wild child, and last night had been no exception. He had met up with some friends at a dive bar downtown, where they had proceeded to drink their weight in cheap beer and loud music. Marc couldn't remember much after that, but he vaguely recalled stumbling out of the bar and into a taxi, which had deposited him back on his doorstep.

As he waited for his noodles to cook, Marc's mind wandered back to the events of last night. He remembered laughing with his friends, singing along to some obscure punk rock song, and at one point, trying to dance on top of a table. The details were fuzzy, but the memory of the bar fight was still pretty vivid in his head.

Marc poured himself a steaming bowl of noodles and sat down at the kitchenette table, cradling the bowl in his hands as he stared out the window into the rain-soaked streets below. He loved days like this – grey, gloomy, and utterly forgettable. The world outside seemed to match his mood perfectly.

Just then, Luna sauntered into the kitchen, tail twitching with interest. Marc reached down and scratched behind her ears, earning a contented purr from the cat. For a few minutes, the two of them sat in comfortable silence, watching the rain create tiny rivers on the sidewalk outside.

Eventually, Marc got up to grab his phone and scroll through social media. The first thing he saw was a message from his best friend, Jake: "Hey, dude, what's with all the crazy posts last night? You okay?" Marc winced, remembering that he had probably posted some... interesting things on Facebook during his drinking spree.

He scrolled past a few more messages from friends and acquaintances, each one asking after his well-being. Marc sighed and rubbed his temples. He hated mornings like this – when the remnants of last night's antics caught up with him, and all he wanted to do was crawl back into bed and hide.

Just as he was starting to feel sorry for himself, a new message popped up on his screen. This one wasn't from Jake or any other friend, but from an unknown number: "Hey Marc, remember that time we snuck into the abandoned factory? I still owe you one."

Marc's heart skipped a beat as he stared at the text. Abandoned factories? Sneaking in with friends? It sounded like something out of his teenage years, when he and Jake used to explore the city's outskirts on a mission to find adventure.

A spark of curiosity ignited within Marc. He quickly typed out a response: "What are you talking about?"

The next message came quickly: "Don't pretend like you don't remember. I'm talking about that one night we stumbled upon the secret art exhibit. The one with the graffiti and the...other stuff."

Marc's mind started racing as memories began to flood back. He remembered sneaking into an abandoned factory on the outskirts of town, discovering a hidden gallery filled with vibrant street art. And yes, there had been something else – something that he had promised himself and Jake they would never speak of again.

A shiver ran down Marc's spine as he realized that someone was trying to reconnect him with his wilder past. He typed out a hasty reply: "What do you want, man?"

The response came almost immediately: "I want to meet up. Like old times."

Marc hesitated for a moment, unsure of what to say. Part of him wanted to run, to leave the memories and the secrets buried where they belonged. But another part – a small, rebellious spark within him – was curious. What did his past self have in store for him?

He looked around at Luna, who was watching him with an unblinking stare. "I guess it's time for a walk," he said, already standing up to grab his jacket.

The rain had let up a bit by the time Marc made his way out into the morning air. He walked through the streets, feeling a little more awake and alive than he had all morning. The unknown number led him on a wild goose chase across town, until they finally agreed to meet at a small café near the river.

As Marc arrived at the café, he spotted the owner of the mysterious text sitting in the corner, nursing a cup of coffee. It was a face he hadn't seen in years – a boyhood friend named Mike who had been one of the gang that used to sneak around the city together.

Mike caught his eye and nodded, a sly grin spreading across his face. "Welcome back, old friend," he said, as Marc slid into the booth beside him.

And with that, Marc's day took an unexpected turn – one that would lead him down memories of the past, and maybe even reveal some secrets he had tried so hard to keep hidden away.
