Colette Järv stepped out of the snow-covered alleyway and onto the bustling streets of Reykjavik. Her dark hair was pulled back in a messy bun, revealing a smattering of freckles across her cheeks that seemed to dance in the pale winter sunlight. She wore a thick, cream-colored coat with a fur-trimmed hood, and her fingers were shoved deep into the pockets for warmth.

As she walked, Colette's thoughts turned to her latest obsession: Icelandic folk music. She had always been drawn to the haunting melodies and primal rhythms of the traditional tunes, but lately, she'd become fixated on the life of a young folk singer named Gunnar. He was said to have traveled the countryside in search of authentic soundscapes, capturing the voices of Iceland's forgotten women on cassette tapes and collecting stories from the rural villages.

Colette had spent countless hours pouring over Gunnar's recordings, imagining herself standing alongside him, her own voice blending with his as they sang ancient songs to an empty audience. She felt a kinship with this mythical figure, sensing that she too was drawn to the fringes of society, searching for something more authentic in a world that seemed increasingly superficial.

As she turned a corner onto Laugavegur, Colette spotted a small, out-of-the-way café tucked away between a thrift store and a vintage bookshop. She pushed open the door, and the bell above it rang out like a tiny chime. The air inside was thick with the scent of old books and stale coffee.

Colette slid onto a stool at the counter, ordering a black coffee as she scanned the room for any signs of life. That's when she spotted him – an older man with sun-creased cheeks and piercing blue eyes, nursing a mug of steaming coffee in the corner. There was something familiar about his gaze, something that sent shivers down Colette's spine.

The man caught her eye, raising his cup in a gentle gesture of recognition. "Solveig Järv," he said softly, his voice like the rustling of leaves on an autumn breeze. "I thought you'd never come here."

Colette felt a jolt run through her body as she took in the stranger's words. How did this man know her name? And what secrets lay hidden behind those piercing blue eyes?
