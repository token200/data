Verónica's passion for baking had been passed down to her from her abuela (grandmother) back in Spain, where she had learned the art of traditional Spanish sweets. She spent hours perfecting her recipes, experimenting with different flavors and ingredients until she had created a menu that was both delicious and uniquely hers.

Despite her success, Verónica remained humble and kind. She took pride in supporting local farmers and artisans, sourcing her ingredients from nearby markets whenever possible. This not only ensured the freshness of her products but also helped to boost the local economy.
