Verónica Krūmiņa was a force to be reckoned with. As a 25-year-old Latvian journalist, she had already made a name for herself in Riga's vibrant media scene. Her sharp instincts and fearless approach to storytelling often led her down the most unexpected paths.

One stormy evening, Verónica received a cryptic tip about a mysterious, abandoned hospital on the outskirts of town. Intrigued, she decided to investigate further. The hospital, once a hub for medical innovation, had been shut down decades ago after a series of tragic accidents. Rumors swirled that it was cursed.

Undeterred by the whispers and warnings from locals, Verónica set out to explore the crumbling building. As she pushed open the creaky front door, a chill ran down her spine. The air inside was thick with dust and memories.

She began to wander through the deserted halls, taking notes and snapping photos of the eerie atmosphere. Suddenly, she stumbled upon an old medical record room. Amidst the yellowed files and rusted medical equipment, Verónica discovered a series of cryptic patient records. One entry caught her eye: "Patient 13, female, died under mysterious circumstances. Autopsy results inconclusive."

Verónica's curiosity was piqued. She decided to dig deeper, poring over old newspapers and conducting interviews with former hospital staff members. The more she uncovered, the more she became convinced that there was a dark story hidden behind Riga's forgotten hospital.

As she left the abandoned building, Verónica felt an unsettling sense of accomplishment. She had uncovered a piece of Riga's history that many thought should remain buried. Her article would expose the truth about Patient 13 and the mysterious circumstances surrounding her death.

But as Verónica began to write, she couldn't shake off the feeling that she was being watched. The stormy night seemed to be closing in around her once more. She quickened her pace, eager to get the story out into the world.

Verónica Krūmiņa had a knack for uncovering secrets, but sometimes, those secrets came with a price. As she sat at her desk, fingers flying across the keyboard, she wondered if some stories were better left untold.
