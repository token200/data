Verónica Dolera was a woman with a passion for photography and a love for the unknown. She had always been drawn to the supernatural and the unexplained, which is why she spent most of her free time taking pictures of abandoned asylums, haunted mansions, and other eerie locations.

One dark and stormy night, Verónica Dolera set out on one of her favorite expeditions - exploring the notorious Ravenswood Asylum. The building had a reputation for being one of the most haunted places in town, and Verónica was determined to capture some evidence of its paranormal activity.

As she crept through the decaying hallways, her camera at the ready, she began to feel a chill run down her spine. She tried to brush it off as mere nerves, but the atmosphere inside Ravenswood seemed to be growing more oppressive by the minute. Suddenly, she heard a faint whispering in her ear - "Get out while you still can."

Verónica Dolera spun around, but there was no one there. Her heart racing, she decided to investigate further. She followed the sound of the whispers to a door hidden behind a tattered curtain. The sign on the door read "Ward 13" in bold letters.

Without hesitation, Verónica Dolera pushed open the door and stepped inside. What she saw took her breath away - a room filled with old medical equipment, rusty wheelchairs, and a single, unoccupied bed. As she looked around, the whispers grew louder, until it seemed like an entire chorus of ghostly voices was surrounding her.

Verónica Dolera knew it was time to leave. She quickly gathered her things and made a hasty retreat from Ravenswood Asylum. As she emerged into the cool night air, she felt a sense of relief wash over her. But as she looked back at the building, she could have sworn she saw a figure watching her from the window - a figure with eyes that seemed to bore into her very soul.

Verónica Dolera shuddered at the thought, knowing that some secrets were better left unexposed. She vowed to never speak of that night again, but deep down, she knew she would return to Ravenswood Asylum, camera in hand, ready to face whatever terrors lay within its crumbling walls once more.
