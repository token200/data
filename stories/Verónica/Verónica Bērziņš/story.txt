Years later, Verónica's artwork could be found in museums and galleries around the world, inspiring a new generation of artists to explore their own cultural heritage. Her legacy lived on through her paintings, which told stories of love, hope, and resilience in the face of adversity – all woven together with threads of traditional Latvian folk art.
