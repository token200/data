I couldn't find any information on a character named Veronica Lafourcade. It's possible that this character is fictional or not well-known. 

However, I can create a story based on your request. Here's a 400-word short story about a character named Verónica Lafourcade:

Verónica Lafourcade stepped off the train and onto the bustling streets of Mexico City. She had just arrived from a long and grueling road trip with her band, "Los Sonadores". The group had been touring for months, playing small towns and festivals all over the country. But after a particularly rough show in a rural town, Verónica had decided it was time to take a break.

As she made her way through the crowded station, Verónica's mind wandered back to her childhood. Growing up in the historic neighborhood of La Condesa, she had always dreamed of making music that would make people dance and sing along. Her parents had encouraged her passion, even when it seemed like just a hobby. Now, as one of Mexico's most respected singer-songwriters, Verónica was determined to make them proud.

She hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of her friend, Ana, who owned a small café in the trendy neighborhood of Roma. As they sped through the city streets, Verónica pulled out her phone and scrolled through her music notes. She had been working on a new album, and was struggling to find inspiration.

When she arrived at the café, Ana greeted her with a warm hug and a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice. "How's the tour been?" she asked, as Verónica took a seat at the table.

"It's been exhausting," Verónica replied, sipping her drink. "But I'm glad to be back in the city. Sometimes I feel like I'm just going through the motions." Ana nodded sympathetically, and Verónica continued, "I need to find my spark again. Make music that means something."

Ana smiled knowingly, as if she had seen it all before. "You'll get there, amiga," she said. "Just remember why you started doing this in the first place. The love of music."
