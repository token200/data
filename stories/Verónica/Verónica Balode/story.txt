Ver√≥nica Balode, known to her friends as Veronica, was a bright and ambitious young lawyer who had just graduated from Harvard Law. With a sharp mind and an unyielding passion for justice, she set out on a career path that would take her to the highest echelons of power.

Growing up in a low-income neighborhood in Brooklyn, Veronica had seen firsthand the devastating effects of systemic inequality. Her mother, a single parent working multiple jobs to make ends meet, had instilled in Veronica the importance of fighting for what was right.
