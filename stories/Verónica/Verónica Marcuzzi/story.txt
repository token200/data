Her friends and family often tried to offer words of encouragement, but nothing seemed to shake off the feeling that there must be more to life than what Verónica was currently experiencing.

One evening, while sipping wine at a trendy bar with her closest friends, Verónica found herself lost in thought as she gazed out the window. Her friends were chatting animatedly about their latest exploits, but Verónica's mind wandered back to her childhood dreams of becoming an artist.

She excused herself from the group and took a walk through the quiet streets of her neighborhood, letting the cool evening air clear her mind. The stars twinkling above seemed to be calling to her, reminding her of the creative spark within.
