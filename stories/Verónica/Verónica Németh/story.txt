Verónica Németh was known for her striking green eyes and razor-sharp wit. As a renowned detective, she had solved some of the most baffling cases in the city. Her latest assignment took her to the upscale neighborhood of Oakwood Hills, where a wealthy businessman named Richard Langley had been found dead at his mansion.

Verónica Németh arrived at the crime scene, taking in the lavish decor and the eerie silence that surrounded it. She began by questioning the guests who had attended the charity gala that night, hoping to find some clue that might lead her to the killer. Among them was Langley's business partner, James Parker, who seemed nervous and agitated.

As Verónica Németh questioned Parker further, she noticed a faint scratch on his hand. She asked him about it, but he claimed it was from a broken glass. Verónica Németh wasn't convinced, but she needed concrete evidence to prove her theory. She made a mental note to look into Parker's alibi and see if he had any motive for the murder.

After several hours of questioning, Verónica Németh decided to review the security footage. The grainy images revealed a figure lurking around the mansion, just as Langley was being attacked. The figure wore a distinctive silver necklace with a small pendant in the shape of a snake. Verónica Németh's eyes widened as she recognized the symbol - it belonged to an ancient cult that had been thought extinct.

Verónica Németh realized that Parker might be more involved than she initially thought. She decided to bring him in for further questioning, this time with the security footage as evidence. As they sat in her office, Verónica Németh watched Parker squirm under her intense gaze.

"You're not telling me everything, James," Verónica Németh said, her voice firm but controlled. "That necklace you're wearing, it's a pretty distinctive one. Tell me what it means."

Parker's eyes darted around the room before he finally spoke up. "I was hired to...to deal with Langley," he stammered.

Verónica Németh smiled grimly, her mind racing with possibilities. She knew that she had just scratched the surface of a much larger conspiracy. As she left Parker's office, she couldn't help but wonder what other secrets lay hidden in Oakwood Hills.

The investigation was far from over, and Verónica Németh was more determined than ever to uncover the truth behind Richard Langley's murder. She knew that it would take all her skills and experience to unravel the tangled web of deceit and corruption that surrounded him. But she was ready for the challenge, and nothing was going to stop her from solving this case.
