Growing up in a small town in Eastern Europe, she had seen firsthand the impact of corruption and oppression on her community. Determined to make a difference, Verónica dedicated herself to studying journalism and quickly became one of the most talented and tenacious reporters in the business.

One day, while investigating a tip about a local politician's shady dealings, Verónica found herself face-to-face with the powerful and ruthless leader of the town council, Viktor Petrov. Viktor was notorious for his ability to crush anyone who dared to cross him, and Verónica knew that she had to be careful if she wanted to get the story.
