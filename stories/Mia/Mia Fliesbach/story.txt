Mia Fliesbach stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any signs of life. It had been months since she'd last set foot in Ravenswood, a tiny town nestled in the heart of the countryside. As a child, Mia had spent summers here with her grandparents, learning the art of traditional woodcarving from her grandfather, Gustav.

Now, at 25, Mia was back in Ravenswood to sort out some unfinished business. Her grandmother, Helena, had passed away, leaving behind a treasure trove of memories and a mysterious will that needed deciphering. The letter she'd received had been cryptic, speaking only of an old wooden box hidden somewhere in the town.

Mia had always felt a deep connection to Ravenswood, as if the land itself held secrets and stories waiting to be uncovered. As she made her way through the quiet streets, she noticed the familiar scent of wood smoke and baking bread wafting from the local bakery. It was a smell that brought back memories of countless afternoons spent playing in the woods with Gustav.

As she approached the old wooden cottage where her grandparents had lived, Mia felt a shiver run down her spine. The windows were boarded up, but the door creaked open as if inviting her inside. She pushed it open and stepped across the threshold, calling out into the darkness. "Gustav? Helena?"

The silence was oppressive, but then, faintly, she heard the sound of wood chiseling against wood. It was a familiar rhythm, one that brought a smile to Mia's face. Gustav must have been here all along, working on his latest masterpiece.

Mia followed the sound and found her grandfather hunched over a workbench, whittling away at a piece of driftwood. "Mia Fliesbach!" he exclaimed, looking up with a twinkle in his eye. "I've been expecting you."

As they sat down together to sort through Helena's will, Mia realized that Ravenswood was more than just a place â€“ it was a family legacy, one that would continue to guide her on her journey into the unknown.
