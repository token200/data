Growing up in the artistic city of Santa Fe, New Mexico, Mia was surrounded by creatives who nurtured her talent from a young age. Her mother, a skilled potter, taught her the value of patience and dedication, while her father, a musician, encouraged her to experiment with different mediums.

As she honed her craft, Mia's passion for art only grew stronger. She spent hours exploring the adobe buildings and alleys of Santa Fe, soaking up the rich history and culture that seeped from every stone. Her paintings became a reflection of this surroundings, blending traditional Native American patterns with vibrant colors and textures.
