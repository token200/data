Mia Salvini was a young and talented artist who had always been drawn to the world of music. Growing up in a small town surrounded by rolling hills and lush green forests, she spent most of her childhood listening to her parents' vinyl records and watching old movies on TV. The sounds and images that flooded her senses sparked something within her, and she knew from an early age that she wanted to become a musician.

As Mia Salvini grew older, her passion for music only intensified. She began playing the guitar at 14 and soon found herself performing at local bars and clubs.

One night, after a particularly grueling show in Los Angeles, Mia Salvini found solace in the quiet streets of Silverlake. She walked along the winding sidewalks, taking in the sights and sounds of the city she had grown to love.
