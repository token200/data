Mia Wei, a talented and ambitious journalist from China, sat at her desk, staring at the stack of files in front of her. As a investigative reporter for the Shanghai Daily, she had been working on a exposé about corruption in the city's government for months. Her sources had been scarce, but she was determined to uncover the truth.

As she poured over the documents, a name kept popping up - Zhang Jian, a high-ranking official with ties to several major corporations. Mia's instincts told her that Zhang was hiding something, and she was determined to find out what it was.

Just then, her editor walked in, holding a cup of coffee. "Mia, I've got some news," he said, his voice low. "One of our sources has come forward with information about Zhang Jian's dealings."

Mia's eyes lit up as her editor handed her the source's note. The document revealed that Zhang had been secretly meeting with several wealthy businessmen to discuss a lucrative project - one that promised huge profits, but also carried significant risks.

Mia knew she had stumbled upon something big. She spent the rest of the day digging deeper, following leads and conducting interviews. As the sun began to set over Shanghai, she finally had enough evidence to write her exposé.

But as she was about to leave the office, a knock came at her door. It was a young woman, dressed in a simple white shirt and jeans, who introduced herself only as "Ling." Mia's instincts told her that Ling was no ordinary source - there was something about her that seemed off.

"What do you want?" Mia asked, trying to sound confident.

"I have information about Zhang Jian," Ling replied, her voice barely above a whisper. "Information that could bring him down."

Mia's eyes narrowed. Who was this mysterious woman, and what did she know about Zhang? She knew that she had to trust Ling, but also be careful - in the world of investigative journalism, sources were often few and far between.

"I'll listen," Mia said finally, her pen poised over her notebook.
