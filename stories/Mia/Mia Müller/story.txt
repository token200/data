Mia Müller stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of her friend. She had arrived in Paris just hours before, eager to start her semester abroad. As a junior majoring in art history, Mia had always dreamed of studying in the city of love and light.

As she waited, a familiar voice called out from behind her. "Mia Müller! Over here!" It was her friend, Sophia, who had been Mia's partner in crime since freshman year. The two had bonded over their shared love of art, history, and adventure.

Sophia emerged from the crowd, carrying a large backpack and a bright smile. "Hey, girl! I'm so glad you made it," she said, dropping her bag onto the platform.

Mia grinned, relief washing over her as she hugged Sophia tightly. The two had planned this trip for months, pouring over maps and guides, making lists of must-see sights and hidden gems.

Their first few days in Paris were a whirlwind of museum visits, art exhibitions, and croissant-filled breakfasts. Mia was in heaven, surrounded by the works of Monet, Van Gogh, and Renoir. She spent hours lost in the Louvre's hallowed halls, taking it all in with wide eyes.

As they explored the city, Sophia regaled Mia with stories of her own adventures – from solo travels to misadventures with old friends. The two laughed and joked, their friendship growing stronger with each passing day.

One evening, as they sat on a bench overlooking the Seine, watching the sun set behind Notre-Dame Cathedral, Mia turned to Sophia with a smile. "I'm so glad I'm here with you, Mia Müller," she said, using her full name for emphasis.

Sophia nodded in agreement, reaching out to take Mia's hand. "Me too, Mia. We're going to make some unforgettable memories this semester." And as the stars began to twinkle above, the two friends raised their faces to the sky, ready to take on whatever Paris had in store for them.
