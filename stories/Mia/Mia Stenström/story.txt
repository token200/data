Mia Stenström stood at the edge of the rooftop, her feet planted firmly on the worn concrete. The wind whipped her dark hair into a frenzy as she gazed out over the city, her eyes scanning the twinkling lights below.

As a journalist for the Stockholm Post, Mia had spent countless nights like this, pouring over tips and chasing down leads in pursuit of the next big story. But tonight was different. Tonight, she was searching for something more personal.

Her phone buzzed with an incoming message from her source, Lena. "Meet me at Café Central," the text read. "I have something to tell you."

Mia's instincts told her to be cautious, but a spark of excitement had been lit within her. She had worked with Lena before, and while their collaboration was always rocky, she trusted the woman's instincts.

As she made her way through the crowded café, Mia spotted Lena sitting in the corner, sipping a cup of coffee. The journalist slid into the seat across from her, her eyes locking onto Lena's.

"So, what is it?" Mia asked, her voice low and urgent.

Lena hesitated, glancing around the room before focusing on Mia once more. "I've been going through some old files," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Files from my time at Sveriges Radio."

Mia's ears perked up as Lena dropped the bombshell: "I think I know what happened to your sister, Maria."

The two women had lost touch after their last investigation together ended in tragedy, with Maria disappearing without a word. The official story was that she'd been killed in a car accident, but Mia had always suspected otherwise.

Lena's words sent shivers down her spine as the night air seemed to grow colder. "What do you mean?" Mia asked, her voice trembling.

"I think she was silenced," Lena replied, her eyes filled with a mix of fear and determination. "By someone close to us."

The revelation sent Mia reeling, but one thing was certain: she had to know the truth. As she left Café Central, the city lights seemed brighter, the wind in her hair carrying a newfound sense of purpose.

For the first time in years, Mia felt like she was closing in on the story that would finally reveal the secrets she'd been searching for. The investigation had just taken a dark and unexpected turn – but one thing was certain: Mia Stenström was ready to dig deeper.
