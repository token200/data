Mia Harris walked into the dimly lit coffee shop, scanning the room for her friend Emily. She spotted her sitting in the corner, sipping on a latte and staring at her phone with a mix of frustration and amusement on her face.

"Mia!" Emily exclaimed, putting down her phone and rushing over to hug her friend tightly. "I'm so glad you're here. I need someone to talk to."

Mia Harris smiled sympathetically as she took a seat across from Emily. "What's going on? You've been texting me nonstop all week, but you haven't told me anything," she said, curiosity getting the better of her.

Emily sighed and began to recount her latest dating disaster. Mia listened attentively, nodding along and making supportive noises as her friend droned on about her ex-boyfriend's lack of commitment and general cluelessness.

As they chatted, the coffee shop started to fill up with the lunch crowd, and the noise level increased. Mia Harris leaned in closer, determined to get to the bottom of Emily's misery. "So, what happened this time?" she asked, her voice low and conspiratorial.

Emily took a deep breath before launching into a detailed account of how her ex had ghosted her for a week without explanation or apology. Mia listened patiently, making sure to maintain eye contact and offer words of encouragement.

As they talked, the coffee shop began to clear out, and the barista started cleaning up the tables. Emily's phone buzzed with an incoming text from an unknown number – presumably her ex trying to make amends? But before she could respond, Mia Harris reached out and took her hand.

"Hey, Em? I'm here for you," she said softly. "You don't have to deal with this alone. We'll get through it together."

Emily's face lit up with gratitude as she squeezed Mia's hand in return. "Thanks, Mia Harris – I don't know what I'd do without you."
