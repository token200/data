In the quaint town of Willowdale, a peculiar individual known only as Yamada Wozniak had made it their mission to collect the most obscure and exotic spices from around the world. Their unique surname was often met with curiosity, but few knew that they were actually named after both Polish mathematician and computer scientist Adam Wozniak, and Polish film director Krzysztof Wozniak.

Determined to satisfy their curiosity, Yamada Wozniak embarked on an epic quest to track down the fabled ingredient.

After months of searching, Yamada finally discovered a small farm in the remote hills of Szechuan Province, where "Dragon's Breath" was grown in secret. With trembling hands, they harvested a pinch of the precious spice and returned to Willowdale, eager to share their discovery with the world.
