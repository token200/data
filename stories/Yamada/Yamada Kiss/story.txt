Yamada Akira, affectionately known as Yamada Kiss, was a free-spirited and enigmatic figure in the bustling streets of Tokyo. Her nickname "Kiss" came from her habit of leaving gentle pecks on the cheeks of those she admired or appreciated.

She wore a vibrant yellow raincoat with a red hood that matched the hue of her signature lip gloss.

Taro invited Yamada Kiss to join him for a nightcap at a nearby café. Over steaming cups of matcha, they delved deeper into each other's passions, sharing stories of their dreams and aspirations. As the night wore on, Yamada Kiss revealed her own creative pursuits – a passion for painting and photography that she hoped to one day share with the world.
