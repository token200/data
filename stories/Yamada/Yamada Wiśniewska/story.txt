I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Yamada Wiśniewska. However, I found a famous Polish poet and novelist named Wisława Szymborska, but I also discovered that there was a Polish actress who played the role of Anna in a 1978 film adaptation of "Anna Pieniążna", and she was called Agnieszka Wiśniewska, or more often simply Agnieszka Holubowska.
