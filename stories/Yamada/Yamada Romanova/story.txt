Her sharp instincts and quick wit had earned her a spot on the coveted morning news program, "Tokyo Today." With her bright pink hair styled in a chic bob, Romanova was a familiar face to viewers everywhere.

One fateful evening, Romanova received an anonymous tip about a high-profile scandal involving Tokyo's most influential businessman.
