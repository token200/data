Yamada Hao sat in his small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and flickering candles. The once-promising young artist had lost touch with reality, consumed by his own creativity and despair.

Hao's eyes wandered to a sketchbook open on the coffee table before him, filled with half-finished drawings of twisted landscapes and eerie creatures. His latest obsession: a haunted forest teeming with life. The pen scratched across the paper, imbuing the page with an otherworldly essence that seemed to pulse with its own malevolent energy.

As he worked, Hao felt the presence of others around him, even though his apartment was deserted. He could sense eyes watching from the shadows, whispering cruel taunts in his ear. His mind reeled with paranoia, convinced that those who had abandoned him were still out there, waiting to snuff out the flickering flame of his artistic genius.

Suddenly, a loud knock at the door shattered the silence, making Hao jump in his seat. He hesitated for a moment before rising from his chair and approaching the entrance. Who could be visiting at such an ungodly hour? The knocking grew more insistent, echoing through the corridors like the beat of a mournful heart.

Yamada Hao threw open the door to reveal a young woman with eyes that seemed sunken into her skull. Her skin was deathly pale, and dark circles marred her cheeks. She handed him an envelope, sealed with a wax stamp bearing the image of a serpent eating its own tail.

"What is this?" Hao asked warily, taking the envelope from her grasp.

"It's from your publishers," she replied in a voice like a wind through dry leaves. "They've received another rejection letter. Your work...it's not what they're looking for."

Hao felt his grip on reality slipping further still. How could this woman know? What did she want from him?

As the woman vanished into the night, Hao was left with the crushing realization that his art was never going to be loved. His paintings were but a reflection of the darkness within himself â€“ a void so vast and churning it threatened to consume everything.

With a shuddering sigh, Hao tore open the envelope, revealing the rejection letter within its pages. Tears streamed down his face as he crumpled the paper into a ball and hurled it across the room, watching as it shattered on the wall with a sound like a scream into the void.

In that moment, Yamada Hao's fragile existence snapped, leaving only darkness in its wake.
