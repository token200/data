Yamada Lemoine, a middle-aged detective with an unassuming demeanor, sat at his desk, sipping his lukewarm coffee. His eyes scanned the stack of files in front of him, each one bearing the hopes and fears of a desperate citizen. He was known for being relentless, yet gentle - the kind of detective who could disarm even the most hardened culprit.

It had been ten years since Lemoine retired from the force, leaving behind the thrill of the chase and the comfort of routine. But when his cousin, a young and talented journalist, went missing, he felt an inexplicable tug to return to his old life.

Lemoine's investigation led him down dark alleys and into the city's underbelly. He spoke with informants and witnesses, piecing together a complex web of clues that seemed to lead nowhere. Yet, he persisted, driven by a sense of responsibility for the young woman's disappearance.

One evening, as he pored over his notes, Lemoine received an unexpected phone call from an unknown number. A low, raspy voice spoke only one phrase: "Look again at the Maito case." The reference was like a slap in the face - it had been years since that high-profile murder case, and Lemoine's superiors had long since closed the book.

He spent the rest of the night re-examining the evidence, comparing notes with his past self. Slowly but surely, a new pattern emerged. The more he delved into the case, the more he realized that this young journalist was not just a victim - she was also a key to unlocking a larger conspiracy.

As Lemoine's mind whirled with possibilities, the darkness outside began to recede, replaced by a newfound sense of purpose. He knew that he still had a long way to go, but for the first time in years, he felt alive again. With each passing minute, his resolve hardened - justice would be served, no matter what it took.

As he leaned back in his chair, Lemoine's eyes locked onto the phone, now silent and still. He smiled wryly, aware that this was only the beginning of a new chapter in his life as a detective.
