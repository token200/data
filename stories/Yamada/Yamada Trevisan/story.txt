In the sweltering summer of 1922, in the vibrant streets of Tokyo's Shinjuku district, Yamada Trevisan was on a mission to unravel the mysteries of the city. A brilliant detective with an unquenchable thirst for truth, he had built a reputation as one of the most skilled and feared investigators in the Japanese Empire.

Trevisan, a man in his mid-40s with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair, walked through the crowded streets, taking in every detail of the surroundings. He was on the hunt for a rare gemstone known as the "Moonlight Seren", said to possess otherworldly beauty and immense value.

Legend had it that the Moonlight Seren could only be found by those with the purest of hearts and the keenest of minds. Trevisan's obsession began when his younger sister, Yumi, had vanished under mysterious circumstances, leaving behind only a cryptic message hinting at her connection to the gemstone.

As he navigated through the city's narrow alleys and bustling markets, Trevisan encountered an array of characters - from charming prostitutes to cunning smugglers. He listened intently to their stories, searching for any clue that might lead him closer to his quarry.

One evening, while sipping tea at a small izakaya, Trevisan met a charismatic stranger named Katsura, who claimed to possess knowledge about the Moonlight Seren. Over whiskey-soaked conversation, Katsura revealed that he had seen Yumi on the eve of her disappearance, meeting a wealthy collector in an abandoned warehouse.

Intrigued by this lead, Trevisan followed Katsura's directions and arrived at the crumbling warehouse on the outskirts of town. With each step, his heart pounded faster as if it too felt the thrill of the hunt. As he pushed open the creaky door, a chill ran down his spine - he knew that he was close.

Trevisan entered the dimly lit room, where he saw Yumi's message scrawled on the wall in her sister's handwriting. He gently touched the parchment, feeling an electric connection to the past and the woman who had vanished before him.

Suddenly, a voice whispered from the shadows - "You're getting close, Yamada Trevisan. But are you prepared for what lies ahead?"
