Karl Meier trudged through the slushy streets, his worn boots making squelching sounds with each step. He had been up since dawn, but it felt like he'd just woken up – again. The city was always awake at this hour, but Karl's mind refused to be wakened from its perpetual haze.

He worked as a mechanic in one of the smaller garages downtown, fixing cars that were old enough to have seen better days themselves. Karl liked working with his hands; it kept him grounded when the rest of his life seemed to be spinning out of control.

As he walked, Karl passed by storefronts with faded signs and dirty windows. There was the pawn shop where his friend Davey had tried to hock a broken watch, but ended up getting stiffed on the deal. Next door, the café served coffee that tasted like burnt ash – a testament to their owner's questionable life choices.

Karl arrived at work, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with the heel of his hand. His boss, Midge, was already there, sorting through a pile of greasy parts in the back room. She looked up as Karl entered and raised an eyebrow.

"Late again," she said without malice, but with a hint of resignation.

Karl shrugged and headed for the coffee machine, pouring himself a lukewarm cup from the day's previous pot. He took a swig, wincing at the bitterness.

The garage was quiet that morning; only one customer had shown up – an old guy in a threadbare coat with a rust-eaten Pontiac LeMans on the lift. Karl worked on it for hours, replacing worn-out belts and tweaking the carburetor until it purred like new. The owner left satisfied, but Karl felt no particular sense of accomplishment.

After the morning rush died down, Midge handed him a stack of paperwork to fill out – the usual: oil changes, tune-ups, repairs that seemed to multiply on their own. Karl went through the motions, his mind drifting away as he wrote in illegible script.

When the lunch break rolled around, Karl ducked into a nearby diner for a quick sandwich and some people-watching. The patrons were the usual mix – business types with briefcases and hurried glances; families with screaming kids and frazzled parents; and the occasional lost soul like himself, nursing a cup of coffee for hours.

A woman in her early thirties caught his eye – dark hair, piercing green eyes that seemed to see right through him. She sat at a table by the window, typing away on her laptop with an air of quiet confidence. Karl felt a spark of curiosity; maybe she was someone he could connect with for once.

As he finished his sandwich and prepared to leave, their gazes met for a brief moment – long enough for Karl to see something flicker in her expression: a glimmer of recognition, or maybe even understanding. He looked away quickly, wondering if it had been just his imagination playing tricks on him.

The rest of the day flew by in a blur of grease and engine noise. Karl closed up shop with Midge, swapping stories about their respective lives outside of work (he was vague, as always). On the walk home, he found himself lost in thought once more – not thinking about anything specific, just drifting through memories that seemed to be stuck on repeat.

It wasn't until he stumbled upon a small park tucked away between apartment buildings that Karl noticed something else besides his own self-absorption. The woman from the diner was sitting on a bench, staring at him with an intensity that made him feel like a specimen under a microscope. He froze for a moment before breaking into a hesitant smile.

She got up and approached him, her eyes never leaving his face. "Karl Meier?" she said, as if surprised he'd answered the question without prompting.

He nodded warily.

"Karl Meier," she repeated, this time with a hint of intrigue in her voice. "I've heard things about you."

As they walked away from the park together, Karl had no idea what the future held – but for once, his life didn't feel so stuck in neutral gear.
