Therese Toth stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. As a renowned linguist, she had spent years studying the ancient languages of the forgotten cultures that once flourished in this remote region. Her latest expedition was to uncover the secrets of the long-lost tongue of Azura.

Therese Toth pulled out her well-worn journal and notebook, taking a deep breath as she began to transcribe the faint markings on the stone pedestal before her. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and decay, but Therese Toth's trained nose picked up on the subtle nuances of the language, hidden beneath the surface.

As she worked, Therese Toth couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the sheer scope of her discovery. This language had been lost to time, erased by the ravages of conquest and cultural suppression. But Therese Toth's tireless efforts had brought it back to life, if only for a brief moment.

The station was quiet, except for the soft creaking of the old wooden beams above. Therese Toth felt a shiver run down her spine as she realized that she was not alone. She turned to see a figure emerging from the shadows, its eyes fixed intently on hers.

Therese Toth's heart quickened as the figure approached, but as it drew closer, she saw that it was just an old man, dressed in tattered robes. He handed her a small, leather-bound book, his eyes gleaming with a knowing light.

"For you," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "From the one who came before."

Therese Toth's eyes widened as she took the book from the old man. It was written in Azuran script, the same language she had spent years studying. She felt a surge of excitement as she began to translate the words, her mind racing with the implications.

As she read on, Therese Toth knew that this discovery would change everything. The secrets of Azura were finally within reach, and she was ready to unlock them.
