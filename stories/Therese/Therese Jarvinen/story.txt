Therese Jarvinen had always been fascinated by the old, dusty bookstore on Main Street. As a child, she would often sneak in through the door and get lost among the shelves of worn paperbacks and leather-bound classics. Her parents had warned her about the store's eccentric owner, Mr. Jenkins, but Therese didn't believe it was true.

One rainy afternoon, as she was browsing through the fiction section, Therese stumbled upon a rare edition of "The Little Prince". It was an original, first-print run copy, its pages yellowed with age and its cover adorned with golden lettering. She knew she had to have it.

Therese approached Mr. Jenkins, who was hunched over behind the counter, surrounded by stacks of books and papers. He looked up at her with his thick, round spectacles perched on the end of his nose, and nodded curtly in greeting.

"I want that book," Therese said, pointing to the rare edition.

Mr. Jenkins raised an eyebrow, impressed despite himself. "Ah, you've got a good eye for the classics, young one. That's a rare find indeed."

He took the book from Therese and examined it carefully before sliding it across the counter to her. As she handed over her money, Mr. Jenkins asked, "How did you come to be interested in books, anyway?"

Therese thought for a moment before responding. "I guess I just love getting lost in stories. There's something about exploring new worlds and meeting new people that draws me in."

Mr. Jenkins nodded, his eyes twinkling with understanding. "I think that's what makes us all readers, don't you? We're always on the lookout for something new to discover."

Therese left the store that day with a spring in her step, the rare edition of "The Little Prince" clutched tightly in her hand. She knew she would return to Mr. Jenkins' bookstore many times, drawn by its magic and the wisdom of its owner.

As the years went by, Therese Jarvinen became a regular at the store, recommending books to Mr. Jenkins and discussing literature with him over steaming cups of coffee. And though she grew up and moved away from her childhood home, she never forgot about that old bookstore or the man who had introduced her to the magic of words.
