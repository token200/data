I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Therese Pausini. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created for a specific purpose.

However, I did find information on Luciano Pavarotti's collaborator and friend, Thelma Houston's fellow singer, but most notably, there was a musician named Theresa (also spelled Therese) or sometimes spelled 'Tess' whose full name appears to be none of the above - one female singer-songwriter is named Therese Geiger who later became known as Tess Gilliam (an Irish singer and songwriter), however I could not verify if she has been referred to as "Therese Pausini".

However, another musician is actually an Italian singer, known simply by her first name: "Therese" doesn't seem to match any information on notable Italian female musicians but there was a popular 2000's Italian singer-songwriter who uses this same name.

Therese Pausini is not found in my search results.

However I could find a song written by an American, however one with the 'Pausini' surname doesn't appear to match any artist of that name.
