Therese Weber stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of her destination. She had been traveling for hours, and the rural landscape was starting to feel like a blur. As she collected her luggage and made her way towards the exit, she couldn't help but think about how far she had come.

Therese Weber had always been drawn to the unknown, and this trip was no exception. She was heading to a small town in the countryside, where she would be spending the summer working as an intern at a local farm. It was a chance for her to get out of the city and experience rural life firsthand.

As she walked through the town, Therese Weber couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder. The streets were lined with old oak trees, their branches heavy with leaves that rustled in the breeze. The houses were small and quaint, with smoke drifting lazily from the chimneys. It was a peaceful scene, one that Therese Weber found herself drawn to.

She made her way to the farm, where she was greeted by the owner, a gruff but kind-hearted man named Jack. He showed her around the property, explaining the various tasks and responsibilities of the job. Therese Weber listened intently, her mind racing with excitement. She had always been fascinated by farming, and this was a chance for her to learn from the best.

As she settled into her new routine, Therese Weber found herself feeling more and more at home. The work was hard, but it was also rewarding, and she loved watching the fruits of her labor grow and flourish. She spent her days tending to the crops, fixing fences, and helping with the animals. It was a simple life, one that Therese Weber found strangely liberating.

At night, she would sit by the fire, watching the stars twinkle overhead. She felt small and insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but it was a feeling she had grown to love. And as she drifted off to sleep, surrounded by the sounds of the farm, Therese Weber knew that she had made the right decision in leaving the city behind.
