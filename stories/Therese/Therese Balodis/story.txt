Therese Balodis stepped into the old antique shop, her eyes scanning the cluttered space with a mix of curiosity and trepidation. As an art historian specializing in 19th-century European art, she had heard whispers about this shop being a treasure trove for rare collectors.

The shopkeeper, an elderly man with wispy white hair, greeted Therese warmly. "Welcome, young lady! I've been expecting you. My name is Emile, by the way."

Therese smiled politely, introducing herself as Therese Balodis. Emile's eyes lit up as he began to guide her through the shop's narrow aisles. "I have just the thing for an expert such as yourself," he said, producing a dusty old frame.

As Therese examined the frame, she noticed it bore an uncanny resemblance to a long-lost painting by Claude Monet. Her heart skipped a beat – this could be the discovery of a lifetime! Emile smiled knowingly, sensing her excitement.

"Ah, yes! This is indeed a rare find. I acquired it from a fellow collector who claimed it was once owned by the Impressionist's own brother."

Therese's eyes widened as she carefully opened the frame, revealing a stunning watercolor of a Monet-esque landscape. The colors seemed to dance in the light, transporting her to the French countryside.

Emile handed Therese a small notebook and pen. "I've kept records of this piece for years," he said. "But I'm willing to part with it – for a price."

Therese's mind whirled as she calculated the potential value of the painting. She knew that as an art historian, her reputation was tied to accurate valuations. After some deliberation, Therese agreed on a price.

As Emile carefully wrapped the frame, Therese couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction knowing that she had secured a piece of art history for herself and her esteemed institution – The Balodis Museum Collection. With the painting safely in hand, Therese departed the shop, already envisioning the excitement and anticipation it would bring to her colleagues back at the museum.

And as for Emile, he smiled knowingly, aware that his life's work was in good hands with Therese Balodis – an art connoisseur with a passion for preserving history.
