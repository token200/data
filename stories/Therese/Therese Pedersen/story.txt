Over a steaming cup of coffee, Therese Pedersen met up with her best friend, Emma. They spent hours talking about their dreams, aspirations, and fears. Therese confided in Emma about her struggles as an artist – the self-doubt, the rejection, the constant feeling of uncertainty.

Emma listened attentively, offering words of encouragement and support. "You have a gift, Therese Pedersen," she said, her voice filled with conviction. "Don't let anyone or anything dull your spark."

Therese nodded, taking Emma's words to heart. She realized that she had been so focused on pleasing others that she had forgotten to follow her own path. From that moment on, she made a conscious effort to stay true to herself.
