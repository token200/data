Therese James had always been fascinated by the abandoned asylum on the outskirts of town. Rumors swirled that it was haunted by the ghosts of former patients, and she couldn't resist the allure. As a photographer, Therese was drawn to capturing the beauty in decay and neglect.

One stormy night, Therese decided to sneak into the asylum, her camera equipment slung over her shoulder. She navigated through the dark corridors, her footsteps echoing off the walls. The air was thick with dust and the stench of rotting fabric. As she explored deeper, Therese stumbled upon a room filled with rusted medical equipment, a stark contrast to the grandeur that once lay within.

Therese's lens captured the eerie atmosphere, and she couldn't help but feel a sense of reverence for those who had suffered within these walls. She spent hours in the abandoned asylum, snapping photos of peeling wallpaper, crumbling plasterwork, and the skeletal remains of former beds. Her equipment crackled with static as the storm raged on outside.

As the night wore on, Therese began to feel an unsettling presence around her. She tried to brush it off as mere imagination, but the hairs on the back of her neck stood on end. Suddenly, a cold breeze swept through the room, extinguishing her flashlight. In the darkness, Therese fumbled for her camera's LCD screen, illuminating the dark space.

Therese James gasped as she saw something that made her heart skip a beat – a figure standing just beyond the reach of the dim light. For an instant, their eyes locked, and Therese felt a jolt of electricity run through her veins. Then, as quickly as it appeared, the figure vanished into thin air.

Breathless, Therese stumbled backward, her camera equipment clattering to the floor. She didn't wait to see what would happen next – with a shake of her head, she turned and fled the asylum, not stopping until she was back in the safety of her car, speeding away from the crumbling building that now felt like a threshold to something sinister.

Therese James drove for hours, her mind replaying every detail of the strange encounter. Though shaken, she knew that she couldn't resist the allure of the abandoned asylum – there were secrets and stories waiting to be uncovered, and Therese was determined to uncover them all.
