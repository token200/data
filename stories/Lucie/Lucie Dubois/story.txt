Lucie Dubois stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the familiar streets of Montreal's Old Port. As she made her way through the crowded streets, she felt a sense of nostalgia wash over her. This was where she had grown up, where she had spent countless summers playing on the cobblestone streets with her friends.

As she walked, Lucie's mind wandered to the present day. She was now in her late 20s, working as a journalist for a small newspaper in Toronto. It wasn't the city she had originally set out to conquer, but it was home now, and she had found success in her career.

Just then, her phone buzzed with an incoming text from her best friend, Sophie. "Hey, Lucie Dubois! What's new?" Sophie asked, always eager to catch up on every aspect of Lucie's life.

Lucie smiled as she replied, "Not much, just trying to meet a deadline for my article. But I'm thinking of heading back to Montreal soon. The city is calling my name." She couldn't help but feel a pang of homesickness as she thought about the familiar rhythms and smells of her childhood.

After a few more messages with Sophie, Lucie decided it was time to grab some lunch at a nearby caf√©. As she sat down at a small table by the window, she pulled out her notebook and began to scribble notes for an upcoming story. Her mind was always racing with ideas, and she loved capturing them on paper before they slipped away.

Just then, a young artist caught her eye. He was sitting across from her, sketchbook in hand, lost in thought as he worked on his latest piece. Lucie watched him for a moment, fascinated by the intensity of his focus. She couldn't help but wonder what inspired such dedication to art.

After finishing her lunch and notebook, Lucie closed up her belongings and continued walking. The streets seemed a little brighter now, the city feeling less overwhelming as she made her way through its winding streets. As she disappeared into the crowd, Sophie's next text appeared on her phone: "When do you plan on coming back to Montreal, Lucie Dubois? I'll be waiting for you."

Lucie smiled, knowing that she would return soon. The city had a hold on her, and she couldn't resist its charms.
