Lucie Balodis, the protagonist of the popular online serial novel "The Last House Guest," sat on the couch, staring blankly at the wall. It had been six months since her husband, Trevor, went missing, leaving behind a trail of unanswered questions and eerie silences.

As she sipped her coffee, Lucie's mind wandered back to the night of the party, where she last saw Trevor alive. She replayed every conversation, every glance, and every gesture, searching for any clue that might lead her to him. But like all of them, it was a futile exercise - Trevor had vanished into thin air.

The police investigation had been ongoing for months, but so far, they had found nothing concrete. Lucie's friends and family were worried about her, sensing the desperation growing inside her. Her daughter, Poppy, who had always been close to her father, looked up at her with wide eyes and asked if she was okay.

Lucie took a deep breath and forced a weak smile onto her face. "I'm fine, sweetie," she said. "Just...just trying to figure some things out." But inside, she was crumbling. How could this have happened? Why had Trevor left her like that?

As the days turned into weeks, Lucie became increasingly isolated, unable to bear the thought of facing people or places associated with Trevor's disappearance. Her apartment was a shrine to him - photos, mementos, and his favorite books and music filled every room.

One evening, as she was scrolling through social media, Lucie stumbled upon an old post from Trevor's blog. He had written about his love for nature and the beauty of solitude. For some reason, that particular entry caught her eye. She felt a surge of determination wash over her - if Trevor had disappeared to find solace in nature, maybe she should follow him.

Lucie took out her phone and dialed the number of the park ranger from the blog post. "I'm searching for my husband," she said firmly. The voice on the other end listened attentively as Lucie recounted Trevor's disappearance. A quiet pause followed before the ranger promised to send a team to assist with the search.

With newfound resolve, Lucie stood up and walked over to her journal. She pulled out a pen and began writing - this time not about guilt or grief but about hope. This was just the beginning of a long and difficult journey, but for the first time in months, she felt like she had a purpose again.
