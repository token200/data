Lucie Brown sat alone in her small, cluttered apartment, staring blankly at the walls as if searching for something that wasn't there. It was a habit she'd developed over the years, ever since her life had taken a drastic turn.

Just a few months ago, Lucie had been a successful event planner, living the high life and surrounded by the people she loved. But after a bitter divorce, she found herself alone, with nothing but her memories to keep her company. The apartment she now called home was a far cry from the luxurious penthouse she used to share with her ex-husband.

As she sat on her couch, Lucie's mind began to wander back to the past. She thought about all the happy moments she'd shared with her husband, the laughter they'd exchanged over dinner, and the late-night conversations that had kept them connected. But most of all, she remembered the pain that had driven them apart.

Lucie sighed, running a hand through her long, dark hair. It was a tangled mess now, a reflection of the chaos that seemed to be brewing inside her. She thought about all the times she'd told herself she was fine, that she didn't need anyone else in her life. But deep down, she knew it wasn't true.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. Lucie's heart skipped a beat as she hesitated for a moment before getting up to answer it. She opened the door to find a delivery person holding a large package. It was a cake, wrapped in bright pink and blue paper with a big bow tied around it.

Lucie's eyes widened in surprise as she took the package from the delivery person. "Who sent this?" she asked, her curiosity piqued.

The delivery person smiled sympathetically. "It says 'From your friends at the office' on the card."

Lucie's heart swelled with emotion as she turned to the package and unwrapped it. Inside, she found a note that read: "We miss you, Lucie. We want to help you move forward." Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she smiled, feeling a glimmer of hope for the first time in months.

Perhaps, just perhaps, this was the start of something new. Something better than she'd ever known before.
