Lucie began her career at a local newspaper in Stockholm, Sweden, where she quickly made a name for herself as a talented and fearless reporter. Her tenacity earned her recognition from top editors and a coveted spot on the prestigious Investigative Journalists' Association (IJA) list.

One day, Lucie received a cryptic tip about a high-profile government scandal involving embezzlement and corruption.
