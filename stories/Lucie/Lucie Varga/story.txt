Lucie Varga sat alone in her small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and forgotten trinkets. She stared blankly at the worn wooden table before her, her eyes tracing the intricate carvings that adorned its surface.

It had been five years since she'd last received a letter from Lucien, her former lover and closest friend. Five years since she'd last heard his voice on the other end of the phone line, his words laced with warmth and longing. The ache in her chest was still there, but it had become easier to bear over time.

Lucie's thoughts drifted back to the memories they'd shared â€“ the laughter, the tears, the late-night conversations that had spanned entire cities and continents. She remembered the way Lucien used to make her laugh with his quick wit and infectious smile, the way he'd hold her hand through life's storms and calm her fears.

As she gazed at the carvings on the table, a faint smile played on her lips. It was as if Lucien was standing beside her, running his fingers over the intricate patterns, his eyes sparkling with amusement.

Suddenly, a knock at the door broke the silence. Lucie's heart skipped a beat as she hesitated for a moment before rising to answer it. On the other side of the door stood a young man, holding a small package wrapped in brown paper and twine.

"Lucie Varga?" he asked, his eyes locking onto hers with an unnerving intensity.

"Yes," she replied warily, feeling a shiver run down her spine.

"My name is Philippe," he said, producing a card from his pocket. "I've come to deliver this package for Lucien."

As the young man handed her the package, a small piece of paper slipped out and fluttered to the floor. Lucie picked it up, her eyes widening as she read the words scrawled on its surface:

"My dearest Lucie,

If you're reading this, I've found what I was searching for all those years ago. A way to make things right between us.

Come to Paris on the summer solstice. We'll walk along the Seine together, just as we used to.

Yours always,
Lucien"

Tears pricked at the corners of Lucie's eyes as she looked up at Philippe, who watched her with a mixture of curiosity and concern. "What do you say, Mademoiselle Varga?" he asked gently.

Lucie smiled, feeling a sense of closure wash over her like a warm breeze on a summer day.
