Lucie Kadyrova stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station. The familiar landscape stretched out before her - rolling hills, scattered trees, and a faint mist that clung to the ground like a damp shroud. It was home.

As she made her way through the station, the sound of murmured conversations and creaking wooden signs seemed to wash away some of the weight that had been bearing down on her for months. Lucie's thoughts were a jumble of emotions - guilt, anxiety, longing. But with each step, the tension in her shoulders began to ease.

She hailed a taxi and gave the driver directions to the old family cottage on the outskirts of town. The journey was short, but the ride itself felt like an eternity as Lucie's mind replayed every conversation she'd had since leaving. There were those who thought she should return to Moscow, that her parents would have wanted her to stay by their side after...after everything. But Lucie knew better.

The taxi finally pulled up in front of a weathered wooden gate, and Lucie stepped out into the cool morning air. The cottage looked smaller than she remembered, but its stone walls seemed to wrap around her like a warm hug. It was as if no time had passed at all.

Lucie spent the rest of the day unpacking boxes and sorting through memories - family photos, worn books, and half-finished puzzles that had been set aside for years. As night began to fall, she lit candles in the kitchen and sat down to a simple meal of boiled potatoes and stewed vegetables. The taste was almost comforting.

She walked out into the darkness, breathing in the scents of wet earth and autumn leaves. It was late enough that the stars had begun to twinkle overhead, casting a silver glow over the landscape. Lucie closed her eyes, letting the stillness wash over her. For now, she could be alone with her thoughts.

She thought about what lay ahead - rebuilding her life, confronting the ghosts of her past. It was daunting, but with each breath, Lucie felt herself growing stronger. She knew that the road would be long and winding, but for the first time in months, she felt like she could face it head-on.

As the night air grew chillier, Lucie opened her eyes and walked back to the cottage, knowing that tomorrow would bring a new day, full of possibilities and uncertainties.
