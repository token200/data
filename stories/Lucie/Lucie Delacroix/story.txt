Lucie Delacroix stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the crowded room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting in the corner, nursing a cup of black coffee. Her gaze lingered on his rugged features before moving to the tattoo on his left cheekbone – a delicate flower she had etched onto his skin during one of their late-night conversations.

Lucie Delacroix slid into the booth across from him, her slender frame squeezing into the small space with ease. "Hey," she said softly, her voice barely audible over the hum of conversation.

He looked up, his eyes locking onto hers before a hint of a smile crept onto his lips. "Hey, Lucie."

Their eyes met for a moment, a spark of understanding passing between them. They'd been through so much together – the good and the bad – but their connection remained unbroken.

A waiter arrived with their order: steaming cups of coffee and an assortment of flaky pastries. Lucie Delacroix picked up her fork and began to nibble on a croissant, savoring the buttery flavor as they sat in comfortable silence.

Her thoughts drifted back to their whirlwind summer romance. They'd met by chance at a local music festival, bonding over their shared love of indie rock and late-night conversations. The world had seemed endless when Lucie Delacroix was with him – like she could conquer anything.

As the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, their relationship blossomed. They explored hidden corners of the city together, laughing and joking like they'd known each other for years. But beneath the surface, underlying tensions simmered, threatening to boil over at any moment.

Their friends whispered about it – how Lucie Delacroix seemed to be pulling away from him, slowly drifting back into her own world. He didn't understand why she was afraid, but he knew that look in her eyes – that haunted, introspective gaze – and he couldn't shake the feeling that something more serious was brewing beneath their surface.

The waiter returned with fresh cups of coffee, breaking the spell that had settled over them. Lucie Delacroix took a sip, her eyes never leaving his face. "Thanks for being here," she said softly, her voice barely above a whisper.

He nodded, his expression understanding and gentle. For now, at least, they were okay – suspended in this fragile state of uncertainty, their connection still pulsing like a live wire between them.
