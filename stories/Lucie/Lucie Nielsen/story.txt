Lucie Marie Nielsen stepped into the crowded coffee shop, her bright blue eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her best friend, Rachel, sitting by the window, sipping on a latte.

"Louie!" Rachel exclaimed, using Lucie's nickname that only a few people knew. "I've been looking all over for you."

Lucie chuckled and made her way to Rachel's table. "Sorry about that, I got caught up in work," she said, plopping down into the chair across from Rachel.

Rachel raised an eyebrow. "Work? You're a freelance journalist, Lucie Marie Nielsen. What's there to work about?"

Lucie laughed. "You know me, always chasing the next big story."

As they chatted, a tall, dark-haired man caught Lucie's attention. He was sitting at the bar, typing away on his laptop. There was something about him that seemed...familiar.

"Who's that?" Rachel followed her gaze and raised an eyebrow. "I don't think I've seen him around before."

Lucie felt a spark of curiosity ignite within her. She excused herself and made her way over to the bar, her long blonde hair swaying behind her like a banner.

As she approached, the man looked up, his piercing green eyes locking onto hers. "Hi," he said, smiling.

"Hi," Lucie replied, feeling a little shy. "I'm Lucie Marie Nielsen."

The man's smile widened. "And I'm Max. Nice to meet you."

As they chatted, Lucie discovered that Max was a writer too, and they spent the next hour discussing everything from literature to music.

Rachel watched with amusement as her friend laughed and smiled with this stranger. She knew Lucie Marie Nielsen had a way of lighting up a room, and she wasn't about to let someone like Max slip away without getting to know him better.

As the night drew to a close, Max walked Lucie out of the coffee shop, his arm brushing against hers in the most pleasant way possible. "Would you like to grab dinner sometime?" he asked, his voice low and husky.

Lucie's heart skipped a beat as she smiled up at him. "I'd love to," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.
