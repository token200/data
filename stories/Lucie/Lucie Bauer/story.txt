Lucie Renée Marie Bauer stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of familiarity. As she made her way through the crowds, a familiar face caught her eye - Max von Schwaben, an old friend from her university days.

"Lucie!" Max exclaimed, hurrying over to greet her with a warm hug. "It's been ages! What brings you back to Berlin?"

Just then, Lucie's phone buzzed in her pocket, breaking the spell of their reunion. She smiled and pulled out her phone to check the message from her best friend, Léon.

"I'm taking a break from art school," Lucie explained, filling Max in on her plans. "I've been feeling stuck for months, and I needed a change of scenery."

Max nodded sympathetically. "I know how that feels. Sometimes you need to step away from the familiar to find your way back." He offered to show Lucie around the city, introducing her to some of his favorite spots.

As they wandered through the streets, Lucie felt a sense of freedom wash over her. She had always been passionate about art, but lately, she'd found herself questioning whether it was the right path for her. Maybe this trip would be just what she needed - a chance to clear her head and figure out her next move.

As they stopped at a street vendor, Lucie couldn't resist buying Max a coffee as a thank-you for showing her around. As they sat down to enjoy their drinks, Léon's message popped up on Lucie's phone again - this time with an urgent request for her to come back to Paris ASAP.

Lucie hesitated, torn between her desire to explore Berlin and her loyalty to her friend. But as she looked at Max, who was watching her with a knowing smile, she knew what she had to do. She took another sip of her coffee, already making plans to extend her stay in the city - for now.
