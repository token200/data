Lucie De Rossi was known for her fiery personality and sharp wit, which often left those around her in stitches. As a freelance journalist, she had built a reputation for asking tough questions and telling it like it was.

One sunny afternoon, Lucie received a call from an old flame, Marco, who wanted to meet up at the local café. Their past relationship had been tumultuous, but they still shared a spark that neither of them could deny. As Lucie arrived at the café, she spotted Marco sitting alone at a corner table, sipping on a cup of coffee.

"Hey, gorgeous," he said with a smile as Lucie approached him. "It's been too long."

Lucie rolled her eyes good-naturedly and slid into the chair across from him. "You're still using that old line?"

Marco chuckled. "Hey, it works, right? Besides, I've missed you, Lucie De Rossi."

Their conversation flowed effortlessly, covering everything from their careers to their personal lives. As they talked, Lucie couldn't help but notice how much Marco had grown as a person – his confidence and kindness shone through in every word.

As the afternoon wore on, their banter turned flirtatious once again. They laughed together at inside jokes, and Lucie found herself feeling more alive than she had in weeks. For a moment, it felt like they were back to where they started – as two people who genuinely enjoyed each other's company.

But as the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the café floor, Marco glanced at his watch and stood up. "I'm so sorry, Lucie De Rossi," he said, taking her hand in his. "But I have a plane to catch soon."

Lucie smiled wistfully as she watched him leave. Though their encounter was brief, it had reignited something within her – a spark of hope that maybe, just maybe, they could rekindle the flame that still burned bright between them.

As she left the café, Lucie couldn't help but wonder what the future held for her and Marco. One thing was certain, though: with Lucie De Rossi, every day was full of possibilities – and sometimes, a little bit of magic.
