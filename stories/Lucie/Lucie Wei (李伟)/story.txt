Lucie Wei, a 25-year-old Chinese-American journalist, had always been fascinated by the stories of her ancestors who lived through some of China's most tumultuous periods. Growing up in New York City, she was exposed to the harsh realities of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, which sparked her interest in history.

After graduating from Columbia University with a degree in journalism, Lucie landed an internship at a prominent Chinese-American newspaper in San Francisco. Her passion for storytelling and her knowledge of Mandarin Chinese quickly made her a valuable asset to the team. She began writing articles about the experiences of Chinese immigrants in America, exploring the complexities of their cultural identities and the struggles they faced adapting to a new society.

One day, Lucie received an email from an elderly woman who claimed to have been a survivor of the Tiananmen Square protests. The woman, who introduced herself as Madame Li, had fled China after being arrested by the authorities for her activism. She asked Lucie to meet with her in person to share her story.

Lucie was both excited and nervous about meeting Madame Li. As they sat down in a quiet café, Madame Li began to recount her experiences during the protests. Her voice trembled as she spoke of the fear and uncertainty that gripped her as she waited for news of her fellow activists. Lucie listened intently, taking notes and asking questions to clarify certain points.

As they parted ways, Lucie felt a deep sense of gratitude towards Madame Li for entrusting her with such an important story. She realized that by sharing these stories, she could help bridge the gap between different generations and foster greater understanding between China and the United States. As she returned to her office, Lucie Wei knew that she had found her true calling – to tell the untold stories of those who had shaped their country's history.
