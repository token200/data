I think you may be mistaken in your request. There is no historical figure named Lucie Aurelius Fulvus Boionius Arrius Antoninus Pius. 

However, I can create a fictional character based on the Roman emperors and their naming conventions. Here's a story about a fictional character inspired by Emperor Hadrian (not included in your request), but I can adapt it for Antoninus Pius:

As the sun set over the bustling streets of Rome, Lucie Aurelius Fulvus Boionius Arrius Antoninus Pius sat at his desk, quill in hand. A philosopher and statesman, he had spent many years studying the great minds of ancient Greece and Rome.

Born into a noble family, Lucie's life was one of privilege, but also duty. He had risen through the ranks of Roman politics with ease, earning the respect of his peers and the admiration of his people. His nickname "Pius" - meaning "pious" or "dutiful" in Latin - was well-deserved.

As Emperor, Lucie's policies focused on maintaining peace throughout the vast Roman Empire. He spent many years traveling to distant provinces, learning about their cultures and meeting with local leaders. His wisdom and compassion had earned him the title of one of the greatest emperors Rome had ever known.

One day, a young boy approached Lucie at the palace. The child's eyes were wide with wonder as he asked his questions about philosophy and governance. Lucie smiled and shared his knowledge with the eager student. He saw something in the boy that reminded him of himself many years ago: a thirst for wisdom and a desire to make a difference.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Lucie bid farewell to the young boy and returned to his desk. His mind turned to the challenges ahead, but he was at peace with the path laid before him. He knew that as Emperor, it was not just about personal power or wealth, but about serving the greater good.

With a sense of contentment, Lucie set down his quill and let the silence wash over him. The Roman Empire might be vast and complex, but in this moment, he felt at one with the world.
