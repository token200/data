Aija Stensson's eyes scanned the dimly lit room, her gaze lingering on the scattered remnants of what was once a life. The walls were adorned with faded photographs, and the air reeked of stale smoke and forgotten memories. She had returned to this small, cramped apartment after years away, driven by a mix of emotions: guilt, regret, and a glimmer of hope.

Aija's fingers drummed an impatient rhythm on the tabletop as she waited for her estranged mother, Helga, to arrive. Their relationship had been complicated from a young age – Aija felt stifled by Helga's rigid expectations, while Helga saw Aija as reckless and irresponsible. They'd grown apart, each pursuing their own paths in life.

The door creaked open, and Helga entered, her once-luxuriant hair now silver and cropped short. She regarded Aija with a wary expression, but as she took in the disheveled state of the apartment, her gaze softened. "Looks like you've been living on the streets," she said dryly.

Aija shrugged, though a pang of defensiveness flared within her. "I had to get out for a while."

Helga nodded curtly and set down a small bag of groceries on the table. They'd arranged this meeting to discuss Aija's future – or rather, lack thereof. Her once-promising career as an artist had stalled due to personal struggles and financial woes. Helga was willing to help, but only if Aija agreed to seek professional guidance.

As they sat down to a simple meal of canned soup and stale bread, the tension in the room dissipated slightly. They talked about old times – their shared love of literature, Aija's failed art show, and Helga's latest infatuation with a certain elderly professor. The conversation was stilted at first, but gradually, they delved into the reasons behind their estrangement.

Aija opened up about her feelings of inadequacy and frustration with her mother's dismissive nature. Helga revealed hidden insecurities, her own struggles to find purpose and connection in a world that seemed determined to move on without them. The words poured out, unencumbered by guilt or shame.

As the evening drew to a close, Aija felt an unexpected sense of peace settle over her. For the first time in years, she saw her mother not as a source of conflict but as a complex, multifaceted individual with flaws and fears just like herself. Maybe, just maybe, they could start anew – Aija and Helga, that is.

With a hesitant smile, Aija reached out and took her mother's hand. It was a small gesture, one that spoke volumes about the fragility of human connections but also their resilience. As they parted ways at the door, Helga whispered softly, "We'll get through this together, Aija."

In that moment, Aija knew she wasn't alone – not anymore.
