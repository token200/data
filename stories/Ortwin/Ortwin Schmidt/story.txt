Ortwin Schmidt was a man with a passion for life, or so it seemed. Behind his charming smile and effortless charm, he concealed a complex web of secrets and lies. As a successful businessman in his late 30s, Ortwin had built a reputation as one of the most shrewd and cunning entrepreneurs in Berlin.

On the surface, Ortwin's life appeared to be nothing short of perfect: a beautiful wife, two adorable children, and a stunning mansion in the heart of the city. But beneath the façade, Ortwin was drowning in debt and struggling to keep his empire afloat. His latest venture had gone bankrupt, leaving him with a mountain of unpaid bills and a dwindling bank account.

One fateful evening, as Ortwin sat at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of unpaid invoices in front of him, he received an unexpected visit from his wife, Anna. Her eyes were red-rimmed, her expression etched with worry. "Ortwin, I need to talk to you about something," she said, her voice trembling.

Ortwin's instincts kicked in, and he swiftly ushered Anna into the adjacent room, where he could control the conversation. He knew that if his wife discovered the extent of their financial troubles, it would spell disaster for his already fragile ego. "What is it, dear?" he asked, feigning concern.

Anna hesitated before blurting out a shocking revelation: she had been embezzling funds from his business ventures to support her own secret life. Ortwin's eyes narrowed, his grip on the pen tightening in his hand as the truth sank in. The carefully constructed illusion of his perfect life was crumbling, and he was powerless to stop it.

As the night wore on, Ortwin and Anna engaged in a heated argument, each one accusing the other of deceit and betrayal. But beneath the venomous words, Ortwin sensed an opportunity. He could use this revelation to manipulate Anna, turning her against herself and consolidating his power over their marriage.

In that moment, Ortwin realized that he had been playing a role all along – the charming businessman, the loving husband. The game was far from over; in fact, it was just beginning.
