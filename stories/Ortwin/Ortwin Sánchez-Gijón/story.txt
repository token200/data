Ortwin Sánchez-Gijón sat at his desk, sipping his coffee and staring out the window. As a renowned detective in the bustling metropolis of Madrid, he had seen it all – the gruesome murders, the heart-wrenching cases, and the never-ending stream of suspects.

But this latest case was different. The wealthy businessman's daughter had gone missing, leaving behind only a cryptic message scrawled on the mirror: "The shadows are where I am."

Ortwin rubbed his temples, feeling the familiar ache of frustration. He had been working on the case for days, but every lead seemed to end in a dead-end alley. The businessman's family was getting anxious, and Ortwin knew he needed to crack this one if he wanted to keep his reputation intact.

Just then, his phone rang. It was an anonymous caller, speaking in hushed tones. "Meet me at the old warehouse on Calle Fuente Elías," the voice said before hanging up.

Ortwin's instincts screamed warning signs, but something about the voice sent a shiver down his spine. He grabbed his coat and headed out into the rain-soaked streets of Madrid.

At the warehouse, Ortwin spotted a figure in the shadows. As he approached, the figure stepped forward, revealing a young woman with piercing green eyes.

"You're looking for answers," she said, her voice dripping with an otherworldly accent. "I can give you some."

Ortwin's curiosity was piqued. The woman began to speak, weaving a tale of ancient myths and hidden rituals. According to her, the missing girl had stumbled upon a secret society that dwelled in the shadows, and Ortwin's own life was now at risk.

As the rain poured down around them, Ortwin felt his grip on reality begin to slip. Was this woman a trickster or a seer? He didn't know, but one thing was certain – he needed her help to unravel this mystery.

"Where do I start?" Ortwin asked, taking a deep breath.

The green-eyed woman smiled, revealing pointed teeth. "Start with the shadows," she said, before vanishing into thin air.

Ortwin stood alone in the warehouse, the rain dripping off his coat. He knew he had a long and treacherous journey ahead of him, but for the first time in weeks, he felt a spark of hope. Maybe, just maybe, this case wouldn't be as dark as it seemed after all.
