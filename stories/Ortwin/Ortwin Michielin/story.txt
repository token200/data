Ortwin Michielin stepped out into the crisp morning air, the chill of the Parisian streets invigorating his senses. As he gazed up at the Eiffel Tower's iron latticework, a sense of melancholy washed over him. It had been ten years since his last visit to the city, and much had changed.

The Michelin brothers' tire empire was still thriving, but Ortwin's thoughts were with his late brother, Édouard. Their company's guiding principle – "safety above all" – echoed in Ortwin's mind like a mantra. He recalled the countless hours spent testing roads, roadsides, and even sidewalks to ensure their tires provided the best grip for drivers.

As he made his way through the winding streets, Ortwin stopped at a small café on Rue Cler. Over a steaming cup of coffee, he noticed a young woman nervously fidgeting with her bagels. "Pardon, mademoiselle," Ortwin said, "but would you mind if I bought you a few pastries? On the house?"

The woman's eyes widened in surprise as she accepted his offer. Over their shared baguette and jam, they discussed everything from travel to books. Ortwin learned that her name was Colette, and she was on vacation from studying physics.

Their conversation flowed effortlessly, transporting them to a world where roads were meant for exploration and possibility, not just transportation. As the café emptied, Ortwin offered Colette his business card, inviting her to join him for a drive through the countryside.

The next morning, Ortwin arrived at the Michelin headquarters, Édouard's legacy weighing heavily on his shoulders. His thoughts turned to the brothers' motto: "a safe road is no joy if it leads nowhere." That evening, he decided to take Colette up on her offer and invited her to join him for a scenic drive through Normandy.

Under the light of a crescent moon, they wound their way through rolling hills and lush forests. The only sound was the hum of the tire's rubber and the soft crunching of gravel beneath their tires. Ortwin smiled as Colette laughed in delight at the beauty around them. "You see, Colette," he said, "sometimes even the safest roads lead to joy."
