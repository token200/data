Ortwin Kaleja stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. As a renowned botanist, he had spent years traveling the world in search of rare and exotic plant species. His latest obsession was a particular species known as "Moonflower," said to bloom only once a decade under the light of a full moon.

As he made his way through the deserted station, Ortwin's thoughts turned to his former colleague, Dr. Sofia Patel, who had recently passed away after a long battle with cancer. They had collaborated on numerous projects together, and her loss was still felt deeply by the scientific community.

A figure emerged from the shadows, dressed in worn jeans and a faded jacket. "Ortwin Kaleja?" they asked gruffly, eyeing him warily.

"Yes," Ortwin replied, extending a hand. "I'm afraid I've come to the wrong place."

The stranger hesitated for a moment before taking Ortwin's hand. "You're close enough," they said with a small smile. "This is Ashwood Station, the last stop on the train that brought you here."

Ortwin nodded, his mind racing with possibilities. He had heard rumors of a hidden greenhouse deep in the nearby woods, where a rare specimen of Moonflower was said to be cultivated by a reclusive scientist.

The stranger led Ortwin through the darkening forest, the trees looming above them like sentinels. Finally, they arrived at a small clearing, and in the center of it stood a magnificent structure that seemed almost otherworldly.

"This is it," Ortwin breathed, his eyes fixed on the greenhouse. "Is this where Dr. Patel told me I might find Moonflower?"

The stranger nodded, their face expressionless once more. "Welcome to Ashwood Station," they said quietly. "I'm afraid you're not the first person to look for that."

Ortwin's eyes narrowed as he began to survey his surroundings, searching for any sign of danger or deceit. He knew that Dr. Patel had warned him about this place, but he had to see it for himself. The secrets hidden within those walls were too great to ignore.

As the moon rose high in the sky, casting a silver glow over the clearing, Ortwin Kaleja stepped forward, his heart pounding with anticipation and a hint of fear. He knew that he was about to uncover secrets that few others had ever seen.
