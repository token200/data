Ortwin Sundlof stepped out of the misty morning fog and onto the cobblestone streets of his hometown, Lyngstad. The small village was still waking up from its slumber, with only a few early risers hurrying to start their day. Ortwin, however, had no such qualms about rising at the crack of dawn.

As a young apprentice blacksmith, Ortwin took great pride in his work. He spent hours honing his craft, learning the intricacies of metalwork and hammering out designs that would make even the most seasoned craftsmen jealous. His full name was Ortwin Sundlof, son of the village elder, and he had always felt a sense of responsibility to live up to his family's legacy.

As he made his way to the town square, Ortwin spotted his friend, Jorgen, already hard at work on their latest project – a magnificent iron gates for the new lord's estate. Ortwin smiled, knowing that this would be his chance to prove himself and earn some extra coin for his family's struggling farm.

With a spring in his step, Ortwin approached Jorgen and began to examine the intricate designs etched into the gate's metalwork. "By the gods," he breathed, his eyes wide with wonder. "You're a genius, Jorgen!"

Jorgen chuckled, wiping the sweat from his brow. "It's just hard work and dedication, Ortwin. But I think we've got something special here."

Together, the two friends worked tirelessly to complete the gate, their hammering echoing through the square as the sun climbed higher in the sky. By midday, they had finished, and Ortwin felt an overwhelming sense of pride and accomplishment.

As he packed up his tools and headed back home, Ortwin couldn't help but think about the letter he had received from the lord's estate earlier that morning – a formal invitation to present their work at the upcoming Harvest Festival. His full name would be on display for all to see, and Ortwin knew that this was just the beginning of his journey as a renowned blacksmith.

With renewed energy, Ortwin trudged back up the hill, ready to share his creations with the world and prove himself worthy of his family's legacy.
