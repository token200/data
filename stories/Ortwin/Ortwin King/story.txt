Ortwin King stood atop the battlements, gazing out at the sprawling city below. As the ruler of Everia, he had grown accustomed to the weight of responsibility that rested on his shoulders. His full name, Ortwin King, echoed in his mind like a mantra, reminding him of the trust placed in him by his people.

As he scanned the horizon, a sense of unease crept over him. Rumors of an ancient prophecy had been circulating for weeks, speaking of a great and powerful sorceress who would bring about a new era of peace and prosperity to Everia. Some said she was already among them, hiding in plain sight.

Ortwin King's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of approaching footsteps. He turned to see his trusted advisor, Lady Isabella, hurrying towards him with a look of urgency on her face.

"My lord," she said breathlessly, "I've just received word from our scouts that a group of mysterious travelers has arrived in the city. They claim to be ambassadors from the distant land of Eldrador."

Ortwin King's curiosity was piqued. He had heard stories of Eldrador's ancient magic and powerful sorcerers, but he had never thought they would set foot in Everia.

"What do you make of this?" Ortwin King asked Lady Isabella, his eyes narrowing as he pondered the implications.

"I think it may be a sign that our prophecy is true," she replied, her voice barely above a whisper. "Perhaps these travelers are the sorceress we've been searching for."

Ortwin King's mind raced with possibilities. Could this be the moment when Everia was finally free from its troubles? He felt a surge of determination course through his veins as he gazed out at the city below.

"I want to meet them," he said, turning back to Lady Isabella. "See that they are given an audience with me immediately."

With a nod, Lady Isabella vanished into the crowd, leaving Ortwin King to wonder what lay ahead for him and the people of Everia. Would this prophecy bring about a new era of peace and prosperity, or would it unleash a power that would threaten their very existence? Only time would tell.

As he descended from the battlements, Ortwin King's full name seemed to echo in his mind once more: Ortwin King, ruler of Everia, guardian of its people.
