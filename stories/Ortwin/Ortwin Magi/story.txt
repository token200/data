Ortwin Magi stepped out of the dimly lit tavern, his piercing blue eyes scanning the crowded streets of Ashwood. The city was alive with the sounds of merchants hawking their wares and the clanging of hammer on anvil from the nearby blacksmith's forge. Ortwin, a skilled mage and member of the prestigious Magi family, felt at home among the throngs.

As he navigated through the crowd, his long, dark coat billowing behind him, Ortwin couldn't help but think about the recent string of mysterious occurrences plaguing Ashwood. Several prominent citizens had reported strange visions and dreams, and some even spoke of seeing shadowy figures lurking in the alleys. The local authorities were stumped, and it was up to Ortwin Magi, renowned for his exceptional magical abilities, to get to the bottom of it.

He made his way to the town square, where a makeshift stage had been set up for a gathering of townsfolk. Ortwin's eyes scanned the crowd, searching for any sign of the afflicted individuals. That was when he spotted her – a young woman, dressed in tattered robes, sitting at the edge of the crowd, her eyes vacant and haunted.

Ortwin approached her quietly, not wanting to startle her. As he drew near, the woman's gaze snapped towards him, and for a moment, they locked eyes. Ortwin could see the fear and confusion etched on her face, but also something else – a deep sadness that seemed to resonate with his own sense of purpose.

"Please, sir," she whispered, her voice barely audible over the din of the crowd, "I've seen things... terrible things. I don't know what's happening to me."

Ortwin knelt beside her, his hands gentle as he placed them on her shoulders. "Tell me," he said softly, "what do you see?"

The woman hesitated for a moment before speaking in a voice that barely reached a whisper. Ortwin listened intently, his eyes never leaving hers, as the secrets of Ashwood's mysterious occurrences began to unravel before him.

It was going to be a long night, but Ortwin Magi was ready to face whatever lay ahead, armed with nothing but his wits and an unyielding determination to uncover the truth.
