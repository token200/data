Ortwin Moore stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a former mercenary, Ortwin had seen his fair share of battles and bloodshed, but this place felt different. The air was thick with tension, and the patrons seemed to be holding their collective breath.

Ortwin's gaze landed on a hooded figure sitting in the corner, sipping a mug of ale. He couldn't help but feel drawn to the mysterious stranger, and he made his way towards them, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword.

As he approached, the figure looked up, revealing piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into Ortwin's soul. "Can I help you?" they asked in a low, husky voice.

"I'm looking for someone," Ortwin replied, taking a seat across from the stranger. "A fellow by the name of Victor LaGraine. He owes me some money."

The figure nodded, their eyes never leaving Ortwin's face. "I know who he is. But I think you'll find that he's not the man you thought he was."

Ortwin raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. "What do you mean?"

Victor LaGraine had been a trusted ally and friend, but a string of suspicious occurrences had led Ortwin to suspect that something was amiss. He leaned forward, his eyes locked on the hooded figure.

The stranger's gaze faltered for a moment before they spoke again. "Let's just say that Victor has... changed. He's not the same man you knew."

Ortwin's gut tightened with a mix of anger and concern. He had to know what was going on, but he also didn't want to push his luck. For now, he decided to trust this mysterious stranger, at least.

"What do I need to do?" Ortwin asked, his voice low and even.

The figure pushed back their hood, revealing a shock of curly brown hair. "I can help you find Victor," they said with a hint of a smile. "But be warned, Ortwin Moore - what you're about to face may change you forever."
