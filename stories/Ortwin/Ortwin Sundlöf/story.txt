Ortwin Sundlöf stood at the edge of the fjord, his rugged features etched against the gray sky. He was a man of few words, but those he spoke were laced with a quiet intensity that commanded attention. As a master shipwright, Ortwin had spent his life crafting vessels for the harsh, unforgiving seas that surrounded the tiny island community of Nordhagen.

As he surveyed his latest project – a sturdy galleon designed to withstand even the most ferocious storms – Ortwin's mind wandered back to his childhood. He was once a young apprentice on another ship, where he had learned the intricacies of woodworking and the importance of patience in craftsmanship. But after a fateful accident left him with a missing hand, Ortwin had set out to forge a new path.

Years of toil and experimentation had led him to Nordhagen, where he had established his own workshop and earned a reputation as one of the finest shipwrights on the coast. His latest design was no exception – the galleon's hull was carved from solid oak, its sturdy frame reinforced with layers of rope and wooden pegs.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow across the water, Ortwin felt a sense of pride wash over him. He had poured his heart and soul into this vessel, and it showed in every carefully crafted detail. The sound of laughter carried on the breeze, mingling with the scent of tar and seaweed – Nordhagen's inhabitants were known for their love of music and feasting.

Just then, a young woman appeared at Ortwin's side, her dark hair tied back in a practical knot. "Ortwin, the lord requests your presence," she said, her voice firm but polite. "He wishes to discuss...certain business matters."

Ortwin's expression turned guarded, his eyes narrowing as he took in the woman's tone. He knew better than to engage with the lord's demands without being certain of their true nature. With a curt nod, he followed the woman aboard the galleon, leaving the tranquility of the fjord behind.

As they sailed through the darkness, Ortwin's mind whirled with possibilities – was this a new commission, or something more sinister? He knew only one thing for certain: in Nordhagen, no question went unexamined. And he would not rest until he had unraveled the truth.
