Ortwin Straume stepped out of his small, cluttered office and onto the rain-soaked streets of Oslo. As the chief financial officer at Nordea Bank, he was no stranger to long hours and high-stakes decision-making. But on this particular evening, he had other plans.

As a man of mystery, Ortwin's personal life remained closely guarded by those closest to him. His colleagues knew him as a brilliant mind with an uncanny ability to crunch numbers and predict market trends. Few, however, knew about his passion for music or his late-night escapades in the city's underground jazz scene.

Tonight was different, though. Tonight, Ortwin had received an invitation from a reclusive jazz musician known only by his stage name, "The Nightwalker." The cryptic message had read: "Meet me at the Blue Room at midnight. Come alone."

Curiosity getting the better of him, Ortwin made his way to the small, smoke-filled club on the outskirts of town. As he pushed open the door, a bell above it rang out, and the sounds of improvisational jazz filled the air.

The Nightwalker sat at the bar, his eyes hidden behind dark glasses. "Welcome, Ortwin," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "I've heard you have skills that go beyond mere finance."

Ortwin raised an eyebrow. "What makes you think that?"

"You have a certain... intuition," The Nightwalker replied, producing a small box from beneath the counter. Inside, a sleek, silver saxophone lay waiting.

Without hesitation, Ortwin took the instrument and began to play. Notes flowed effortlessly from his lips, transporting both him and the musician to a world beyond the confines of Oslo's skyscrapers.

For the next two hours, they jammed together, their music weaving a spell of sonic beauty that captivated all who listened. In that moment, Ortwin Straume was no longer the CEO of Nordea; he was The Nightwalker's musical accomplice, lost in the realm of sound and possibility.

As the night drew to a close, The Nightwalker nodded in approval. "You have the touch," he said, before vanishing into the shadows, leaving Ortwin with only the memory of that magical evening â€“ and the haunting melody still echoing within him.
