Ortwin Kenji was a man with a past shrouded in mystery. His piercing green eyes seemed to hold a thousand secrets, and his chiseled features hinted at a life of adventure. As a former member of an elite mercenary unit, Ortwin had seen his fair share of battles and bloodshed.

Now, years after leaving the unit, Ortwin found himself working as a freelance security consultant. His services were in high demand, thanks to his exceptional skills and reputation for getting the job done. But despite his success, Ortwin couldn't shake off the feeling of restlessness that had been following him for months.

One day, he received a cryptic message from an old acquaintance, asking him to meet at a secluded café on the outskirts of town. As Ortwin arrived, he spotted his acquaintance sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee. It was Lena, a woman he had worked with during his mercenary days.

Lena's eyes locked onto Ortwin's, and she motioned for him to sit down. "I heard you're doing well," she said, her voice low and measured. "But I also heard rumors about your past. Rumors that you've been hiding from the world."

Ortwin raised an eyebrow, intrigued by Lena's words. "What are you talking about?" he asked, his tone cautious.

Lena leaned in closer, her eyes locked onto Ortwin's. "I'm talking about the incident at New Eden. The one where you and your team were ambushed by enemy forces. You never told me what really happened that day."

Ortwin Kenji felt a flutter in his chest as he gazed into Lena's eyes. He knew that she was probing him, trying to uncover secrets that Ortwin had kept hidden for years. But as he looked back at her, he saw something there that gave him pause – a spark of understanding, perhaps, or even empathy.

For a moment, Ortwin forgot about his past and the life he'd built for himself. He let his guard down, just enough to see Lena's face, etched with concern and compassion. And in that fleeting instant, Ortwin Kenji knew that he had been wrong to keep his secrets hidden.
