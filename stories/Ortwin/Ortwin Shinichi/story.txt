Ortwin Shinichi stood at the edge of the old wooden pier, gazing out at the serene lake that lay before him. The soft lapping of the water against the shore created a soothing melody, one that seemed to wash away the weight of his thoughts.

As a former member of an elite special forces unit, Ortwin had seen his fair share of battles and bloodshed. But after a fateful mission went wrong, he was forced to flee, leaving behind everything he once knew.

Now, Ortwin had found solace in this small lakeside town, where no one seemed to recognize him. He'd taken on the alias "Shinichi," adopting the quiet, reserved nature of the local townsfolk as his own.

Ortwin's past still lingered, however, and he often found himself lost in memories of the comrades he'd lost or the atrocities he'd witnessed. His nightmares were a constant reminder that some wounds would never fully heal.

Just then, a young girl appeared at the pier's edge, her curious gaze fixed on Ortwin. "Hello," she said softly, eyeing him with a mixture of fear and curiosity.

Ortwin hesitated for a moment before responding, his voice barely above a whisper. "Hi."

The girl didn't flinch or retreat; instead, she took a step closer, her hand extended as if in friendship. "I'm Yui," she said, smiling faintly.

For the first time in years, Ortwin felt a spark of connection with someone new. As he looked into Yui's bright eyes, he saw a glimmer of hope that perhaps he wasn't alone anymore.

Over the next few weeks, Ortwin and Yui grew closer, bonding over their shared love of nature and quiet contemplation. For the first time in years, Ortwin began to feel like himself again – not as "Shinichi" or a product of his past, but simply Ortwin Shinichi.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow across the lake, Ortwin realized that maybe he wasn't ready to be forgotten just yet. Maybe it was time to start embracing his new life and forge a path forward, rather than constantly looking back at what had been lost.

Ortwin turned to Yui, who stood beside him now, her eyes shining with an unwavering trust. Together, they watched as the stars began to twinkle above, and Ortwin felt the first tentative steps of his journey toward healing, toward rediscovery – and toward a new sense of purpose.
