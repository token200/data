Ortwin Laine stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of damp earth and saltwater filling his lungs. He had been away for years, and it seemed like an eternity since he'd last set foot on this small island town.

As he made his way through the crowded station, Ortwin's eyes scanned the sea of unfamiliar faces. His own face was a map of lines and creases, etched from years of hard living and harder loving. He smiled to himself, thinking of his wife, Lisbeth, who had left him when he'd gone off to fight in the wars.

The sound of laughter and clinking glasses carried on the wind, drawing Ortwin towards the town's tavern. Inside, he spotted familiar faces - old comrades, now merchants and traders, with wives and children of their own. They fell silent as Ortwin approached, their eyes betraying a mixture of curiosity and wariness.

Ortwin slid onto a stool, ordering a mug of ale from the barkeep. As he waited for his drink to arrive, he listened intently to the hushed conversations around him. Old rivalries had long since been settled, but the wounds still ran deep.

A gruff voice spoke up beside him, "Ortwin Laine, is it?" The speaker, a burly man with arms like tree trunks, clapped Ortwin on the back. "How's the old fighter faring?"

Ortwin laughed, feeling the weight of his years settle onto his shoulders. "A little worse for wear, but still standing."

The men laughed and joked around him, drawing him into their stories and camaraderie. It was as if no time had passed at all, and Ortwin felt a sense of belonging he hadn't experienced in years.

As the night wore on, Ortwin found himself lost in conversation with an old friend, swapping tales of battles won and lost, of love and loss. The ale flowed, and with it, memories both fond and painful. For a few brief hours, Ortwin Laine was no longer a man who'd fought wars, but just another islander, living life one day at a time.

As the evening drew to a close, Ortwin bid his friends farewell, his eyes locking onto Lisbeth's across the crowded room. A fleeting smile crossed her face before she turned away, leaving him with more questions than answers. Yet, as he stumbled out into the cool night air, the sound of laughter and clinking glasses still echoing in his ears, Ortwin knew that some wounds would never fully heal, but that was a price worth paying for life itself.
