Ortwin Simon had always been a man of mystery. As a skilled thief and con artist, he had built a reputation for being untouchable. His piercing blue eyes seemed to gleam with mischief, and his chiseled features hinted at a sharp mind and quick wit.

Despite his questionable morals, Ortwin had a certain charm that drew people in. He was like a snake oil salesman, peddling his wares with a smooth tongue and a disarming smile. Few people suspected the true nature of Ortwin's work, and even fewer managed to catch him in the act.
