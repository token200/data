Ortwin Dubois stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station with a mix of curiosity and trepidation. He had never been to Ravenshire before, but the letter from his great-aunt's lawyer had piqued his interest. It seemed she had left him her estate, a vast property that stretched across the rolling hills of the countryside.

As he made his way through the station, Ortwin noticed the locals casting curious glances in his direction. He was used to being overlooked, having spent most of his life studying in the great libraries of Paris. But there was something about this place that drew him in â€“ perhaps it was the sense of isolation, or maybe it was the promise of adventure.

After a short carriage ride, Ortwin arrived at the estate, his eyes widening as he took in the sprawling landscape before him. The trees were taller than any he had seen before, their branches twisted and gnarled with age. A faint mist clung to the ground, casting an otherworldly glow over the entire scene.

As he explored the property, Ortwin began to uncover clues about his great-aunt's life. She had been a recluse, it seemed, but one who had lived life on her own terms. The letters and diaries she had left behind spoke of a passion for botany, of collecting rare species from every corner of the globe.

Ortwin found himself drawn to the garden, where he spent hours lost among the flowers and herbs. It was here that he felt most at home, surrounded by the sights and scents of nature. He began to feel a sense of connection to his great-aunt, who had left behind a legacy that was both vast and intimate.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Ortwin sat down among the flowers, feeling the weight of his inheritance settle upon him. He knew he had a long journey ahead, but for now, he was content to simply be here, surrounded by the beauty of Ravenshire's countryside. And as he closed his eyes, he felt Ortwin Dubois' great-aunt's spirit smiling down upon him, welcoming him home.
