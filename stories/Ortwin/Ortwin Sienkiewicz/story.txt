I couldn't find any information on a historical or fictional figure named Ortwin Sienkiewicz. It is possible that you meant to ask about Tadeusz Henryk Sienkiewicz, a Polish novelist.

If so, here's a story about him:

Tadeusz Henryk Sienkiewicz was a renowned Polish novelist and Nobel laureate, best known for his historical novels set in Poland during the 19th century. Born on February 14, 1868, in Wola OkrÄ…glica, Russia (now part of Ukraine), Sienkiewicz grew up speaking Polish as his native language due to the Russian occupation.

Sienkiewicz's writing career spanned over three decades and included several notable works such as "With Fire in His Heart," "Throne of the Wood," and "The Teutonic Knights." These novels not only showcased his mastery of storytelling but also provided a glimpse into Poland's rich history during the late 19th century.

Despite facing criticism for his conservative views on Polish identity, Sienkiewicz remains one of the most celebrated writers in Polish literature. His dedication to promoting Polish culture and language earned him the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1905.

Sienkiewicz's impact extends beyond Poland's borders, with many readers around the world appreciating his work for its historical accuracy and engaging narrative style. As a symbol of Polish resistance against foreign occupation, Sienkiewicz continues to inspire writers and artists to this day.

Tadeusz Henryk Sienkiewicz passed away on September 4, 1916, but his legacy lives on through the countless readers who have been captivated by his stories. His commitment to preserving Poland's heritage has left a lasting impression on literature, making him one of the most revered figures in Polish literary history.

In the years since his passing, Sienkiewicz's works have continued to be translated into multiple languages and remain widely read. As a testament to his enduring influence, his name is often mentioned alongside other great authors of the era, such as Leo Tolstoy and Gustave Flaubert.
