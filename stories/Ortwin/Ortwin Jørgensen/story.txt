Ortwin Jørgensen was a man of mystery, with an air of quiet confidence that commanded attention without ever seeking it. A former detective turned private investigator, he had built a reputation for himself as one of the most skilled and resourceful sleuths in Copenhagen.

One rainy evening, as Ortwin sat sipping his coffee at a small café near his office, a petite woman with piercing green eyes walked in, shaking the rain from her coat. She scanned the room frantically until her gaze landed on him, and she quickly made her way over to his table.

"I'm looking for information," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "About my sister's disappearance."

Ortwin's expression softened as he nodded sympathetically. "What makes you think I can help?"

"My parents told me about your work on the Jensen case last year. You solved it, didn't you? They said you were brilliant, that you could find anyone if they wanted to be found."

Ortwin Jørgensen smiled wryly, feeling a twinge of pride at being remembered so well. "I did solve that case, yes. But I'm not sure what good this information will do for your sister."

The woman's eyes welled up with tears as she handed him a small folder containing a few photos and some documents. "Please, just look through these. You have to help me find her."

As Ortwin Jørgensen took the folder from her hand, he couldn't help but feel a spark of determination ignite within him. He spent the next hour poring over the contents, searching for any lead that might point him in the right direction.

Just as he was about to pack up and leave, his phone rang. It was an old acquaintance, someone who had a connection to the police department. "I think I can get you some access," he said, "but it's going to cost you."

Ortwin's eyes narrowed as he listened to the man's proposal. He knew that in this business, sometimes the only way to move forward was to take risks and trust your instincts. And Ortwin Jørgensen had a feeling that this case would be one of the most challenging – and rewarding – of his career yet.
