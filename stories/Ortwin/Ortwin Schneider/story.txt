As a young boy, he had always been fascinated by the old clock tower that stood tall on the outskirts of town. The tower's intricate mechanisms and the soft tick-tock of its gears had captivated Ortwin, who spent countless hours tinkering with broken clocks and trying to understand their inner workings.

As he grew older, Ortwin's passion for mechanics only deepened, and he became known throughout Ravensburg as a master clockmaker.

Despite his reputation, Ortwin remained humble and unassuming. He preferred to keep to himself, lost in thought as he worked on his latest project. Few knew that beneath his gruff exterior lay a kind heart and a deep love for the beauty of mechanics.

One day, a mysterious stranger arrived in Ravensburg, seeking Ortwin Schneider's expertise. The stranger was a member of an ancient order, sworn to protect the world from clockwork threats. They had heard rumors of a legendary timekeeper, hidden away in Ravensburg, who possessed knowledge and skills that could help them defeat their enemies.

As the stranger waited for Ortwin to accept his offer, they observed him at work, marveling at his skill and attention to detail. Finally, the day arrived when Ortwin agreed to join forces with the stranger, and together they set out on a quest to unravel the secrets of time itself.
