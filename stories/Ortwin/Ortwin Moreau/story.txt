Ortwin Moreau sat at his desk, staring out the window as he poured over the stack of papers in front of him. As the CEO of Moreau Industries, one of the largest and most respected engineering firms in Europe, he was always surrounded by demands for attention and decisions to make.

But Ortwin's mind wasn't on work right now. It was on his wife, Colette, and their upcoming anniversary. They were celebrating five years of marriage, and Ortwin wanted everything to be perfect. He had already ordered a new watch, one that Colette loved, but he still needed to find the right gift.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was his assistant, Pierre. "Chief, I have some good news," Pierre said, smiling. "I just got off the phone with our new project manager in Paris. They're ready to begin work on the Le Chat Noir development."

Ortwin's eyes lit up. This was exactly what he needed - something to take his mind off Colette and his worries about their anniversary. The Le Chat Noir was a massive engineering project that would require the expertise of Moreau Industries, and Ortwin was determined to make it happen.

As he began to discuss the project with Pierre, his thoughts turned back to Colette. What had she gotten him for their anniversary? And had he really thought about what she wanted? He felt a pang of guilt for not paying enough attention to her lately.

Just then, there was another knock at the door. It was Pierre again, this time holding a small box wrapped in red paper. "I just got these from Paris," he said, handing it over to Ortwin. Inside the box was a beautiful silver necklace with a tiny charm in the shape of a cat - Colette's favorite.

Ortwin felt his eyes well up with tears as he hugged Pierre and thanked him for remembering such an important detail. He took a deep breath and focused on the project at hand, feeling more confident that everything would turn out perfectly.

After all, Ortwin Moreau was a man who knew what he wanted - and he wasn't afraid to go after it. And this anniversary, he vowed, would be one to remember for years to come.
