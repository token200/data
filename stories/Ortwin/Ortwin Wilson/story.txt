As an expert in the field of interior design, he had amassed an impressive collection of rare and unique door handles over the years. From intricately carved wooden knobs to delicate glass ones, Ortwin's obsession with door knobs knew no bounds.

One sunny afternoon, Ortwin received a call from his trusted friend and colleague, Emily. She informed him that she was in need of his expertise for her new project – restoring an old mansion to its former glory. The catch was that the mansion came with a host of peculiarities, including several door knobs that were allegedly said to possess supernatural powers.

Intrigued by Emily's claim, Ortwin agreed to meet her at the mansion and assess the situation. Upon arrival, he was greeted by Emily, who led him through the labyrinthine halls, pointing out various door knobs along the way. As they reached the grand staircase, Ortwin noticed a particularly ornate door knob with an eerie glow emanating from its center.

"This one," Emily whispered, "is said to be the most powerful of all."

Ortwin's curiosity was piqued as he carefully examined the door knob, feeling an unusual energy emanating from it. Suddenly, the air around him seemed to shift, and a faint whispering echoed through the hallway.

"I must get this knob back into its rightful place," Ortwin declared firmly, determination etched on his face.

Together, Ortwin and Emily restored the mansion's doors to their former splendor, carefully installing the door knobs in strategic locations. As they worked, Ortwin couldn't shake off the feeling that something was watching him from the shadows – a testament to the supernatural powers said to reside within those enchanted door knobs.

With each passing day, the mansion began to transform into its former glory, and Ortwin's collection of door knobs grew exponentially. His reputation as an expert in interior design spread far and wide, with people coming from all over to see his remarkable array of antique door handles.

And so, Ortwin Wilson remained at the helm of his craft, forever bound by a deep love for those peculiar door knobs that seemed to hold secrets beyond their intricately carved surfaces.
