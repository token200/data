Ortwin Nagy stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his piercing blue eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a renowned mercenary and adventurer, he had seen his fair share of battles and narrow escapes. The patrons fell silent as he approached the bar, their whispers dying down like embers in the wind.

"Ortwin Nagy," a gruff voice called out from behind him. Turning around, Ortwin spotted none other than his old friend and ally, Rennart. "What brings you to this humble abode?" Rennart asked, clapping Ortwin on the back.

"Just passing through," Ortwin replied, taking a seat next to Rennart. "I've been hired for a new job – escorting a merchant caravan across the treacherous mountains." He tossed a few coins onto the bar, catching the bartender's eye. "Tell me, what's the word on the streets? Any rumors of bandits or wild beasts?"

Rennart chuckled, taking a swig from his mug. "Just the usual – wolves, goblins, and the occasional lost traveler looking for work. But I heard something peculiar yesterday." He leaned in closer, lowering his voice. "There's been talk of an ancient ruin hidden deep within the mountains, filled with gold and treasures beyond your wildest dreams."

Ortwin's eyes lit up at the prospect. "That sounds too good to be true," he muttered, "but I'll give it a shot." He signaled to Rennart to join him for a drink, and the two friends spent the next hour pouring over maps and discussing strategies.

As they left the tavern, Ortwin Nagy couldn't help but feel a thrill of excitement. The road ahead would be fraught with danger, but he was ready for whatever lay in store. With his sword by his side and his wits about him, he knew that Ortwin Nagy was more than capable of facing whatever challenges came his way.

With a grin on his face, Ortwin set off into the unknown, ready to face whatever adventures awaited him. Little did he know, this trip would change his life forever.
