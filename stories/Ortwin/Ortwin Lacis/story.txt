As he turned a corner onto a quiet street, Ortwin spotted a young apprentice watching him from across the way. The boy's eyes were wide with awe as he took in the master painter at work, his hands moving deftly across the canvas as he brought a scene to life.

Ortwin smiled, remembering when he was once that young and full of wonder. He beckoned the apprentice over, offering him a glimpse into the world of art and imagination that had shaped his own journey. And so, Ortwin Lacis continued on his path, creating masterpieces that would be remembered for generations to come, inspiring others to follow in his footsteps.
