I couldn't find any information on a person named Ana Kalniņš. It's possible that this person is not a public figure or doesn't have a significant online presence. Can you provide more context or details about who Ana Kalniņš is? 

If you'd like, I can create a fictional story about Ana Kalniņš based on some general information about Latvia or its culture. Let me know!
