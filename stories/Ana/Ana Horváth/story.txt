Ana Horváth sat alone in her small, cluttered apartment, staring blankly at the wall as she sipped her cold coffee. It had been three years since the accident, and yet it still felt like yesterday that her life was forever changed.

Ana's eyes drifted back to the photograph on the mantlepiece - a smiley face scribbled on a Polaroid of her and her best friend, Luca. They had planned to travel Europe together after graduation, but fate had other plans. The car accident had taken Luca's life, leaving Ana with a shattered heart and a crippling sense of guilt.

As she gazed at the photo, memories flooded back - the carefree days, the laughter, and the late-night conversations about their dreams. Ana's mind wandered to what could have been if only...

The doorbell rang, breaking her reverie. It was János, her neighbor from across the hall. He had taken a liking to Ana and often dropped by with fresh bread and coffee, trying to lift her spirits.

"Hey, how are you doing?" he asked, setting down a basket of freshly baked rolls on the kitchen counter.

Ana forced a smile, feeling a pang of embarrassment at her gloomy mood. "I'm fine, just...just thinking about things."

János nodded sympathetically and handed Ana a warm baguette slice. "Want to talk?"

Ana hesitated for a moment before nodding, letting out a deep sigh as János sat down beside her.

Over the next hour, they talked about everything and nothing - the news, their favorite TV shows, and even János's latest amateur painting endeavors ( Ana diplomatically praised his artistic talents). It was a gentle respite from Ana's introspection, allowing her to momentarily escape into a world of shared laughter and friendship.

But as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting an orange glow over the city, Ana knew she couldn't hide forever. The grief still lingered, like an open wound that refused to close. She thought about Luca, wondering if he was okay where he was, and whether he'd ever forgive her for surviving when he didn't.

As János stood up to leave, he placed a gentle hand on Ana's shoulder. "Hey, I know it's hard right now, but you can't let guilt consume you. You're strong, just like Luca would want."

Ana looked at him, feeling a lump form in her throat as she nodded. Maybe János was right - maybe there was more to life than dwelling on what could have been.

The days ahead wouldn't be easy, but for now, knowing someone cared and was willing to sit with her through the darkness gave Ana the strength to face another day.
