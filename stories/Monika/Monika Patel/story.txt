A string of mysterious disappearances had been plaguing a small town on the outskirts of the city, and Monika Patel was determined to get to the bottom of it.

With her trusty notebook and pen in hand, Monika Patel set out into the streets, interviewing locals and gathering clues.

With shaking hands, Monika Patel carefully transcribed the message, her eyes scanning it for any clues.

As she delved deeper into the mystery, Monika Patel found herself becoming increasingly obsessed with solving the case.
