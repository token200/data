Monika Cooper stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. It had been months since she'd seen Rachel, and Monika couldn't shake the feeling that their friendship was on the verge of unraveling.

As she waited in line to order, Monika's mind wandered back to their last conversation. They'd gotten into an argument over something ridiculous – Monika thought Rachel was being too passive-aggressive, while Rachel insisted Monika was being too sensitive. The more they talked, the more they both said things they didn't mean.

Now, as Monika waited for her coffee, she spotted Rachel sitting at a small table by the window, sipping on a latte. Monika's heart skipped a beat as their eyes met. For a moment, time froze, and all Monika could see was Rachel's bright smile and piercing blue eyes.

Rachel waved her over, and Monika took a deep breath before walking towards the table. They hugged awkwardly, both of them trying to gauge the other person's mood without saying anything.

"So, what's up?" Monika asked finally, sitting down across from Rachel.

"Not much," Rachel replied, fidgeting with her cup. "Just got back from a trip and needed some caffeine."

Monika nodded sympathetically. She knew Rachel had been stressed out before the trip, but now that she thought about it, there was something more to it than that. A secret, perhaps?

As they chatted, Monika tried to pry the truth out of her friend without being too obvious. She asked casual questions about work and school, all while paying close attention to Rachel's body language.

It wasn't until later, when they were walking down the street, that Monika finally got her answer. Rachel hesitated for a moment before blurting it out: "I'm leaving town next week."

Monika felt like she'd been punched in the gut. She knew Rachel had been thinking about moving away for months – but to actually do it now? That was a surprise.

As they walked on, Monika couldn't help but wonder what the future held for their friendship. Would they stay close despite the distance, or would this be the end of an era?

For now, Monika decided to put her feelings aside and focus on supporting Rachel through this change. She knew that no matter what happened next, their bond was strong enough to withstand anything.

"Hey?" Monika said, turning to Rachel with a concerned expression.

"Yeah?"

"You're doing okay, right? I mean, you can always come back."

Rachel smiled wistfully and nodded. "I'll be fine, Moni. Thanks for being here for me."
