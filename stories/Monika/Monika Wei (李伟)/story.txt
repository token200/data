Monika Wei, or Lee Wei as she was known to her family and friends back in Taipei, had always been fascinated by the world of art. Growing up, she spent hours sketching and painting, lost in her own little world of color and creativity.

After completing her degree in fine arts, Monika decided to pursue a career in photography, hoping to capture the beauty of the world through her lens. She traveled to various parts of Asia, snapping pictures of street life, landscapes, and people. Her unique perspective and eye for detail quickly gained her recognition in the art community.

Monika's love for photography took her to the streets of New York City, where she immersed herself in the vibrant culture of the Big Apple. She spent countless hours wandering through the city, camera in hand, taking in the sights and sounds of the bustling metropolis. Her photographs captured the essence of urban life, from the bright lights of Times Square to the peaceful green oases of Central Park.

As Monika's career progressed, she began to receive commissions from prominent clients, including fashion brands and art galleries
