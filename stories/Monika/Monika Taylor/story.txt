Monika's origins were shrouded in mystery. Few knew that she was once a struggling artist who worked multiple jobs to make ends meet while chasing her passion. One fateful night, while working late in her small studio, Monika stumbled upon an ancient tome hidden away in the back of a dusty bookshelf. The cover was adorned with strange symbols and markings that seemed to shimmer in the dim light.

As she opened the book, Monika felt an electric jolt run through her veins.

One evening, as she stood before a particularly breathtaking piece, Monika felt the familiar tingle of electricity running through her fingers. She closed her eyes and allowed herself to become one with the art, letting the symbols from the ancient tome wash over her like a wave.
