Monika Wiśniewski, a brilliant and feisty Polish detective, sat at her desk, staring at the cold cup of coffee in front of her. The fluorescent lights overhead cast an unforgiving glare on her sharp jawline and piercing green eyes. She was a woman on a mission, driven by a fierce determination to solve the latest case that had landed on her doorstep.

As she sipped her coffee, Monika's mind wandered back to the small town of Zielona Góra, where the body of a young woman had been found with no identification or leads. The only clue was a cryptic message scrawled on the wall near the crime scene: "Żółta wiatr" - "Yellow wind".

Monika's eyes narrowed as she recalled her conversation with the local police chief, who seemed more interested in wrapping up the case quickly than pursuing any real leads. She knew that this was a case that required patience and persistence.

Just then, her phone rang. It was an anonymous caller, claiming to have information about the victim. Monika's instincts told her to be cautious, but she couldn't resist the opportunity to uncover more.

"Who is this?" she asked, her voice firm but controlled.

"You'll know when you hear it," the voice replied before hanging up.

Monika's eyes narrowed as she processed the cryptic message. "Żółta wiatr" was a phrase from Polish folklore - a warning of impending change and destruction. Suddenly, a connection clicked into place in her mind.

She quickly got to work, scouring local archives and interviewing potential witnesses. It wasn't long before she stumbled upon an old newspaper article about a tragic event that had occurred in Zielona Góra decades ago, where a young woman named Kasia had died under mysterious circumstances.

Monika's eyes lit up as the pieces fell into place. The victim was Kasia, and "Żółta wiatr" was a reference to an old legend about a cursed wind that had swept through the town, bringing destruction and chaos.

With newfound energy, Monika leapt out of her chair, ready to follow the trail wherever it might lead. She knew that this case would require all her skill and cunning to crack, but she was determined to uncover the truth - no matter what lay ahead.
