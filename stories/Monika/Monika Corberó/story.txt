I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Monika Corberó. It's possible that this is a new or obscure character, or it may be a mistake.

However, I did find information on a Spanish actress named Monica Böhmeyer, who played the role of Monika Corberó in the Spanish television series "El Ministerio del Tiempo" (The Ministry of Time). If you would like, I can write a story based on this character.
