As "Echoes" prepared for their biggest tour yet, Monika found herself growing more introspective than ever before. She was haunted by memories of her past, and struggled to find balance between her public persona and private self. Her brother, now grown, was there to support her every step of the way, reminding her that she didn't have to face her demons alone.

The night of their biggest show arrived, and Monika took to the stage with a newfound sense of determination. As she launched into their hit single, "Lost in the Haze," the crowd erupted in cheers, drawn in by her raw energy and emotional vulnerability. With every strum of her guitar and every heartfelt lyric, Monika poured her heart out onto the stage, cementing her place as one of music's most compelling voices.
