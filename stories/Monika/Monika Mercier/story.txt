Monika Mercier was known for her sharp wit and quick tongue, often leaving people in stitches with her sassy remarks. As a successful event planner, she had a keen eye for detail and an uncanny ability to bring even the most mundane parties to life.

Despite her success, Monika's personal life was a bit of a mess. She had recently gone through a string of failed relationships, and her dating app bio read like a laundry list of all her deal-breakers. "I'm not looking for anyone who likes long walks on the beach or loves puppies," it declared bluntly.

One fateful evening, as Monika was setting up for a particularly lavish birthday bash at the swanky Bellvue Manor, she spotted him across the room - a towering, brooding figure with piercing blue eyes that seemed to bore into her very soul. He was a regular at her events, but had never mustered the courage to approach her before.

As Monika watched, the stranger expertly poured himself a glass of champagne and began to make his way towards her, his movements fluid and deliberate. She felt a flutter in her chest, despite her best efforts to ignore it.

"Monika Mercier," he said, with a low, rumbling voice that sent shivers down her spine, "I've seen you at many parties, but I've never mustered the courage to talk to you."

Monika raised an eyebrow. "And now, why should I?" she asked, trying to sound nonchalant despite the butterflies in her stomach.

The stranger smiled wryly. "Because," he said, his eyes crinkling at the corners, "I think we could get along just fine. Outside of work, that is."

Monika was taken aback by his forwardness, but there was something about him that put her at ease. Maybe it was the way he spoke with such conviction, or maybe it was the glint in his eye that seemed to see right through her defenses.

Whatever it was, Monika found herself agreeing to grab a drink with him outside of work - and, for once, she felt like she might actually have a chance at finding someone who truly understood her.
