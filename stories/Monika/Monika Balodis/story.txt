Monika Balodis stepped out of her small apartment and into the crisp morning air, taking a deep breath as she gazed out at the snow-covered streets of Cleveland. A native daughter of the city, Monika had always felt a sense of nostalgia wash over her whenever winter set in.

As a young woman, Monika had grown up exploring the shores of Lake Erie with her siblings, chasing after seagulls and making memories that would last a lifetime. But as she grew older, life took her far from the familiar comforts of home. She attended college on the East Coast, then moved to New York City for a string of creative jobs.

Despite the allure of the big city, Monika found herself restless, feeling like a small cog in a vast machine. She longed for something more – something that spoke to her sense of place and identity as a Clevelander. So when an old friend offered her a job at a local art gallery, Monika jumped at the chance.

Now, as she sipped coffee and surveyed the morning light filtering through the gallery's skylights, Monika felt like she'd finally found her footing. She spent her days organizing exhibitions, meeting with artists, and sharing her own stories about Cleveland's rich cultural heritage.

But it was when Monika stumbled upon an old photograph in a hidden corner of the gallery that her true passion project took shape. The image depicted a group of young women – Monika guessed they were probably from the 1940s or 50s – gathered around a table, their faces alight with laughter and conversation.

As she pored over the photo, Monika began to imagine the stories behind it: the friendships forged, the secrets shared, the moments of triumph and heartache. She became determined to track down the women in the picture, to uncover their histories and share them with the world.

Thus, the idea for a community-driven oral history project was born. Monika would use her gallery as a hub, hosting events and workshops that brought together local residents to share their own tales of Cleveland's past. It was an ambitious plan, but one that resonated deeply with Monika – who saw it as a way to reclaim her city's stories and make them her own.

As the snow outside continued to fall, Monika felt a sense of purpose settling into her bones. She knew she still had a lot of work ahead, but for now, surrounded by the quiet morning hours, she smiled knowing that this was just the beginning.
