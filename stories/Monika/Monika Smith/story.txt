Monika Smith stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the cityscape. Her dark hair whipped in the wind as she took a long drag on her cigarette, feeling the familiar rush of nicotine coursing through her veins.

She was a private person, content to keep to herself most days, but tonight she had a mission. She had received a cryptic message from an anonymous source, hinting at a deep-seated conspiracy within the city's government. Monika had always been drawn to the unknown, and this case seemed too big to ignore.

As she looked out over the glittering lights of the skyscrapers, Monika felt a sense of unease creeping up her spine. She had spent years building a reputation as a lone wolf investigator, taking on cases that others deemed too strange or too small. But this one felt different. This one felt like it could change everything.

Monika flicked out her cigarette and began to pace the rooftop, her mind racing with theories and possibilities. She was no stranger to danger, but there was something about this case that made her skin crawl.

Just as she was starting to feel a sense of unease, Monika's phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out, scanning the screen for any sign of who might be trying to contact her now. The message was brief and to the point: "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone."

Monika hesitated for a moment before tucking her phone away. She knew that this was as good a lead as she was going to get, and she couldn't pass up the chance to uncover the truth.

As the hours ticked by, Monika found herself growing more and more restless. She spent her time poring over files and evidence, searching for any connection between the government and the mysterious message.

Finally, with just minutes to spare before midnight, Monika slipped out of her apartment and made her way to the clock tower. The streets were deserted as she walked, the only sound the soft crunch of gravel beneath her feet.

Monika reached the clock tower just as the clock struck midnight. A figure was waiting for her in the shadows, their face obscured by a hood. "Welcome, Monika," they said, their voice low and gravelly. "I've been waiting for you."
