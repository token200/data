Lee Emi sat at her desk, staring blankly at the computer screen in front of her. She was supposed to be working on her latest art project, but her mind kept wandering back to the argument she had with her best friend, Maya, earlier that day.

Maya and Lee Emi had been inseparable since childhood, sharing secrets, laughter, and adventures together. But over the past few months, their friendship had started to fray. They had gotten into a heated discussion about their future plans, with Maya wanting to pursue a more traditional career path, while Lee Emi was determined to follow her passion for art.

Now, as she sat in silence, Lee Emi felt a pang of regret. She wished they could have talked it out like they used to, but the words had gotten stuck in their throats, and the argument had escalated into a shouting match.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was her roommate, Rachel, who had brought over a plate of freshly baked cookies and a concerned expression. "Hey, Emi, I could tell you were upset earlier," she said, as she set the plate down on Lee Emi's desk. "Do you want to talk about it?"

Lee Emi hesitated for a moment before nodding. Rachel pulled up a chair and listened attentively as Lee Emi recounted the argument with Maya. As she spoke, she felt a weight lift off her shoulders. For the first time that day, she felt like she was talking to someone who truly understood her.

Rachel nodded sympathetically, offering words of encouragement and advice. "You're an amazing artist, Emi," she said. "Don't let anyone make you feel otherwise."

Lee Emi smiled, feeling a sense of gratitude towards her roommate. Maybe, just maybe, she could find a way to reconcile with Maya and continue pursuing her passion for art.

As she worked on her project again, Lee Emi felt a newfound sense of clarity and purpose. She was going to make it work, no matter what. And as she lost herself in the creative process, she knew that everything would be okay.

With renewed energy and focus, Lee Emi set aside her worries about Maya and focused on bringing her art vision to life. As the hours passed, her doubts began to fade away, replaced by a sense of excitement and anticipation. She was going to create something truly special, and nothing could stop her now.
