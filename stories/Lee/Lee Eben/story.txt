Lee Eben was a man of few words, but when he spoke, people listened. As a former Marine and current detective with the local police department, Lee had earned a reputation for being one of the most skilled investigators in the business. His sharp mind and quick wit made him a formidable opponent in the pursuit of justice.

One day, while working on a particularly gruesome murder case, Lee received a cryptic message from an anonymous source claiming to have information about the killer's identity. The note read: "Look to the past for the answer." Intrigued, Lee decided to dig deeper into his own history, hoping to find a connection to the case.

As he poured over old case files and memories, one name kept popping up: Rachel Jenkins. A former colleague from Lee's Marine days, Rachel had been a skilled sniper who had also served as a valuable asset in the department. But their relationship had become strained after a particularly messy operation went wrong, leaving several innocent civilians injured.

Lee couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to Rachel's involvement than met the eye. He decided to track her down and pay her a visit. When he finally found her, she seemed hesitant to open up about what had happened all those years ago. But as Lee listened attentively, he began to piece together the fragments of their past.

It turned out that Rachel had been deeply disturbed by the incident, feeling guilty for not being able to prevent the harm that had occurred. She had spent years working to atone for her perceived failure, becoming a key witness in several high-profile cases. And now, as Lee dug deeper into the latest murder, he realized that Rachel's past was linked to the present in ways he couldn't yet understand.

As Lee Eben sat across from Rachel, watching the shadows dance on her face, he knew that this case was far from over. He had uncovered a thread of truth, and he was determined to follow it wherever it led. With his trusty notebook by his side, he began to scribble down notes, knowing that the answer lay hidden in the recesses of their troubled past.
