I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Lee Errani. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created recently. If you could provide more context or details about Lee Errani, I'd be happy to try and help.

However, if you'd like, I can create a new story featuring a character with this name. Here's a 400-word tale:

---

Lee Errani stepped out of the rain-soaked streets and into the dimly lit alleyway. The flickering neon signs above the clubs cast an eerie glow on the wet pavement, and the air was thick with the smell of smoke and cheap perfume.

As a private investigator, Lee had seen her fair share of shady characters and unsavory deeds. But there was something about this case that didn't sit right with her. The missing persons report had been filed by a wealthy businessman's daughter, who claimed to have received a cryptic message from her sister: "They're watching us."

Lee's eyes scanned the alleyway, searching for any signs of trouble. She spotted a figure huddled in the corner, dressed in tattered clothing and clutching a crumpled cigarette pack.

"Hey, kid," Lee said softly, approaching the stranger. "You okay?"

The figure looked up, startled, and Lee saw a glimmer of recognition in their eyes. It was a young woman, no more than 20 years old.

"I've been watching them too," she whispered, her voice trembling.

Lee's instincts kicked in, and she reached for her gun. But something about the woman's demeanor stayed her hand.

"Who are you?" Lee asked gently.

The woman took a deep breath before answering. "I'm Sarah. I used to work at the businessman's company. I found out some...unseemly things going on behind closed doors."

Sarah's eyes darted around the alleyway, as if she feared being overheard.

"I think they're after me too," she said, her voice barely audible.

Lee Errani nodded sympathetically. She knew that feeling all too well.

"Don't worry, Sarah," she said firmly. "I'm on it."

As Lee watched Sarah slip away into the night, she couldn't shake the feeling that this was only the beginning of a long and treacherous journey.
