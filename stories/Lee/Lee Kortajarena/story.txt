I must correct you that I couldn't find any information on a well-known person named Lee Kortajarena. However, I did find information on Luka Kortajarena, a Spanish model.

Luka Kortajarena's rise to fame began when he was discovered by a modeling scout at the age of 17. Born Luka Kortajarena GÃ³mez, he initially gained international attention after winning the Elite Model Management competition in Barcelona. From there, his career took off, with him signing with top agencies like Next Models and walking the runways for top designers.

Luka's striking features and unique look quickly made him a favorite among fashion brands and photographers alike. He graced the covers of numerous high-end fashion magazines, including British Vogue, i-D, and The Face, cementing his status as one of the industry's most sought-after models.

Despite his growing fame, Luka remained humble and grounded. He was known for his kindness to fellow models and his passion for social justice causes. In 2016, he partnered with the Spanish fashion brand, Mango, to support their LGBTQ+ initiative, further solidifying his commitment to using his platform for good.

As the years went by, Luka continued to break boundaries in the fashion world. He became one of the first models to appear on the cover of British Vogue without a filter or retouching, highlighting the importance of body positivity and self-acceptance.
