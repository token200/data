Lee Nieminen trudged through the snow-covered streets, his breath misting in the chill air. As a detective with the Helsinki Police Department, he was no stranger to rain or shine, but today's dreary weather matched his mood.

It had been three days since the murder of 25-year-old business student, Emma, shook the city. Lee's team had been working around the clock to gather evidence and follow leads, but so far, they were no closer to catching the killer.

As he walked into the precinct, Lee was greeted by his partner, Detective Maria Rodriguez. She handed him a steaming cup of coffee and said, "You look like you could use this."

Lee took a sip, feeling the warmth spread through his chest. He'd been working non-stop since Emma's murder, barely sleeping or eating. His usual sharp mind was starting to feel foggy.

The two detectives sat down at their desks, poring over the case files and reviewing surveillance footage. Lee's eyes narrowed as he watched the grainy images of Emma walking alone on that fateful night. She'd been wearing a bright yellow jacket – a distinctive mark that would make her easy to spot in the crowded streets.

Just then, Maria spoke up. "Lee, I think I found something."

Lee turned to her, his interest piqued. "What is it?"

"It was a witness who came forward last night," Maria explained. "A guy who saw Emma arguing with someone near the park where she was murdered. But here's the thing – he didn't recognize their faces."

Lee's mind began racing. If they couldn't even get a good description of the suspects, how were they supposed to catch them? He scribbled down some notes on his pad, trying to think outside the box.

As they delved deeper into the case, Lee's determination grew. Emma's family deserved justice, and he was going to make sure that justice was served – no matter what it took. The snow outside seemed to fade into the background as he focused on the task at hand: bringing the perpetrators to justice.
