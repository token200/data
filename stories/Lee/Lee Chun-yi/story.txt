Lee Chun-yi sat alone at a small café, nursing a cup of cold coffee. It had been three months since he'd last seen her - his wife, Hong-ji. The pain still felt like an open wound, and every day seemed to drag on forever.

As he stared blankly into space, memories flooded back. The way she'd smile when he walked in the door after a long day at work, the way she'd laugh at his silly jokes, the way she'd always know how to make him feel better when he was down. His eyes stung as he thought of their last conversation - the one where she told him she needed space.

Chun-yi sighed and raised his cup to his lips again. He couldn't bear the thought of facing her now, not after everything that had happened. They'd been married for ten years, and yet it felt like just yesterday they were young and in love. Hong-ji was more than just his wife - she was his best friend, his partner in every sense of the word.

He thought back to their happiest moments together - the trip to the beach, the night they watched the stars together, the way she'd always make him feel like he was home. But those memories were now tainted with sadness and regret.

As the café started to fill up with people, Chun-yi found himself lost in his own thoughts. He couldn't shake the feeling that he'd let her down, that he hadn't been enough for her. The weight of those emotions threatened to crush him, but he knew he had to keep going.

With a newfound determination, Chun-yi pushed back from the table and stood up. He took one last look at the empty chair across from him, where Hong-ji used to sit beside him. With a heavy heart, he walked out of the café, into the bright sunlight. The world outside seemed vast and overwhelming, but he knew he had to take that first step.

For now, he'd keep walking, one step at a time. He'd find a way to heal, to move forward. And maybe, just maybe, someday he'll be whole again.
