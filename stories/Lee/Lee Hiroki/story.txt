Lee Hiroki stepped out of the crowded streets of Tokyo and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the sea of faces as he waited for his train. A freelance journalist, Hiroki had spent years working on the stories that nobody else dared to tell – the dark corners of this city's underbelly.

As a child, Hiroki had grown up in a small town outside Tokyo, where his father was a priest and his mother was a nurse. But after a tragic accident claimed her life, he left home to make sense of it all. Now, at 32, he was one of the most feared and respected investigative journalists in the city.

Hiroki's latest tip came from an anonymous source who had handed him a cryptic note with the words "Echo-12 Project" scribbled on it. The note hinted at some sort of high-stakes government experiment that involved mind control, psychological manipulation, and who-knows-what kind of dark arts.

Determined to get to the bottom of it, Hiroki boarded his train and began to make calls – always careful to keep his phone conversations hushed and secretive. He had years of experience playing both sides against each other; if anyone knew how to get information out of someone without arousing suspicion, it was him.

After a few stops, Hiroki arrived at Shinjuku Station, the heart of Tokyo's corporate world. It was here that he finally tracked down his source – a nervous-looking young man with sunken eyes and haunted expressions.

"I don't know how you found me," Hiroki whispered into the phone, eyes locked on the stranger across from him.

"It's because I have nowhere else to go," the man replied in a trembling voice. "Echo-12 Project... they're using us for their own twisted games."

Hiroki nodded silently, sensing he was onto something big.

"I need your story," Hiroki said firmly, pulling out his recorder and notebook. The young man's eyes went wide as he began to recount the details of Echo-12 – a vast government-funded research facility where hundreds were subjected to inhumane experiments for their minds.

As the train hurtled through Tokyo, Lee Hiroki listened intently, taking every word down on his notebook pages. He knew this was just the beginning – there would be battles ahead and lives lost along the way. But he also knew that if anyone could shine a light into these darkest corners of power, it was him.

And so, with his recorder still running and the city lights blurring outside the window, Hiroki vowed to see this story through – no matter what lay in store for him next.
