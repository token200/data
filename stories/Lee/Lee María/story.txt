Lee María was a young, vibrant artist who had grown up in the streets of Havana. Her bright pink hair and bold style often drew attention from passersby, but few noticed the depth behind her piercing green eyes.

Born into a family of musicians, Lee María's passion for art began at a young age, watching as her mother painted vivid portraits of their community.
