As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the warehouse, Lee Schneider felt an energy wash over her. It was as if the city itself was coming alive through her lens.

The photographs that emerged from this impromptu shoot were nothing short of breathtaking. The colors were vivid, the textures rich, and the emotions palpable. Lee Schneider knew she had created something special.
