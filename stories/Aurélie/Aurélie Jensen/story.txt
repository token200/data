Aurélie Jensen sat alone in her small Parisian apartment, staring out the window at the misty morning light creeping over the rooftops. Her thoughts were consumed by the letter she had received just hours before, its contents still searing her heart like a hot brand.

It was from him – Marc, the man who had left without explanation three years ago, leaving Aurélie with nothing but a shattered dream and a deep sense of loss. The words on the page told her that he was finally coming home, that they would rekindle what was once, but could never be again.

Aurélie's fingers drummed against the worn wooden armchair as she replayed their past in her mind. She remembered the laughter they had shared, the late-night conversations under starry skies, and the way Marc's eyes crinkled when he smiled. But most of all, she recalled the ache that had settled in her chest whenever he left – a feeling she thought was long buried.

As she rose from her chair, Aurélie took a deep breath and let the misty air fill her lungs. She knew what she wanted – to see Marc again, to understand why he'd walked away, and maybe, just maybe, find closure in their reunion.

A gentle knock on the door interrupted her reverie. "Mademoiselle Jensen?" A soft voice called out from behind.

"Oui," Aurélie replied, smoothing out her dress as she made her way to answer the door.

The face that greeted her was familiar – it belonged to Sophie, Marc's younger sister. "Bonjour, chère sœur. I brought some coffee and croissants."

Aurélie smiled weakly, feeling a pang of guilt for the pain in Sophie's eyes. She knew that the return of her brother would bring comfort to Sophie, but not necessarily Aurélie herself.

As they sat together at the kitchen table, sipping coffee and nibbling on flaky pastries, Aurélie tried to prepare herself for the reunion ahead. The doorbell rang again, this time accompanied by a soft knock.

"It's him," Sophie whispered, her eyes sparkling with excitement.

Aurélie's heart skipped a beat as she rose from her chair and made her way towards the door. With a deep breath, she pushed it open to reveal Marc standing on her threshold, his eyes meeting hers for the first time in three years.

For a moment, they just stared at each other – two souls bound by memories and longing, both waiting for the same thing: understanding.
