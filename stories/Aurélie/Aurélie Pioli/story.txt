Aurélie Pioli stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar station. She had never been to Ravenswood before, but it was here that she would find herself embroiled in a mystery that would change her life forever.

As a renowned forensic psychologist, Aurélie had been called in to help the local police department profile a killer who had been terrorizing the town for months. The victims all shared one thing in common: they were women with striking blue eyes.

Aurélie's thoughts turned to her own eyes, which had always been an odd shade of green. She had never quite fit in, even among her own family. Her Italian mother and French father had encouraged her to explore her heritage, but it was the vast expanse of human psychology that truly interested her.

As she made her way through the quiet streets of Ravenswood, Aurélie felt a sense of unease creeping over her. This was a town where everyone knew each other's business, and yet, the killer seemed to be hiding in plain sight.

She arrived at the police station just as the chief was briefing her on the case. "Dr. Pioli, we've had three more victims in the past 24 hours," he said, his eyes tired but determined. "All of them were women with blue eyes."

Aurélie's mind began to whirl with possibilities. She had seen it before - the killer targeting similar-looking women, trying to blend in and avoid detection.

As she delved deeper into the case, Aurélie discovered that each victim had one thing in common: they had all received a mysterious letter with a single sentence: "I see you."

The words sent shivers down her spine. Who was writing these letters? And why were they targeting women with blue eyes?

Aurélie knew she had to get inside the killer's head, to understand what drove them to commit such heinous crimes. She spent hours pouring over the victims' backgrounds, searching for any connection that might lead her to the killer.

And then, just as she was starting to make progress, she saw it - a small detail in one of the letters that had slipped past her attention before. It was a phrase from an old Italian poem, one that spoke of the dangers of being seen by someone who didn't truly know you.

Aurélie's heart quickened as she realized what this might mean. She was closing in on the killer. But just as she thought she had found the break, everything went dark and she fell into a deep, unsettling sleep.
