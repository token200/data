I couldn't find any information on a famous person named Aurélie DiCaprio. However, I believe you may be thinking of Leonardo DiCaprio, who is an American actor and environmentalist.

If that's the case, here's a story about him:

Aurélie was not Leonardo's given name. His birth name was Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio. He was born in Los Angeles, California on November 11, 1974.

As a child, Leo grew up surrounded by the entertainment industry. His mother, Irmelin Indenbirken, was a former model, and his father, George DiCaprio, was an actor. The family moved frequently during Leo's childhood due to his father's work on film sets.

Despite the constant changes, Leo remained focused on his acting career from a young age. He landed his first role at 13 in the TV series "Romantic Days" and later made his film debut in the 1991 movie "Critters 3".

As he grew older, Leo began to take on more significant roles in Hollywood films such as "Titanic", "Catch Me If You Can", and "The Wolf of Wall Street". His performances earned him numerous awards and nominations, solidifying his status as a leading actor in the industry.

However, Leo's passion for acting wasn't limited to the screen. He was also an environmentalist at heart. He began by reducing his own carbon footprint but soon became more involved in activism. In 2006, he donated $20 million of his own money to help combat climate change.

Years later, his efforts paid off when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Hugh Glass in "The Revenant" (2015). The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $533 million worldwide.

Aurélie DiCaprio may not have been his birth name, but Leo's journey to stardom was anything but ordinary. From acting on TV sets as a child to receiving one of the most prestigious awards in Hollywood, he has truly lived up to his father's legacy.
