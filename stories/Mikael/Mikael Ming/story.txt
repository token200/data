Mikael Ming stood alone on the rooftop, gazing out at the cityscape below. The neon lights reflected off the wet pavement, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the concrete jungle. He took a long drag on his cigarette, feeling the cool night air fill his lungs.

As a detective with the Hong Kong Police Department, Mikael had seen his fair share of crime and corruption. But this case was different. This one felt personal.

A young girl named Lily had gone missing three days ago, leaving behind only a cryptic message scrawled on her bedroom wall: "I'm looking for my father." The police were stumped, but Mikael couldn't shake the feeling that he was missing something.

He leaned against the railing, his eyes scanning the rooftops below. He knew every alleyway and street in this city like the back of his hand. Maybe it was time to take a closer look.

As he scanned the rooftops, Mikael noticed a small figure darting across the top floor of the adjacent building. It was Lily's father, a man known only by his alias: The White Tiger.

Mikael knew better than to confront him directly. Instead, he made his way down to the streets below and tracked the man's movements to an abandoned warehouse on the waterfront. He slipped inside, his gun drawn, ready for anything.

The air was thick with dust and the smell of decay. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was The White Tiger himself.

"You're too late," he sneered, holding up a small photo album. "Lily's already gone. She's safe now."

Mikael's grip on his gun tightened. "Where is she?" he demanded.

The man chuckled. "You'll never find her. You see, I have a way of disappearing into the shadows. And you're not even close to being fast enough to catch me."

With that, The White Tiger vanished into thin air, leaving Mikael with nothing but his own doubts and frustration. He slumped against the wall, defeated.

But as he looked down at the photo album, something caught his eye - a small note scribbled in Lily's handwriting. It read: "I'll always be looking for my father."

Mikael's eyes narrowed. This case wasn't over yet. Not by a long shot.
