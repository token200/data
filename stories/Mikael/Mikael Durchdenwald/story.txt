Mikael Durchdenwald stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, his eyes scanning the crowded street market for any sign of trouble. As a private investigator, he had seen it all - from cheating spouses to embezzlement cases. But tonight was different. Tonight, Mikael Durchdenwald was on the hunt for a lead.

He spotted a figure in the distance, a woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She seemed out of place among the throngs of shoppers, and Mikael's instincts told him she was trouble.

As he approached her, the woman turned to face him. Her gaze locked onto his, and for a moment, they simply stared at each other.

"Can I help you?" she asked, her voice husky and confident.

Mikael Durchdenwald smiled wryly. "I'm looking for information," he said. "Information about my missing sister."

The woman's expression changed in an instant. Her eyes narrowed, and she took a step back. "What makes you think I know anything?" she asked.

Mikael Durchdenwald pulled out his badge. "I've been investigating her disappearance for months. And now, I have reason to believe it's connected to some shady business dealings."

The woman raised an eyebrow. "And what makes you think that?"

Mikael Durchdenwald produced a small photograph from his pocket. It was of the woman herself, taken several years ago. But it was the notation on the back that caught her attention - "Project Erebus".

"What does this mean?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

"It means I've been tracking you for a long time," Mikael Durchdenwald replied. "And I think you know more than you're letting on."

The woman's eyes flashed with anger, but Mikael Durchdenwald could see the fear lurking beneath. He took a step closer, his voice low and menacing.

"I'm not leaving until you tell me what I want to know. You can either cooperate, or we can do this the hard way."

The woman swallowed hard, and then nodded. "Okay," she said. "I'll tell you everything. But you have to promise to protect me."

Mikael Durchdenwald nodded, a sense of satisfaction washing over him. He had finally found a lead, and he was going to follow it no matter where it led.

As they walked out of the alleyway, Mikael Durchdenwald knew that this was just the beginning of his investigation. And he was ready for whatever came next.
