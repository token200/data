Mikael Shinichi was a man with a passion for art and music. As a child, he spent countless hours sketching and painting, lost in his own little world of creativity. His parents, both artists themselves, encouraged his talents and nurtured his imagination.

As Mikael grew older, his interests only deepened. He became fascinated with the works of Japanese masterpieces and began to study traditional art forms such as calligraphy and woodblock printing. His love for music also flourished, and he learned to play the shamisen, a traditional Japanese instrument.
