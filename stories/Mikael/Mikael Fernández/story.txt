One evening, as Mikael Fernández was sipping on a whiskey at his favorite bar, he overheard a hushed conversation between two suits that caught his attention. They spoke in hushed tones about a mysterious figure known only as "The Architect," who was rumored to be behind a series of high-profile scandals and embezzlement schemes.

Intrigued, Mikael Fernández began to dig deeper into the mystery, poring over financial records and conducting discreet interviews with suspected witnesses. As he delved deeper, he discovered that The Architect seemed to always be one step ahead of him - but he refused to give up.

The next evening, Mikael Fernández received a cryptic message from an anonymous source claiming to be The Architect's latest victim. He agreed to meet the person at an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town, his heart racing with anticipation.
