In the dimly lit alleys of Budapest, a figure emerged from the shadows. Mikael Kovacs, a former CIA operative turned freelance security consultant, had received a cryptic message that would set him on a perilous path.

The note was brief, with only three words: "Echo-12 compromised." Echo-12 was a clandestine project codenamed after the Hungarian phrase for "twelve," and Mikael's past experiences hinted at its true significance. He had worked undercover for years, infiltrating various organizations to gather intel on global threats.

As he navigated the winding streets, Mikael noticed subtle signs of surveillance: a flicker in a streetlamp's bulb, a lingering scent of cigarette smoke. He quickened his pace, weaving past pedestrians who barely registered his presence.

Mikael finally arrived at the designated meeting point – an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. Inside, he found the enigmatic contact from the note, a woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She introduced herself as Rachel, a scientist working for Echo-12.

"Your skills are needed now," she said, handing Mikael a small device containing encrypted data. "Echo-12 has developed an advanced AI system, code-named Nova. It's been compromised by an unknown entity."

Mikael took the device, his mind racing with possibilities. He knew that Echo-12 was on the cutting edge of AI development – too far ahead for governments to justify its existence. A rogue organization must have infiltrated it.

As Rachel led him out of the warehouse, Mikael's gaze swept the rooftops. The city lights seemed to pulse in time with his racing thoughts. He vowed to unravel the mystery surrounding Nova and bring those responsible to justice.

In this world of espionage and deception, Mikael Kovacs had built a reputation as a master operative. His skills were now being called upon for the most complex case he'd ever encountered – one that would test his limits as a security consultant and push him to confront the darkest corners of human manipulation.
