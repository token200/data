Mikael Põld, or Mika as he liked to be called, was an Estonian folk musician with a rich history and storied voice. Born in the countryside of Estonia in 1935, he grew up surrounded by traditional music and dances that his mother taught him. As a young man, Mikael would often wander through the rural landscape, listening to the stories and songs of the elderly villagers who shared tales of love, loss, and everyday life.

After completing his formal education, Mikael set out to learn more about the art of music-making. He spent years studying traditional Estonian instruments such as the nyckelharpa and the kantele under a renowned master luthier. This training gave him an exceptional ability to coax beautiful sounds from these unique instruments.

Mikael's musical journey eventually took him to the capital city of Tallinn, where he became known for his hauntingly poignant ballads that spoke directly to the heart of Estonian identity. He would perform at festivals and concerts throughout the country, weaving a spell over audiences with his mesmerizing melodies and heartfelt lyrics.

But Mikael's life wasn't without its challenges. As an elderly man, he struggled with illness and loneliness, finding solace in the company of nature and the stories that flowed through him like a river. It was during one such lonely winter afternoon that he penned some of his most memorable compositions – songs of love, loss, and perseverance that resonated deeply with audiences across Estonia.

Years went by, and Mikael continued to tour, perform, and create music that captured the essence of Estonian culture. He became a national treasure, celebrated not only for his talent but also for the stories he shared through song. When the time came for him to pass on, the nation mourned his loss as one of its greatest storytellers.

Today, Mikael Põld's legacy lives on in the hearts and minds of those who cherish traditional Estonian music and the timeless wisdom it carries. His songs continue to evoke emotions long after they're first heard, reminding listeners that even the smallest threads can weave a tapestry of depth and meaning when shared with love and care.

Those who listen closely will hear whispers of his name – faint echoes that echo through the quiet countryside where he spent most of his life learning music from nature itself.
