Mikael Arias stepped into the dimly lit room, his eyes adjusting slowly to the faint light. He had received a cryptic message earlier that evening, summoning him to this very location. As he made his way through the crowded space, a mixture of familiar and unknown faces passed by him.

A figure emerged from the shadows, their features illuminated only by the soft glow of a single candle. "Mikael Arias," they said, their voice low and husky. "I've been waiting for you."

Mikael's eyes narrowed as he approached the mysterious individual. They were an old acquaintance from his childhood, someone he had lost touch with over the years.

"What do you want?" Mikael asked gruffly, his hand instinctively reaching for the knife at his belt.

The figure chuckled, a low, throaty sound. "I have information about your past," they said, their eyes glinting in the candlelight. "Information that could change everything."

Mikael's grip on the knife tightened, but he forced himself to remain calm. He had always been wary of those who claimed to know secrets about him.

"What kind of information?" he asked finally, his voice measured.

The figure hesitated, as if weighing their words carefully. "It concerns your parents," they said slowly. "Their deaths. The circumstances surrounding them."

Mikael's eyes widened in surprise, but the figure continued before he could speak.

"I know what really happened that night," they said, their voice dripping with conviction. "And I'm willing to share it with you, Mikael Arias, if you're willing to listen."

Mikael hesitated, his mind racing with possibilities. He had always wondered about the truth behind his parents' deaths, and now he might finally have the chance to uncover it.

With a deep breath, he nodded. "Tell me," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

The figure leaned forward, their eyes locked on Mikael's. And with that, the conversation began, one that would change Mikael Arias' life forever.
