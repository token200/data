Mikael Chih-chieh sat cross-legged on the floor of her small apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and scattered notes. As a renowned historian and expert in ancient mythology, she spent most of her days pouring over texts and researching the obscure rituals of long-lost civilizations.

Despite her focus on the past, Mikael Chih-chieh's mind often wandered to the present. She lived in modern-day Taipei, surrounded by towering skyscrapers and bustling streets that seemed a world away from the mystical realms she studied.

As she delved deeper into her research, Mikael Chih-chieh became increasingly fascinated with the legend of the Moon Goddess, Tsai-ho. According to myth, Tsai-ho was a powerful deity who had once ruled over the land with an iron fist, only to be banished by the gods themselves.

Mikael Chih-chieh spent hours poring over ancient texts and manuscripts, searching for any mention of Tsai-ho or her role in Taiwanese history. She finally found a rare, 19th-century tome hidden away in a dusty corner of the library, which told the story of Tsai-ho's downfall and subsequent disappearance.

As she read through the pages, Mikael Chih-chieh felt a shiver run down her spine. The stories were so vivid, so alive, that she could almost smell the incense and feel the weight of the Moon Goddess's presence. She knew, in that moment, that she had to share this discovery with the world.

With renewed energy and purpose, Mikael Chih-chieh set about writing her own account of Tsai-ho's legend, weaving together threads of myth and history into a compelling narrative that would captivate readers for generations to come. As she worked, she couldn't help but feel a sense of connection to the mysterious Moon Goddess, who had captured her imagination so thoroughly.

When she finally finished writing, Mikael Chih-chieh smiled wearily at her computer screen, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment. She knew that her book would be a game-changer for Taiwanese history, and that Tsai-ho's legend would live on through her words. With a satisfied sigh, Mikael Chih-chieh leaned back in her chair, ready to embark on the next stage of her research, knowing that there was always more to uncover about this enigmatic figure known as Tsai-ho, the Moon Goddess, and her own name, which had been etched on her mother's family altar since time immemorial - Mikael Chih-chieh.
