Mikael Tóth stepped off the crowded bus and onto the winding streets of Budapest's historic district. As a detective with the Hungarian National Police, he had seen his fair share of crime scenes, but none as peculiar as this one.

A wealthy businessman, Szabó, lay on the ground outside his office building, a look of shock frozen on his face. The police were stumped - no signs of forced entry or struggle, and yet the victim was clearly dead.

Mikael surveyed the area, taking in every detail. The air was thick with the scent of freshly baked pastries wafting from the nearby bakery, but otherwise, the streets were quiet. As he knelt beside Szabó's lifeless body, a faint smile played on his lips. This case had all the makings of a classic: wealth, power, and an air of mystery.

As Mikael began to process the scene, his thoughts turned to the victim's family. He knew that Szabó was known for his ruthless business tactics, but he also understood that this level of brutality was not typical of the man. Something about the scene didn't add up.

Just then, a petite woman in her mid-30s emerged from the office building, her eyes brimming with tears. Mikael recognized her as Szabó's wife, Mária. He approached her gently, his hands clasped behind his back.

"Mrs. Szabó, I'm Detective Tóth. May I have a word?" he asked, his voice soft and reassuring.

M María nodded, and together they walked to the bus, which was still parked nearby. As they rode in silence, Mikael probed her with gentle questions about her husband's final hours.

It wasn't until Mária mentioned a heated argument Szabó had with one of his business partners that the pieces began to fall into place for Mikael. A cunning smile spread across his face as he pieced together the events leading up to the murder. It seemed that Szabó had finally outmaneuvered his rival, and the killer was not pleased.

As the sun dipped below Budapest's rooftops, casting a golden glow over the city, Mikael felt a sense of satisfaction wash over him. The game was afoot, and he was ready to unravel its threads. This case would be a puzzle no more for him - but only time would tell if justice would prevail in the end.
