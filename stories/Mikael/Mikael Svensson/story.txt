Mikael Svensson walked into the small café, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. He spotted her sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee and staring out the window. It had been months since they last met, but Mikael knew he could count on Lena to always be there.

Lena looked up as Mikael approached, a hint of a smile on her lips. "Mikael Svensson," she said, using his full name as if it were an old habit.

Mikael chuckled and sat down across from her. "And you're still using my full name?" he asked, raising an eyebrow.

Lena shrugged. "Why not? It's been too long since we last spoke. I like to hold onto the details of people."

As they caught up on each other's lives, Mikael couldn't help but notice how different Lena seemed. She was more subdued than usual, her eyes clouded with a sadness that didn't quite match her bright smile.

"What's going on?" Mikael asked, his concern genuine. "You're not yourself today."

Lena sighed and set her cup down. "I've been feeling lost lately," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Like I'm just drifting through life without any real purpose."

Mikael nodded understandingly. He'd seen it in himself before - the feeling of being adrift, without direction or meaning.

"I used to feel that way too," he said, reaching out and taking Lena's hand. "But then I realized that it's okay not to have all the answers. Sometimes you just have to trust that things will work out."

Lena looked at him, her eyes searching for reassurance. Mikael could see the weight of her struggles lifting slightly as she listened to his words.

As they talked, the café started to fill with more patrons, the noise and bustle of the day slowly pushing its way into their conversation. But Mikael and Lena didn't let it deter them - they kept talking, lost in their own little world.

Finally, as the sun began to set outside, casting a warm glow over the room, Lena smiled at Mikael. "Thank you," she said, her voice filled with gratitude.

Mikael squeezed her hand. "Anytime," he said, his full name forgotten in the warmth of the moment.
