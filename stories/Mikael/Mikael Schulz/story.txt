Mikael Schulz stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station. He had been away for what felt like an eternity, and the familiarity of this small town in Sweden was comforting. As he made his way through the crowd, the chatter and laughter from passersby carried on the crisp autumn air.

Mikael's thoughts were elsewhere, however. His mind was still grappling with the events that had led him to leave the city behind. The memories of that fateful night haunted him still – the fire, the screams, the senseless violence. He couldn't shake the feeling that he'd been left with a piece of himself in that abandoned warehouse.

He walked out into the fading light, taking a deep breath as the scent of wood smoke and damp earth filled his lungs. His small flat on the outskirts of town was just a short walk from here, its wooden facade adorned with vines that seemed to stretch up towards the sky like skeletal fingers.

Mikael pushed open the door, calling out a hello before kicking off his shoes and letting them fall to the floor. His mother had taken him in when he returned to Sweden, her warmth and comfort a balm to his frayed nerves. He smiled as he remembered her cooking – the way she'd always managed to make even the most mundane meal feel like a celebration.

The fire crackled in the hearth, casting flickering shadows on the walls as Mikael settled into his favorite armchair. He took a deep breath and let out a slow sigh, feeling some of the tension ease from his shoulders.

As he sat there, he began to notice something strange – a small piece of paper on the coffee table that he was certain hadn't been there before. It was an old photograph, creased and torn in places, with two faces staring up at him: one familiar, one unknown.

Mikael's heart skipped a beat as his mind struggled to fill in the gaps. The face beside the stranger looked almost...familiar. Yet it wasn't quite right – something in their eyes sent shivers down his spine.

He reached for the photograph again and again, trying to place himself alongside the person beside him. But like the memories of that night, it remained just out of reach – a shadowy presence lurking at the edges of his consciousness, waiting to reveal its secrets once more.

Mikael Schulz closed his eyes, letting the darkness close in around him, and let the questions begin to swirl.
