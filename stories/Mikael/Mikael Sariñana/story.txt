Mikael Sarniñana sat alone in his dimly lit, smoke-filled apartment, staring blankly at the wall as he nursed his whiskey. It was a chilly winter evening, and the rain pounded against the windows like a relentless drumbeat. Outside, the city slumbered, unaware of the turmoil brewing inside Mikael's mind.

A former journalist, Mikael had once been driven by a passion for truth and justice. But after years of chasing down leads and confronting the harsh realities of the world, he'd become disillusioned with the whole endeavor. The corruption, the lies, the manipulation – it all seemed to conspire against him, leaving him feeling lost and defeated.

As he sipped his drink, Mikael's thoughts wandered back to the story that had sparked it all: a local politician's scandalous affair with a young woman who'd ended up dead in the trunk of her own car. The investigation had been botched from the start, and the authorities had managed to cover their tracks so expertly that not even Mikael could uncover any real evidence.

The pain and frustration still lingered within him, refusing to be silenced. He thought about his colleagues, who'd all seemed so convinced of their own righteousness, yet were ultimately unable to bring down the corrupt system they claimed to want to expose. Some had quit in disgust; others continued on with naivety intact, never truly realizing what was at stake.

Mikael's gaze drifted towards a photo on his mantle – an old picture of himself and his partner, Ana. She'd been the one person who'd ever truly understood him, who'd seen beyond the facade to the darkness beneath. They'd met while working on that same story, bonding over their shared outrage and determination.

The memories came flooding back: late nights spent pouring over evidence, whispers in dark alleys, promises of justice that never materialized. Mikael's mind felt fragmented, as if he was staring at a shattered mirror – fragments of what used to be whole, yet impossibly disparate.

He drained his glass, feeling the whiskey burn its way down his throat like a toxic cocktail. In this cold, dark place, Mikael had given up on everything he'd once believed in: truth, justice, even love itself. The sound of rain outside seemed a fitting accompaniment to his internal turmoil – relentless, unwavering, and cruelly unforgiving.

And yet, in that darkest of moments, something within him stirred. A spark, long thought extinguished, flickered to life as he gazed upon the photo once more. Mikael's eyes locked onto Ana's face, her smile a beacon of hope in this desolate landscape. For an instant, the world outside receded, and all that remained was the two of them – lost, yet together, in a sea of shattered dreams and broken glass.
