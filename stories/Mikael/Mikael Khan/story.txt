Mikael Khan stepped off the crowded bus and onto the worn pavement of Little India. The sounds of Mumbai assaulted his senses - horns honking, vendors calling out their wares, and the distant thrum of a Bollywood soundtrack.

As he made his way through the labyrinthine streets, Mikael's thoughts turned to the mission ahead. He was a private investigator, known for his sharp mind and quick wit. His latest client, a young woman named Leela, had hired him to track down her sister, who had gone missing in the city.

Mikael had worked with Leela before - she was a feisty one, always up for a challenge. He knew that finding her sister wouldn't be easy, but he was determined to succeed.

As he walked, Mikael's trained eyes scanned the crowded streets, taking in every detail. He spotted a street food vendor selling spicy dosas and noted the direction of his gaze. A small, unassuming shop caught his eye - it looked like a front for something more illicit.

Mikael pushed open the door and slipped inside. The air was thick with smoke and the scent of incense. A figure emerged from the shadows, their face obscured by a hood.

"You're looking for someone," the figure said in a low, gravelly voice. "Someone who has... gone underground."

"That's right," Mikael replied, his hand resting on the grip of his gun. "My client is worried sick about her sister."

The figure nodded, seeming to consider their options. After a moment, they produced a small photograph from beneath their cloak.

"This one might be what you're looking for," they said, handing it over.

Mikael took the photo and studied it carefully. The woman was young, with long dark hair and piercing green eyes. Mikael's instincts told him that this was the sister he had been searching for.

But as he looked closer, he noticed something odd - a small tattoo on her wrist. A symbol that seemed to match one of the markings from an ancient cult that was rumored to be active in Mumbai.

Mikael's eyes narrowed - it seemed like his investigation had just taken a very dark turn. He tucked the photo into his pocket and turned to leave, but not before catching the figure's eye.

"You're not telling me everything," he said, his voice low and even.
