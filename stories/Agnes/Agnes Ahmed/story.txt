Agnes Ahmed walked into the crowded caf√©, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She had been friends with Rachel since college, and they always made it a point to meet up for coffee every week.

As she waited in line, Agnes' mind wandered back to their last conversation. Rachel had told her about her new job at a marketing firm, and how excited she was to take on new challenges. Agnes couldn't wait to hear all about it.

When it was finally her turn to order, Agnes greeted the barista with a warm smile. "Hey, just a large coffee please," she said, taking a seat by the window.

As she sipped her coffee, Agnes noticed Rachel walking towards her, a bright smile on her face. "Agnes! What's up?" Rachel exclaimed, plopping down in the chair across from her.

"Just getting my caffeine fix for the day," Agnes replied, laughing. "How was your week?"

Rachel launched into a enthusiastic rundown of her new job, regaling Agnes with stories of long hours and high expectations. Agnes listened intently, nodding along as Rachel spoke.

As they chatted, Agnes couldn't help but think about how much she admired Rachel's drive and determination. She knew that Rachel was capable of achieving great things, and it made her feel proud to be her friend.

Their conversation flowed easily, covering everything from work gossip to their favorite TV shows. It was a moment of pure relaxation, one that Agnes cherished every time they met up.

After finishing their coffee, the two friends made plans to catch up again soon. As Rachel stood up to leave, Agnes called out after her. "Hey, Rach? I have an idea for our next get-together!"

Rachel turned back with a curious expression. "What is it?" she asked.

Agnes grinned mischievously. "I'll tell you over coffee," she said, winking. And with that, the two friends went their separate ways, already looking forward to their next meeting.
