Agnes saw an opportunity to showcase her baking skills on a larger scale and decided to enter the festival's competition with her famous croissants. She spent hours perfecting her recipe and spending extra care in preparing each flaky pastry.

As the big day approached, Agnes' nerves began to get the better of her. What if her pastries didn't turn out right? What if she wasn't good enough to compete against other talented bakers?
