But when a mysterious letter arrived at her doorstep, everything changed. The letter was from a secret society dedicated to protecting the planet's most vulnerable creatures.

The letter invited Agnes Junko to join their ranks, and she knew that this was the opportunity she had been waiting for. She threw herself into the work, using her gifts to help those in need.

Her legend grew, but she never forgot where she came from – or the family that had raised her all those years ago.

Despite her newfound fame, Agnes remained humble and kind. She continued to listen to the whispers of the natural world, using her unique connection to guide her on her quest. And as she stood watch over the planet's most precious resources, Agnes Junko knew that she had finally found her true purpose in life.
