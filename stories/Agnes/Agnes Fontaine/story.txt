Agnes Fontaine stepped into the crowded café, her bright blue eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Lucy, sitting by the window, sipping on a cup of coffee. Agnes Fontaine made her way over, exchanging warm smiles with the barista as she waited in line.

Lucy looked up as Agnes Fontaine approached, a look of excitement on her face. "I'm so glad you could make it, Agnes Fontaine!" she exclaimed, as Agnes Fontaine settled into the chair across from her.

The two friends spent the next hour catching up on each other's lives. Lucy had just started a new job at a local art studio, and Agnes Fontaine was thrilled for her. As they chatted, Agnes Fontaine pulled out her sketchbook and began to draw the intricate patterns on the café's ceramic tiles.

Lucy watched in awe as Agnes Fontaine's pencil danced across the page, bringing the designs to life with each stroke. "You're so talented, Agnes Fontaine," she said, as Agnes Fontaine smiled humbly. "It's just something I've always loved doing."

As they finished their coffee and prepared to leave, Lucy turned to Agnes Fontaine with a serious expression. "I've been thinking about our conversation the other day," she said. "You mentioned that you've been feeling a bit lost lately. What's been going on?"

Agnes Fontaine sighed, her shoulders slumping slightly as she began to open up about her struggles. Lucy listened attentively, offering words of encouragement and support. As they stepped out into the cool morning air, Agnes Fontaine felt a sense of relief wash over her.

"Thank you for listening, Lucy," she said, smiling at her friend. "You always know just what to say." Lucy smiled back, her eyes shining with warmth. "That's what friends are for, Agnes Fontaine."
