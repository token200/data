Agnes Salamanca, the infamous and enigmatic matriarch of the powerful Lannister family, sat regally on her throne, surveying the lush gardens of King's Landing. Her piercing green eyes seemed to bore into the souls of those around her, as if searching for any sign of weakness or disloyalty.

As she lounged in her favorite chair, a delicate porcelain cup and saucer cradled in her hands, Agnes couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her. She thought back to her childhood, growing up amidst the intrigue and politics of Westeros, where her sharp wit and cunning nature had earned her a reputation as one of the most feared women in the realm.

Her eyes narrowed slightly as she recalled the countless battles she had fought on behalf of her family, from the war with the Targaryens to the struggles against the Iron Throne's various claimants. Through it all, Agnes Salamanca remained steadfast, always putting the interests of House Lannister above her own desires.

As she sipped her tea, a soft knock at the door announced the arrival of her trusted advisor, Kevan Lannister. "Your Grace," he said, bowing low, "I bring news from the capital. The King has requested your presence at the upcoming council meeting."

Agnes's gaze lingered on Kevan for a moment before she nodded curtly. "Send word to the other lords and ladies that I will be there. But make certain that my...ahem...'representatives' are present, as well." A sly smile played on her lips as she added, "I would not want any...misunderstandings."

Kevan's expression remained neutral, but a flicker of understanding danced in his eyes. He knew better than to cross Agnes Salamanca, for beneath her regal demeanor lay a calculating mind and a will of iron.

With a final nod, Kevan departed, leaving Agnes to her tea and her thoughts. As she sat there, lost in the labyrinthine corridors of her own mind, one thing was certain: Agnes Salamanca would stop at nothing to secure the future of House Lannister, no matter the cost to herself or those around her.
