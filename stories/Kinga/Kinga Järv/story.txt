Born into a family of esteemed nobility, Kinga Järv had always been drawn to the rich history and folklore that wove itself through the fabric of Estonian society.

As they talked, an idea began to take shape in Kinga Järv's mind. She realized that she wanted to create a national park system that would protect the country's most precious natural treasures for generations to come.

She was proud to be Queen Kinga Järv, a leader who had dedicated her life to preserving the beauty and wonder of Estonia for all time.
