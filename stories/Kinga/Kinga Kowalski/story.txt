Kinga Kowalski stood at the edge of the frozen lake, her long black hair whipping about her pale face as the wind howled across the frozen tundra. She gazed out at the vast expanse of white, her eyes squinting against the cold. Her thoughts were elsewhere.

It had been ten years since she'd last set foot in Poland. Ten years since she'd left behind the small village where her family still lived, where rumors of a cursed bloodline spread like wildfire through the grapevine. Kinga's grandmother had always claimed that their ancestors had made a pact with the devil himself, trading prosperity and power for a price that could only be paid in blood.

Kinga didn't believe it. Not anymore.

She took a deep breath, feeling the cold air fill her lungs, and turned to face the village she'd left behind. Her eyes scanned the buildings, searching for any sign of life. Her mother lived there now, or at least, Kinga assumed so – letters were unreliable in this remote corner of Poland.

Kinga's gaze landed on a figure watching from the window of her childhood home. It was an old man with sunken eyes and a wispy beard, his face twisted into a scowl that seemed to hold a thousand secrets.

As she approached him, he beckoned her closer, his bony fingers wiggling in invitation. Kinga hesitated for a moment before following him inside. The air was thick with the scent of old books and stale air as they sat by the fire, the flames casting eerie shadows on the walls.

"You're back," the old man said, his voice like sandpaper. "The village has been waiting."

Kinga nodded warily, feeling a shiver run down her spine. The villagers had always whispered about her – how she'd left Poland as soon as she was of age to avoid the curse. They claimed that without Kinga, the family's luck had begun to unravel.

"What do you want?" she asked, trying to keep her tone neutral.

The old man leaned in closer, his eyes glinting with an otherworldly intensity. "I have news," he whispered, his breath tickling her ear. "News about your bloodline."

Kinga's heart skipped a beat as the old man handed her a letter tied with a faded ribbon. She tore it open, revealing a message scrawled in hasty handwriting.

A stranger had come to Poland, seeking you out.
They claim to have proof of our cursed past.
Meet them at the old windmill on Friday night.

Kinga's eyes widened as she felt the world tilt beneath her feet. She'd always known that the rumors were true – but now, for the first time in a decade, she wondered if there was more to it than just small-town gossip and superstition.
