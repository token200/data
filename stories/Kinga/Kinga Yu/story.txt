Kinga Yu was no ordinary princess. Born to the wealthy and influential Yu family, she had been groomed from a young age to take over the family business and manage its vast empire. But Kinga's heart belonged to something more - music.

As a child, Kinga would sneak away from her royal duties to watch street performers in the bustling streets of Tokyo. She was captivated by their talent and creativity, and she knew that one day she wanted to join them. Her parents had other plans, however, and insisted that she focus on her royal duties instead.

Years went by, and Kinga's life became a blur of royal functions and family obligations. But at night, when the world was quiet and the palace was still, she would sneak into the practice room and strum her guitar, letting the music wash over her like a balm to her soul.

One evening, as she was playing a haunting melody, Kinga was caught by one of the palace guards. To her surprise, he didn't scold or reprimand her - instead, he listened intently, his eyes closed in rapt attention.

Over time, the guard became a regular visitor to the practice room, and eventually, he introduced Kinga to other musicians who shared her passion for music. They formed an unlikely band, with Kinga as their lead singer and guitarist.

As the months passed, the Yu family began to take notice of Kinga's new hobby. Her parents were dismayed - they had always envisioned a traditional royal life for their daughter, not one filled with rock music and rebellion. But Kinga refused to give up on her dreams.

Finally, after much persuasion from her bandmates, Kinga's parents agreed to let her pursue music as a side venture. And so, Kinga Yu became the lead singer of the band "Midnight Serenade", playing sold-out shows around Tokyo and winning over fans with her unique voice and style.

Despite the initial shock and dismay from her family, Kinga's decision had brought her true happiness and fulfillment. As she took the stage each night, guitar in hand, she knew that she was exactly where she was meant to be - not as a princess, but as a rockstar.
