Kinga Lacis, the enigmatic and reclusive Queen of Azura, sat upon her throne, her piercing green eyes scanning the darkened chamber before her. The flickering candles cast eerie shadows on the walls, making it seem as though the very spirits of the dead watched her every move.

Legend had it that Kinga Lacis was born with a gift – the ability to communicate with the realm of the dead. As a young woman, she had honed this talent, using it to guide those who sought her counsel and solace in times of great need.

Now, as Queen, Kinga Lacis wielded this power with an iron fist. Her advisors whispered among themselves, fearful of crossing her, lest they suffer the wrath of the Queen's restless spirits. The people of Azura trembled at the mention of her name, knowing that to incur her favor was to win a measure of divine protection.

But few knew the depth of Kinga Lacis's sorrow. Her beloved husband had died young, and his passing had left a void in her heart that could never be filled. Some said she wore a silver locket containing his likeness, a token of their love, as a constant reminder of what she had lost.

As night fell, the whispers began. The spirits of Azura's dead rose from their graves, drawn by Kinga Lacis's presence like moths to flame. She listened, her eyes closed, allowing the voices of the departed to speak directly into her mind. It was said that those who sought her counsel could hear the whispers of the dead themselves – but at a steep price.

Those brave enough to seek out the Queen's wisdom did so with great trepidation. For in Kinga Lacis's world, there were no certainties – only the realm of the unknown, where the living and the dead coexisted in an eternal dance of mystery and terror.
