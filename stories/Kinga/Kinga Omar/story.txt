She walked among her people, listening to their concerns and offering guidance where needed. Her full name, Kinga Omar bin Hassan, was on the lips of every villager, and they spoke of her with reverence.

Despite the dangers that lurked beyond her borders, Kinga Omar felt a sense of contentment wash over her. She knew that she had found her place in this world, and that she would do everything in her power to protect and defend it. As the day wore on, she returned to her palace, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead, knowing that she was a leader worthy of respect.
