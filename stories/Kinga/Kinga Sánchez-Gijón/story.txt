Kinga Sánchez-Gijón sat on her throne, her long black hair cascading down her back like a waterfall of night. She was the last king of the once-great kingdom of Galicia, and she ruled with an iron fist. Or rather, an iron crown.

As she gazed out the window at the misty mountains beyond the castle walls, Kinga's thoughts turned to the future. Her people were suffering under her rule, forced to work long hours in the mines and factories that fueled the kingdom's economy. But what choice did they have? The alternative was chaos and anarchy.

Kinga's mind wandered back to her childhood, when she had been just a young girl playing in the castle gardens. Her parents, the previous king and queen, had taught her everything they knew: how to rule, how to lead, and most importantly, how to survive.

But as she grew older, Kinga began to realize that her parents' approach was flawed. She saw the resentment building among her people, the way they whispered behind her back when she walked by. They feared her, and she didn't blame them. But she also knew that she couldn't be like them. She had to be stronger.

Kinga Sánchez-Gijón took a deep breath, feeling the weight of her crown settle upon her shoulders. She would make changes, she vowed. She would bring prosperity back to her kingdom, and peace to her people. But it wouldn't come easily.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the castle walls, Kinga stood up, her joints creaking with age. She knew that tomorrow would be another hard day, but she was ready. For herself, for her people, and for the future of Galicia.

With a newfound sense of determination, Kinga Sánchez-Gijón walked out into the evening light, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. Her people might not love her, but they needed her. And that thought gave her the strength to carry on, no matter what the cost.
