Kinga Altmann stood before the grand throne room, her long, dark hair braided neatly behind her head. As the reigning monarch of the small kingdom of Altmark, she was no stranger to power and protocol. Her piercing blue eyes scanned the crowded room, taking in the assembled nobles and courtiers.

Kinga Altmann's mind, however, was focused on the matter at hand: a delicate diplomatic situation that required her utmost care. The neighboring kingdom of Ravensburg had been making overtures towards Altmark, seeking to strengthen their alliance through trade and military agreements.

As Kinga Altmann descended the throne room steps, she was greeted by her trusted advisor, Baron von Walden. His bushy eyebrows arched in concern as he approached her.

"Your Majesty," he began, his voice low and respectful, "I must warn you that Ravensburg's overtures are not entirely forthcoming. Their leader, Prince Viktor, seems... hesitant."

Kinga Altmann's expression remained serene, but a hint of steel ran beneath the surface. She had dealt with men like Prince Viktor before; their words were as empty as a promise.

"I see," she said, her voice steady. "I would like to receive Prince Viktor in person. Summon him forthwith."

As the minutes ticked by, Kinga Altmann paced the throne room, her mind racing with strategies and counter-strategies. She was aware of the delicate balance of power in the region; one misstep could lead to war.

When Prince Viktor arrived, flanked by his burly guards, Kinga Altmann extended a gracious hand. "Prince Viktor, it is an honor to receive you."

The prince's smile was courteous, but his eyes betrayed a hint of calculation. Kinga Altmann noted the faint scratch on his left cheek, the telltale sign of a bruise.

Their conversation meandered through diplomatic niceties and trade agreements, each carefully crafted phrase designed to ease tensions. But beneath the surface, both monarchs knew the truth: this meeting was merely a prelude to a larger game of power and deception.

As Prince Viktor departed, Kinga Altmann turned to Baron von Walden once more. "It seems our meeting has merely set the stage for further... negotiation," she said, her voice dripping with understatement.

Walden nodded discreetly, knowing that in the world of politics, nothing was ever as it seemed.
