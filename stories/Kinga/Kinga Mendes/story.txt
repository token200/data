Kinga Mendes stepped out onto the balcony of her Parisian apartment, gazing out at the City of Light. The Eiffel Tower stood tall in the distance, its iron latticework glinting in the evening sun. As she breathed in the crisp air, Kinga felt a sense of contentment wash over her.

At 35, Kinga had accomplished more than most people twice her age. She was the CEO of Mendes Group, a successful conglomerate with interests ranging from fashion to real estate. Her parents, immigrants from Portugal, had instilled in her a strong work ethic and determination.

But Kinga's success came at a price. Her personal life was complicated, marked by failed relationships and a strained relationship with her mother. She had given up on love, focusing instead on building her business empire.

As she sipped her coffee, Kinga's mind wandered to the upcoming charity gala. The Mendes Group had pledged a significant donation to support underprivileged children in Africa, an initiative that held close to her heart. Kinga was determined to make this year's event one to remember, with a surprise announcement planned for later.

The door creaked open behind her, and her assistant, Ana, slipped into the room. "Your call is waiting, Mademoiselle Mendes," she said, handing Kinga a sleek black phone.

Kinga took the phone, her eyes scanning the screen. It was a text from an unknown number – a single word: 'Tonight?' – followed by an accompanying photo of herself standing in front of the Eiffel Tower. The caption read: "I see you."

Kinga's heart skipped a beat as she recognized the sender – her former flame, Alexandre Dupont, who had broken her heart two years ago. They had parted ways amicably, but the memory of their time together still lingered.

For a moment, Kinga hesitated. She could ignore the message and focus on the gala. But something about the photo caught her off guard – the look in Alexandre's eyes, the faint smile that played on his lips.

As she raised an eyebrow, Kinga knew she had to see him tonight. She smiled wryly, tucking the phone into her bag. Maybe, just maybe, this would be the night things started to change.
