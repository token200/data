Elias Fernández González stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station. He had been traveling for hours, and the exhaustion was starting to take its toll. As he made his way through the crowded carriages, Elias's mind wandered back to the letter he had received that morning.

It was from an old friend, inviting him to a reunion in the small town of San Miguel de Allende. Elias hadn't seen his friend, Carlos, in years, and the prospect of reconnecting with someone from his past was tantalizing. He had always been close to Carlos, despite their vastly different backgrounds and interests.

As he emerged onto the streets of San Miguel de Allende, Elias was struck by the town's beauty. The colonial architecture, the vibrant markets, and the warm sunshine all combined to create a sense of tranquility that was just what he needed. He made his way through the winding streets, taking in the sights and sounds, until he finally arrived at the agreed meeting point - a small café on the outskirts of town.

Carlos was already there, sipping a coffee and looking more relaxed than Elias had expected. They hugged warmly, and Elias was struck by how much his friend had changed yet remained the same. Over the next few hours, they caught up on old times, sharing stories and laughter like no time had passed at all.

As the sun began to set, Carlos suggested a walk through the town's historic center. Elias agreed, and together they strolled through the narrow streets, taking in the vibrant colors and lively atmosphere. It was as if Elias had come home, and he felt grateful for this chance to reconnect with an old friend. As they walked, Elias realized that sometimes it takes a little nudge to remember where you belong - and for him, that belonged with Carlos, his dear friend Elias Fernández González.
