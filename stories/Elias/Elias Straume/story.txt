Elias Straume stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the desolate station. It was a long way from home, but he had to see it through. The wind whipped his dark hair into a frenzy as he made his way towards the small café that served as the town's only gathering spot.

Elias Straume, a man with a mysterious past, had come to Ravenswood in search of answers. His parents had vanished when he was just a child, leaving him with more questions than he knew how to ask. The locals whispered about his family's connection to the town, but Elias Straume didn't know what to make of it.

As he sipped his coffee, a gruff voice interrupted his thoughts. "You're the one they call the 'Ghost Boy', eh?" It was Old Man Jenkins, a fixture in town who had known Elias Straume since he was old enough to walk. The nickname stuck, much to Elias Straume's chagrin.

Elias Straume shook his head, the old man's words stinging like an open wound. He didn't know what to say, or if he even wanted to try. "What do you know about my family?" he asked instead, the question hanging in the air like a challenge.

Jenkins snorted, his eyes clouding over with memories. "I don't know much, but I do know they were involved in some...interesting things. Your parents were part of a group that sought to uncover the secrets of Ravenswood." Elias Straume's ears pricked up at this, the prospect of hidden truths sending a thrill through his veins.

As he listened, Jenkins told him tales of ancient rituals and forbidden knowledge, of a world hidden beneath Ravenswood's sleepy surface. It was more than Elias Straume had ever imagined, and for the first time in years, he felt like he might finally be on the right track. The darkness that had haunted his every step began to recede, replaced by a sense of purpose he hadn't known he needed.

Elias Straume left the café that evening with more questions than answers, but also with a newfound determination to uncover the truth about his family's past and Ravenswood itself. The journey ahead would be long and treacherous, but Elias Straume was ready to face it head-on.
