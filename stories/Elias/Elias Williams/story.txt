Elias Williams stepped out of his small cottage, the early morning sun peeking through the dense forest that surrounded him. A quiet man, he lived off the land, relying on his wits and skill to survive. His eyes scanned the horizon, checking for any signs of danger - be it wild animals or rival hunters.

As a woodsman, Elias had spent years honing his craft, learning which plants were edible, how to build shelter with minimal materials, and how to navigate through the dense forest like a ghost. He was resourceful and strong-willed, but he also knew when to ask for help.

Just then, an arrow flew past Elias's ear, landing on a nearby branch with a thud. Elias instinctively dropped to his knees, drawing his own bow and loading it in seconds. The sound of rustling leaves signaled the approach of his opponent - a young man with piercing blue eyes and jet-black hair.

The stranger dismounted his horse, approaching Elias calmly. "I mean no harm," he said, holding up his hands in surrender.

Elias eyed him warily, but there was something about the stranger's demeanor that put him at ease. He lowered his bow and examined the arrowhead - it was made from a rare metal, one only found deep within the forest.

"I've been tracking you for days," Elias said, wiping the sweat from his brow.

The stranger chuckled. "I'm on a mission to gather supplies for my village. I heard this land held some of the finest hunting grounds."

Elias nodded thoughtfully. "You're not the first outsider I've met around here. What makes your village think they can just take what's already been provided by nature?"

The stranger took a deep breath, his eyes meeting Elias's. "We've been ravaged by drought and famine. Our people are dying, and we need to survive somehow."

Elias's expression softened, seeing the desperation in the stranger's eyes. He knew that feeling all too well.

"I can help you," he said, offering a nod. "But it won't be easy. We have rules here - for our own protection."

The stranger nodded eagerly. Elias handed him an arrowhead made of the same metal as his own. Together, they forged a fragile alliance, with Elias agreeing to share some of his knowledge in exchange for help with clearing land for farming.

As they parted ways, Elias felt a sense of camaraderie wash over him - it was a small step towards building something bigger than just his own survival.
