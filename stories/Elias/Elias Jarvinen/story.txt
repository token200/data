Elias Jarvinen stepped into the crowded café, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. He spotted her sitting by the window, sipping on a cup of coffee and staring out at the rainy streets outside. It had been months since they'd last seen each other, but Elias knew that looking at her profile was like seeing an old friend.

He made his way over to the table, exchanging quiet hellos with the patrons around them. As he approached, she looked up, catching his eye and breaking into a soft smile. "Elias," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

They spent the next few hours catching up on lost time, talking about everything from Elias's job as a freelance writer to her own passions as a painter. Elias was struck by how little things had changed for her – she still wore bright colors and smiled like a sunbeam when discussing art. And yet, there was an air of quiet introspection about her now that he hadn't noticed before.

As the rain continued to fall outside, Elias found himself opening up to her in ways he never thought possible. He talked about his dreams of one day publishing his own book, and she shared stories of her struggles as a small business owner. Their conversation flowed effortlessly, like they'd been doing this for years rather than mere months.

It was during one of these long moments that Elias realized just how much he missed having someone to talk to – someone who genuinely listened and understood him on a deep level. He glanced over at the woman sitting across from him, feeling an unexpected sense of gratitude towards her.

As they finished their coffee and prepared to part ways once more, Elias reached out and placed his hand on hers. "Thanks for listening," he said softly. Her eyes sparkled with amusement as she replied, "No problem, Elias Jarvinen – you're always welcome here."
