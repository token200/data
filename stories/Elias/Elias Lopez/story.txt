Elias Lopez walked into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. He spotted her sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee. It had been months since they last spoke, but the connection between them remained strong.

As he approached her table, she looked up and smiled. "Elias Lopez," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "It's been too long."

He sat down across from her, taking in the changes in her appearance. Her hair was shorter now, and her eyes seemed to hold a depth he had never noticed before.

"I've missed you," Elias Lopez said, his voice sincere. "I've been thinking about you a lot lately."

She leaned back in her chair, a hint of sadness in her expression. "I've been thinking about you too," she replied. "I'm glad you showed up today."

The two sat in silence for a moment, sipping their coffee and staring at each other. Elias Lopez was struck by how much she had grown since they last saw each other. Her confidence and self-assurance radiated from her very being.

"I've been doing some traveling," she said finally, breaking the silence. "I wanted to see the world and learn more about myself."

Elias Lopez nodded, a small smile on his face. "You're doing exactly what you should be doing," he said. "You're following your heart and taking risks. I'm proud of you."

She smiled back at him, her eyes sparkling with gratitude. "Thank you, Elias Lopez," she said. "That means a lot coming from you."

The two sat in comfortable silence for the rest of the afternoon, reminiscing about old times and sharing stories about their adventures since they last spoke. As the sun began to set outside, Elias Lopez knew it was time for him to leave.

"I should get going," he said, standing up from his seat. "But I promise we'll catch up again soon."

She smiled at him, her eyes shining with warmth. "I'm looking forward to it," she replied.

As Elias Lopez walked out of the café, he felt a sense of peace wash over him. He knew that their friendship was strong enough to withstand time and distance, and that they would always be there for each other.
