Elias Roberts stepped out of his small, cluttered office and onto the dusty streets of New Haven. As a private investigator, he had seen it all – from cheating spouses to corporate embezzlement. But this case was different. This one was personal.

A year ago, Elias's younger sister, Lily, had gone missing. The police had given up on her, but Elias knew she was still out there. He had spent months digging through old leads and re-interviewing witnesses, all in the hopes of finding a clue that would lead him to his sister.

As he walked down the street, Elias's mind replayed the last time he saw Lily. It was at their family dinner party, when she had stormed out of the room, refusing to speak to anyone. Elias had thought it was just a typical teenager tantrum, but now he wasn't so sure.

He arrived at his destination – an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. A note had been left on his desk earlier that morning from an unknown number: "Meet me here if you want to find Lily."

Elias's heart racing, he approached the warehouse cautiously. As he entered, he was met with a dimly lit room filled with old crates and boxes. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows.

It was Emily, his old high school friend who had always harbored feelings for Elias. She looked nervous, fidgeting with her hands as she began to speak.

"Elias, I know it's been hard for you... but I think I might have some information about Lily."

Elias's eyes narrowed. "What are you talking about?"

Emily hesitated before speaking. "I saw her that night at the dinner party. She was arguing with someone. But then she just vanished. And after that, nothing. I've been trying to find out who she was arguing with, but... "

As Emily spoke, Elias's mind began to piece together the fragments of his sister's disappearance. He had always suspected that something more sinister was at play.

With newfound determination, Elias turned to Emily and asked, "Who did you see?"

Emily took a deep breath before answering: "It was Victor."

Elias's eyes widened as the truth dawned on him. The same Victor who was rumored to be connected to several high-profile cases in New Haven. A cold fury began to burn within Elias, driving him forward like never before.

This case just got personal.
