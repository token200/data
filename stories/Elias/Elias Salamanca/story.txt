Elias Salamanca sat in his dimly lit office, surrounded by the opulent trappings of his vast fortune. As the patriarch of the notorious Salamanca crime family, he was a man feared and respected throughout the city's underworld.

Elias Salamanca's eyes narrowed as he listened to the nervous salesman on the other end of the phone. "I don't care what it costs, I want that shipment delivered within 24 hours," he growled, his voice dripping with menace.

The salesman hesitated before stammering out a confirmation, and Elias Salamanca nodded to himself in satisfaction. He was a man who didn't tolerate weakness or excuses, and those who crossed him knew better than to test his patience.

As he hung up the phone, Elias Salamanca's gaze fell upon a photograph on his desk. It was an old family portrait, showing his parents and younger brother, who had met a tragic end at the hands of rival gang members many years ago. Elias Salamanca's expression turned cold as he gazed at the image, his mind flashing back to that fateful night.

But he pushed those memories aside, focusing on the task at hand. He was a businessman, not a sentimental fool. He had built his empire through ruthlessness and cunning, and he would stop at nothing to protect it.

Just then, there was a knock at the door, and one of his loyal associates entered with a look of reverence on his face. "Elias Salamanca, the DEA is looking for you," he said quietly, as if afraid to utter the words aloud.

Elias Salamanca's eyes snapped up from the photograph, his expression unreadable. He knew that the feds had been sniffing around his operation for months, trying to get a foothold. But Elias Salamanca was not one to back down from a challenge. He smiled to himself as he stood up, his movements fluid and calculated.

"You know what to do," he said to his associate, a hint of amusement in his voice. "Tell them I'm busy. Very busy."

The associate nodded hastily before backing out of the room, and Elias Salamanca watched him go with an unyielding gaze, his mind already turning over plans for the next move in his relentless game of cat and mouse.
