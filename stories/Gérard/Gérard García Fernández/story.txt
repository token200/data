Gérard García Fernández, or 'Geri' to those who knew him, was a man with a passion for life and a heart of gold. A Spanish native, he had spent his childhood wandering the sun-kissed streets of Barcelona, dreaming of adventure and possibility.

As he grew older, Geri's wanderlust took hold, and he set out to explore the world beyond his city limits. He worked as a journalist, traveling from one exotic destination to the next, always on the lookout for the next big story.

But it was during his time in Argentina that Geri met her – Sofia, the love of his life. A beautiful Argentinean woman with piercing green eyes and long, curly brown hair, Sofia captivated Geri's heart like no one had before.

The two fell deeply in love, spending countless nights sipping wine on the banks of the Rio de la Plata, gazing up at the stars together. Geri knew he wanted to spend the rest of his life with Sofia – and she felt the same way about him.

However, life has a way of throwing obstacles in the path of love. As a journalist, Geri's work often took him away from home, leaving Sofia to manage their small patisserie on her own. It was hard for Geri to be away from his beloved wife and business partner, but he knew it was necessary.

Years went by, and Geri continued to travel the world, always chasing the next big story. But no matter where life took him, his heart remained in Barcelona – with Sofia and their patisserie.

One day, Geri received an invitation from an old friend to attend a prestigious journalism award ceremony in Madrid. Excited to take center stage and share his latest achievements, he accepted without hesitation. But as the day of the ceremony approached, Geri couldn't shake off the feeling that something was missing – Sofia's absence weighed heavily on him.

On the evening of the ceremony, as Geri took the stage to accept his award, he felt a surge of emotion wash over him. Tears pricked at the corners of his eyes as he thought of the love and support that had always been by his side. With renewed determination, he raised his award aloft, vowing to one day return home to Sofia – and the patisserie they built together.

The crowd erupted in applause, but for Geri, there was no triumph without his beloved wife in attendance. As he left the stage, he knew that he would never let another moment go by without telling her how much she meant to him.
