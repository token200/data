Gérard Roy sat at his desk, surrounded by the clutter of years gone by. Papers, books, and dusty trinkets cluttered every inch of his small, dimly lit office. It was a space that spoke to him – a refuge from the world outside.

As he poured over his notes, Gérard's mind wandered back to the early days. He had always been fascinated by the human condition, seeking answers to questions that others seemed content to leave unasked. His research had taken him down many dark paths, but it was this that drew him in – the search for meaning.

Gérard's eyes scanned the pages of his latest manuscript, written in a hasty scrawl. It was a work-in-progress, a collection of fragmented thoughts and observations on the nature of humanity. He had no idea if anyone would ever see it, but the act of creation was all that mattered to him.

A knock at the door broke the spell, and Gérard rose from his chair to answer it. His secretary, a quiet woman named Colette, stood in the hallway, a small package in her hands.

"For you," she said, handing over the parcel.

Gérard unwrapped the paper to reveal a slim volume bound in black leather. The title, "L'Invisible" – "The Invisible" – was embossed in silver letters on the cover.

He felt a shiver run down his spine as he opened the book. The pages were blank, except for a single phrase, typed on each page: "Je suis là." I am here.

Gérard's mind reeled as he tried to comprehend the message. Who could have written this? And why had they chosen him?

As he stood there, frozen in wonder, Colette slipped back into the hallway, leaving Gérard alone with his thoughts.

Over the next few days, the phrase began to take hold of him – "Je suis là." He felt an unseen presence around him, as if something was watching and waiting. It was a feeling he had grown accustomed to over the years, but this time it was different. This time, he knew that someone – or something – was trying to communicate with him.

Gérard's eyes returned to his manuscript, the words beginning to take on a new significance. He realized that he had been searching for answers in all the wrong places. The truth lay not in books and research, but in the silence itself. In the invisible spaces between words.

As he sat there, surrounded by the shadows of his office, Gérard felt the presence draw closer. "Je suis là," it whispered, echoing off the walls.
