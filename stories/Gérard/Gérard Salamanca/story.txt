Gérard Salamanca, also known as Gustavo's right-hand man, stood in the dimly lit room, sipping his whiskey on the rocks. His eyes scanned the space, taking in every detail as he waited for his contact to arrive.

As a key player in the cartel, Gérard had earned a reputation for being ruthless and cunning. His nickname "El Jefe de los Jefes" - The Boss of the Bosses - was well-deserved, given his ability to get things done without question.

The door creaked open, and a hooded figure slipped in, their face obscured by shadows. Gérard didn't flinch, his expression neutral as he extended a hand. "Gustavo sent me," he said, his voice low and even. "I have information about the DEA's latest operation."

The figure pushed back its hood, revealing a woman with piercing green eyes. "I'm Maria," she said, her accent thick and mysterious. "And I have news that will interest you, Gérard Salamanca."

Gérard's gaze locked onto hers, his mind racing with possibilities. He signaled for her to continue, and Maria began to speak in hushed tones.

"It seems the DEA has been working closely with a rival cartel," she said. "They're planning to take out our operation and establish themselves as the new leaders."

Gérard's expression turned cold, his eyes narrowing as he processed the information. He knew that Gustavo would want to know about this immediately. Gérard pulled out his phone and dialed a number, waiting for Gustavo to answer.

As they spoke in hushed tones, Maria watched Gérard with interest. She had heard stories about him, about how ruthless he could be when provoked. But she also sensed a calculating intelligence behind his eyes, a sense that he was always thinking several steps ahead.

Gérard finished his conversation and turned back to Maria. "Thank you for the information," he said, his voice dripping with sincerity. "I owe you one."

Maria smiled, her eyes glinting in the dim light. "Just be careful, Gérard Salamanca," she warned. "The DEA is not to be underestimated."

Gérard nodded, his expression unyielding as he took another sip of his whiskey. He knew that Maria was right - but he also knew that Gustavo's operation would prevail in the end. After all, they had Gérard Salamanca on their side.
