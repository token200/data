I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Gérard Yi-hsien. However, I can create a story about such a character.

Gérard Yi-hsien was a mysterious and enigmatic artist who lived in 19th century Paris. Born to a Taiwanese father and French mother, he grew up surrounded by the vibrant colors and eclectic sounds of Montmartre's artistic community.

As a young man, Gérard struggled to find his place within the art world. His unique blend of Eastern and Western influences made him an outsider among his peers. Nevertheless, he persevered, fueled by his passion for painting and his fascination with the mysteries of the universe.

One day, while exploring the winding streets of Paris, Gérard stumbled upon a small, mysterious shop tucked away in a forgotten alley. The sign above the door read "Curiosités Étranges" (Strange Curiosities). Intrigued, he pushed open the door and stepped inside.

The shop was dimly lit, filled with an assortment of peculiar artifacts: ancient scrolls, taxidermied birds, and strange, glowing orbs. Behind the counter stood an old man with piercing green eyes, who introduced himself as Monsieur Li. He claimed to possess knowledge from across the globe, gained through years of travel and exploration.

Gérard was drawn to the old man's wisdom and mysticism. Over the next few weeks, he returned to the shop frequently, discussing art, philosophy, and the secrets of the universe with Monsieur Li. The old man taught Gérard about the interconnectedness of all things, and how the boundaries between reality and fantasy were blurred.

As Gérard's understanding grew, his art began to transform. His paintings became more vibrant, more expressive, and more surreal. Colors merged and swirled together, as if the very fabric of reality was unraveling before his eyes. People who saw his work spoke of being transported to other worlds, where the rational and irrational coexisted in perfect harmony.

And so, Gérard Yi-hsien's art career took off, as he became known throughout Paris for creating paintings that were both mesmerizing and unsettling. Those who witnessed his work couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder, as if they had stumbled upon a hidden doorway to the unknown.
