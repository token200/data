As a child, he spent hours watching his grandmother weave intricate patterns on her loom, mesmerized by the way the threads came together to create something beautiful. This early fascination with textiles and color only intensified as he grew older, eventually leading him to study at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris.

There, Gérard honed his craft under some of the city's most renowned artists, learning the subtleties of light and shadow, the power of symbolism, and the art of pushing boundaries.
