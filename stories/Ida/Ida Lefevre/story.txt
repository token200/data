Ida Lefevre stood at the edge of the cliff, the wind whipping her long, curly hair into a frenzy as she gazed out at the grey sea. She had always been drawn to the ocean, its vastness and power both humbling and exhilarating. As a child, she would spend hours exploring the rocky shores, collecting seashells and watching the gulls soar overhead.

But Ida's fascination with the ocean was more than just a childhood quirk. It was a connection to her past, to the family she had lost and the secrets that lay hidden beneath the waves. Her parents had been sailors, their ship wrecked on a stormy night when Ida was just a teenager. The tragedy had left her alone and adrift, with only the ocean as a constant companion.

As she grew older, Ida became increasingly obsessed with uncovering the truth about her family's fate. She spent countless hours poring over old maps and nautical charts, searching for any clues that might lead her to the wreckage. And then, one day, she stumbled upon an obscure text that mentioned a hidden cove on the island of Normandy.

Ida had always been skeptical of her mother's stories about their family's past, but something about this text resonated with her. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she imagined herself standing in that cove, feeling the sand between her toes and the sea spray on her skin.

Without hesitation, Ida set off for Normandy, determined to uncover the secrets of her family's fate once and for all. As she walked along the winding coastal path, the wind whipping her hair into a frenzy, she felt a sense of freedom and purpose that she had never known before.

The sun was setting over the sea as Ida crested the final hill, her eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of the cove. And then, in the distance, she saw it - a tiny dot on the water's edge, shining like a beacon in the fading light. With a thrill of excitement, Ida took off towards the cove, ready to face whatever lay ahead and finally uncover the truth about her family's tragic fate.
