Ida Kask stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station. It was a place she'd known all too well, where her father had spent his final years before his passing. The memory still brought a pang to her chest.

As she made her way through the crowded streets of Tallinn, Ida's thoughts turned to her own journey. A talented artist, she'd left Estonia after high school, chasing the dream of making a name for herself in the art world. Years had passed since then – years of struggle, of failure, and of perseverance.

She thought back to the letter she'd received from her mother just yesterday, telling her that Ida's estranged father was sick and wanted to see her before he went. Something about it had stirred up a mix of emotions within her: guilt, love, and a deep-seated desire for answers.

As Ida walked into her childhood home, she was hit with a wave of nostalgia. The same smell of wood polish and baking wafted through the air, transporting her back to a time when life felt simpler. Her father lay in bed, his eyes sunken but still sparkling with warmth as he smiled at her.

For a moment, they just sat together, hands clasped, sharing stories of their lives – hers of struggles in New York, his of triumphs on the streets of Tallinn. Ida told him about her paintings, which had finally started to gain recognition; her father shared tales of his own time as an artist, struggling to make ends meet.

As they spoke, Ida realized that this was what it meant to be home – not just a place, but a connection with the people who understood you. Her father's fragile hands wrapped around hers once more, and he whispered something in her ear: "I'm proud of you, Ida. You've always been an artist."

The words cut through her like a knife, yet brought tears of happiness to her eyes. In that moment, she knew exactly what she wanted to do with her life – create art that would speak for those who'd been silenced, and for those who were still struggling to find their voice.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Ida's father passed away, surrounded by his beloved daughter. But in her heart, a new beginning was taking shape – one where her passion for art would merge with her love of heritage, and Ida Kask would emerge as an artist who was unafraid to tell stories that needed telling.
