Ida Elisabeth Eben was no ordinary woman. She lived in the small town of Ravenswood, where everyone knew each other's names and secrets. But Ida Eben kept her true nature hidden behind a mask of normalcy. To outsiders, she seemed like just another stay-at-home mom with a penchant for baking and gardening.

However, few people realized that Ida Elisabeth Eben was actually a skilled thief and con artist. At night, after the children were in bed, Ida Eben would slip out of her house, dressed in a long coat and hat, and prowl the streets for her next mark. She had a reputation for being one step ahead of the law, always managing to disappear into thin air.

One evening, as she was casing a wealthy merchant's mansion, Ida Elisabeth Eben spotted something peculiar - an exquisite music box hidden away in a secret compartment. She couldn't resist its allure and decided to take it for herself. But what she didn't know was that the merchant had been expecting her and had set a trap.

The next morning, when Ida Elisabeth Eben arrived at the market with the stolen music box on display, she found herself face-to-face with the merchant himself. To her surprise, he offered to let her go in exchange for one final task: to retrieve an item from his late sister's estate that had gone missing years ago.

Ida Elisabeth Eben was intrigued and agreed to take on the challenge. She spent days tracking down the missing heirloom, a priceless diamond necklace. Her skills as a thief came in handy once again, but this time she found herself caught up in a complex web of family secrets and lies.

In the end, Ida Elisabeth Eben managed to retrieve the necklace, and the merchant kept his word. As a reward, he granted her freedom and even offered her a job in his mansion as an... amateur curatorial assistant. And so, Ida Elisabeth Eben continued to walk the fine line between her double lives, all while keeping her wit sharp and her cunning razor-sharp.
