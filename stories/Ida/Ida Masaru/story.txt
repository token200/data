Ida Masaru was an enigmatic figure, shrouded in mystery and intrigue. Her past was a puzzle, with pieces that refused to fit together. Some said she was a former performer in Tokyo's underground cabarets, while others whispered of a life spent among the neon-lit streets of Shibuya.

As a child, Ida had been known as Yumi, a shy and reserved girl who found solace in the world of dance. She would spend hours watching the Geisha perform traditional Japanese movements, their elegant steps mesmerizing her like nothing else. But after a fateful night that left her feeling broken, Ida vanished from the spotlight, leaving behind only rumors of her disappearance.

Years went by, and whispers turned to legends as people began to speculate about Ida's true identity. Some said she was a ghost, lost forever in the labyrinthine streets of Tokyo, while others believed she had simply reinvented herself. The truth, however, remained elusive.

One evening, at a small, out-of-the-way bar in Shimokitazawa, a young musician named Kaito spotted Ida Masaru sitting alone at the bar. Her eyes gleamed like stars in the dim light as she sipped on a whiskey, her face illuminated only by the faint glow of the neon sign outside.

Kaito was drawn to her, sensing an energy that seemed both familiar and yet utterly foreign. As he watched Ida, she raised her head, meeting his gaze with an intensity that made him pause. For a moment, time stood still as they locked eyes, each lost in their own memories.

With an almost imperceptible smile, Ida vanished into the crowd, leaving Kaito with more questions than answers. Was she who he thought she was? Or was it all just another piece of her enigmatic puzzle waiting to be solved?

As the night wore on and the bar emptied out, Kaito couldn't shake the feeling that Ida Masaru was still watching him â€“ a mysterious presence lurking in the shadows, always one step ahead.
