Ida Nowakowska stepped out of her small, cluttered apartment and into the chilly winter air. The streets were quiet, save for the distant hum of cars driving by on the nearby highway. She wrapped her scarf tightly around her neck, feeling the familiar tug of discomfort.

As she walked through the city, Ida couldn't help but feel like an outsider. Her name was Polish, and her heritage was one that often seemed foreign to those who didn't know her. She had grown up in a country where tradition was still deeply ingrained, and yet she found herself living in a world where everything felt so... temporary.

She passed by the city's many cafes, each one filled with people sipping coffee and typing away on their laptops. Ida watched them with a mixture of curiosity and envy. They were all just trying to make a name for themselves, to leave their mark on this crazy, beautiful world.

But Ida knew that her own path was different. She wasn't here to chase dreams or build a career. She was here to escape. To leave behind the memories that still lingered in her mind like a ghostly presence. Her parents had died when she was just a teenager, and the pain of losing them still felt raw.

As she turned a corner, Ida caught sight of a small art studio tucked away between two larger buildings. She pushed open the door and stepped inside, where she found rows of canvases stacked haphazardly on walls, their colors muted and faded. A young woman with bright pink hair looked up from her work, smiled at Ida, and extended a hand.

"Welcome to 'Rustic Revival'!" she said, her voice warm and encouraging. "What brings you in today?"

Ida hesitated for a moment before answering, unsure of how much to reveal. But there was something about this place that felt like home â€“ the colors on the canvases, the smell of paint and turpentine, the sense of creative possibility.

"I just needed a space," Ida said finally, shrugging her shoulders. "A place where I can lose myself in my art."

The pink-haired woman nodded sympathetically, handing Ida a brush. "We've all been there," she said softly. "Sometimes it's not about finding ourselves, but about losing ourselves completely."
