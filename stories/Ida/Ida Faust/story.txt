Ida Faust stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, her eyes scanning the narrow passageway for any signs of trouble. As a skilled thief, she had been in tighter spots than this before, but there was something about this particular mark that didn't feel right.

She had been hired by a wealthy collector to steal a rare gemstone from the mansion of its owner, and Ida Faust was determined to see it through. She pulled out her lockpicks and began working on the door, her hands moving swiftly and precisely as she worked.

As she opened the door, a chill ran down her spine. Something about the atmosphere inside felt oppressive, like the very walls were watching her. But Ida Faust was not one to be deterred. She slipped inside, her eyes adjusting slowly to the dim light.

The mansion was a labyrinth of corridors and rooms, each one filled with treasures beyond her wildest dreams. But where was the gemstone? She had been told it would be hidden in a display case somewhere, but so far, she had found nothing.

Just as she was starting to get frustrated, Ida Faust heard a faint noise coming from upstairs. It sounded like footsteps, heavy and deliberate. Suddenly, a figure appeared at the top of the stairs, its eyes fixed intently on her.

For a moment, the two locked gazes, and Ida Faust felt a jolt of recognition. She knew that face, despite never having seen it before. There was something about it that seemed familiar, like she had seen it in a dream or a memory from a past life.

The figure didn't move, didn't speak. It just kept staring at her, until Ida Faust felt her heart begin to pound in her chest. Then, just as suddenly, the gaze broke, and the figure turned and walked away, disappearing into the shadows.

Ida Faust was left standing alone in the hallway, her mind reeling with questions. Who was that person? And what did they want from her? But one thing was certain: Ida Faust had stumbled upon something much bigger than a simple heist.
