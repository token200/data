Ida Ryota was known for her enigmatic smile, which seemed to hold a thousand secrets. As a renowned detective in Tokyo, she had earned a reputation for solving cases that left others stumped. Her sharp mind and quick wit made her a force to be reckoned with in the city's underworld.

One fateful evening, Ida Ryota received a visit from a mysterious woman named Akane, who claimed to have information about a high-profile murder case. The victim was a wealthy businessman, found dead in his mansion with no signs of forced entry or struggle. Akane handed Ida Ryota a cryptic note with a single sentence: "The truth lies in the reflection."

Intrigued, Ida Ryota decided to investigate further. She began by interviewing the victim's family and colleagues, but everyone seemed shaken by his death. She decided to focus on finding any potential witnesses or leads that might crack the case.

As she delved deeper into the investigation, Ida Ryota became increasingly convinced that Akane's note was more than just a red herring. She began to examine the victim's life and found a peculiar connection between him and an old mirror maker in the city's Shinjuku district.

With her newfound lead, Ida Ryota set out to meet with the mirror maker, who turned out to be an elderly man named Takeshi. He revealed that he had created the exact mirror mentioned in Akane's note, but with a subtle variation – it was now being sold at an antique shop on the other side of town.

Curious, Ida Ryota visited the shop and examined the mirror. To her surprise, she found an engraved message on the back: "Look again." Suddenly, all the pieces fell into place as she remembered Akane's note. The murder was not about the victim himself but about something he had left behind – a valuable item with sentimental value.

With this new information, Ida Ryota pieced together the events surrounding the murder and ultimately exposed the killer. As she closed the case file, she couldn't help but smile at the enigmatic riddle that had led her to victory: "The truth lies in the reflection." It was a testament to her own sharp mind and keen instincts as detective Ida Ryota.
