Ida Yang adjusted her glasses, surveying the cluttered office from behind her desk. The phone on the receiver let out a series of high-pitched squeaks as it rang for what felt like the hundredth time that day. She picked up with a sigh, hoping against hope it wouldn't be another telemarketer or spam call.

"Yang Investigations," she said gruffly into the mouthpiece.

A pause, and then a smooth voice spoke up. "Ms. Yang, this is Detective James from Homicide Division. We've been reviewing some new evidence in the Chen case, and I think you'll want to hear about it."

Ida's eyes narrowed as she jotted down notes on her pad. The Chen case had been an especially puzzling one, with a lack of witnesses and no leads. She had taken it on as a personal project, fueled by her own determination for justice.

"What do we know?" Ida asked, already typing up the details in her mind.

"Well, just now, we found a small note hidden inside Chen's safe deposit box," Detective James said, his voice dripping with excitement. "It reads: 'They're watching me.'"

Ida's grip on her pen tightened. This was exactly what she had been looking for – something tangible to go off of. She began mentally piecing together the fragments of evidence they'd gathered so far.

"I need to come down there ASAP," Ida told Detective James, already planning her next move.

"Will do," he replied, hanging up without another word.

Ida hung up the phone and let out a satisfied huff as she leaned back in her chair. This was what it meant to be an investigator – the hunt for clues, the relentless pursuit of truth. She couldn't wait to get started on this new lead.

With renewed energy, Ida dived headfirst into her work, sipping from her lukewarm tea and scanning the stacks of files in front of her.
