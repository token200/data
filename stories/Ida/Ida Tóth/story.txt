Ida T贸th was a brilliant and reclusive mathematician who had made a name for herself in the academic circles with her groundbreaking work on number theory. Her latest publication, "The T贸th Conjecture," had sent shockwaves through the mathematical community, and she was hailed as a genius by many.

Despite her fame, Ida was a solitary figure who preferred to keep to herself. She spent most of her days locked away in her small apartment, surrounded by stacks of books and papers, working on her next project. Her social skills were limited, and she found it difficult to connect with people outside of the academic world.

One day, a young graduate student named Emma stumbled upon Ida's work while researching for her dissertation. Enthralled by the T贸th Conjecture, Emma decided to track down the elusive mathematician herself. She spent weeks searching for Ida's office or residence, but all she could find were obscure references to her in academic journals and conference papers.

Undeterred, Emma decided to pay a visit to the local university library, hoping to find some clues about Ida's whereabouts. There, she met one of Ida's colleagues, who revealed that she was actually teaching a seminar on number theory. Emma's heart skipped a beat as she rushed to sign up for the course.

The first day of class arrived, and Ida stood at the front of the room, her signature long hair tied back in a ponytail, wearing a pair of thick-framed glasses perched on the end of her nose. As she began to lecture, Emma realized that this was indeed the renowned mathematician she had been searching for. Throughout the semester, Ida's lectures were peppered with references to "my own work" and "the T贸th Conjecture," and Emma couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at her genius.

As the course drew to a close, Emma mustered up the courage to approach Ida after class. To her surprise, Ida was warm and welcoming, engaging in a lively discussion about mathematics with her student. For the first time in years, Ida felt like she had found someone who truly understood her.
