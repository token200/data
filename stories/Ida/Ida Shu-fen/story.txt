Ida Shu-fen stood alone in the dimly lit alleyway, her eyes fixed on the faded portrait tacked to the wall. It was an image she had seen countless times before, yet each glance still brought a pang of sorrow.

The painting depicted her mother, Mei-liang, a woman with a fierce spirit and a kind heart. Ida's own features were subtly different, but the resemblance was undeniable. She gazed at her mother's eyes, remembering the way they sparkled when she laughed or shone bright with determination in the face of adversity.

It had been ten years since Mei-liang's passing, yet Ida still felt the weight of her loss acutely. As a child, she had struggled to come to terms with the fact that her mother was gone, leaving behind only memories and the faintest glimmer of a legacy.

As she grew older, however, Ida began to realize the impact Mei-liang's life had on those around her. The way she had nurtured Ida's father, helping him rebuild his life after a devastating illness. The way she had mentored young girls in their community, imparting wisdom and skills that would stay with them for years to come.

Mei-liang's death had left Ida feeling lost and adrift, but it also sparked within her a newfound sense of purpose. She began to follow in her mother's footsteps, using her own talents to help others. She volunteered at local charities, taught classes in traditional crafts, and even started a small business selling handmade goods.

With each step, Ida felt Mei-liang's presence around her, guiding her toward the path she was meant to follow. The portrait on the wall seemed to glow with an otherworldly light as she gazed upon it, as if her mother was smiling in approval.

One day, while working late in her shop, a young girl stumbled into the alleyway, looking lost and scared. Ida quickly ushered her inside, listening as the child poured out her troubles. As they talked, an idea began to form in Ida's mind â€“ one that would bring Mei-liang's legacy full circle.

With newfound determination, Ida set out to create a program that would support young girls like this one, helping them discover their own passions and talents. She spent long hours researching, planning, and networking, driven by the knowledge that her mother would be proud.

As she looked at the portrait once more, Ida smiled, knowing that Mei-liang's spirit was alive and well within her.
