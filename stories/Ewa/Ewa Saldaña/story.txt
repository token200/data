As the customer purchased the piece, Ewa Saldaña couldn't help but think of Abuela Sofia, smiling knowing that she would be pleased to see her granddaughter carrying on the family's artistic traditions. With a sense of satisfaction, Ewa Saldaña returned to work, ready to create more beauty and stories for the world to enjoy.
