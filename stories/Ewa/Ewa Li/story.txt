Ewa Li walked into the bustling streets of Tokyo, her eyes scanning the crowded sidewalks with a mix of excitement and nerves. As a freelance journalist, she had been working on a story for months, and finally, she was about to confront the source: the enigmatic CEO of Oni-Kiru Industries.

Rumors swirled around Ewa's latest scoop – a high-ranking executive at the cutting-edge tech firm had secretly invested in an eco-friendly startup. With this revelation, Ewa Li could potentially expose Oni-Kiru's involvement and bring about change within the company.

Ewa navigated through the crowded alleys of Shinjuku, finally reaching the imposing skyscraper that housed Oni-Kiru's headquarters. She took a deep breath and stepped into the sleek lobby, where a polished receptionist greeted her with an icy smile.

"Good morning, I'm here to see Mr. Nakamura," Ewa said confidently, flashing her press badge.

The receptionist raised an eyebrow but nodded and led Ewa to a high-rise conference room on the 20th floor. As she entered, Ewa spotted the CEO of Oni-Kiru Industries sitting behind a massive wooden desk – none other than Taro Nakamura's trusted lieutenant, Kenji Nakamura.

"Ah, Ms...?" Kenji began, as if unsure how to pronounce her name.

"Ewa Li," she replied firmly, producing her press badge from her pocket. "I'm here for the interview about Oni-Kiru Industries' recent investments."

Kenji leaned back in his chair, eyes narrowing behind his thick-rimmed glasses. Ewa sensed that he knew more than he let on – this was not going to be an easy conversation.

"So, Ms. Li," Kenji said with a calculated smile, "tell me – what makes you think we have a stake in this eco-friendly startup?"

Ewa's mind flashed back to the countless late nights spent digging through financial records and conducting interviews with anonymous sources. She knew she had enough evidence to expose Oni-Kiru Industries' involvement.

"Let's just say I have my reasons, Mr... Kenji," Ewa said coolly, eyes locked onto his, "and I'll make sure they are revealed."

Kenji's expression remained unreadable, but a hint of unease flickered across his face. Ewa Li knew she had won this small battle – the war was far from over.
