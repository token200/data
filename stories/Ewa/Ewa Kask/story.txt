Ewa Kask was a renowned Polish poet, known for her poignant and introspective verses that captured the essence of the human experience. Born in Krakow, Poland, on a crisp autumn morning in 1975, Ewa's love for poetry was fostered by her mother, a former professor of Slavic literature.

As a child, Ewa spent hours listening to her mother's recitations of Tadeusz Dąbrowski and Wisława Szymborska, two of Poland's most celebrated poets. She would sit mesmerized by the rhythmic cadence of their words, weaving a spell that would stay with her forever. This early exposure not only shaped Ewa's own writing style but also instilled in her a deep appreciation for the power of poetry to transcend borders and cultures.

Ewa's journey as a poet was marked by both triumph and struggle. She faced numerous rejections before publishing her first collection, "Pomnik dla nieznałych" (Monument for Unknowns), which earned critical acclaim and recognition from Polish literary circles. However, it wasn't until the release of her second book, "Wiatr w skarbie", that she gained widespread international attention.

"Wiatr w skarbie" was a collection of poems that delved into themes of identity, belonging, and social justice. It was here that Ewa's unique voice emerged, blending elements of mysticism, history, and personal narrative to create a rich tapestry of words. Her poetry spoke to readers from diverse backgrounds, weaving together threads of shared human experience.

Throughout her career, Ewa Kask has remained committed to using her platform to amplify the voices of marginalized communities and advocate for social justice. Her work has been translated into numerous languages, allowing her message to reach an even broader audience. Despite facing challenges and setbacks, Ewa continues to write from a place of deep conviction and compassion, inspiring readers around the world with her words.

As she looks back on her journey, Ewa reflects on the profound impact that poetry has had on her life. "Poetry is my sanctuary," she says. "It allows me to express myself, to explore the depths of human emotion, and to connect with others across borders and cultures." In this sense, Ewa Kask's work serves as a testament to the transformative power of words, speaking truth to power and illuminating the complexities of our shared human experience.
