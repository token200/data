Ewa Sariñana was a free spirit, always chasing the next adventure and living life on her own terms. Born in the vibrant city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, she grew up surrounded by music, dance, and passion. As a child, Ewa would spend hours watching traditional Brazilian dances like samba and forró, mesmerized by the rhythmic movements of her parents' bodies.

As she grew older, Ewa's love for dance only intensified. She began taking classes at local studios, mastering various styles and eventually earning a spot in a prestigious dance company. But it wasn't until she discovered capoeira that her true passion was ignited. This Afro-Brazilian martial art combined elements of dance, acrobatics, and music, and Ewa was hooked.

Ewa's unique blend of style and athleticism quickly made her a standout performer on the stage. Her confidence and charisma commanded attention, and soon she found herself leading workshops and teaching capoeira classes to enthusiasts of all ages.

One day, while performing at a music festival in Lisbon, Portugal, Ewa met a fellow traveler named Mateus. A photographer by trade, Mateus was captivated by Ewa's energy and creativity, and the two struck up a conversation that would change their lives forever. They spent the rest of the evening exploring the city together, laughing, and sharing stories.

As they wandered through Lisbon's winding streets, Ewa found herself opening up to Mateus in ways she never had with anyone before. She shared her dreams, fears, and passions with him, and Mateus listened with a curious ear. The connection between them was palpable, and soon they were inseparable.

For the next year, Ewa and Mateus traveled the world together, capturing its beauty through art and performance. They explored ancient ruins in Greece, hiked through the Swiss Alps, and even spent a month in India learning yoga and meditation. Along the way, Ewa continued to hone her capoeira skills, incorporating new movements and techniques into her repertoire.

As they sat on a hill overlooking the sunset, Mateus turned to Ewa and said, "You are my muse, my inspiration." Ewa smiled, knowing exactly what he meant. With Mateus by her side, she felt invincible – ready to take on whatever adventures lay ahead.
