Ewa Larsson stood at the edge of the frozen lake, her eyes fixed on the faint outlines of the Swedish woods beyond. It was a winter morning in Stockholm, and the cold air bit at her skin like a thousand needles. But she wasn't here to enjoy the scenery.

As a detective with the Stockholm police department's Cold Case Unit, Ewa had spent countless hours reviewing files, interviewing witnesses, and searching for leads on some of the city's most infamous unsolved crimes. And now, she was finally getting close to solving one of them.

Twenty years ago, a young woman named Lena Nielsen had gone missing during a solo skiing trip in these very woods. Her body had never been found, and despite Ewa's best efforts, no one had ever been convicted of her murder. But something about this case had stuck with her all these years, and she was determined to finally bring justice to Lena's family.

Ewa took a deep breath, the cold air filling her lungs, and began to walk towards the woods. She had received a tip from an anonymous source that a suspect might be hiding in a secluded cabin on the other side of the lake. Ewa's heart quickened as she thought about the possibility of finally closing this case.

As she walked, the silence was broken only by the crunch of snow beneath her boots and the distant sound of birds chirping in the trees. Ewa felt a sense of focus wash over her, a sense of purpose that she hadn't felt in years.

After what felt like hours of walking, Ewa finally came to the cabin. It was small and weathered, but it looked sturdy enough to withstand the harsh Swedish winters. She approached cautiously, her gun drawn, and peered through the window.

And then she saw him - a man with a scruffy beard and tired eyes, huddled on the couch in front of the fireplace. Ewa's gut told her that this was her guy. She took another deep breath and knocked on the door.

The man looked up, startled, and Ewa could see a flicker of fear in his eyes. "Can I help you?" he asked gruffly.

Ewa smiled, a sense of triumph rising within her. "Just here to ask you some questions," she said, her voice firm but friendly.

And with that, the case was finally coming to an end. Ewa's eyes locked onto the man's, and she knew that justice would soon be served.
