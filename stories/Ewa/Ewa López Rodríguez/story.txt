Ewa López Rodríguez sat alone in her small café, sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee. It was a typical Wednesday morning, with the usual hum of activity from the early risers filtering through the door. But Ewa wasn't like everyone else. She was a ghost.

Or at least, that's what she'd come to believe.

It started when she died in 1990. The official cause of death: an accidental overdose of prescription medication. But Ewa knew it was more than that. She saw the world through different eyes, and her spirit had been trapped between worlds ever since.

As a young woman, Ewa had lived a life full of passion and purpose. A talented artist, she'd spent years honing her craft, working tirelessly to make a name for herself in the art world. But life had dealt her a cruel hand, and one fateful night, it was taken away from her.

Now, as she sipped her coffee, Ewa felt like a relic of the past. Forgotten by those who'd known her, left to wander the earth alone. She watched as people came and went, their faces blurring together in a sea of strangers. Some tried to make contact, sensing that there was something...off about her.

Ewa had learned to avoid them, to fade into the background like a whispered secret. But today was different. Today, she felt a sense of restlessness, a feeling that she needed to move on. She set her cup down and stood up, her joints creaking with a soft ache that seemed to come from nowhere.

With a newfound determination, Ewa began to walk out of the café, into the bright sunlight. It was like a door had opened in front of her, revealing a world she'd never noticed before. She felt alive, and for the first time in decades, it felt good.

As she walked, the city came alive around her. The sounds, the smells, the sights – everything seemed fresh and new, full of possibility. Ewa smiled to herself, feeling like a bird taking flight for the first time.

She didn't know where she was going or what lay ahead. All she knew was that she was moving forward, one step at a time. And as she vanished into the crowd, her spirit finally found peace, free from the weight of her own mortality.
