She had also won several domestic and international titles, including the UEFA Women's Euro Championship in 2012. But Ewa's greatest achievement was not just her success on the pitch, but the impact she made off it.

As captain of the Finnish women's national team, Ewa Nieminen was a vocal advocate for women's rights and equality in sports. She had worked tirelessly to promote greater visibility and recognition for female athletes, using her platform to raise awareness about issues such as pay equity and stadium safety.

Together, they had formed a tight-knit bond that transcended the game of soccer, one that was built on trust, respect, and a shared commitment to excellence.
