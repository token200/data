Ewa Berzina stepped into the dimly lit caf√©, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. As she waited in line to order, she couldn't help but feel a sense of unease wash over her. It had been months since she'd last seen her estranged sister, Katarzyna.

As Ewa waited for her coffee, she noticed a woman sitting alone at a small table by the window. There was something about the way the light danced across her features that seemed...familiar. Ewa's heart skipped a beat as she approached the table, her hand hovering over the shoulder of the stranger before coming to rest on the back of the chair.

"Katarzyna?" she said softly, hoping against hope that it was indeed her sister.

The woman looked up, startled, and Ewa's heart sank. It wasn't Katarzyna at all - just a young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair.

Ewa's embarrassment slowly gave way to confusion as the stranger began to chat with her. They exchanged small talk about their jobs and interests, but Ewa couldn't shake the feeling that she was staring into the face of...someone else.

Just as they were finishing up their conversation, a woman with curly brown hair and bright blue eyes walked in, scanning the room until her gaze landed on Ewa. "Ewa?" she said hesitantly, rising from her seat to join her at the counter.

"Katarzyna!" Ewa exclaimed, as the truth finally dawned on her. The woman who had been sitting alone by the window was indeed her estranged sister - and the other woman she'd met in line was...a doppelganger?

As Katarzyna wrapped her arms around Ewa in a tight hug, Ewa couldn't help but wonder if she had somehow switched lives with this lookalike. But as they pulled back to examine each other's faces more closely, it became clear that these two women were not one and the same.

"Who is that?" Katarzyna asked, nodding towards the stranger, who was now watching them from across the room with an air of curiosity.

Ewa shrugged. "No idea," she said, feeling a mix of relief and confusion wash over her once again.
