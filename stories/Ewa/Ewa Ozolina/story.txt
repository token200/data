Ewa Ozolina stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting in the corner, nursing a cup of coffee and staring intently at his laptop screen. It had been months since she'd last seen her colleague and friend, and Ewa couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her.

As she approached the table, Ewa noticed the look of concentration on her coworker's face was matched only by the hint of fatigue in his eyes. She slid into the chair across from him, dropping her own bag to the floor with a soft thud.

"Ewa Ozolina," he looked up, startled, before breaking into a warm smile. "It's been too long."

Ewa chuckled, feeling a pang of guilt for being so long overdue in visiting him. They spent the next hour catching up on each other's lives, discussing everything from their latest projects to their favorite TV shows.

As they talked, Ewa couldn't help but notice the way her coworker's eyes lit up when he spoke about his passion for coding. It was a side of him she rarely saw, and it made her admire him all the more. She, on the other hand, had been feeling stuck in a rut lately, struggling to find inspiration for her own creative pursuits.

Just as they were starting to wrap up their conversation, Ewa's coworker suddenly looked at his watch and exclaimed, "I have to go! I promised my team I'd be there 15 minutes ago."

Ewa laughed and stood up, stretching her arms over her head. "Well, it was great catching up with you," she said, smiling. As they exchanged pleasantries and made their way out of the café, Ewa couldn't help but feel grateful for the chance encounter.

The run-in had left her feeling invigorated, reminding her that sometimes all it took was a nudge in the right direction to reignite her spark. And as she walked home under the stars, Ewa Ozolina felt a renewed sense of purpose and creativity stirring within her.
