Ewa Salamanca stepped into the dimly lit room, her eyes scanning the space for any sign of life. As the youngest sibling of the notorious Lannister family, she had grown accustomed to being overlooked and underestimated. Her dark hair was pulled back in a tight ponytail, revealing a scattering of freckles across her cheeks.

Ewa's full name, Ewa Salamanca, whispered secrets among those who knew her, a reminder that even the most unlikely Lannister had a claim to power. She moved with a quiet confidence, her long coat billowing behind her like a dark cloud.

A soft knock at the door broke the silence, and Ewa's hand instinctively went to the dagger at her waist. "Enter," she called out, her voice low and even.

The door creaked open, revealing a young man with a look of desperation in his eyes. "Ewa Salamanca, I need your help," he said, his voice shaking slightly.

Ewa's expression remained neutral, but a flicker of curiosity danced across her face. "What do you want?" she asked, her tone dripping with skepticism.

The young man hesitated before speaking. "I'm being pursued by the Faith Militant. They say I've committed treason."

Ewa raised an eyebrow. "Treason? Against whom?"

The young man swallowed hard. "Against King's Landing. They say I was part of a plot to overthrow the king."

Ewa's eyes narrowed, her mind racing with possibilities. She knew that if this were true, it would mean that she was in league with those who opposed the Iron Throne. But something about the young man's words resonated within her.

"Ewa Salamanca?" he asked again, his voice laced with hope.

She nodded, a small smile playing on her lips. "I'll help you. But first, tell me why."

The young man's eyes widened in surprise before he launched into a tale of loyalty and duty, of a queen who had wronged him deeply. Ewa listened intently, her expression softening as she learned the truth behind his words.

As they spoke, the shadows in the room seemed to recede, replaced by a glimmer of understanding between two people bound by fate. And for one fleeting moment, Ewa Salamanca felt like herself, not just the youngest Lannister sister.
