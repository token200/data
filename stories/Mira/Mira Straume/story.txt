Mira Straume stepped into the crowded café, scanning the room for a familiar face. As the lead singer of the indie rock band "Echo Fade," she was no stranger to performing in front of crowds, but tonight was different. Tonight, she was here to meet with her manager, Alex, about the latest developments in their record deal.

As she waited at the bar, sipping on a cup of coffee, Mira's mind began to wander back to the band's latest album release. The response had been overwhelmingly positive, but there were still doubts lingering in the back of her mind. Was this really what they wanted to do with their music? Or was it just a means to an end?

Just as she was starting to get anxious, Alex appeared at her side, a smile spreading across his face. "Hey, Mira! Good to see you," he said, taking a seat next to her.

Mira smiled back, feeling a sense of relief wash over her. "Hey, Alex. Thanks for meeting me."

The conversation that followed was a whirlwind of numbers and statistics, but Mira's attention kept drifting back to the album release. Had they done enough to tap into the mainstream? Or would they be forever stuck in the indie rock underground?

As they discussed the finer points of their deal, Mira couldn't help but think about her bandmates – Jack, Emily, and Ryan. They were all talented musicians, but were they truly ready for the spotlight? The more she thought about it, the more she realized that she had been putting a lot of pressure on herself.

As the meeting drew to a close, Alex leaned forward and placed a hand on her arm. "Mira Straume, you're an incredibly talented artist," he said, his eyes locked on hers. "Don't forget to take care of yourself in all of this."

Mira felt a lump form in her throat as she nodded, feeling a sense of gratitude towards Alex for reminding her what truly mattered. With renewed determination, she stood up and walked out of the café, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead with her band by her side.

As they left the restaurant, Jack turned to her and asked if she was okay. Mira smiled back at him, feeling a sense of reassurance. "I'm fine," she said, taking a deep breath. "Let's just focus on making music that we love."
