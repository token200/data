Mira Jasinska was no stranger to the darker corners of Budapest. As a private investigator, she had spent years navigating the city's underbelly, uncovering secrets and lies that most people would rather keep hidden.

She spent hours pouring over old records and conducting discreet interviews, slowly unraveling the threads of a web that seemed to lead everywhere except where it wanted her to go. The more she learned, the more she became convinced that this case was personal – that someone close to her own family was embroiled in this dark scheme.

She knew that this case would change everything – not just for her investigation, but for her own sense of identity and purpose.
