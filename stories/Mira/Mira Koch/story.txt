Mira Koch stepped into the dimly lit art gallery, her eyes scanning the room with a mix of curiosity and skepticism. As an art critic for the local paper, she had seen her fair share of uninspiring exhibitions, but there was something about this one that piqued her interest.

The exhibit featured a series of abstract paintings by a young artist named Leo, whose work had been gaining attention in the city's underground art scene. Mira had heard whispers about his unique style, which blended traditional techniques with cutting-edge digital tools. But she wasn't convinced – could this new breed of "tech-infused" art truly be considered art?

As she wandered through the gallery, Mira's gaze settled on a large-scale piece that seemed to pulsate with an otherworldly energy. She felt drawn to it, like a moth to a flame, and approached cautiously. The artist had titled this work "Echo Chamber," and as Mira gazed deeper into its swirling vortex of color, she began to feel a sense of unease.

Suddenly, the lights flickered and dimmed, plunging the gallery into darkness. When they flickered back on, Mira found herself face-to-face with Leo himself, standing beside her. "Welcome," he said, his voice low and hypnotic. "I see you're drawn to 'Echo Chamber.'"

Mira's skin prickled as she tried to process what was happening. This wasn't just an exhibit – it was an immersive experience. She felt like she had stepped into Leo's inner world, a realm where technology and art blurred into something new and unseen.

Over the next few weeks, Mira found herself returning to the gallery again and again, each time unlocking new layers of meaning in "Echo Chamber." She began to see her own assumptions about art shattered – was it possible that this "tech-infused" style was more than just a novelty? That it could actually tap into something fundamental about human experience?

Mira's column in the local paper became a sensation, as she waxed poetic about Leo's innovative use of technology. But for Mira, the real excitement lay not in the art itself, but in the questions it raised about what we mean by "art" – and how we might be pushed to see the world anew.

As she left the gallery on her final visit, a small package slipped into her hand – an invitation from Leo, with a note that read: "Welcome to my echo chamber. Come back soon."
