Alfred Jankowska, a man in his late fifties with unruly grey hair and a bushy beard, sat at the kitchen table, nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee. He stared out the window, lost in thought as he often was.

It had been five years since Alfred's wife passed away. Five years since their life together came to an end. The memories still lingered, haunting him like a ghost from his past. They would appear at the most inopportune moments – during a phone call with a client, while driving down the highway, or even just as he was drifting off to sleep.

Alfred's mind wandered back to that fateful day when he received the news about his wife's passing. The diagnosis had been a shock – pancreatic cancer had spread faster than they could have imagined. She had fought bravely, but it was too late. Alfred remembered the look on her face as she lay in the hospital bed, holding his hand for the last time.

As he sat there now, sipping his cold coffee, Alfred thought about the life he and his wife had built together. They had met at college, bonding over their love of literature and philosophy. It was a union that seemed destined to be, yet life had other plans.

Their home, once filled with laughter and conversation, was now an empty space that echoed with silence. Alfred would often find himself wandering from room to room, searching for his wife's presence in the furniture, in the books on the shelves, or even in the faint scent of fresh laundry. But she was never there.

The phone rang, breaking Alfred out of his reverie. It was a client, requesting a meeting to discuss a new project. Alfred hesitated for a moment before answering, unsure if he had the energy to focus on work. He agreed, knowing that it was exactly what he needed – an escape from the world within.

As he hung up the phone and began gathering his thoughts, Alfred couldn't help but think about his wife's favorite quote – "Life is like a river, ever-changing yet eternally the same." It had been her favorite book of all time. He smiled wistfully to himself, remembering how she would recite it with such passion.

The door creaked open and Alfred looked up to see his daughter standing in the doorway, a young woman with her mother's piercing blue eyes. "Dad?" she said softly. Alfred stood up, wiping his hands on a towel as he went to give her a hug. For that moment, at least, he felt a sense of peace wash over him – a sense that life would go on, even without the love of his wife.

With newfound determination, Alfred walked alongside his daughter out into the bright sunlight, ready to face whatever came next.
