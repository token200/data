Nikita Askarov's eyes scanned the crowded market square, her fingers instinctively tightening around the hilt of her dagger. She had been watching the merchant from across the way for weeks, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

As a member of the Red Vipers, Nikita was tasked with infiltrating the wealthy elite and exposing their corrupt dealings. Her target today was Marcellus Blackwood, a ruthless collector who would stop at nothing to acquire rare and valuable artifacts.

Nikita wove through the stalls, her long black hair pulled back into a ponytail as she surveyed the scene. The sun beat down on her skin, but she hardly noticed, her focus solely on the merchant's heavily guarded mansion looming in the distance.

With a swift movement, Nikita slipped past a vendor and made her way to Blackwood's estate. She snuck through a hidden entrance, avoiding the guards who patrolled the perimeter. The air inside was thick with opulence – velvet drapes, polished marble, and glittering crystal chandeliers.

Nikita moved swiftly, her bare feet making barely a sound on the cold stone floor. She reached Blackwood's study in record time, where she found the merchant sipping champagne and admiring a prized artifact.

"Welcome, Nikita," Blackwood said, his voice dripping with condescension. "I see you've arrived unannounced. How...quaint."

Nikita smiled sweetly, her eyes locked on the artifact in question – a golden statue of a mythical creature. "Just thought I'd drop by and say hello, Marcellus," she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

Blackwood chuckled, but Nikita could see the faintest flicker of unease behind his eyes. She had him now.

With a swift movement, Nikita pulled out her dagger and pressed it against Blackwood's throat. The merchant gasped as Nikita began to speak, her words spilling out in a rapid torrent.

"You've been buying and selling artifacts on the black market for years, Marcellus," she said. "You've ruined lives, brought ruin to communities – and now, you're going to pay."

As Nikita's words hung in the air, Blackwood's face turned white with fear. The guards burst into the room, but Nikita was ready. With a few swift movements, she dispatched them all, rendering herself the last one standing.

When the dust settled, Nikita stood over Blackwood's defeated form, her chest heaving with exertion. She had done it again – exposed another corrupt dealer and brought justice to those who needed it most.

As she turned to leave, a small note caught her eye on the edge of the desk. It read: "You may have won this time, Nikita, but there are always more like Blackwood waiting in the shadows."

Nikita's eyes narrowed as she smiled to herself. She had only just begun.
