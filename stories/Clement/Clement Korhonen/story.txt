Clement Korhonen was a man with a unique profession - he was a professional line-stander. Yes, you read that right. While many people would rather spend their time relaxing on the couch or engaging in thrilling activities like hiking or painting, Clement enjoyed standing in lines for hours on end.

It all started when Clement's cousin needed someone to wait in line for him at a concert, and Clement agreed to do it. He waited for five hours in the pouring rain and was rewarded with a pair of tickets to his favorite band's show. From that day on, Clement became known as the "line-stander extraordinaire."

People would pay Clement to stand in lines for them, whether it was waiting for a new iPhone release or snagging a coveted concert ticket. Clement's patience and endurance were put to the test every time, but he took pride in his work.

One day, Clement received a call from a client who needed him to wait in line at a popular restaurant that opened its doors at 6 AM sharp. The catch? The client was too busy to make it himself. Clement arrived bright and early, donning his warmest coat and most comfortable shoes. He stood for five hours, chatting with fellow customers and sipping on coffee, until the doors finally swung open.

As he waited, Clement couldn't help but think about how much he loved his job. There was something satisfying about being a line-stander, watching as people scrambled to get in before him. He took pride in knowing that he was making someone else's day easier, even if it meant sacrificing his own comfort for hours on end.

Clement Korhonen may not have won any awards or accolades for his work, but he knew he was doing something special. And as he walked away from the restaurant, exhausted but content, he couldn't help but smile at another job well done.
