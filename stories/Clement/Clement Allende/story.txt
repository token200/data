In that moment, Clement felt truly alive. For the first time in years, he saw a glimmer of hope on the horizon, and it was Sophia who stood beside him, shining like a beacon in the darkness. As they exchanged numbers and made plans to meet again soon, Clement knew that his life would never be the same.
