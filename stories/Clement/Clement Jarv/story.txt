But as he grew older, it became clear that there was more to this young man than met the eye. He possessed an uncanny ability to communicate with animals, a gift that had been passed down through generations of Jarvs.

One day, while out exploring the woods near his family's farm, Clement Jasper Jarv stumbled upon a small, injured bird. Without hesitation, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a few crumbs, gently coaxing the bird back to its nest.
