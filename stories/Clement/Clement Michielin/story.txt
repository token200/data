Clement Michielin was a man shrouded in mystery. Few knew much about him beyond his impressive resume as a renowned detective and puzzle solver. His reputation preceded him, drawing people to him like moths to flame.

As he sat in the dimly lit café, sipping on a cup of black coffee, Clement's eyes scanned the room with an intensity that made others squirm in their seats. He was a man consumed by his craft, always seeking the next challenge, the next puzzle to solve.

A young woman, Emily, approached him hesitantly, her hands shaking as she handed over a small package. "This is for you, Mr. Michielin," she whispered, glancing around nervously. Clement's eyes narrowed, and he took the package without a word, his fingers tracing the intricate patterns etched into its surface.

As he unwrapped the contents, a small, crystal orb gleamed in the dim light. The room seemed to grow quieter, as if everyone was holding their collective breath, waiting for something to happen. Clement's eyes locked onto the orb, and his expression transformed from curiosity to fascination.

"Ah, the Phoenix Oracle," he breathed, his voice low and husky. "I've heard of its existence, but never thought I'd have the chance to behold it in person." He carefully placed the orb on the table, his hands trembling ever so slightly as he did so.

The café fell silent once more, waiting for Clement's next move. And then, without warning, the lights flickered and died, plunging the room into darkness. In the sudden silence, Emily gasped, her eyes wide with fear. But Clement Michielin merely smiled, his eyes glinting in the darkness.

"I'm not done yet," he whispered, his voice echoing through the café like a promise. As the lights flickered back to life, Emily saw that Clement had vanished into thin air, leaving behind only the faint scent of smoke and the whisper of "The game has just begun."
