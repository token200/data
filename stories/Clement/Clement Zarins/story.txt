One fateful evening, Clement Zarins received a visit from a distraught socialite named Sophia, who implored him to investigate her sister's disappearance. The police had given up on the case, but Sophia was convinced that Clement Zarins held the key to unlocking the truth.

Clement Zarins accepted the challenge and began his investigation, poring over every shred of evidence and interviewing suspects with a discerning eye.
