Born in the sleepy town of Ravenswood, Clement grew up with an insatiable curiosity about the world around him.

One day, while exploring the ruins of a long-abandoned temple deep in the heart of Cambodia, Clement stumbled upon a mysterious artifact that would change his life forever. The intricately carved stone statue depicted a figure with eyes that seemed to gleam with an otherworldly intelligence – an image that sent shivers down the spine of even the most hardened explorer.

As Clement gazed upon the statue, he felt a sense of connection to the long-lost civilization that had created it.
