Mats Hill trudged through the snow-covered forest, his eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of life. A lone skier, he had been on the mountain all morning, but the fresh powder had proved elusive. As he crested a small rise, a plume of smoke drifted into view.

Curious, Mats quickened his pace, his boots crunching through the snow. He followed the scent until he came upon a small cabin, its chimney puffing out gentle wisps of smoke. A figure emerged from the doorway, bundled in a thick parka and mittens.

Mats's eyes narrowed as he took in the stranger's rugged appearance. "You're not one of ours," he said gruffly, his voice low and even.

The stranger smiled, revealing a scattering of scars on his cheeks. "I'm just passing through," she said, her voice husky from disuse. "Heard this was the best spot to find powder."

Mats snorted, a wry smile twisting his lips. "You've got that wrong, friend. This mountain's not for beginners."

The stranger nodded, a hint of mischief in her eyes. "I can handle myself," she said.

As Mats sized her up, he noticed the glint of something metal caught in her mitten – a small silver pendant, shaped like a skier. He felt a sudden jolt of recognition, as if he had seen her before.

Suddenly, it clicked into place. The stranger was Lena, his childhood friend from town. They had lost touch after she left to explore the world on her own, but Mats had always held out hope that one day they would meet again.

"Hey," Mats said, his voice softer now. "Lena?"

Her eyes widened in surprise before breaking into a radiant smile. "Mats!" she exclaimed, rushing forward to fling her arms around him.

For a moment, the snow and the mountains receded as they stood wrapped in each other's arms, their past and present blurring together like the trees in the forest. Mats laughed, feeling a weight lift off his shoulders, as he knew that he had found something precious – an old friend, and perhaps something more.

As they pulled apart, Lena gazed up at him with sparkling eyes. "Want to explore some powder?" she asked, her grin still plastered on her face.

Mats grinned back, the snow-covered peaks stretching out before them like a promise.
