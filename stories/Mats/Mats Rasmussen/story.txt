Mats Rasmussen sat alone at the bar, nursing a whiskey on the rocks as he gazed out at the rain-soaked streets of Copenhagen. It was a night like any other in this bustling city, but for Mats, it felt like a lifetime ago that he'd last been here, laughing and loving with his wife.

Lena had passed away six months ago, leaving Mats to pick up the pieces of his shattered heart. He'd tried to fill the void with work and drink, but nothing seemed to shake the feeling of emptiness that lingered within him. As he stared into the amber liquid in front of him, he couldn't help but think of all the memories they'd made together - the way Lena would always know how to make him laugh, the way she'd always be there to lend a listening ear when he needed it most.

Mats took a sip of his drink, feeling the burn of the whiskey all the way down. He wasn't sure how much longer he could keep going like this. The pain was still raw, but he knew he had to find a way to move forward if he wanted to honor Lena's memory. He thought about all the things they'd planned to do together - the trip to Italy, the concert tickets, the cozy nights in by the fireplace.

Just as Mats was starting to feel like he couldn't take it anymore, the door to the bar swung open and a familiar face walked in. It was his old friend, Anna. She spotted Mats from across the room and made her way over, a warm smile on her face.

"Mats, my friend, I'm so sorry," she said, sliding onto the stool beside him. "I know you're still hurting, but I want you to know that I'm here for you. We'll get through this together, okay?"

Mats looked up at Anna, feeling a lump form in his throat. For the first time all night, he felt like maybe, just maybe, things were starting to look up again. He took another sip of his drink, savoring the taste and the company, knowing that with friends like Anna by his side, he'd get through this darkness after all.
