I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Mats Kalniņa. It is possible that this character is not well-known or was created for a specific story. 

However, I can create a story about a fictional character named Mats Kalniņa and provide you with it.

Mats Kalniņa was a skilled Latvian archer who lived in the 16th century. He was known throughout the land for his exceptional marksmanship and his unwavering dedication to his craft. Mats had been training since he was a young boy, honing his skills under the watchful eye of his father, a renowned archer himself.

As he grew older, Mats began to compete in local tournaments, where he quickly earned a reputation for his accuracy and speed. His fame spread far and wide, attracting the attention of the royal court. The King himself took notice of Mats' exceptional abilities and invited him to participate in a grand tournament at the palace.

Mats Kalniņa was both thrilled and intimidated by the opportunity. He knew that this would be his chance to prove himself on the biggest stage imaginable. With his trusty bow and quiver full of arrows, he arrived at the palace, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.

The tournament began, and Mats' skills were put to the test as he faced off against some of the finest archers in the land. Despite being a dark horse in the competition, Mats managed to hold his own, impressing the royal court with his precision and focus.

As the days passed, Mats continued to excel, earning himself a spot in the final round. It was there that he faced off against the reigning champion, a formidable archer named Leonhard. The crowd held its collective breath as the two competitors took aim, but in the end, it was Mats Kalniņa who emerged victorious, his arrow finding its mark with pinpoint accuracy.

The King himself congratulated Mats on his win, praising his skill and sportsmanship. From that day forward, Mats Kalniņa was hailed as a hero in Latvia, his name synonymous with excellence and achievement.
