Mats Perin stepped into the dimly lit pub, the smell of smoke and stale beer hitting him like a punch to the gut. He had been searching for this place for weeks, ever since he received that cryptic message from his old friend, Jukka.

As he made his way through the crowded room, Mats scanned the faces, looking for someone who seemed out of place among the rowdy patrons. That's when he spotted her - a woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair, sitting alone at the bar.

Mats nodded to himself as he approached the woman, his instincts telling him that she was connected to Jukka's message. The bartender looked up, raised an eyebrow, and said, "Can I get you something, Mats?"

Mats ordered a whiskey and took a seat next to the mysterious woman, trying not to draw attention to themselves. She turned to him, her eyes narrowing slightly as she asked, "You're Mats Perin."

He nodded, his heart racing with anticipation.

"I've been looking for you," she said, her voice low and smooth.

Mats leaned in, his curiosity getting the better of him. "What do you want from me?"

The woman pulled out a small photograph from her purse and slid it across the bar to Mats. He picked it up, his eyes widening as he recognized Jukka's face staring back at him.

"Mats, I'm afraid your friend has gone missing," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "We need your help to find him."

Mats' mind was racing with questions and theories, but the woman cut him off before he could say anything. "We'll talk about it in private. Follow me."

She stood up, leaving Mats to follow her out of the pub and into the chilly night air. As they walked through the streets of Helsinki, the city seemed to grow darker and more menacing with every step.

Eventually, they arrived at an old warehouse on the outskirts of town. The woman produced a key and unlocked the door, leading Mats inside. The warehouse was dimly lit, the only sound the creaking of old wooden beams.

Mats felt a sense of unease growing in his stomach as he followed the woman deeper into the warehouse. He knew that Jukka would never go missing without a reason, but this feeling told him otherwise.

Suddenly, the woman stopped and turned to him, her eyes gleaming with an intensity that made Mats' skin crawl. "We're not just looking for your friend," she said. "We're looking for something much bigger."

And with that, everything went black.
