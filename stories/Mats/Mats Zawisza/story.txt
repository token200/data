As a rising star in the Polish media scene, Mats' sharp instincts and quick wit had earned her a reputation as one of the most respected and feared journalists in the country.

Despite the danger and backlash that came with tackling such high-stakes stories, Mats remained undeterred. She was convinced that her pursuit of justice and transparency was worth the risk.
