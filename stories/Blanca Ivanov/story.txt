Blanca Ivanov stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the desolate landscape. The small station was surrounded by nothing but trees and fields, the only sound the distant hum of a tractor. She had been on this journey for what felt like an eternity, with no end in sight.

As she made her way through the station, Blanca's thoughts drifted back to her life before this place. She had grown up in a world of opulence and excess, where every whim was catered to and every need was met. But that was all behind her now. Her parents' death had left her with nothing but debt and regret.

Blanca pushed open the creaky door to the small cafe that served as the station's only eatery. The owner, a gruff old man named Gus, looked up from his newspaper and nodded at her. "Coffee?" he asked, his voice like gravel.

"Yes," Blanca replied, taking a seat at the counter. She ordered a black coffee and pulled out a worn notebook, flipping through its pages to find a specific entry. As she read, her eyes scanned the desolate landscape outside, searching for something – anything – that might spark a memory.

Gus watched her with interest, his expression softening slightly. "You're new around here," he said, nodding at her backpack. "What brings you to our neck of the woods?"

Blanca hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. But there was something about Gus's kind eyes that put her at ease. "I'm looking for a place to start over," she said, finally.

Gus nodded, his expression understanding. "We've all been there," he said. "Sometimes it takes a while to find your footing."

As Blanca sipped her coffee and continued reading from her notebook, Gus leaned in close, a conspiratorial look on his face. "There's something I need to tell you," he whispered. "Something about this town that might interest you."

Blanca raised an eyebrow, intrigued. What could Gus possibly know that would make her stay? But before he could speak, the cafe door swung open and a figure slipped inside, their eyes scanning the room until they landed on Blanca.

For a moment, she froze, unsure of what to do. The stranger's face was unfamiliar, but there was something about them that seemed... familiar. As if they knew her, even though she couldn't quite place why.

Blanca's heart skipped a beat as Gus nodded discreetly towards the door. "I think you should go," he whispered. "It's someone from your past."
