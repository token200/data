Berthold Alsbach stepped out of the misty morning air and into the grand foyer of his ancestral estate, his eyes scanning the dimly lit space as he made his way towards the fireplace. The soft crackle of the flames was a comforting sound, one that had been a constant presence in his life since childhood.

As he poured himself a cup of steaming coffee from the old silver pot on the side table, Berthold's thoughts turned to the weighty matters that lay ahead. His late father's estate was being auctioned off, and as the eldest son, it was Berthold Alsbach who would inherit the bulk of the property.

He took a sip of his coffee, feeling the bitterness wash over him like a bitter taste in his mouth. The thought of parting with the family home was almost too much to bear. This place had been his sanctuary for years, where he could escape the pressures of being a member of the Alsbach family.

Just then, there was a knock at the door, and Berthold's butler, Jenkins, entered with a discreet bow. "Good morning, sir," he said. "I trust you're ready to face the day?"

Berthold nodded curtly, his mind already racing with the impending auction. He had spent countless hours poring over the estate's records, trying to get a sense of what was truly valuable and what could be sold off.

The auctioneer, Mr. Finch, arrived promptly at noon, his booming voice echoing through the halls as he began to catalogue the wares on offer. Berthold watched with growing unease as the prices for each item soared upwards, knowing that some of the items would fetch far more than they were worth.

As the day drew to a close, Berthold made his way over to the final sale â€“ an exquisite watercolor set created by his great-grandmother, Sophia Alsbach. He couldn't bear the thought of parting with it, but he knew it was too late to change course.

With a heavy heart, Berthold signed the sale documents and handed over the deed, feeling a pang of loss that he had never expected. As he turned to leave, Jenkins approached him, his eyes sympathetic. "You've done what was best for the estate, sir," he said softly. Berthold nodded, still trying to process the weight of it all.

As he walked back into the grand foyer, the fireplace seemed quieter than before, its flames flickering in a dimmer light. It was a reminder that some things could never be replaced, no matter how hard one tried.
