Berthold Saldana, a man in his late 30s with an unruly mane of curly hair and a quick wit, walked into the small café on a drizzly afternoon. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the air as he took a seat at the counter, ordering a large cup of black coffee.

As he waited for his drink to arrive, Berthold Saldana couldn't help but notice the stranger sitting across from him, typing away on their laptop. Their profile was dimly lit by the faint glow of the screen, and Berthold found himself drawn to the person's intensity.

When his coffee arrived, Berthold Saldana took a sip and turned his attention back to the stranger, who had now closed their laptop and was gazing out the window. They seemed lost in thought, their brow furrowed in concentration.

Feeling a sense of curiosity, Berthold Saldana got up from his stool and approached the stranger's table. "Mind if I join you?" he asked, nodding towards the empty chair across from them.

The stranger looked up, startled, before smiling and shaking their head. "Not at all," they said, scooting over to make room for Berthold Saldana.

As they introduced themselves – Alex, a freelance writer – Berthold Saldana learned that they were working on a novel about a young man with a similar passion for life and adventure. The story resonated deeply with Berthold, who felt an instant connection to the character.

Over the next hour, Berthold Saldana and Alex engaged in lively conversation, discussing everything from literature to music. Their shared interests created a palpable bond between them, and Berthold found himself feeling more at ease than he had all day.

As the café began to empty, Berthold Saldana realized that he didn't want their time together to end. "Would you like to grab dinner sometime this week?" he asked Alex, smiling hopefully. With a nod and a smile, Berthold knew that he was in for an evening of possibility with this intriguing stranger.
