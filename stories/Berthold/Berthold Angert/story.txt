Berthold Angert was a man of peculiar tastes and even more peculiar habits. As a renowned collector of antique door knobs, he spent most of his days scouring dusty flea markets and estate sales for the perfect addition to his collection.

Despite his rather niche interest, Berthold's reputation as a connoisseur of door knobs had earned him a devoted following among fellow collectors and enthusiasts. His prized possession, a 19th-century Victorian-era doorknob with intricate etchings, was said to be worth a small fortune.

One sunny afternoon, Berthold Angert strolled through the local market, his eyes scanning the rows of vendors selling everything from vintage postcards to antique teapots. As he wandered, he stumbled upon a quaint little stall tucked away in a corner, filled with an assortment of peculiar knick-knacks and trinkets.

The vendor, a wizened old man with spectacles perched on the end of his nose, looked up as Berthold approached. "Ah, welcome, sir! I have just the thing for you," he exclaimed, producing a small, ornate doorknob from beneath the counter.

Berthold's eyes widened as he took in the intricate details of the doorknob – delicate filigree, etched patterns, and a subtle shimmer that seemed to dance in the sunlight. "Ah, this is exquisite!" he breathed, his voice full of enthusiasm. "Where did you acquire it?"

The vendor smiled knowingly. "A fellow collector, I'm afraid. He was looking for someone with an eye for the finer things in life." Berthold Angert's eyes lit up with excitement as he carefully lifted the doorknob from its resting place and examined it more closely.

As he did so, a smile crept across his face – a smile that said he had finally found something to add to his beloved collection. With a satisfied sigh, Berthold Angert tucked the doorknob into his bag and bid the vendor farewell, already planning his next move in the hunt for the perfect addition to his cherished door knob collection.
