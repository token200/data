Berthold Leblanc was a man shrouded in mystery. His eyes seemed to hold a thousand stories, each one whispering secrets to those who dared to listen. He wore a perpetual air of detachment, as if observing life from behind a mask of indifference.

One rainy evening, Berthold stepped into the dimly lit café on Rue de Rivoli. The patrons fell silent as he took his seat at the end of the bar, ordering a cognac with an air of quiet confidence. His fingers drummed against the glass, a subtle rhythm that commanded attention.

A young artist, Henri, noticed Berthold's gaze drifting across the room, lingering on each face before moving on to the next. Intrigued, Henri approached him, introducing himself with a mixture of curiosity and trepidation. Berthold's response was brief, but piercing: "I collect faces."

As the night wore on, Berthold revealed fragments of his past – a childhood spent in the misty French countryside, where stories were currency and secrets hidden behind whispering oak trees. He spoke of lost loves and forgotten dreams, each tale a thread woven into the tapestry of his existence.

Henri was enthralled by Berthold's words, sensing an artist's passion behind the mask. Yet, whenever he probed deeper, Berthold's gaze would falter, as if guarding some hidden truth. The air around him seemed to vibrate with unspoken truths, drawing in those who dared to listen.

As the café emptied and the rain intensified outside, Berthold finished his cognac, leaving a small pile of coins on the bar as payment. He stood, towering over Henri, and vanished into the swirling darkness like a phantom. The last sound was the rustle of his coat, its silence announcing a departure.

Henri watched him go, unsure whether he had truly seen Berthold Leblanc or merely imagined a fleeting shadow. Yet, in that moment, he understood the power of observation – for in observing others, we reveal ourselves to our own eyes.

As Henri stepped into the rain-soaked night, he felt an eerie sense of connection to Berthold, as if their paths were forever linked by threads of unspoken understanding. The city seemed different, its faces taking on a new dimension, each one whispering secrets in the silence between encounters. And in the darkness, Berthold Leblanc watched from afar, his eyes holding another story – one he kept hidden behind the mask of indifference.
