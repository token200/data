Berthold González Fernández was known to his friends and family as Bertie, but only in private. In public, he was the esteemed Don Bernardo de la Vega, a name that commanded respect in the halls of power. He was a master of politics, a virtuoso of manipulation, and a chess player extraordinaire.

As the head of security for the President's office, Bertie had earned a reputation for being unflappable under pressure. His ability to remain calm in the face of crisis made him the go-to advisor for sensitive matters. With a flicker of his eyebrows and a raised eyebrow, he could defuse even the most explosive situations.

But beneath the polished exterior, Bertie was struggling. The weight of his secrets was crushing him, and the whispers of scandal were starting to make him uneasy. He had once been a passionate advocate for social justice, but the corridors of power had slowly eroded his ideals. Now, he played by the rules, even if those rules didn't align with his own moral compass.

One evening, as Bertie was leaving the office, he received an unexpected visit from an old friend and confidant, Ana. Over coffee, she confronted him about his increasing distance from his past life. She pressed him for answers about why he had given up on his dreams of becoming a journalist to become a high-ranking government official.

Bertie shifted uncomfortably in his seat, unsure how to respond. He knew that his friend saw right through him – that she could read the conflicted emotions simmering beneath his carefully crafted façade. As they spoke, Bertie began to see Ana's words as a wake-up call, a reminder of the person he once was and the dreams he had let slip away.

Perhaps it was time for Don Bernardo de la Vega to take a step back, if only for a moment. Maybe he could reclaim some of the ideals that had driven him to enter politics in the first place. Bertie's eyes locked with Ana's, and for an instant, they shared a glimmer of hope – a chance to rediscover himself amidst the corridors of power.

But as the night wore on, reality crept back in, like a cold draft through the window. The weight of his responsibilities pulled him back into the fray. Bertie knew that he couldn't stay frozen forever; there were duties to be attended to and secrets to be kept.

With a sigh, he stood up, shaking off the dust of nostalgia. "I'll think about it," he said finally, with a hint of resignation. And as Ana departed into the night, Bertie González Fernández knew that his private struggle had only just begun – a silent battle between the man he was meant to be and the role he had taken on in life.
