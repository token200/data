Berthold Moore stepped out of his office, onto the misty London streets. It was the early hours of the morning, and the city still wore its slumbering cloak. He lit a cigarette, feeling the familiar pang in his chest as he exhaled the smoke into the chilly air.

As a former intelligence officer, Berthold had seen it all - from the thrill of a successful mission to the agony of failure. His years at MI6 had taken their toll, but the experience still coursed through his veins like adrenaline.

Berthold made his way to the local café, where he knew the proprietor would have a freshly brewed cup of coffee waiting for him. The old man nodded as Berthold slid into the booth, his eyes never leaving the papers scattered on the table.

Berthold spent most of his days trying to make sense of it all - the world's intrigue, the countless plots and counterplots that seemed to twist like a puzzle with no end. His own past had been marked by deception and betrayal - he knew what it was like to be lost in the labyrinth of loyalty and duty.

But this latest case... Berthold couldn't shake off the feeling that something big was unfolding before him. A cryptic message from an old contact, hinting at a mole within MI6's own ranks. The more Berthold dug, the deeper he sank into the mire of suspicion.

He took a sip of his coffee, watching as the fog outside thickened into a shroud. His mind began to wander - memories of dead agents and false leads, whispers in the dark that never seemed to come true.

Suddenly, a faint hum echoed through the café, accompanied by the glow of a phone on the table. Berthold's eyes narrowed, as he picked up the receiver.

"Who is this?" his voice cut through the static, like a blade slicing through air.

"Berthold," came the reply, low and husky. "It's Sarah."

A chill ran down Berthold's spine. He had thought she was dead - killed in the line of duty on one of his last missions. But now, he was faced with the possibility that this enigmatic woman might hold the key to unraveling the tangled web.

"Sarah," Berthold whispered, his hand instinctively reaching for his gun. "I'm listening."
