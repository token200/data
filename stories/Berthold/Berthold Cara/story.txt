Berthold Cara was a man shrouded in mystery, his past a closely guarded secret known only to a select few. He lived a life of quiet observation, always watching and waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

As a master thief, Berthold had made a name for himself in the underworld, earning respect and admiration from his peers. His ability to blend into the shadows, to vanish like smoke on a summer's day, was unmatched. He was the one they called when they needed something taken care of, without anyone getting their hands dirty.

Berthold Cara stood tall and lean, his piercing green eyes glinting in the dim light of the tavern where he often met with clients. His dark hair was cropped close to his head, accentuating the sharp angles of his face. He exuded an aura of confidence, a quiet self-assurance that bordered on arrogance.

Tonight was no different. Berthold sat at the bar, nursing a whiskey as he waited for his contact to arrive. The fire crackled in the hearth, casting flickering shadows on the walls as the wind howled outside like a chorus of restless spirits.

The door swung open and a hooded figure slipped inside, their eyes scanning the room before locking onto Berthold's figure. A nod was exchanged, and the stranger slid onto the stool beside him.

"I have something that needs taking care of," the hooded figure whispered, producing a small package wrapped in black cloth.

Berthold's fingers closed around the package like a vice, his eyes never leaving the stranger's face. "What's inside?" he growled, his voice low and menacing.

The hooded figure hesitated before answering, their voice barely audible over the crackling flames. "A valuable artifact. One that could change hands for a fortune."

Berthold Cara smiled, a cold and calculating smile that sent shivers down the spine of anyone who saw it. He knew the value of this artifact, and he was determined to see it into safekeeping.

With a swift motion, Berthold produced a small knife from his pocket and began to work on the package. The hooded figure watched, transfixed, as the threads that bound the artifact in place were slowly cut away.

As the last thread fell to the floor, Berthold Cara slipped the artifact into his pocket, his eyes never leaving the stranger's face. "That'll be 10,000 gold," he said, his voice dripping with satisfaction.

The hooded figure handed over the coin, their hand shaking slightly as they did so. Berthold watched them, a sense of amusement dancing in his eyes. He knew that this was only the beginning of a long and profitable association.
