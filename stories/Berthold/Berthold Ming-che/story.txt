Berthold Ming-che was known throughout the land for his extraordinary abilities as a master thief. His exploits had been chronicled in whispered tales and hushed conversations among the nobility, who marveled at his audacity and cunning.

As a young man, Berthold Ming-che had grown up on the streets of a bustling metropolis, surviving by his wits and stealth. He quickly learned to navigate the city's hidden passageways and alleys, using his agility and quick reflexes to evade capture.

Years later, as a seasoned thief, Berthold Ming-che was approached by a wealthy patron with a lucrative proposal: steal a priceless artifact from the royal collection and retrieve it at midnight. The reward was too great for Berthold Ming-che to resist.

Under the cover of night, Berthold Ming-che set out on his mission, his eyes scanning the castle walls for any sign of vulnerability. He moved with an unnatural silence, his bare feet barely making a sound on the stone floor as he made his way to the display case housing the artifact.

With a few swift movements, Berthold Ming-che lifted the lid and extracted the artifact – a golden statue of the king's ancestor. He tucked it into a small pouch at his belt and turned to make his escape.

But as he reached the door, Berthold Ming-che was confronted by a surprise guest: the queen herself, who had been secretly watching his progress from the shadows. To his credit, Berthold Ming-che remained calm and composed, deftly charming the queen with his wit and guile.

"Your Majesty," he said, bowing low, "I am but a humble thief, merely performing my craft. I mean no disrespect to your family or your kingdom."

The queen smiled, seemingly impressed by Berthold Ming-che's audacity. "I think you will find that this artifact is not as valuable as it seems," she said, her voice dripping with subtle menace. "It holds a secret, one that only the most skilled thief – like yourself, I suspect – can unlock."

With that enigmatic statement, Berthold Ming-che knew he had to leave immediately. He tucked the statue into his pouch and made a hasty exit, leaving behind a trail of questions and whispers about the mysterious theft.

As for the queen's words, only time would tell if they were more than just a clever ruse – or if Berthold Ming-che had indeed stumbled upon something far greater. For now, he disappeared into the night, his legend growing with each whispered rumor about his exploits.
