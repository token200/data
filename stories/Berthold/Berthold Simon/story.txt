Berthold Simon was a man shrouded in mystery. His piercing green eyes seemed to bore into those he met, as if sizing them up for some unknown purpose. His rugged features and sharp jawline made him look like a character from a Dickens novel, but there was something unsettling about his presence that kept people at bay.

Berthold was a collector of rare and obscure artifacts, with a particular fascination for antique medical equipment. He spent most of his days scouring dusty antique shops and flea markets in search of the next big find. His obsession had become an all-consuming force in his life, driving him to neglect his relationships and even his own well-being.

One day, while rummaging through a particularly obscure shop, Berthold stumbled upon a rare and beautifully crafted silver autopsy table. The craftsmanship was exquisite, with intricate etchings on the surface that seemed to dance in the light. As soon as he laid eyes on it, Berthold knew he had found what he was looking for.

Despite the protests of the shop owner, who warned him of the table's dark history and potential cursed status, Berthold took the table home with him. Over the next few weeks, strange occurrences began to plague him. Tools would go missing, only to reappear in odd places around his workshop. Strange noises echoed through the night, like whispers from beyond the grave.

As the days passed, Berthold became increasingly paranoid and isolated. He stopped leaving his house, afraid of what might happen if he ventured out into the world again. His relationships with friends and family began to fray, as they grew concerned about his growing obsession with the autopsy table.

It wasn't until one fateful night, when a fire broke out in his workshop, that Berthold realized the true extent of his problem. As he watched the flames engulf his beloved collection, including the silver autopsy table, he saw something that chilled him to the bone: the table's intricate etchings seemed to be changing, shifting from beautiful to grotesque.

In that moment, Berthold understood that some secrets were better left unexplored. He emerged from his workshop a changed man, forever wary of the strange and unknown forces that lurked in the shadows. The autopsy table was gone, but its memory would haunt him for the rest of his days, a grim reminder of the dangers of delving too deep into the mysteries of the past.
