Berthold Satylganova stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the drab, grey town before him. It was a place he'd never expected to call home – or at least, not without great reluctance. Yet here he was, forced to stay by circumstance.

A former soldier, Berthold had thought he'd left such desperation behind when he enlisted. But war has a way of leaving its mark, and the memories of what he'd seen lingered like an open wound. He'd tried to escape in the city, to lose himself among the crowds, but it seemed no matter where he went, the echoes followed.

He made his way through the station, Berthold's eyes adjusting to the dull light. The air was heavy with the scent of dampness and stagnation, and a shiver ran down his spine as he walked. He'd always been drawn to places that felt... broken, like this forgotten town in rural Russia.

As he entered the small hotel where he'd taken a room for the night, Berthold couldn't help but notice the faded photographs on the wall – old family portraits with eyes that seemed to follow him as he moved. He shook his head, the memory of another place that had once felt like home flashing in his mind.

In Moscow, there was a café where Berthold used to meet friends over steaming cups of black coffee, laughing and sharing stories until late into the night. Now, with every passing year, it seemed further away from him. He couldn't recall when he'd last heard its familiar melody or seen its smiling face on the main street.

He checked into his room, a cramped space above the hotel's kitchen, where Berthold lit a candle and gazed out at the darkening sky through the grimy windowpane. It was here in this little town that Berthold felt the weight of solitude – like he'd become so lost that even the memories were foreign.

As night fell and the wind howled outside, Berthold let his thoughts drift to what lay ahead – rebuilding himself, perhaps, rediscovering who he truly was beyond the scars of war. And maybe, just maybe, finding a way to bring those forgotten dreams back to life in this quiet, forgotten town where time had lost its grip on reality.
