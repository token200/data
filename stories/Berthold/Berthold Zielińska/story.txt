Berthold Zielińska, a Polish aristocrat from the early 20th century, stood at the edge of his family's ancestral estate, gazing out at the rolling hills and forests that stretched as far as the eye could see. The wind carried the scent of blooming wildflowers and fresh-cut grass, transporting him back to summers spent playing in these very same fields.

As he walked through the gates, Berthold felt a pang of nostalgia wash over him. His family's estate had been in their hands for generations, but with the wars and economic downturns that plagued Poland after World War II, things had changed. The once-lush gardens were now overgrown, and the sound of laughter and children's games had fallen silent.

Berthold's thoughts turned to his younger sister, Szczepana, who had been taken from him far too soon. Her passing had left a void in their family that could never be filled. He remembered her bright smile and infectious laugh, and how she would always be the first to suggest an adventure, no matter how reckless.

As he entered the manor house, Berthold was greeted by his loyal butler, Józef. "Good day, sir," Józef said with a bow. "The guests have arrived."

Berthold's eyes narrowed slightly as he took in the assembly of people gathered in the foyer. There were relatives and acquaintances, all come to pay their respects to the late matriarch of the Zielińska family. Berthold had been told they would be discussing the future of the estate, but he knew better. They would only debate and bicker over whose share was what.

Berthold's gaze wandered to a young woman standing at the edge of the group, her dark hair pulled back into a neat bun. She looked out of place among the more established members of society, yet there was something about her that caught his eye. Perhaps it was the way she listened intently as someone spoke, or the way her eyes sparkled with interest.

As the evening wore on and the discussions turned to business and politics, Berthold couldn't help but notice the young woman again. This time, they made eye contact, and for a fleeting moment, he felt like he was back in those idyllic summers, surrounded by laughter and possibility. He smiled to himself, wondering if maybe – just maybe – this chance encounter might lead to something more than just a change in his family's history.
