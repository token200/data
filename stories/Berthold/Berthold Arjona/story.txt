Berthold Arjona stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small town before him. The once-thriving community now seemed frozen in time, its streets lined with buildings that told a story of better days. Berthold, a seasoned adventurer and explorer, had heard whispers of this forgotten corner of the world.

As he made his way through the quiet streets, Berthold couldn't help but think of his full name: Berthold Arjona, son of the legendary archaeologist, Leonidas Arjona. His father's tales of hidden cities and lost civilizations had sparked a fire within him, driving him to follow in his footsteps.

Berthold's thoughts were interrupted by the soft voice behind him. "Can I help you?" It was an elderly woman, her eyes twinkling with curiosity as she watched Berthold gaze out at the town. "You're not from around here, are you?"

"No," Berthold replied, turning to face her. "I'm looking for something. A artifact, perhaps."

The old woman's expression changed, and she nodded knowingly. "Ah, I see. You must be looking for the ancient ruins of Zanar. My late husband used to tell me stories about those places when we were young."

Berthold's heart skipped a beat as he heard the mention of his father's favorite destination. "Zanar? Do you know where they are?"

The woman smiled, and with a gentle nod, she handed Berthold a worn map. "Be careful, Berthold Arjona, son of Leonidas. The ruins are said to be cursed."

Berthold took the map, his eyes scanning the faded markings as he felt a shiver run down his spine. He knew that this was just the beginning of an adventure that would take him deeper into the unknown. With the map clutched tightly in his hand, Berthold set off towards the ancient ruins, ready to face whatever lay ahead.

As he walked, the wind carried whispers of Zanar's secrets on its breeze, drawing Berthold Arjona, son of Leonidas Arjona, ever closer to uncovering the mysteries hidden within those forgotten walls.
