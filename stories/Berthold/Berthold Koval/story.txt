Berthold Koval was a man shrouded in mystery. His rugged, weathered face seemed chiseled from the very stone that formed the rolling hills of his family's ancestral homeland. For years, whispers of his exploits had circulated among the rural communities, where folk spoke of him with a mixture of awe and trepidation.

Rumors claimed that Berthold was a skilled hunter, able to track and slay beasts with an uncanny ease that bordered on the supernatural. Some said he possessed a magical connection to the natural world, while others whispered that he had made pacts with dark forces in exchange for his extraordinary abilities.

As a young man, Berthold had left his village to make a name for himself as a bounty hunter, tracking down outlaws and lost travelers who dared to stray into forbidden territories. His reputation grew, along with the stories of his exploits. They spoke of the way he could navigate the treacherous wilderness like a ghost, or the uncanny accuracy with which he could strike down his prey.

Years went by, and Berthold's fame spread far beyond the borders of his homeland. He became known as "The Ghost of the Steppe," a man feared and respected by all who knew him. His services were in high demand, and kings and queens from across Europe sought his expertise to deal with threats both magical and mundane.

Despite his reputation for ruthlessness, Berthold's heart remained steadfastly loyal to those he considered friends. He was particularly close to his sister, Helga, a gifted healer who had followed him on many of his adventures. Together, they roamed the world, taking on cases that few others dared to tackle.

One day, Berthold received an urgent summons from the Tsar himself, requesting his presence in Moscow to deal with a supernatural threat to the imperial family. With Helga by his side, he set out into the unknown, ready to face whatever dangers lay ahead. As they rode towards their destination, the wind rustling through his hair, Berthold felt an unshakeable sense of purpose. He was the Ghost of the Steppe, and this was what he was born to do.
