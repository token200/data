Berthold Garcia was a man consumed by his work. As the owner of a small, family-owned deli in New York City's Greenwich Village, he spent most of his days surrounded by the sights and smells of cured meats and freshly baked bread. His passion for creating the perfect pastrami sandwich drove him to experiment with different marinades and roasting techniques late into the night.

Despite his dedication to his craft, Berthold's personal life was a different story. He had given up on love after a string of failed relationships, each one ending in disappointment and heartache. His friends and family would often try to set him up with someone new, but he was too busy perfecting his deli recipes to pay attention.

One day, as Berthold was prepping for the lunch rush, a young woman walked into his shop. She had a quirky sense of style and an infectious smile that immediately caught his attention. She ordered a pastrami on rye with mustard and pickles, and Berthold found himself nervously watching her eat each bite.

As the days went by, the woman, whose name was Luna, returned to the deli again and again. Berthold would notice her lingering in the background, observing him as he worked his magic behind the counter. He began to wonder if she was interested in more than just his pastrami sandwiches.

One evening, as the shop was closing, Berthold mustered up the courage to approach Luna. "Can I get you something else?" he asked gruffly, trying to sound nonchalant. Luna smiled and replied, "Actually, yes. Can you teach me how to make a proper pastrami sandwich?"

Berthold's heart skipped a beat as he led Luna into the back of the shop. Together, they rummaged through jars of spices and baskets of bread, learning about the art of deli-making from one another. The hours flew by, and before Berthold knew it, the sun had set outside.

As the night drew to a close, Luna turned to Berthold with tears in her eyes. "I never thought I'd find someone who understands me," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. Berthold's heart swelled with emotion as he took her hand and replied, "You're not just understanding; you're the perfect topping."

From that day on, Berthold and Luna were inseparable. They worked side by side at the deli, experimenting with new recipes and sharing their laughter and tears. For the first time in his life, Berthold felt like he had found someone who truly got him – and his pastrami sandwiches.

As the deli's popularity grew, so did Berthold's heart. With Luna by his side, he was no longer just a man consumed by his work; he was a man with purpose, surrounded by people who loved him for who he was – including his imperfect, delicious pastrami sandwiches.
