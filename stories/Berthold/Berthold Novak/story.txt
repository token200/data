The final piece was a masterpiece by Maestro Rodriguez himself, one that Berthold Novak had always considered his crowning achievement. As the music swelled to its climax, Berthold Novak's eyes opened, and he stood up, raising his arms in triumph. The orchestra erupted into applause, and for a moment, Berthold Novak felt like he was standing on the shoulders of giants.
