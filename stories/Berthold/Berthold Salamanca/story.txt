Berthold Salamanca stood in front of the grand mirror, adjusting his signature purple vest for what felt like the hundredth time that day. As the infamous strategist and leader of Los Pollos Hermanos, he took pride in his appearance, knowing it was a reflection of his intellect and cunning.

His full name, Berthold Salamanca, echoed through the halls of the restaurant as his loyal employees went about their duties. They knew better than to question his authority or challenge his decisions, for they had witnessed firsthand the devastating consequences of his wrath.

As he made his way to the kitchen, the aroma of sizzling chicken and spices wafted through the air, teasing his senses. Berthold's eyes narrowed, his mind already racing with plans for his next move against his arch-nemesis, Hector Salas.

His rivalry with Hector had been a long-standing one, with both men engaging in a game of cat and mouse that spanned years. But Berthold was always one step ahead, using his intelligence and resources to outmaneuver his opponent at every turn.

As he sat down to enjoy a quiet meal before the lunch rush, Berthold's thoughts turned to his next move. He would need to be careful, for Hector had a reputation for being ruthless when pushed too far. But Berthold was not one to back down from a challenge.

He smiled to himself, feeling a sense of satisfaction wash over him. After all, it was in moments like these that he reminded himself why he had become the mastermind behind Los Pollos Hermanos. His full name, Berthold Salamanca, seemed fitting, for he was a man of strategy and cunning, always thinking several steps ahead.

The door to the kitchen swung open, and his head chef, Carlos, approached him with a concerned look on his face. "Berthold, we have a problem," he said, his voice low and urgent. Berthold's eyes locked onto Carlos', and for a moment, they just stared at each other before he spoke, his voice dripping with menace: "Tell me."
