Berthold Kwiatkowski, a former Polish boxer who once held the title of European champion, sat in his small flat, staring at the faded boxing gloves that hung from a hook on the wall. The soft glow of the evening sun cast a warm light on his weathered face, etched with lines and scars from years of taking hits in the ring.

Berthold's mind wandered back to his glory days, when he was the undisputed champion of Europe. He remembered the roar of the crowd as he stepped into the ring, his fists clenched and his eyes burning with determination. The rush of adrenaline that coursed through his veins before each fight still lingered in his memories, like a ghostly presence haunting him.

But life had taken its toll on Berthold since he retired from boxing. He had struggled to find work, and the once-sharp mind that had driven him to succeed now felt muddled and uncertain. His marriage had faltered, and his children had grown up and moved away, starting families of their own. Berthold's only companion was a worn-out copy of "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu, which he clutched to his chest like a talisman.

One day, as Berthold was sipping tea on the balcony, he spotted a young boxer training in the park below. The boy's sweat-drenched face and determined expression brought back a wave of memories, both bitter and sweet. Berthold watched as the boy executed a perfect jab-cross combination, his eyes locked on some invisible opponent.

For a moment, Berthold felt transported back to his own boxing days. He remembered the early morning training sessions, the endless sweat and exhaustion, and the thrill of victory. The weight of years began to lift from his shoulders as he realized that the art of war was not just about winning or losing – it was about perseverance, discipline, and the pursuit of perfection.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Berthold rose from his chair, took off his slippers, and walked down to the park. The young boxer looked up in surprise as an older man with weathered skin and scars approached him. "You're training hard, kid," Berthold said, with a warm smile. "I can see that in your eyes. Keep it up."

And so, Berthold Kwiatkowski began to mentor the young boxer, sharing his wisdom and expertise gained from years of experience. As he watched the boy train, he felt the ghostly presence return – this time, however, it was not a fleeting memory but a present companion that would stay with him for many more years to come.
