Berthold Kentaro was a man shrouded in mystery. His eyes gleamed with an unsettling intensity, as if they held secrets that no one else could see. His fingers were long and slender, perfect for weaving intricate patterns on his sketches.

As the son of a wealthy family, Berthold had grown up with every privilege imaginable. But he had never felt truly at home in his high-society world. He found solace in the art of drawing, using it to escape the stifling conventions that surrounded him.

At night, when the lights were dimmed and the house was quiet, Berthold would sneak away from his bedchamber and make his way to a secret room deep in the manor's labyrinthine corridors. This was where he spent most of his time, lost in the world of his sketches. He drew everything: people, buildings, landscapes – even the faces of those who had wronged him.

His subjects were always distorted, twisted into grotesque forms that seemed to writhe and twist on the page. It was as if Berthold's pencil had taken on a life of its own, revealing hidden truths about the world he inhabited.

Despite his talent, Berthold's art remained a secret, known only to a handful of people who had stumbled upon it in the dead of night. His family and friends saw him as a peculiar, reclusive child, prone to tantrums and mood swings. They had no idea that beneath the surface lay a mind sharp enough to dissect the very fabric of reality.

One fateful evening, Berthold's sketchbook was discovered by a curious maid named Lizzie. As she flipped through its pages, she felt an electric jolt course through her veins. The drawings were unlike anything she had ever seen – haunting, surreal, and mesmerizing.

Berthold watched from the shadows as Lizzie devoured his sketches with rapt attention. He saw something in her eyes that made him pause: a recognition of the hidden truths he had so painstakingly uncovered. In that moment, Berthold realized that his art was not just a form of escapism, but a key to unlocking secrets that lay beyond the veil of everyday reality.

And with Lizzie's discovery, Berthold Kentaro's secret room became no longer a sanctuary, but a launchpad for an extraordinary journey into the hidden corners of his own mind.
