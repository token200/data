Berthold Järv stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the small station with a mix of nostalgia and wariness. It had been years since he'd set foot in his hometown of Ås, Norway, but the memories still lingered like autumn mist on a cold winter's day.

As a young man, Berthold had been an apprentice to his father, a skilled woodcarver who taught him the intricacies of birch bark and the gentle art of shaping raw wood into something beautiful. But life had other plans for Berthold, and he'd left Ås to explore the world beyond its rugged fjords.

He'd traveled far and wide, working as a shipwright in Liverpool, learning the secrets of the sea from grizzled sailors who told tales of storms and sea monsters. But something about the solitude of the ocean had stayed with him, leaving an ache that he couldn't shake.

Now, Berthold stood in the station's worn waiting room, clutching a small suitcase as if it held the world itself. His thoughts turned to his father, who'd passed away a few winters ago, and to the village where his childhood memories had been forged.

The station master, a stout man with a bushy beard, nodded at Berthold from behind the counter. "Welcome back, son! We've missed you around here."

Berthold smiled wryly, feeling like a stranger in a strange land once more. "It's good to be home," he said, trying to sound convincing.

The master handed him a small package wrapped in brown paper and twine. "From your sister," he said quietly. Berthold unwrapped the package to find a beautiful piece of birch bark carving – his father's work.

Tears pricked at the corners of Berthold's eyes as he looked up at the master, who nodded sympathetically. "You're home now, Berthold Järv. Let us welcome you back with open arms."

Berthold smiled, feeling a weight lift from his shoulders. He knew that he still had a long way to go, but for now, it was enough to be home among the fjords and forests of Ås, surrounded by the familiar rhythms of the land.

As he walked into the crisp afternoon air, the mist on his face began to clear, revealing the contours of his homeland – rough-hewn, wild, and beautiful. Berthold breathed deeply, feeling a sense of peace settle over him like the gentle snow that blanketed the landscape in winter.
