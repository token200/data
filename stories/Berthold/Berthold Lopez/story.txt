Berthold Lopez was a man of few words, but when he spoke, people listened. As the owner of a small, independent bookstore in the heart of the city, he had built a reputation for being fiercely protective of his customers and staff.

One rainy afternoon, as the streets emptied, Berthold sat behind the counter, sipping a cup of coffee and watching the rain drizzle down the windowpane. The store was quiet, save for the occasional creak of the old wooden floorboards beneath the feet of passersby. It was moments like these that Berthold cherished, when he could finally take a break from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.

As he pondered his next move, the door swung open and in walked Emily, a regular customer who had become close to Berthold over the months. She smiled warmly at him, her eyes sparkling with excitement as she handed over a worn copy of "The Great Gatsby". Berthold's expression softened as he took the book from her, his eyes scanning the cover before locking onto hers.

"You know I love you," he said gruffly, his voice low and rough but full of affection. Emily laughed, taking a seat beside him at the small table by the window.

"I know you do," she replied, leaning in to whisper, "You're always so reserved with everyone else, Berthold Lopez, but I feel like I'm one of the only people who can see past your gruff exterior and touch the real you."

Berthold's face reddened as he looked away, but Emily just smiled knowingly. She had a way of making him feel seen, understood in a way that no one else did.

As the rain continued to fall outside, Berthold and Emily sat together in comfortable silence, lost in their own little world of words and books. It was moments like these that reminded Berthold why he loved running his bookstore so much â€“ it was more than just a business; it was a sanctuary for people like Emily, who appreciated the quiet, gentle soul beneath the gruff exterior.
