Berthold Németh was a man of contradictions. On one hand, he was a brilliant and reclusive academic, known for his groundbreaking research in the field of cryptography. His eyes gleamed with intensity as he pored over ancient texts and deciphered codes that had stumped scholars for centuries.

On the other hand, Berthold's private life was shrouded in mystery. Few knew that beneath his tweed jacket and spectacles, he harbored a secret passion for flamboyant fashion. He spent hours in front of the mirror, applying bold lip colors and heavy makeup, much to the dismay of his colleagues.

One fateful evening, Berthold received an invitation to attend a high-society gala at the city's most exclusive club. Despite his initial reservations, he couldn't resist the opportunity to mingle with the rich and powerful. As he donned his finest suit (which he paired with a bright red lip) and arrived at the club, he was greeted by a sea of familiar faces – including some of his academic rivals.

However, as the night wore on and the champagne flowed, Berthold's inhibitions began to fade. He found himself laughing and joking with ease, charming everyone in sight with his quick wit and razor-sharp intellect. For one fleeting moment, he forgot about his love of codes and ciphers and allowed himself to be seen as simply Berthold – a person, not just an academic persona.

As the evening drew to a close, Berthold was approached by a mysterious figure who introduced himself only as "V." V revealed that he too was a seeker of hidden knowledge, and that he had been tracking Berthold's work for months. The two struck up a conversation about cryptography and codes, leading to an impromptu meeting at 3 am the next morning.

As they sipped coffee in a deserted alleyway, V revealed himself to be none other than the infamous hacker collective known only as "Erebus." Berthold was both thrilled and terrified by the prospect of collaborating with such a mysterious organization. Yet, he couldn't deny the thrill that coursed through his veins – a sense of belonging to something greater than himself.

And so, Berthold Németh embarked on a new chapter in his life, one that blurred the lines between academia and activism. With V by his side, he set out to unravel the world's most complex codes, using his knowledge to bring about a revolution in the shadows of the digital age. The world would never know what lay behind Berthold's makeup, but they would soon learn that this academic's secrets were about to change everything.
