Berthold Piątek was not your average Polish nobleman. He had an unquenchable thirst for adventure and a penchant for getting into trouble. Growing up in the rural countryside, Berthold was always drawn to the stories of his ancestors - brave warriors who fought against invading armies and forged their own paths.

As a young man, Berthold left his family's estate to explore the world beyond the rolling hills and forests of Poland. He traveled to distant lands, meeting people from all walks of life and learning new skills along the way. But despite his many adventures, Berthold couldn't shake the feeling that he was meant for something more.

Years passed, and Berthold found himself at a crossroads. His travels had taken him to the great cities of Europe, where he had become known for his cunning and bravery. Yet, he knew that he needed a true challenge to test his mettle.

One day, while sipping ale in a seedy tavern, Berthold overheard whispers of a mysterious organization operating in the shadows. This group, known only as "The Order of the Red Hand," was said to be recruiting brave and resourceful individuals like himself. Intrigued, Berthold set out to uncover more information.

He tracked down a contact who led him to an abandoned windmill on the outskirts of town. There, he met the enigmatic leader of The Order - a woman known only as "The Archon." With piercing green eyes and raven-black hair, she presented Berthold with a choice: join their ranks or leave forever.

Berthold hesitated, weighing his options. But something about The Order's ideals resonated with him - the promise of power, the thrill of danger, and the freedom to forge his own destiny.

With a nod, he accepted the Archon's offer. And so, Berthold Piątek embarked on a new journey, one that would take him into the very heart of darkness. For in The Order of the Red Hand, there was no room for hesitation - only the pursuit of greatness, and the willingness to do whatever it took to achieve it.

As he walked away from the windmill, Berthold felt a shiver run down his spine. He knew that his life would never be the same again. The world had just gotten a whole lot bigger - and a whole lot more complicated.
