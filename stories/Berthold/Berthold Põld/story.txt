In the quaint Estonian village of Tartu, there lived a peculiar individual named Berthold Põld. Berthold Põld was known throughout the village for his extraordinary talent - he could craft the most exquisite wooden figurines with ease. His workshop, cluttered with half-finished projects and scraps of wood, was a testament to his dedication to his craft.

One day, a young girl named Liina approached Berthold Põld with a request - she wanted him to create a wooden owl for her birthday. Berthold Põld was taken aback by the request, but he accepted it without hesitation. As he began working on the owl, his hands moved deftly, shaping and sanding the wood into a majestic creature.
