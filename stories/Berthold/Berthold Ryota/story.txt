Berthold Ryota was a man consumed by his own darkness. A former detective, he had once brought solace to those in need, but years of dealing with the worst of humanity had left him hollow. His eyes, once bright and inquisitive, now seemed dull and lifeless, like two extinguished candles.

After a particularly brutal case had shaken him to his core, Berthold had walked away from the force. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was no better than the monsters he used to hunt. The weight of his own morality bore down on him like a physical burden, crushing his spirit with every passing day.

As the years went by, Berthold's life became a solitary existence. He lived in a dingy, cluttered apartment, surrounded by the detritus of his past: faded photographs, empty whiskey bottles, and scattered notes that spoke of a justice he could no longer uphold. His few remaining acquaintances whispered about him behind closed doors – how he'd lost his way, his passion for the truth extinguished like a dying flame.

And yet, on some nights, when the city outside was hushed and the shadows were long, Berthold would sit by the window, staring out into the darkness. He'd recall the case that had changed him, the one where he'd confronted a monster who had somehow managed to escape justice. The memory still seared his mind like an open wound.

As he sat there, lost in thought, a faint light flickered from across the room. It was the small LED lamp Berthold's niece, Emiko, had left for him on her last visit. A tiny beacon of hope, it reminded him that even in the depths of his despair, there were still those who cared.

Berthold rose from his chair, a faint determination creeping into his step. He made his way to a dusty old box hidden beneath his couch, containing a faded badge and a photograph of Emiko's smiling face. As he held the badge up to the dim light, it seemed like the first spark of hope in an otherwise dark world.

For a moment, Berthold felt the weight lift, ever so slightly. He remembered why he had once become a detective – to find justice, no matter how elusive. And maybe, just maybe, he could still find that spark within himself. With newfound resolve, he set out into the night, determined to find redemption in the shadows, one case at a time.
