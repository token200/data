I couldn't find any information on a person named Berthold Vargas Llosa. It's possible that this is a fictional character.

However, I can create a short story based on your request:

Berthold Vargas Llosa was a man of mystery and intrigue. A former detective with a reputation for being one of the best in the business, he had retired from the force to start his own private investigation firm. His offices were located in a nondescript building in the heart of the city, where he spent most of his days pouring over case files and sipping strong coffee.

Berthold's life was not without its secrets, however. He had a mysterious past that few people knew about, and those who did were sworn to secrecy. Some said he was once a member of an elite police unit, while others claimed he had connections to the city's underworld.

One day, a wealthy businessman named Henry arrived at Berthold's office with a plea for help. His daughter had gone missing, and he suspected foul play. Berthold listened intently as Henry recounted his daughter's final hours, his eyes narrowing behind his wire-rimmed glasses.

Berthold agreed to take on the case, and set out to follow in the footsteps of the missing girl. He scoured the city, talking to acquaintances and gathering clues. As he delved deeper into the mystery, Berthold began to uncover a web of deceit and corruption that went all the way to the top.

Despite his growing unease, Berthold pressed on, driven by a burning need to find out what had happened to Henry's daughter. He encountered shady characters, dodgy alibis, and cryptic messages, but with each new lead, he drew closer to the truth.

Finally, after weeks of investigation, Berthold cracked the case. The missing girl was found safe and sound, although shaken by her ordeal. Her father, Henry, thanked Berthold profusely for his services, and promised to keep his friend's involvement in the case a secret.

As Berthold watched Henry drive away, he couldn't shake the feeling that there were still many secrets lurking just beneath the surface of this seemingly ordinary world. He smiled wryly to himself, knowing that his work was far from over.
