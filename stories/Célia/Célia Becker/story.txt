Célia Becker stepped off the train and onto the platform, gazing out at the misty mountains that stretched as far as the eye could see. She had always been drawn to this small town in the countryside, where her great-aunt lived in a quaint little cottage surrounded by lush greenery.

As she made her way through the station, Célia's mind wandered back to her childhood days spent with her aunt in the city. Great-Aunt Colette Becker had been a source of comfort and guidance, teaching her the art of traditional cooking and the value of hard work.

Now, as an adult, Célia was returning to this place to help her aunt with the farm. She had left behind a successful career in marketing to pursue a simpler life, one that allowed her to reconnect with nature and herself.

As she walked up the path to her aunt's cottage, the scent of freshly baked bread wafted out into the air, making Célia's stomach growl with hunger. Great-Aunt Colette greeted her warmly, enveloping her in a tight hug. "Welcome home, chérie," she said, using the affectionate term that only family members were allowed to use.

Over the next few weeks, Célia settled into a routine of helping her aunt with the farm work and learning new recipes from the old cookbooks. She spent her days tending to the animals, harvesting vegetables, and experimenting with new flavors in the kitchen. As she worked, she felt a sense of peace wash over her, one that she had been missing for years.

One evening, as they sat down to a meal of roasted chicken and steaming vegetables, Great-Aunt Colette smiled at Célia and said, "You know, chérie, I think you're exactly where you're meant to be." Célia looked up, her eyes shining with tears. She knew that she had made the right decision in leaving behind the city life for this quiet, rural existence.
