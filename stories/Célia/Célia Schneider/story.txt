Célia Schneider had always been drawn to the world of art. As a child, she spent hours sketching and painting, losing herself in the vibrant colors and textures that surrounded her. As she grew older, her passion for art only intensified, leading her to pursue a degree in fine arts from one of Paris's most prestigious schools.

After graduating, Célia Schneider set out into the world, determined to make a name for herself as an artist.
