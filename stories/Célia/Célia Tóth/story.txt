Célia Tóth stepped into the bustling café, her eyes scanning the crowded room with a practiced air of detachment. As a renowned photographer, she had grown accustomed to being in the spotlight, but it was a double-edged sword – she craved solitude almost as much as she craved the rush of adrenaline that came with capturing the perfect shot.

Célia Tóth ordered a black coffee and made her way to the corner table, where she set up her camera and began to review her shots from the previous day's shoot. The clicking of the shutter was music to her ears, a symphony of creativity and precision that soothed her frazzled nerves.

Just as she was about to pack up and head home, a young woman with a striking resemblance to herself walked into the café. Célia Tóth's eyes narrowed – who was this doppelganger, and what did they want? The imposter sat down across from her, flashing a bright smile that sent a shiver down Célia Tóth's spine.

"Mind if I join you?" the woman asked, her voice husky and confident. "I'm Sophia, by the way."

Célia Tóth hesitated for a moment before extending her hand. "I'm Célia Tóth," she said, her tone even.

Sophia's eyes sparkled with curiosity as she took in Célia Tóth's sleek attire and poised demeanor. "I've always been fascinated by your work, Ms...?"

"Tóth," Célia Tóth supplied, her patience wearing thin. Sophia laughed, a throaty sound that sent Célia Tóth's instincts into overdrive.

As they sipped their coffee and engaged in conversation, Célia Tóth found herself drawn to Sophia – the way she moved with an air of effortless cool, the way she spoke with a confidence that belied her youth. It was disconcerting, to say the least.

Before she knew it, the café had emptied and the sun had dipped below the horizon. Célia Tóth stood up, tossing a few coins onto the table in payment for their drinks. Sophia caught her arm, holding her back with an unspoken understanding that lingered long after they parted ways outside the café's door.

As she disappeared into the night, Célia Tóth couldn't shake the feeling that her life was about to change – and not for the better.
