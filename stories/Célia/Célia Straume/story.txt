Célia Straume stood at the edge of the ocean, her feet planted firmly on the sandy shore. The waves crashed against the rocks below, their salty spray misting her skin as she gazed out at the horizon. She was a woman with secrets, with scars that told stories of her own.

As a former member of an elite special forces unit, Célia had seen her share of battles. But it was what came after that had left her changed forever. The memories haunted her still, like ghosts that lingered in the shadows.

Célia's past was marked by tragedy. She had lost loved ones, comrades who had given their lives for a cause she no longer believed in. And so, she had walked away, leaving behind the life she knew to start anew.

But the sea was not as forgiving as Célia thought it would be. The waves continued to crash against her, a constant reminder of the turmoil within. She felt like she was drowning, unable to escape the demons that haunted her.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the ocean, Célia closed her eyes and let the breeze wash over her. It was then that she felt it – a sense of peace, of tranquility that had eluded her for so long.

She opened her eyes to find a young girl standing beside her, staring out at the waves with a look of wonder on her face. The child's name was Lena, and she had wandered onto the beach in search of shells.

Célia watched as Lena skipped along the shoreline, collecting seashells and watching the sea creatures scurry for cover. For the first time in years, Célia felt a sense of connection to another person. It was as if the ocean itself was bringing them together, reminding her that there was still beauty in the world.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the sky ablaze with color, Célia reached out and took Lena's hand. "Let's build a shelter," she said, a smile spreading across her face. Together, they began to construct a simple home from driftwood and sand, one that would stand against the fury of the sea.

In that moment, Célia Straume felt like she was finally coming home. The ocean had washed away her scars, leaving behind a sense of peace and belonging. And as she looked at Lena, she knew that she would never be alone again.
