Célia Esther stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the smell of saltwater and seaweed filling her nostrils. She had been away for so long, and yet the air still held a familiar scent. The small coastal town of Évora lay before her, its whitewashed houses and narrow streets seeming to shrink from the sea.

It was here that Célia's father, Paulo, had grown up, and it was here that he had disappeared when she was just a teenager. She remembered the days spent waiting for news, the endless phone calls and visits to the local station, but nothing ever came of it. Her mother had left soon after, seeking a life beyond the confines of their small town.

Célia's eyes scanned the crowded platform, searching for a glimpse of familiar faces or places. The only person she recognized was the conductor, his worn face creasing into a warm smile as he handed her a bouquet of fresh flowers.

"Miss Célia," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "Welcome home."

She took the flowers, feeling a sense of disconnection wash over her. Home wasn't what it used to be, not anymore. Her father was gone, and she had spent years trying to fill the void with work, with distractions, but nothing seemed to stay.

As she made her way through the station, Célia felt like an outsider looking in. Everyone knew each other here; everyone knew every detail of their lives. But she didn't belong to this town anymore. She was a stranger in her own home.

The sea breeze whipped through her hair as she walked out of the station and into the bright sunlight. Célia's eyes followed the curve of the coastline, searching for some sign of her father's presence. It was a futile gesture, one that had failed her countless times before. Yet, it was all she could do.

She wandered along the beach, feeling the sand between her toes and the spray on her skin. The world was vast and unpredictable, but in this small corner of it, Célia felt trapped. As if the sea itself held secrets it would never reveal to her.

Eventually, exhaustion took its toll, and she settled down on a rocky outcropping, watching as the sun dipped below the horizon. She closed her eyes, the sound of the waves lulling her into a meditative state.

Perhaps, like the tides, Célia's life was constantly shifting, never staying still for long. Maybe it was time to learn to adapt, to let go of what she had expected and embrace what came next. As the stars began to twinkle overhead, she felt a glimmer of understanding – that her father might have been gone, but he would always be with her in this place, where sea met land and sky.
