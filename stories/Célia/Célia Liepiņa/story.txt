Célia Liepiņa stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. She had arrived in Riga, Latvia, weeks ago to stay with her aunt, but it still felt like a stranger's town. The crumbling architecture and narrow streets seemed to whisper secrets she wasn't quite sure she wanted to hear.

As she made her way through the deserted station, Célia Liepiņa's thoughts turned to the reasons she had come here in the first place. She was running from something, though what that was, she didn't entirely know. The memories of her past were hazy and fragmented, like a photograph left out in the rain.

She hailed a taxi and gave the driver an address in the Old Town. As they navigated the crowded streets, Célia Liepiņa felt a sense of unease creeping over her. She had always been drawn to the unknown, the unexplained, but this place seemed different. The air was thick with history and secrets, and she could feel it watching her.

The taxi finally dropped her off in front of a small, ornate church. Célia Liepiņa's aunt was waiting for her on the steps, a look of concern etched on her face. "Célia, I've been worried sick about you," she said, embracing her niece tightly.

Over the next few days, Célia Liepiņa settled into a routine with her aunt. They spent their afternoons exploring the city, visiting museums and galleries, and sipping coffee at tiny cafes. But despite the beauty of Riga, Célia Liepiņa couldn't shake the feeling that she was being pulled in different directions.

One night, as they sat on a bench watching the stars, Célia's aunt asked her about her past. "Tell me, Célia Liepiņa," she said gently, "what drove you to leave everything behind?" Célia hesitated, unsure of how to respond. The truth was, she didn't know herself.

As they sat in silence, a wind picked up, rustling the leaves and sending shivers down Célia's spine. She felt a presence around her, watching and waiting. And for a moment, she wondered if she had made a terrible mistake coming to this place.
