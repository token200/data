Célia Ayumi had always been fascinated by the world of ancient mythology. As a young woman with a passion for learning, she spent most of her free time poring over dusty tomes and attending lectures on the subject. Her friends often joked that she was destined for greatness, and they weren't far off.

As Célia Ayumi delved deeper into her research, she began to notice strange occurrences around her. She would find ancient artifacts in unexpected places, and experience vivid dreams filled with mythological creatures. It wasn't until she stumbled upon an old scroll hidden away in the library's archives that she realized the true extent of her connection to the world of mythology.

The scroll revealed that Célia Ayumi was a direct descendant of a long line of powerful priestesses who had served the ancient gods. According to legend, these priestesses were chosen for their unique ability to communicate with the divine, and to wield the power of the gods themselves. Célia Ayumi's eyes widened as she read the words, feeling a shiver run down her spine.

As news of her discovery spread, people began to seek out Célia Ayumi's counsel. They would come to her with their problems, hoping that she might be able to offer some guidance or solace. And Célia Ayumi, with her quick mind and kind heart, was always happy to help. But as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months, she began to realize that there was more to being a priestess than just offering advice.

Célia Ayumi started to feel a strange energy building inside of her. It was as if the gods themselves were stirring within her, waiting for her to unlock their secrets. And so, with trembling hands and a heart full of wonder, Célia Ayumi reached out to the divine, ready to unleash the power that had been hidden within her all along.
