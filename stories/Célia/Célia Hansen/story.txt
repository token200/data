After completing her degree, Célia landed an internship at a prominent news organization in the city, where she quickly proved herself to be a valuable asset to the team. She spent long hours pouring over documents, conducting interviews, and writing stories that exposed corruption and inequality.

One day, Célia received a tip about a local politician who was embezzling funds from public projects. Intrigued by the lead, she began digging deeper, following a trail of financial records and leaked documents that ultimately revealed a web of deceit and cronyism.
