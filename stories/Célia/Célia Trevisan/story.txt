Célia Trevisan stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. She had been away for weeks, traveling through Europe to escape the memories that haunted her. As she made her way through the empty streets, the faint scent of freshly baked bread wafted from a nearby café, drawing her in.

Célia Trevisan pushed open the door and slipped inside, taking a seat at the bar as the warm light spilled over her face. The barista, a young woman with a kind smile, asked what she could get for her, and Célia ordered a cup of coffee, black as the night that had driven her away.

As she sipped her coffee, Célia's gaze drifted out the window, where the rain began to fall in soft sheets. It was a sound that always brought back memories of home – of laughter and tears, of sunshine and storms. She closed her eyes, letting the sound wash over her, and felt the weight of her memories begin to lift.

Célia Trevisan had left this small town with a sense of purpose, determined to make a new life for herself in the city. But as she settled into her new routine, she found that the ghosts of her past lingered, refusing to be exorcised so easily. She began to question whether she would ever truly be able to escape.

The rain intensified outside, drumming against the pavement like a thousand tiny fingers. Célia Trevisan opened her eyes, feeling a sense of resolve wash over her. She knew that she couldn't outrun her memories forever, but perhaps she could learn to live with them – to find solace in the pain and the beauty of it all.

With a newfound sense of determination, Célia Trevisan finished her coffee, stood up, and stepped back out into the rain, ready to face whatever lay ahead. The storm raged on, but for the first time in weeks, she felt a glimmer of hope – that perhaps this time, she would be able to find her way forward, rather than just running from it.
