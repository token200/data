In the sweltering heat of ancient Rome, Célia Ulpius Traianus stood out among the crowded streets. Her long, curly brown hair was tied back in a neat bun, revealing a face that shone like polished marble. She was the daughter of a wealthy merchant, and her family's influence extended far beyond their humble abode.

Célia's life was one of luxury and refinement, with every aspect meticulously planned and executed. She spent her days studying philosophy under the tutelage of prominent scholars, and her evenings attending lavish parties hosted by Rome's elite. Despite her privileged upbringing, Célia harbored a deep sense of unease, as if there were a void within her that could never be filled.

As she navigated the labyrinthine streets, Célia's thoughts often wandered to the poet Ovid, whose works spoke directly to her soul. She longed to follow in his footsteps, to capture the essence of human experience on parchment. But her family's expectations were at odds with her artistic inclinations; they wanted her to marry well and secure a prosperous future for their merchant empire.

Célia Ulpius Traianus had other plans. Under the light of a full moon, she would sneak out of the house and lose herself in the city's winding alleys, allowing her imagination to run wild. She saw herself as a muse, a conduit for the divine, and Ovid's words became her guiding light.

One fateful evening, Célia stumbled upon a group of traveling poets, who were setting up their tents near the Tiber River. The leader, a charismatic figure named Aurelius, took notice of her curiosity and invited her to join them. For the first time in months, Célia felt like she had found her tribe.

As they shared their stories and verse under the starry sky, Célia realized that she did not have to choose between her family's ambitions and her own desires. With Aurelius and his cohorts by her side, she could forge a new path, one that would allow her to channel her creativity into something greater than herself. And so, with Ovid's words echoing in her mind, Célia Ulpius Traianus took her first step towards becoming the poet she was meant to be.
