Aisha Chiatti stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small Italian town before her. The air was thick with the scent of freshly baked bread and simmering sauce, transporting her back to her childhood summers spent with her Nonna in this very same village.

As she made her way through the cobblestone streets, Aisha's mind wandered to the reason for her return. It had been ten years since she'd left, chasing a career in finance on the other side of the world. But after the loss of her beloved Nonno, and the emptiness that followed, she'd found herself drawn back to this place, seeking solace in the familiar rhythms and routines of home.

Aisha's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her phone buzzing in her pocket. She pulled it out to find a text from her sister, Livia: "Hey, Amoretta! So glad you're finally here! Nonna is dying to see you."

Aisha's heart swelled as she read the words, feeling a mix of emotions: happiness at being reunited with the woman who'd raised her, but also a pang of sadness knowing that their time together was limited.

She made her way to Livia's small apartment on the outskirts of town, where a steaming plate of pasta and a vase of fresh flowers awaited her. Over coffee, Aisha caught up on the family news: Nonna's health had taken a turn for the worse, but she remained lucid and engaged, as always.

The next day, Aisha visited Nonna in the village hospital, where she found the elderly woman sitting upright in bed, surrounded by the photographs of Aisha's childhood. "Oh, bambina," Nonna said, her eyes shining with tears. "I'm so glad you're home. I've missed you so much."

As they spent the day together, reminiscing about old times and sharing stories of their lives since parting ways, Aisha felt a sense of peace settle over her. For the first time in years, she felt like herself again, unshackled from the responsibilities and expectations that had weighed on her.

Over dinner at Livia's apartment, Nonna took Aisha's hand and looked into her eyes. "Amoretta, you know what I want for you?" she asked, her voice weak but resolute. "I want you to be happy. Follow your heart, not just your head."

Aisha smiled, feeling a lump form in her throat. She knew exactly what Nonna meant: sometimes it takes getting lost to find our way back home.
