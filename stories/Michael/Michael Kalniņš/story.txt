Michael Kalniņš was a young and ambitious musician who had just moved to Los Angeles in search of fame and fortune.

He worked multiple part-time jobs to make ends meet while taking online courses and attending music workshops. Despite the challenges, Michael's determination never wavered, and he continued to hone his skills.
