Born Michael David Klein to a family of modest means, Mike (as he was affectionately known) had always been driven by a strong work ethic and a determination to succeed. He worked tirelessly throughout his youth, studying hard and saving every penny he could to invest in his future.

Through his work with the Michael D. Klein Education Foundation, Mike had made a tangible impact on the lives of countless young people. He had watched them grow into confident, capable leaders, armed with the knowledge and skills they needed to succeed in an ever-changing world.
