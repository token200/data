Michael Straume stepped off the crowded bus and onto the damp streets of Portland. As a freelance journalist, he was used to navigating unfamiliar neighborhoods in search of his next big story. But tonight, he wasn't here for work – he was on a mission to reunite with an old friend.

It had been years since Michael Straume last saw Emily, their childhood neighbor who had always been the more adventurous of the two. They had lost touch after high school, but when she reached out a few months ago, inviting him to meet up for dinner, Michael couldn't resist.

As he made his way through the crowded streets, Michael's mind wandered back to their childhood days spent exploring the woods behind their houses. Emily was always the one with the crazy ideas and fearless spirit, while Michael Straume was content to watch from the sidelines, taking notes on her escapades.

But as he approached the small cafe where Emily had said they would meet, a sense of nervousness crept over him. What if she didn't remember him? What if their friendship had faded like an old photograph left in the sun?

As he pushed open the door and scanned the room, his eyes landed on Emily, sitting at a table by the window with a glass of wine in front of her. She looked exactly as he remembered – bright-eyed and mischievous, with a scattering of freckles across her cheeks.

"Michael!" she exclaimed, jumping to her feet and embracing him tightly. "It's so great to see you!"

For a moment, the past just melted away, and Michael Straume was transported back to their carefree childhood days, exploring the woods and dreaming up fantastical adventures. As they hugged goodbye – this time for real – he knew that some friendships never fade, no matter how life takes them apart.
