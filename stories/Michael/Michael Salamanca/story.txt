Michael Salamanca was known to his friends and family as Mike, but to those in the know, he was also known as "Toro," the notorious hitman from Albuquerque, New Mexico. As a member of the ruthless Salamanca crime family, Michael had made a name for himself as one of the most feared men in the city.

But despite his tough exterior, Michael had a soft spot for those in need. He was fiercely loyal to his friends and family, and would stop at nothing to protect them from harm. His late brother, Victor Salamanca, had been a constant source of inspiration for him, and he often found himself thinking about the lessons Victor had taught him before his untimely death.

One day, Michael received a visit from an old acquaintance, who had a proposition for him. The man was in trouble, accused of embezzling funds from a local business. He begged Michael to help him, promising that he would be eternally grateful if only he could clear his name. Michael listened intently, weighing the pros and cons of getting involved.

After some deliberation, he decided to take on the case, using his vast resources and network of associates to build a defense for his friend. As they worked together, Michael couldn't help but think about Victor, who had also been in a similar situation before. He remembered the words of wisdom Victor had once shared with him: "A man without family is like a tree without roots - he's dead on the inside."

With this mantra in mind, Michael dove headfirst into the investigation, using his cunning and wit to unravel the web of deceit that had ensnared his friend. And as they worked together, Michael couldn't help but feel a sense of pride knowing that he was carrying on Victor's legacy.

In the end, Michael's efforts paid off, and his friend was acquitted of all charges. As he watched him walk out of the courtroom free man, Michael felt a sense of satisfaction wash over him. He knew that this was what it meant to be a true Salamanca - not just a hitman, but a guardian, protector, and friend.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Michael returned to his usual routine, ever vigilant and always ready for the next challenge. After all, as he often said to those who knew him: "I'm Mike Ehrmantraut... but you can call me Toro."
