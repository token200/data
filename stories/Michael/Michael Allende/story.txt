Michael Allende sat alone in his dimly lit study, surrounded by stacks of dusty tomes and scattered papers. He rubbed his tired eyes, trying to remember why he had agreed to meet this person in the first place. It wasn't often that he got requests for interviews or speaking engagements, especially not from someone claiming to be a huge fan.

The door creaked open, and a young woman entered, carrying a large portfolio case. "Hi, I'm Emily," she said, extending a hand. Michael took it, feeling a slight jolt of disappointment at the lack of enthusiasm in her voice.

"So, what's this about?" he asked gruffly, gesturing to the empty chair across from him.

Emily smiled brightly and pulled out a photograph. "I'm huge fan of your work, Mr... Allende?" she hesitated, as if unsure how to address him.

Michael sighed inwardly, knowing that his real name wasn't exactly widely known outside academia circles. He stood up, gesturing for Emily to sit down, and took her portfolio case from her shoulders. As he flipped through the pages, a mixture of frustration and annoyance grew inside him. The articles were shallow, the analysis overly simplistic.

"Ms. Jenkins," he said finally, using his real name, which Emily had revealed in passing during their brief introduction, "I appreciate your enthusiasm for my work, but I'm afraid this isn't exactly the kind of discussion I'd be interested in having."

Emily's smile faltered, and she looked at him with a mixture of disappointment and curiosity. "Okay, Mr. Allende," she said, using his full name once more. "What do you think about the current state ofâ€”"

"Actually, Emily, let me show you something that might change your mind," Michael interrupted, gesturing to a bookshelf behind her. He pulled down a leather-bound volume, adorned with strange symbols and markings.

As he opened the cover, a musty smell wafted out, and Emily leaned in closer, intrigued despite herself. For a moment, they forgot about the interview, lost in the depths of the text. It was then that Michael realized this chance meeting might not be such a waste after all.

The afternoon wore on, with Michael sharing his insights on various topics, from anthropology to philosophy. Emily listened intently, taking notes and asking thoughtful questions. As she packed up her things to leave, Michael felt a twinge of gratitude toward this unlikely fan.

"Thanks for the chat, Ms. Jenkins," he said as she departed, feeling a renewed sense of purpose in his work. Perhaps this chance meeting would prove to be more than just a waste of time.
