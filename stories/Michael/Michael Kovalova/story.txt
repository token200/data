Michael Kovalova stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the salty sea air filling her lungs. She had been away from London for weeks, but it felt like just yesterday she was standing in front of the familiar face of Buckingham Palace.

As a renowned detective, Michael had solved some of the most complex cases in the city's history. But this time, she wasn't here on business. This time, she was on vacation.

Her eyes scanned the bustling station, searching for the familiar figure of her best friend and colleague, Emily Patel. They were meeting up for lunch at a quaint little café nearby, and Michael couldn't wait to catch up with her.

Just as she spotted Emily's bright yellow scarf, a commotion broke out near the ticket booth. A young woman stumbled forward, clutching her purse and looking frantically around. "Has anyone seen my phone?" she asked, her voice shaking.

Michael instinctively stepped in, surveying the scene. She noticed that the woman was wearing a faint tattoo of a snake on her wrist - a tattoo that seemed all too familiar.

Without hesitation, Michael's mind went into detective mode. She had seen this same tattoo on a few suspects in the past, and it never boded well. "Do you remember where you last saw your phone?" she asked, already knowing the answer.

The woman thought for a moment before pointing to a small café on the other side of the station. Michael nodded silently and led the woman over. As they walked, Michael's thoughts were racing - was this some kind of setup?

When they reached the café, the woman frantically searched her purse once more, only to find it was empty. But as Michael scanned the area, she noticed a small piece of paper on the floor, caught in a gap between two tables.

She carefully picked up the paper and examined it - it was a receipt from a seedy bar on the outskirts of town. A bar that she had received intel about, just days ago.

Without breaking stride, Michael led the woman back to the station, her mind whirring with connections and theories. As they sat down at Emily's table for lunch, Michael couldn't help but smile - this vacation was already turning out to be more than just a relaxing break from work.

With a raised eyebrow, she mouthed to Emily, "Looks like I've got my detective hat back on."
