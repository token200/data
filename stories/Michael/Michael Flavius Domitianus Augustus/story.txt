In the scorching summer of 98 AD, Emperor Michael Flavius Domitianus Augustus sat on his throne, gazing out at the bustling streets of Rome. His piercing eyes, a trait shared by his illustrious ancestors, seemed to bore into the souls of those who dared approach him.

As he pondered the fate of the empire, a young scribe named Lucius approached him, quill in hand. "Your Imperial Majesty," Lucius began, "the Senate requests an audience with you."

Michael Flavius Domitianus Augustus inclined his head, and with a wave of his hand, summoned the senators to his presence. They poured into the throne room, their faces etched with concern.

"Gentlemen, I sense unease among us," Michael Flavius Domitianus Augustus declared, his voice like thunder on a summer's day. "Speak freely, but be warned: only the truth shall be revealed."

The senators exchanged nervous glances before speaking in unison. "Your Majesty, rumors spread of your increasingly erratic behavior and the fear that you may soon ascend to the gods themselves."

Michael Flavius Domitianus Augustus chuckled, a dry, mirthless sound. "Ah, they think me mad? Ha! I am the very embodiment of reason and justice."

The session continued, with each senator venting their fears and concerns about the emperor's growing paranoia and isolation. As the sun began to set over Rome, casting long shadows across the palace floor, Michael Flavius Domitianus Augustus rose from his throne.

"Gentlemen," he declared, his voice dripping with menace, "do not speak of such things again. I am your Emperor, and you will swear loyalty to me until the day of my passing."

The senators nodded hastily, their faces pale, as they whispered their oath of fealty. As they departed, Lucius lingered behind.

"Your Majesty," Lucius asked, "what drives you? What fuels this fire that burns within you?"

Michael Flavius Domitianus Augustus turned to the young scribe, his eyes flashing with intensity. "I am not driven by mortal passions, Lucius. I am driven by destiny itself. And when my time comes, Rome will tremble before me once more."

With a cold smile, Michael Flavius Domitianus Augustus dismissed Lucius, leaving the young man to ponder the emperor's words and wonder what lay in store for the empire under his rule.
