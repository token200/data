As a child, Thérèse would spend hours exploring the winding streets of Shimokitazawa, taking in the colorful murals and quaint shops that lined the way. She was particularly drawn to the traditional ukiyo-e woodblock prints, which she felt captured the essence of Japan's rich artistic history. As she grew older, her passion for art only intensified, and Thérèse Jie began to hone her skills in the studio of a renowned local artist.

Years went by, and Thérèse's talent continued to flourish. She spent countless hours studying the works of Monet and Van Gogh, incorporating their techniques into her own unique style. Her art was a fusion of East meets West, with bold brushstrokes and vibrant colors that seemed to pulse with energy.

One day, Thérèse received an invitation to participate in a prestigious group exhibition at a prominent Tokyo gallery.
