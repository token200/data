Thérèse Hoffmann stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station as if searching for something familiar. As she made her way through the deserted streets, the late afternoon sun casting long shadows behind her, Thérèse couldn't shake the feeling of restlessness that had been growing inside her for weeks.

She had left her life in Paris behind, fleeing the city's endless chaos and expectations to find solace in this quiet corner of France. Her family, who still lived in Paris, had grown concerned about her departure, but Thérèse was determined to carve out a new path for herself.

As she walked through the village, Thérèse noticed the curious glances from the locals, their faces etched with a mix of curiosity and suspicion. She knew that her name, Thérèse Hoffmann, would likely stand out in this small community - a name that was foreign to these people yet still carried an air of elegance.

Thérèse stopped at a small café on the outskirts of town, ordering a cup of coffee and sitting down at a worn wooden table. The owner, a gruff but kind-hearted man named Marcel, greeted her with a nod as she entered. "Bonjour, Mademoiselle Hoffmann," he said, using her full name with a slight bow.

Thérèse smiled wryly to herself - it was a habit that would die hard, no matter where she settled. She had always been accustomed to being called Thérèse, but her family and friends in Paris used the Germanic variant Hoffmann more often.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the village in a warm orange glow, Thérèse felt a sense of peace wash over her. This small corner of France might be foreign to her, but it was hers now - and she was determined to make it home.
