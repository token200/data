Thérèse Järvinen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the station for any sign of life. It had been years since she'd last set foot in Helsinki, and yet the familiarity of the city felt like a warm hug on a cold day.

As she made her way through the crowded streets, Thérèse's thoughts turned to the reason for her return: her mother's passing. Lydia Järvinen, her Finnish-Swedish mother, had been more than just a parent to Thérèse; she was her closest friend and confidante.

Thérèse's family had moved to Sweden when she was just a child, and she'd grown up speaking both Swedish and Finnish. Her parents had told her that their ancestors were from Helsinki, but it wasn't until she was an adult that she'd discovered the rich history and culture of her heritage.

As she walked through the city, Thérèse noticed the small details that reminded her of her mother: the way the sunlight filtered through the narrow streets, casting intricate patterns on the pavement; the smell of freshly baked karjalanpiirakka wafting from a nearby bakery; and the sound of traditional Finnish music drifting from a café window.

Thérèse's eyes welled up with tears as she thought about her mother's passing. They'd been close, despite their complicated past, and Thérèse knew that Lydia would want her to continue exploring her roots. She made a mental note to visit the Helsinki Museum of Contemporary Art, which featured an exhibit on Finnish-Swedish culture.

As she turned onto Sveavägen, Thérèse spotted a small café with a sign that read "Lydia's Favorites." It was as if her mother was calling to her, urging her to come inside and share a cup of coffee. Thérèse smiled, feeling a sense of peace wash over her.

She pushed open the door and stepped into the cozy café, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee greeted her like an old friend. The barista looked up and smiled as Thérèse approached the counter. "Koska?" she asked, referring to Thérèse's Finnish heritage.

Thérèse laughed, feeling a sense of belonging wash over her. "Mina äiti." I'm my mother.

The barista nodded knowingly, pouring Thérèse a cup of coffee and saying, "Lydia would be proud."

As Thérèse took her first sip, she felt a sense of closure and new beginnings. She knew that Lydia was watching over her from wherever she was, guiding her on this journey of self-discovery and cultural exploration. And with that thought, Thérèse felt like she could finally begin to heal.
