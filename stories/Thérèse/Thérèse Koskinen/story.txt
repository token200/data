Thérèse Koskinen sat alone in her small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and faded photographs. Her eyes wandered to the worn leather armchair where she spent countless hours lost in the pages of her favorite novels. She took a sip of her lukewarm tea, feeling the familiar comfort of routine.

Thérèse had always been an outsider among her peers. Growing up on the outskirts of town, she was content with the quiet rhythms of rural life. Her parents, though poor, instilled in her a love for learning and exploration. She spent most afternoons helping at the local library, devouring books by the likes of Tolstoy and Bronte.

As she grew older, Thérèse's interests shifted towards the mysterious and unknown. She devoured tales of spiritualism, mysticism, and the supernatural. Her friends whispered about her supposed "curiosities" – how she would often spend entire nights researching into séances and spirit communication.

Thérèse didn't bother with the gossip. Instead, she pored over texts on mediumship, practicing simple exercises to connect with spirits. She kept a journal, detailing each encounter – some vague, others more substantial. Among these entries was one particular name: Helena Blavatsky.

The enigmatic writer and spiritualist had left an indelible mark on Thérèse's mind. Her ideas about Eastern mysticism and cosmic forces resonated deeply with the young woman. In her late twenties, Thérèse began to experiment with mediumship in earnest, hoping to bridge the gap between worlds.

As she sat in silence, sipping tea and lost in thought, a faint whispering caught her attention – soft murmurs of names and dates that didn't belong to anyone known. Her eyes narrowed; the hairs on her arms stood on end. Thérèse closed her book, leaned forward, and called out: "Is there someone here?"

The whispers ceased.

A chill coursed through her body. For a moment, she was paralyzed with expectation – whether it was a genuine contact or mere hallucination, Thérèse didn't dare to say. She waited, ears strained for any hint of movement, but all remained still.
