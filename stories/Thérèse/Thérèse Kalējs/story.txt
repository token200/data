Thérèse Kalējs had always been a free spirit, never content to be tied down by conventional expectations. As a young woman growing up in a small town in Latvia, she felt suffocated by the narrow-minded views of those around her. She longed for adventure and excitement, and so she set out into the world, determined to make her own way.

Despite her carefree exterior, Thérèse Kalējs was not immune to the complexities of life. She had experienced heartbreak and loss, and struggled with feelings of loneliness and disconnection.

One day, while wandering through a bustling market in Paris, Thérèse Kalējs stumbled upon a small, quirky shop tucked away in a quiet alley.
