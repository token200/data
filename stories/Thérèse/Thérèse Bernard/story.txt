Thérèse Émilie Bernard was a woman of great conviction and compassion. Born in New Orleans in 1824 to a wealthy Creole family, she grew up with the privilege of attending some of the finest schools in the city. However, it wasn't until she met Jeanne Jugan, the founder of the Little Sisters of the Poor, that Thérèse's true calling began.

Thérèse was deeply moved by the conditions in which the elderly poor lived, forced to reside in squalid institutions with little dignity or respect. She knew that she had to do something to help. In 1841, at just 17 years old, Thérèse traveled to France to join Jeanne Jugan's congregation, and thus began her journey as a nun.

Over the next several decades, Thérèse dedicated herself to caring for the most vulnerable members of society - the elderly poor. She spent countless hours tending to their physical needs, listening to their stories, and offering comfort in their times of sorrow. Her selflessness and dedication earned her the respect and admiration of all who knew her.

Thérèse's work was not without its challenges. The Little Sisters faced opposition from many within the Catholic Church, who questioned the legitimacy of a congregation that aimed to care for those considered "poor" by society's standards. However, Thérèse remained steadfast in her commitment, and her conviction ultimately led to the growth of the congregation.

In 1877, Thérèse Bernard was one of the first women to be canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church. Her beatification was a testament to her extraordinary faith and selflessness. Throughout her life, she had shown that even the smallest acts of kindness could have a profound impact on those around her.

Thérèse's legacy lives on in the countless institutions she helped establish to care for the elderly poor. Her story serves as a reminder that compassion, empathy, and kindness can change the world.
