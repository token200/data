Thérèse Ozola stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of familiarity. It had been years since she'd set foot in this sleepy town, and yet, a sense of nostalgia washed over her as she breathed in the familiar scent of the nearby bakery.

As she made her way through the crowded streets, Thérèse Ozola couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt for leaving behind the life she'd built here. She'd always been the quiet one, content to observe from the sidelines while others took center stage. But after a chance encounter with an old friend, Thérèse Ozola found herself drawn back into the world she'd tried so hard to escape.

The bakery, still run by her mother, was bustling with activity as the lunch rush approached. Thérèse Ozola's stomach growled in anticipation of the flaky pastries and rich coffee that had been a staple of her childhood. As she pushed open the door, a bell above it rang out, announcing her arrival.

Her mother looked up from behind the counter, a warm smile spreading across her face as she took in Thérèse Ozola's dusty coat and tired eyes. "Bonjour, ma chère," she said, using the French endearment that had always been reserved for special occasions. Thérèse Ozola felt a lump form in her throat as she hugged her mother tightly, the scent of sugar and butter enveloping her like a warm hug.

Over lunch, Thérèse Ozola caught up with old friends and acquaintances, regaling them with stories of her adventures on the other side of the world. But as the afternoon wore on, she found herself drifting back to the quiet life she'd left behind, one that had been filled with comfort and routine. Maybe, just maybe, Thérèse Ozola thought, it was time to find a way to reconcile the two worlds within her.
