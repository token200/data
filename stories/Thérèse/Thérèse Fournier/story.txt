Thérèse Fournier stepped out of the crowded train station and onto the rain-soaked streets of Paris. Her long, dark hair was tied back in a neat knot, revealing a smattering of freckles across her cheeks. As she navigated through the throngs of pedestrians, her bright blue eyes scanned the faces around her, searching for a glimpse of familiar features.

It had been years since Thérèse Fournier last set foot in this city, and yet the memories came flooding back with each step. She thought of her childhood summers spent playing along the Seine, of laughter-filled nights spent with friends at a small café on Rue Cler. The weight of nostalgia threatened to overwhelm her, but she pushed on, determined to find what she had come for.

As she turned a corner onto Boulevard Saint-Germain, the faint outline of the Luxembourg Gardens came into view. Thérèse Fournier's thoughts drifted back to her time spent studying art there, surrounded by masterpieces and the quiet contemplation that came with them. She remembered the way the sunlight filtering through the trees had illuminated her sketchbook pages, the feel of graphite dust beneath her fingertips.

After a long pause outside the garden's gates, Thérèse Fournier took a deep breath and stepped forward, leaving the echoes of her past behind. The city seemed fresh once more, full of possibilities waiting to be uncovered. With a newfound sense of purpose, she made her way towards the café where she had planned to meet an old friend.

As she pushed open the door, the sound of laughter and conversation enveloped her, carrying with it the scent of freshly brewed coffee. Thérèse Fournier's eyes scanned the room, searching for the familiar face that would bring a smile to her own lips. It was there, nestled in a corner table by the window, that she spotted Sophie – her old friend and confidant. The reunion was far from expected, but it felt like coming home.

Thérèse Fournier smiled, feeling a sense of belonging wash over her. For the first time in years, she knew where she was going, and what she was searching for.
