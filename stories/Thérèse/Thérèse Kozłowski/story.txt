Thérèse Kozłowski was known for her striking resemblance to Frida Kahlo. She had the same piercing green eyes, dark hair, and vibrant smile that captivated everyone who laid eyes on her. But beneath her artistic façade, Thérèse harbored a secret: she was a master thief.

As a child, Thérèse grew up in a world of art and magic. Her grandmother, a mysterious woman named Ola, taught her the art of shape-shifting and deception. With Ola's guidance, Thérèse honed her skills, learning to weave intricate illusions and blend into any crowd.

One night, while on a solo expedition through the streets of Paris, Thérèse stumbled upon an exquisite painting hidden away in a dusty antique shop. It was a self-portrait of Frida Kahlo's sister, Cristina – a piece so rare that collectors were willing to kill for it. The price tag was too enticing to resist, and Thérèse found herself drawn into the world of high-stakes art theft.

Using her new identity as "La Vipère" (the viper), Thérèse became known among the Parisian underworld as a cunning thief with an uncanny ability to slip in and out of the shadows unnoticed. Her reputation grew, but so did the risks – she attracted unwanted attention from rival thieves, ruthless collectors, and even the authorities.

Thérèse's next target was a prized Impressionist painting by Claude Monet. She spent weeks researching, infiltrating galleries, and gathering intel on potential security measures. On a stormy night, she donned her La Vipère disguise and crept into the museum under cover of darkness.

As she slipped past guards and alarms, Thérèse felt Ola's presence guiding her hands, as if the spirits of the past were watching over her. The painting lay before her – its colors glistening like moonlight on rippling water. With a swift motion, she snatched it from the wall and vanished into the night.

Thérèse disappeared into the Parisian underworld, leaving behind only whispers of La Vipère's exploits. Her reputation grew, as did the mystery surrounding her identity. Some claimed she was a ghostly thief with supernatural powers; others whispered that Thérèse was an artist herself – one who painted masterpieces in secret.

As for Ola, the enigmatic woman from Thérèse's past? She smiled knowingly whenever anyone spoke of La Vipère's exploits, for she knew the truth: her student had taken on a life of her own, and nothing could ever contain the art that Thérèse Kozłowski was capable of.
