Thérèse Gagnon was a quiet and reserved individual who kept to herself, preferring the company of books to that of people. She spent most of her days working as a librarian at the local library, surrounded by stacks of dusty novels and ancient tomes.

Despite her reserved nature, Thérèse had a rich inner life, with a deep love for literature and learning. She was particularly fond of poetry, and would often spend hours lost in the works of Baudelaire and Verlaine. Her colleagues at the library had grown accustomed to finding her curled up with a book on her lunch break, often neglecting her own food in favor of devouring the latest issue of the Paris Review.

One day, a new student arrived at the university where Thérèse worked as a part-time instructor. She was a young woman named Sophie, who had come to study literature and was eager to learn from the best. As fate would have it, Thérèse's class was scheduled for the same time slot as Sophie's, and soon they found themselves sitting next to each other in the lecture hall.

Thérèse was taken aback by Sophie's energy and enthusiasm, but couldn't help being drawn to her warmth and kindness. As the weeks went by, Thérèse found herself growing more confident in class, and even began to share some of her own insights and opinions with the group. Sophie proved to be a supportive and encouraging partner, and the two soon developed a close bond.

As they worked together on a project, Thérèse was struck by how much she had been missing out on by keeping herself isolated. Sophie's presence in her life had brought light and joy, and she found herself grateful for their unlikely friendship. For the first time in years, Thérèse felt like she was truly being seen and heard, and it filled her with a sense of belonging that she had never known before.
