Thérèse Wiśniewska sat alone in her small Parisian apartment, staring out at the grey mist that rolled off the Seine. She was a woman of few words, but her eyes spoke volumes of the pain and longing that lay within.

As she sipped her tea, Thérèse's mind wandered back to her childhood in Poland, where she had grown up surrounded by the vibrant colors and lively rhythms of her family's small bakery. But life had taken a different turn when she was forced to flee, her parents' tragic deaths at the hands of the Nazis leaving her alone and adrift.

Thérèse had spent years rebuilding her life in France, but the scars of her past still lingered. She had tried to put on a brave face, to blend in with the crowd, but the memories refused to be silenced. The smell of bread wafting from the bakery on the corner brought tears to her eyes, and the sound of children's laughter sent shivers down her spine.

Despite her tough exterior, Thérèse was vulnerable, her heart heavy with the weight of her losses. She longed for connection, for someone to share her burdens with, but fear held her back. What if she let her guard down, only to have it shattered once again?

As the afternoon wore on, Thérèse's thoughts turned to a young woman who had recently taken up residence in the apartment next door. She had been watching her from afar, observing the way she laughed with abandon, the way she danced through life with reckless joy.

Thérèse wondered if this stranger might be the key to unlocking a part of herself that had long been frozen. Could she find the courage to let go, to allow someone else in? As she gazed out at the mist-shrouded city, Thérèse felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, it was time to start living again.
