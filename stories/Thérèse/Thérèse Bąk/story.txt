As a Polish-French artist, she had built a reputation for her thought-provoking works that explored the complexities of identity, culture, and belonging. Her paintings were like windows into alternate realities, inviting viewers to step into worlds both familiar and strange.

Born in Warsaw to a family of artists, Thérèse Bąk's creative journey began at an early age. She spent hours watching her parents work in their studio, mesmerized by the way colors blended and textures merged on canvas. As she grew older, her fascination with art only deepened, leading her to study fine arts in Paris.
