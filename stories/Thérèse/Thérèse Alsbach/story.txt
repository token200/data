Thérèse Alsbach stepped into the grand foyer of the old mansion, her eyes adjusting to the dim light after a long day of work in the garden. As she hung up her gloves, she couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over her. She had spent countless hours tending to the gardens, pruning flowers and training vines, and it showed.

Her employer, Mr. Jenkins, approached her with a smile on his face. "Thérèse Alsbach, I must say you've done an outstanding job this season," he said, his voice warm and sincere. Thérèse blushed at the praise, feeling a sense of gratitude towards the kind old man who had taken her in.

As she followed Mr. Jenkins to the dining room for dinner, she couldn't help but think about how far she'd come since arriving at the mansion five years ago. From being a poor, scrappy orphan with no prospects to becoming one of the most skilled gardeners in the country was no easy feat. But Thérèse Alsbach had worked tirelessly to hone her skills, pouring over books and seeking out mentors who could teach her the finer points of horticulture.

Over dinner, Mr. Jenkins asked her about her plans for the future. Thérèse hesitated, unsure if she was ready to leave the security of the mansion behind. But as she looked around at the sprawling gardens and the endless possibilities they presented, she knew that it was time to spread her wings. She had a dream of creating her own garden oasis, one that would bring joy and beauty to countless people.

As the evening drew to a close, Thérèse Alsbach felt a sense of purpose wash over her. She knew that she still had much to learn, but with Mr. Jenkins' guidance and support, she was ready to take on whatever challenges came her way. And as she retired to her small attic room, she smiled to herself, knowing that tomorrow would bring new opportunities and adventures in the world of gardening.
