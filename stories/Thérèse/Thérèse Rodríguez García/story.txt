"Ah, you're an artist too?" Thérèse Rodríguez García asked, her voice warm and encouraging.

Sophia nodded shyly, and Thérèse Rodríguez García took her under her wing. Together, they spent hours exploring the forest, collecting leaves and twigs for sketching, and watching the sunsets paint the sky with hues of gold and pink.
