Thérèse Neumann was born on April 2, 1898, in Münster, Germany. Growing up in a devout Catholic family, she was raised with strong faith and a deep sense of spirituality. As a young girl, Thérèse struggled with her health, suffering from various ailments that left her bedridden for much of her childhood.

Despite these physical limitations, Thérèse's spirit remained unbroken. She developed a profound devotion to God, spending hours in prayer and contemplation, often falling into deep trances. Her love for the Lord became an all-consuming passion, driving her to seek a deeper understanding of His will.

In 1916, at the age of 18, Thérèse Neumann received a vision from Jesus Christ Himself, calling her to join the Benedictine abbey of Bordesaux in France as a novice. Recognizing her unique vocation, the Mother Superior accepted Thérèse's request, and she began her novitiate.

Thérèse's time at Bordesaux was marked by intense spiritual growth and struggle. She faced numerous challenges, including bouts of illness and self-doubt, but remained steadfast in her commitment to God. Her determination earned her the respect and admiration of her fellow sisters, who came to see her as a shining example of faith.

In 1925, Thérèse Neumann's life took a dramatic turn when she began to experience strange physical phenomena. She developed an intense heat emanating from her body, which was later diagnosed as St. Anthony's Fire, a rare condition caused by an allergic reaction to the wool used in the abbey's clothing.

Despite this affliction, Thérèse continued to thrive spiritually, using her experiences to draw closer to God. Her writings and teachings became renowned throughout Europe, inspiring countless souls with her message of love and devotion.

Thérèse Neumann passed away on September 1, 1962, at the age of 64, but her legacy lived on. Her life's work continued to inspire generations, a testament to the power of faith and determination. As she once said, "I was never made for this world." And yet, it was precisely in this world that Thérèse Neumann left an indelible mark on humanity, forever changing the lives of those who knew her.
