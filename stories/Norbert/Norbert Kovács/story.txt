Norbert Kovács stepped into the crowded café, his eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. As he waited in line to order, he couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. This was one of his favorite spots in the city, a place where he had spent countless hours as a student, working on papers and sipping coffee with friends.

As he ordered his usual cappuccino, Norbert's gaze landed on an old friend, László, who was sitting at a table by the window. László caught his eye and smiled, beckoning Norbert over. He made his way through the crowded room, nodding to acquaintances along the way.

When he reached László's table, Norbert sat down and ordered another round of drinks for both of them. As they chatted, Norbert couldn't help but think about how far he had come since his university days. He had gone on to study law, earning a prestigious job at a top firm in the city.

László, now a successful writer, was regaling Norbert with stories of his latest literary endeavors. Norbert listened intently, impressed by László's talent and drive. As they talked, Norbert found himself reminiscing about their time as students, laughing at old jokes and sharing fond memories.

After a while, the conversation turned to more serious topics – politics and social justice issues that had been on Norbert's mind lately. He was passionate about using his law degree to make a difference in the world, and László offered words of encouragement and support. As they finished their drinks and prepared to part ways, Norbert felt grateful for the friendship and camaraderie that had endured through the years.

As he left the café, Norbert Kovács felt content, knowing that some things never changed – like the warm sense of community and connection he found in this special place. He looked forward to many more hours spent with László and other friends, sharing laughter and stories over coffee and good conversation.
