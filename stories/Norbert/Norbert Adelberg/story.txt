Norbert Adelberg was an unlikely hero. He worked as a janitor at the local museum, spending most of his days sweeping and dusting exhibits. But Norbert had a secret: he was an expert in forensic anthropology.

As a child, Norbert had spent countless hours watching documentaries on famous detectives and their cases. He devoured books on crime scenes and studied the work of renowned forensic anthropologists. Despite having no formal training, Norbert had developed a keen eye for detail and a knack for piecing together seemingly unrelated facts.

One fateful evening, as Norbert was sweeping the museum's entrance hall, he stumbled upon something peculiar. A small piece of fabric caught in a display case lock. It was a thread from an old velvet suit - but what caught Norbert's attention was the tiny pinhole hole in one corner of the fabric. The hole looked almost... deliberate.

Intrigued, Norbert began to examine the surrounding area more closely. He noticed that the nearby exhibit on ancient Egypt had recently been moved, and the display case had been left open for a longer period than usual. It was then that Norbert spotted a faint smudge of dust on one corner of the display case - similar to the dust around the entrance hall.

It dawned on Norbert: someone might have deliberately hidden evidence in plain sight. With newfound determination, he decided to investigate further.

That night, as the museum closed and the staff went home, Norbert snuck back into the building, armed with nothing but his trusty flashlight and a magnifying glass. He began to systematically examine every display case, searching for any inconsistencies or anomalies.

Hours later, as the first light of dawn crept over the horizon, Norbert stumbled upon the unthinkable: a human skeleton hidden behind a fake wall in one corner of the museum's basement.

Panicked, Norbert contacted the police and led them to the discovery. The skeleton was later identified as that of a long-lost art collector who had been murdered 20 years ago. As news of Norbert's bravery spread, he became an unlikely hero - not just for solving the crime, but also for proving that even the humblest of workers can make a difference.

From then on, Norbert Adelberg was known as the "Janitor Detective," and his remarkable skills were celebrated by everyone from museum curators to law enforcement officials. His small, overlooked contribution had unraveled a decades-old mystery - all thanks to the keen eye and sharp mind of this unassuming janitor extraordinaire.
