Norberto 'Papa Gene' Salamanca sat in his plush office, sipping his tea and surveying the city skyline through the floor-to-ceiling windows. As the infamous crime lord of Albuquerque's west side, he held a tight grip on the underworld, with everyone from low-level dealers to high-stakes traffickers bowing down to him.

A knock at the door interrupted his reverie. "Enter," he growled, his voice dripping with menace. The door swung open to reveal his loyal henchman, Victor. "What is it, Victor?" Norberto asked, setting his cup down.

"It's Mike Ehrmantraut, sir," Victor replied, a hint of tension creeping into his voice. Norberto's eyes narrowed. He knew that look; it meant trouble was brewing.

Mike, the gruff but effective cleaner and former cop, had been working for Norberto on and off for years, taking care of "problems" that required discreet handling. Norberto respected Mike's skillset, even if he didn't always like his methods.

Just then, another henchman burst in, looking frantic. "Sir, we've got a situation at the El Paso warehouse," he stammered. Norberto raised an eyebrow. He knew that the Ehrmantraut was not one to panic easily.

"I'll take care of it," he said, standing up from his chair. Victor and the others nodded in unison as Norberto strode out of his office, ready to deal with whatever Mike had gotten himself into this time.

As he approached the warehouse, he spotted Mike standing outside, flanked by two burly men. Norberto's eyes locked onto Mike, a silent understanding passing between them. This was going to be a fight.

But when the dust settled and the situation was under control, Norberto couldn't help but feel a begrudging respect for his former associate. Mike had saved him from a nasty bind, and that was something even Papa Gene Salamanca could appreciate.

With a nod, Norberto turned to leave, his mind already turning to the next challenge he would face. He knew that in his line of work, complacency was a luxury few could afford. And for now, he was ready to take on whatever Albuquerque threw his way.

As he walked away from the warehouse, a small smile crept onto Norberto's face. It was a rare sight, but one he allowed himself when it suited him â€“ and right now, it suited him just fine.
