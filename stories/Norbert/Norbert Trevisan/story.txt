Norbert Trevisan sat in his cluttered office, surrounded by stacks of dusty files and half-finished projects. As a private investigator, he had seen it all - the cheating spouses, the missing persons, the corporate embezzlers. But there was something about this case that had him stumped.

It started with a phone call from a frantic wife, claiming her husband had been acting strangely in the days leading up to his disappearance. She provided no details, but Norbert's instincts told him that there was more to it than just a simple kidnapping or run-in with debtors.

He spent hours poring over the husband's financial records, looking for any discrepancies or suspicious transactions. But every lead seemed to end in a dead-end. It was as if the man had vanished into thin air.

Just when Norbert was about to pack up and call it a day, he received a cryptic message from an unknown number. The text read: "Look again at the wife." At first, Norbert dismissed it as a prank, but something about the words resonated with him.

He decided to pay another visit to the husband's wife, this time armed with more questions and a healthy dose of skepticism. But what he found was anything but suspicious - she seemed genuinely distraught over her husband's disappearance.

It wasn't until Norbert noticed the faint scent of perfume on his jacket that things started to make sense. The woman claimed it was just a fragrance his wife often wore, but Norbert had seen enough to know better. It was a subtle clue, one that pointed to a deeper truth.

As he continued to investigate, Norbert uncovered a tangled web of deceit and betrayal. The husband's disappearance turned out to be staged, orchestrated by the woman herself in an attempt to collect life insurance payouts for themselves.

It was a shocking revelation, one that left Norbert wondering how he had missed it all along. But as he sat at his desk, surrounded by the chaos of his office, he couldn't help but feel a sense of pride - after all, it was cases like this that made him the best in the business.

Norbert leaned back in his chair, rubbed his tired eyes, and smiled wryly to himself. Another case closed, another puzzle solved. The game was never-ending, but one thing was certain: he would always be ready to play.
