Norbert Zawisza stood at the edge of the bustling market square, his piercing blue eyes scanning the crowds with an air of detachment. As a private investigator, he had grown accustomed to observing from afar, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

His gaze landed on a young woman, her raven-black hair tied back in a tight bun, as she haggled with a vendor over the price of a rare book. There was something about her that caught Norbert's attention - perhaps it was the fire in her eyes or the way her shoulders squared under the weight of her opponent's scrutiny.

As he watched, the woman's smile faltered, and she leaned in close to the vendor, her voice taking on a sharp edge. The vendor's face paled, and he hastily agreed to her terms. Norbert's curiosity was piqued; who was this woman, and what drove her to such determination?

Without thinking, Norbert pushed his way through the crowd, weaving past vendors and shoppers as he made his move. He slipped a small note onto the woman's hand, his fingers brushing against hers in the process.

"Looks like you could use some help," he said, flashing a disarming smile. "I know someone who can get you into that book for what you want."

The woman's eyes narrowed, but Norbert could see the faintest glimmer of interest behind them. She tucked the note into her pocket and turned back to the vendor, dismissing him with a wave.

"I think we have an agreement," she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "You can't sell that book for more than I'm willing to pay."

Norbert chuckled, impressed by her tenacity. "You're a negotiator, I like that."

The woman's smile returned, this time accompanied by a glint of amusement in her eyes. "I do what it takes," she said, and Norbert knew he was hooked.

Over the next hour, they haggled with the vendor, Norbert and the woman exchanging wits and sarcasm as they worked together to drive down the price. As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the square, Norbert finally extracted a name from her - Emilia Kowalska, a brilliant historian with a reputation for being unbeatable in negotiations.

With the book safely in hand, Emilia turned to Norbert and offered him a smile that left him breathless. "Thanks for your help," she said. "I think I owe you one."

Norbert smiled back, feeling an unexpected spark of excitement. "Anytime," he said. "After all, I'm always looking for someone to do business with."
