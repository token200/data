As he walked, a strange glow began to emanate from an alleyway nearby. Without hesitation, Norbert Hill strode towards it, his senses on high alert. The air around him seemed to thicken with an otherworldly energy, and he knew that he was closing in on something momentous.

Stepping into the alley, Norbert's eyes adjusted to the dim light, revealing a glowing artifact nestled among discarded trash.
