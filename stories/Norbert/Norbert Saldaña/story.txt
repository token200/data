Norbert Saldaña was a man with a passion for solving mysteries. A retired detective from Los Angeles, he spent his days pouring over old case files and searching for clues that had gone cold. His small, cluttered office in the city's Westside neighborhood was a testament to his dedication: shelves stacked high with dusty books, folders overflowing with crumpled papers, and a worn-out chair that seemed to sag under the weight of years.

One day, as Norbert sifted through an old file on a 20-year-old cold case, he stumbled upon a cryptic letter that had gone unnoticed for decades. The writer claimed to have information about a high-profile murder that had shaken the city's elite: the infamous "Black Swan" killing. The letter hinted at a web of deceit and corruption that went all the way to the top.

Intrigued, Norbert began to dig deeper. He spent long nights scouring the internet for leads, interviewing old contacts, and tracking down obscure informants. His colleagues at the LAPD had given up on the case years ago, dismissing it as a relic of the past. But Norbert was undeterred.

As he delved deeper into the mystery, Norbert started to experience strange occurrences: phone calls in the dead of night, whispered messages from unknown numbers, and an unshakeable feeling that someone was watching him. He began to suspect that his investigation had awakened a dark force, one that would stop at nothing to silence him.

Despite the risks, Norbert pressed on, driven by a fierce determination to uncover the truth. Weeks turned into months, with Norbert's life becoming increasingly entangled in the mystery. He encountered shadowy figures lurking in alleys, and cryptic symbols etched into walls seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy.

One rainy evening, as Norbert huddled over his latest research, a knock at the door broke the silence. He hesitated for a moment before opening it, revealing a hooded figure clutching a small folder filled with documents. The figure whispered a single phrase: "Meet me at the pier at midnight."

Norbert's heart skipped a beat as he took the folder and pocketed it. It was then that he knew he had finally cracked the code – and that his life would never be the same again.
