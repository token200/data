Norbert Balodis stepped into the dimly lit pub, his eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. As he made his way to the bar, he spotted a figure sitting alone in the corner, nursing a whiskey. It was Viktor, an old acquaintance who had been out of touch for years.

Viktor looked up as Norbert approached, a hint of recognition flashing across his face. "Norbert Balodis," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "Long time no see."

Norbert slid onto the stool beside him, ordering a beer as he introduced himself to the bartender. Viktor watched him with an air of curiosity, his eyes lingering on Norbert's worn leather jacket.

As they sipped their drinks in silence, Norbert couldn't help but notice the changes in Viktor over the years. His once-sleek jawline had softened, and a few strands of grey had crept into his dark hair. Yet despite these signs of age, there was still an air of quiet confidence about him that drew people to him like moths to a flame.

The silence between them began to feel oppressive, and Viktor finally spoke up, breaking the spell with a wry laugh. "So, Norbert Balodis, what brings you here tonight?"

Norbert shrugged, taking a swig of his beer. "Just passing through," he said, though he knew that wasn't entirely true. He had been running from something - or someone - for weeks now, and the weight of it was starting to bear down on him.

Viktor nodded sympathetically, his eyes never leaving Norbert's face. There was a deep understanding between them, one that went beyond small talk and surface-level conversation. As they sat there in silence, the air thick with unspoken words, Norbert knew he had found a kindred spirit in this stranger, someone who saw him for who he truly was - not just the persona he presented to the world.

The night wore on, and as the pub emptied out, Viktor stood up, his movements fluid and practiced. "I'll walk you home, Norbert Balodis," he said, offering a hand up from his seat.

Norbert accepted it gratefully, feeling a sense of solidarity with this stranger who had seen right through him.
