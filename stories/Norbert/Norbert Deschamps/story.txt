Norbert Deschamps stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the unfamiliar streets of the small town. He had been running from his past for years, ever since the night that changed everything: the night he saw his brother's lifeless body on the cobblestone streets.

As a teenager, Norbert was always the one who kept his family together, the voice of reason in a household torn apart by grief and anger. But when tragedy struck, everything fell apart. His parents were never the same, and Norbert became the primary caregiver for his younger sister, Isabelle.

Years went by, and Norbert's world shrunk to fit within those narrow streets. He worked at his family's bakery, learning the intricacies of bread-making from their father, who had been the one to teach him before he passed away too. The smell of flour and yeast brought back memories of happier times, but also filled him with a deep sadness.

But life has a way of surprising you, and Norbert's past finally caught up with him when Isabelle, now grown, sent word that their estranged father had left them a small inheritance. It was a sum that would allow them to leave the bakery behind and start anew.

Norbert stood on the platform for what felt like hours, weighing his options. He could take the money and start fresh somewhere else, or he could try to stay in this town, to hold on to what little sense of normalcy he had left.

As he watched, a young woman stepped onto the train behind him. She smiled at Norbert, and he felt a pang in his chest. It was as if she knew exactly what he was struggling with, that he wasn't alone. Without thinking, Norbert nodded, and walked towards her. "Mind if I join you?" he asked.

The woman's eyes sparkled as she smiled again, this time for him. For the first time in years, Norbert felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe it was time to face his past head-on, with someone new by his side. As they chatted on the train ride out of town, Norbert realized that sometimes, running from your demons is just as hard as facing them.
