I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Norbert Vargas Llosa. It's possible that this character does not exist or is not well-known.

However, I can create a story about a character with a similar name to you.

Meet Norberto "Norbie" Vargas Llosa, a charismatic and talented musician who had always dreamed of making it big in the music industry. Growing up in a small town in Colombia, Norbie was surrounded by the sounds of salsa and vallenato, which would later become the foundation of his unique sound.

As he grew older, Norbie began to play the guitar and write his own songs, inspired by the greats like Juanes and Shakira. He formed a band with his friends and started playing gigs around town, slowly building up a loyal following.

But Norbie's big break came when he was discovered by a talent scout at one of his performances. The scout was blown away by Norbie's energy and songwriting skills, and soon he was offered a record deal.

With the support of his family and friends, Norbie released his debut album to critical acclaim. The lead single, "La Vida es un Camino," shot up the charts and earned him a spot on the popular music show "El Fantasma." Overnight, Norbie became an overnight sensation in Colombia and beyond.

As he navigated the ups and downs of fame, Norbie never forgot his humble beginnings. He remained true to himself and his art, always staying connected to his roots. His sophomore album, "Amor y Desamor," was met with even greater success than his debut, solidifying his position as one of Colombia's most exciting new talents.

Years later, when asked about the secret to his success, Norbie would smile and say, "Gracias a mi familia y mis amigos, gracias al música que me ha permitido conectar con el mundo." ("Thanks to my family and friends, thanks to music that has allowed me to connect with the world.") He would pause for a moment, looking out at the sea of faces before him, and add, "Y gracias a mí mismo, por creer en mí cuando nadie más lo hacía." ("And thanks to myself, for believing in me when no one else did.")
