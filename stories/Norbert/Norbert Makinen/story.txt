Norbert Makinen stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of his missing friend, Lena. It had been three days since they'd last spoken, and Norbert's worry was growing by the hour.

As he waited in line to order a cup of coffee, Norbert couldn't help but think about the last time he'd seen Lena. They'd been studying together for their exam, pouring over notes and sipping on lukewarm tea. But when he'd gone to her dorm room to study for another subject, she'd been nowhere to be found.

Norbert had reported her missing to the university police, but so far, no one had any leads. His phone was blowing up with concerned messages from friends and family, but Norbert was at a loss. He knew Lena; she wouldn't just disappear without a word.

As he waited for his coffee, Norbert's mind wandered back to their conversation three days ago. They'd been arguing about something trivial – who knew? – when Lena had abruptly stood up and stormed out of the room. Norbert had assumed it was just a bad day, but now...

Just then, a figure emerged from the shadows near the corner of the café. It was a young woman with piercing green eyes, her hair tied back in a ponytail. She looked vaguely familiar to Norbert, but he couldn't quite place her.

The woman approached him, a small notebook clutched in her hand. "I think I might have some information about Lena," she said quietly. "Her name is Lena Andersson, by the way."

Norbert's eyes widened as he took in the details on the notebook. It was an address – one that belonged to a small cabin on the outskirts of town. Norbert felt a surge of hope. Could this be where Lena had gone?

Without hesitation, Norbert grabbed his jacket and followed the woman out of the café. They set off into the crisp winter air, their footsteps crunching through the snow. Where was Lena going? And what did she want from him?
