Norbert Kortajarena stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the desolate landscape. He had been traveling for days, driven by a restlessness that couldn't be satiated by the familiar comforts of home.

A native of the Basque Country, Norbert had always felt a deep connection to the land, but one that went beyond mere nostalgia. He was a seeker, always on the move, always searching for something more.

As he walked through the small town, Norbert noticed the looks he received from the locals. They were wary, even hostile, their eyes darting towards him as if he were an outsider. And perhaps he was. But Norbert knew that his presence here was no coincidence.

He had come to this place in search of a specific type of stone, one that only grew in these remote regions. It was said to have properties that could calm the mind and soothe the soul. Norbert's own experiences with mental illness had led him to believe in its healing power, and he was determined to find it.

After days of searching, Norbert finally stumbled upon a small quarry, hidden away from prying eyes. He approached the proprietor, an old man with graying hair and a weathered face, who eyed him warily but said nothing as Norbert presented his credentials.

As they worked together, extracting the stone from the earth, Norbert noticed that the old man seemed to be watching him more intently than necessary. He felt a shiver run down his spine, but pushed it aside, telling himself he was just tired.

But as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the quarry, Norbert saw something move out of the corner of his eye. The old man's face seemed to twist into a grotesque grin, and for an instant, Norbert thought he saw something else - a glint of gold, a spark of light.

The moment passed, leaving Norbert feeling unsettled. He knew then that this place was not what it seemed. There were secrets here, hidden beneath the surface like the stone he had come to find.

Norbert's quest was far from over, but he felt a sense of unease creeping in, as if he was walking into the unknown with his eyes wide open.
