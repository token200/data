Norbert Eglitis was a man with an unusual past, one that had shaped him into the person he was today. Born to a family of nomadic Romani people, Norbert had grown up traveling from town to town, learning new skills and taking on various identities.

As a young boy, Norbert had been fascinated by the world beyond his tribe's traditional ways. He spent hours listening to the stories of outsiders who passed through their campsite, mesmerized by tales of cities, schools, and jobs. When he turned 18, Norbert decided to leave home and explore the world on his own terms.

Norbert settled in Berlin, where he became a skilled craftsman, learning woodcarving from a local master. He spent his days creating intricate figurines and selling them at markets, earning enough money to support himself. Despite his success, Norbert felt restless, yearning for adventure and meaning beyond the mundane routines of daily life.

One day, while wandering through the city's streets, Norbert stumbled upon a small antique shop tucked away in a quiet alley. The owner, an elderly man with kind eyes, introduced himself as Herr Müller. Over cups of strong coffee, Norbert discovered that he shared a passion for history and storytelling.

Herr Müller took Norbert under his wing, teaching him about the city's hidden past and introducing him to other collectors and enthusiasts. As they spent more time together, Norbert found himself drawn into a world of vintage treasures and forgotten memories. He began to see his own identity as a kind of collage, woven from threads of Romani culture, German history, and Berlin's eclectic present.

Years passed, and Norbert Eglitis became known throughout the city as a master restorer and collector, with an eye for the unusual and the overlooked. Though he still roamed the streets at night, his heart was no longer on the move; it had found a home in the intricate patterns of Herr Müller's antique shop.
