One fateful evening, a distraught woman named Sophia approached Norbert with a plea for help. Her family heirloom, a priceless diamond necklace, had been stolen during a charity gala at their estate. Desperate to recover the stolen treasure, Sophia begged Norbert Bonnet to take on the case.

The case closed, Norbert returned to his office, already planning his next move. His reputation as a detective continued to grow, and those who knew him couldn't help but admire the man behind the mystery-solving machine â€“ Norbert Bonnet, the greatest detective of all time.
