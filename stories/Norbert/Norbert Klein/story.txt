Norbert Klein was an artist with a rebellious spirit, known for his bold and provocative works that challenged societal norms. Born in Berlin, Germany in 1896, Norbert grew up amidst the city's rich artistic heritage, but it wasn't until he discovered graffiti as a teenager that he found his true calling.

As a young man, Norbert became fascinated with the underground art scene in Berlin, particularly with the works of German Expressionist artists like Max Beckmann and Otto Dix. He spent countless hours studying their techniques and experimenting with different mediums, eventually settling on stencils and spray paint as his primary tools.

Norbert's early work was marked by biting social commentary, targeting issues like class inequality, racism, and militarism in Nazi Germany. His bold, graphic images of protests, marches, and demonstrations made him an instant sensation among Berlin's avant-garde crowd, but also attracted the ire of authorities who saw his art as subversive.

Despite the risks, Norbert continued to push the boundaries of his work, incorporating elements of collage and abstract expressionism into his signature stencil style. His bold, graphic images began to take on a life of their own, becoming symbols of resistance against an oppressive regime that seemed determined to silence him.

In 1933, as Hitler's Nazi party came to power in Germany, Norbert's art took on an even more urgent tone. He began creating works that explicitly critiqued the new regime, depicting scenes of chaos and destruction, and portraits of marginalized groups being forced into hiding or extermination camps.

As the Nazis tightened their grip on Berlin, Norbert knew he had to leave his home city to avoid persecution. In 1934, he fled to Paris, where he continued to create art that was both radical and deeply personal. His paintings and prints became iconic symbols of resistance against fascism, and his unique stencil style influenced generations of artists who followed in his footsteps.

Today, Norbert Klein is remembered as one of the most important and influential artists of the 20th century, a true original whose courage and conviction paved the way for future generations of rebels and activists. His art remains a testament to the power of creative expression, even in the face of overwhelming oppression.
