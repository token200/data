Norbert Chun-yi was known for his unwavering dedication to justice, a trait that had earned him both admiration and criticism from those who knew him. As the lead detective of the Hong Kong Police Department's Special Investigations Unit, Norbert had solved some of the city's most baffling cases, leaving many to wonder how he did it.

Despite his impressive record, Norbert was not without his flaws. His intense focus on his work often led him to neglect his personal relationships and health. His colleagues would sometimes joke that he was as thin as a blade, due to his constant late nights spent pouring over evidence and studying the smallest details of each case.

One fateful night, Norbert Chun-yi received an urgent call from an anonymous source claiming to have information about a notorious triad leader who had been evading justice for years. The caller was hesitant to reveal their identity, but seemed certain that they held crucial evidence against the triad's top figurehead, Victor Wong.

Norbert's instincts told him that this could be his biggest break yet. He poured all his energy into tracking down the source of the call, working tirelessly through the night to unravel a complex web of clues and connections. Finally, after hours of grueling work, he pinpointed the location of the caller - an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town.

With his trusty sidekick, Detective Wong, by his side, Norbert Chun-yi entered the dimly lit building, determined to bring Victor Wong to justice once and for all. What they found inside would change the course of Hong Kong's history forever, thanks to the relentless pursuit of truth and justice led by the unyielding detective.

As they closed in on their target, Norbert's mind flashed back to his early days as a young detective, full of determination and idealism. He had set out to make a difference, just as he did every time he took on a new case. And now, more than ever, his unwavering commitment to justice seemed like the only way forward.
