I couldn't find any information on a historical figure named Roberts Alighieri. However, I believe you may be referring to Dante Alighieri, an Italian poet from the Middle Ages.

Here's a 450-word short story based on the life of Dante Alighieri:

The city streets were narrow and winding, lined with ancient stone buildings that seemed to lean in, as if sharing a secret. It was Florence, 1300, and I, Dante Alighieri, walked among them, lost in thought.

As a young man, I had been a member of the White Guelphs, a group of nobles who sought power and influence through politics and poetry. But after my family was exiled from the city, I found myself alone, with nothing but my words to sustain me.

I walked along the Arno River, its waters flowing softly beneath my feet. The sun beat down upon my shoulders, warming me as I pondered the words of my beloved poet, Virgil. His voice echoed in my mind, guiding me through the labyrinths of hell and purgatory.

As I turned a corner, I saw her - Beatrice Portinari, the love of my life, the light that had once filled my darkness. Her face glowed like a star, shining brightly in the dimness of the city. I reached out to touch her hand, but she vanished into thin air, leaving me with nothing but memories.

I sighed and continued on my way, my thoughts consumed by the Inferno that lay ahead. The journey was long and arduous, fraught with danger and uncertainty. But I pressed on, driven by a desire to reach the highest level of heaven, to see God face to face.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the city in a golden glow, I spotted her again - Beatrice, standing at the entrance of the realm of souls, beckoning me forward with an outstretched hand. My heart swelled with joy and longing as I approached her, ready to face whatever lay ahead.

For in that moment, I knew that my words would be enough to guide others through the darkness, just as Beatrice had guided me. And so, I set to work on my epic poem, The Divine Comedy, a journey through the realms of hell, purgatory, and paradise, with Beatrice as my companion every step of the way.

As I wrote, the city faded into the background, and I was left alone with my thoughts and my words. And though the road ahead was uncertain, I knew that I would never be truly lost again, for I had found my guiding light in Beatrice, and my pen to chronicle our eternal love.
