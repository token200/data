Cristina Maria Roy was a force to be reckoned with in the art world. As a renowned painter, she had built a reputation for her bold and expressive works that captured the essence of human emotion. Her unique style, which blended elements of abstract expressionism and realism, had garnered international attention and accolades.

Despite her success, Cristina remained humble and grounded, crediting her upbringing in a small town in Mexico to her artistic influences.
