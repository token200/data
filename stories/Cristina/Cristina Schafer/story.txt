One day, as Cristina was working on a particularly intricate piece, she received an offer from a prominent gallery to feature her work in a solo exhibition. Overjoyed by the news, Cristina couldn't help but think of her late grandmother, who had always encouraged her love of art. Her grandmother's words echoed in her mind: "Follow your passion, Cristina, and never let anyone dull your sparkle."

With newfound determination, Cristina threw herself into preparing for the exhibition.
