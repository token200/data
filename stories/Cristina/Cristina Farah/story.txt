Cristina Farah stepped into the bustling streets of Rio de Janeiro, her eyes scanning the vibrant crowd with a mix of curiosity and caution. As a renowned artist, she had always been drawn to the eclectic energy of this city, but after years of living abroad, she was starting to feel restless.

Born Cristina Farah in Buenos Aires to a family of Argentine artists, Cristina had spent most of her life wandering between Europe and South America, capturing the beauty of each place on canvas.
