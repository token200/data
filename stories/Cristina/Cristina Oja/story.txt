Cristina Oja was known for her sharp wit and razor-sharp tongue, but beneath her tough exterior lay a heart of gold. As a successful businesswoman in her late twenties, she had built a reputation as one of the most ruthless players in the corporate world.

Despite her tough exterior, Cristina's soft spot was for stray animals, which she spent every spare moment volunteering at the local animal shelter. Her colleagues often joked that she was more comfortable around dogs and cats than people, and while it wasn't entirely true, there was some truth to it.

One day, while working late on a project, Cristina received an unexpected visit from her estranged father, who had been absent for most of her life. His sudden reappearance caught her off guard, and she found herself torn between her duty as his daughter and her own feelings of resentment towards him.

As they sat in the dimly lit office, Cristina's father poured out his apologies and explained why he had left when she was just a child. For the first time in years, Cristina saw her father not as a stranger, but as a person who had made mistakes and tried to make amends.

Over the next few hours, they talked long into the night, sharing stories and laughter, and Cristina began to see her father in a new light. She realized that she didn't have to be defined by their past, and that it was possible for people to change and grow.

As the night drew to a close, Cristina's father left as suddenly as he had arrived, leaving her with more questions than answers. But she knew one thing for sure - she would never forget this moment, or the person who stood before her now, with tears in his eyes and a heart full of regret. From that day on, Cristina Oja saw her life through different eyes, and her relationships with others began to change forever.
