Cristina Nagy stepped into the bustling caf√©, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Sofia, sitting at a small table by the window and made her way over. As she approached, Sofia looked up and smiled.

"Cristina Nagy, you look like you could use a cup of coffee," Sofia said, gesturing to the empty chair across from her.

Cristina sat down and signaled the barista for a latte. "I've been running on fumes all week," she admitted, taking a sip of her drink. "Work has been crazy."

Sofia nodded sympathetically. "I know how you feel. I've been feeling overwhelmed with my own projects lately."

The two friends chatted for a while, catching up on each other's lives and sharing stories about their latest adventures. Cristina Nagy had always been the more outgoing of the two, but Sofia had a way of drawing her out and making her feel heard.

As they talked, a group of rowdy patrons caught Cristina Nagy's attention. She nudged Sofia with her elbow and pointed to the group. "Those guys are trouble," she whispered.

Sofia followed her gaze and raised an eyebrow. "What makes you think that?"

Cristina leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. "I saw them arguing on social media last week. They're going to cause some kind of drama soon."

Sofia's eyes widened. "You're always so perceptive, Cristina Nagy. I don't know what we'd do without you keeping us out of trouble."

Cristina blushed, feeling a little self-conscious about her intuition. But she knew that sometimes her instincts were right on the money.

As they finished their drinks and prepared to part ways, Sofia reached out and put a hand on Cristina Nagy's arm. "Thanks for being such a great friend," she said. "I'm lucky to have you in my life."

Cristina smiled, feeling grateful for the friendship that had been there since college. She knew that no matter what life threw their way, Sofia would be there to support her. And Cristina Nagy was content knowing that she could do the same for her friend.
