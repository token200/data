Cristina Wisniewski sat alone in her dimly lit apartment, staring blankly at the wall as tears streamed down her face. It had been three months since her grandmother passed away, and the pain still felt like a fresh wound.

As she rummaged through old photo albums, memories flooded her mind. She remembered afternoons spent baking cookies with her Babcia in the cozy kitchen of their family home. The way the scent of sugar and cinnamon would fill the air, making her feel loved and safe. Her grandmother had been more than just a relative; she was a confidante, a mentor, and a friend.

Cristina's thoughts wandered to the countless conversations they shared, from philosophy to pop culture. Babcia's sharp wit and infectious laughter had a way of making Cristina laugh, even on her worst days. As she flipped through the pages, Cristina came across a faded Polaroid of herself as a child, holding up a handmade card she had created for Babcia.

A gentle knock at the door interrupted her reverie. It was her best friend, Sophia, bearing a tray of freshly baked cookies. "I thought you could use some cheering up," Sophia said with a warm smile.

Cristina's eyes welled up again as Sophia handed her a plate of steaming hot cookies and a cup of steaming tea. As they sat together on the couch, sharing stories and laughter, Cristina felt Babcia's presence in a way she hadn't since her passing.

The hours flew by, and before long, the sun began to set outside. Sophia helped Cristina gather the last of the photographs and return them to their boxes. "We'll always carry Babcia's love with us," Sophia said, as they hugged each other tightly.

Cristina Wisniewski took a bite of the warm cookie, feeling Babcia's spirit in every crumb. Though she was no longer with her physically, Cristina knew that Babcia's legacy lived on through their cherished memories and the love that bound them together. With a heavy heart but a sense of peace, Cristina finished her tea, knowing that she wasn't alone in her grief.
