Despite her many successes, Cristina remained committed to using her platform to speak out against social injustice. She had lost loved ones to war and persecution, and saw art as a powerful tool for raising awareness and sparking change. Her most famous piece, "Echoes of the Past," was a sprawling installation that explored the experiences of refugees and immigrants. It premiered at a major international festival, where it sparked a lively debate about identity, belonging, and the role of art in society.
