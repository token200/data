Cristina Hansen was known for her fiery spirit and sharp tongue, but beneath her tough exterior lay a heart of gold. A successful event planner in her late twenties, she had built a reputation for delivering flawless weddings and parties that left her clients breathless.

On this particular Friday evening, Cristina was preparing for the most important event of her career: the wedding of her best friend, Emma's sister, Olivia. As she meticulously arranged the last-minute details, her mind wandered back to her own life – or lack thereof. Despite her professional success, Cristina's love life remained a mystery.

Her phone buzzed with an incoming text from her sister, Sarah. "Hey sis! Just a heads up, there will be a lot of family at Olivia's wedding. Make sure you're ready for them." Cristina chuckled to herself; she was more than ready to handle the Hansen clan's antics.

As the big day arrived, Cristina took center stage, orchestrating the logistics with military precision. But amidst the chaos, she couldn't shake off the feeling that something was missing – a sense of belonging, perhaps? She had always been the glue that held her family together, but lately, it felt like she was drifting further and further away from their lives.

Just as Cristina was about to breathe a sigh of relief, Olivia burst into the room, frazzled. "Cristina, have you seen my bouquet?" The sudden outburst made Cristina laugh; this was what she was born for – putting together broken pieces, making beautiful chaos.

As the sun began to set on the wedding reception, Cristina stood at the center of it all, watching Olivia and her new husband exchange vows. She felt a lump form in her throat as she gazed around at the sea of familiar faces – Sarah, her mom, even her dad, who had grudgingly forgiven her for quitting college.

Cristina Hansen was more than just an event planner; she was a guardian angel, wrapping love and laughter around her family like a warm blanket. As she raised a glass to toast Olivia's happiness, Cristina couldn't help but wonder – what would happen if she wrapped that same warmth around herself?
