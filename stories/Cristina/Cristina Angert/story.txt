Cristina Angert stepped into the crowded coffee shop, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She had been searching for weeks, trying to track down her long-lost cousin, and finally, she had received a tip that he might be here.

As she waited in line, Cristina's mind wandered back to her childhood. Growing up in a large family with five siblings and no parents who ever showed up on time, Cristina had always felt like an outsider. But when her grandmother passed away, leaving her the family's small bakery, Cristina had found a sense of belonging among her cousins.

Cristina Angert, now a successful pastry chef herself, had always been close to one cousin in particular - Leo. The two had grown up together, exploring the city and sharing secrets. But after their grandmother's passing, Cristina had lost touch with Leo. She had tried reaching out to him over the years, but he had never responded.

As she waited for her coffee, Cristina noticed a figure sitting in the corner of the shop, sipping on a cup of black coffee. There was something familiar about him - the way his eyes crinkled at the corners when he smiled, the way his hair curled slightly at the nape of his neck.

"Excuse me," Cristina said, approaching the man's table. "Is this seat taken?"

Leo looked up, startled, and their eyes locked in a moment of pure recognition. "Cristina Angert?" he asked, his voice hesitant.

Tears pricked at the corners of Cristina's eyes as she smiled. "It's been too long," she said, sitting down across from him.

As they caught up on lost years, Cristina realized that some things never changed - Leo was still charming and funny, still the same boy who had shared countless adventures with her. And in this moment, surrounded by the bustling coffee shop, Cristina felt like she was home at last.
