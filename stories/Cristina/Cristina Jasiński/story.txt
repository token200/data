Cristina Jasiński stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar town. She had left Warsaw with little more than a suitcase and a vague plan to find herself in the small village of Żelazów, where her grandfather used to live.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Cristina couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness. It had been years since she'd returned to Poland after her mother's passing, and though her father was still living there, she felt like an outsider in his own home.

She walked for what felt like hours, her feet carrying her on autopilot as her mind wandered back to the life she'd left behind. She thought of her friends, her job, her old routine – all of it seemed so foreign now. The thought sent a pang of sadness through her chest, but she pushed it aside, focusing instead on the sense of adventure that had drawn her here.

As she turned a corner, a small sign caught her eye: "Żelazów – 5 km". Her heart skipped a beat as she quickened her pace. Could this be where her grandfather was buried? The village of Żelazów was famous for its stunning cemetery, where families would often hold memorial services and celebrate their loved ones' lives.

Cristina's eyes welled up with tears as she approached the entrance to the cemetery. She had always felt a deep connection to her Polish heritage, but in recent years, she'd found herself feeling disconnected from it all. Coming here felt like a chance to reconnect with a part of herself that she thought was lost.

As she made her way through the rows of weathered headstones, Cristina came across a familiar name: Jasiński. Her heart sank as she realized that this had to be where her grandfather's final resting place was located.

She found a bench and sat down, taking in the beauty of the cemetery around her. The stone beneath her felt cold and unforgiving, but it was there that Cristina finally allowed herself to break down. Tears streamed down her face as she thought about her grandfather, about her mother, about all the memories they'd made together.

For the first time in a long while, Cristina felt like she was home.
