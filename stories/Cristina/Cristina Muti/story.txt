Cristina Muti stepped onto the gleaming marble floor of the prestigious opera house, her eyes fixed on the stage where she would soon take center stage. As the lead soprano of the renowned Opera della Scala, Cristina was no stranger to the spotlight. But tonight was different. Tonight, she had a secret.

As she began to warm up her vocal cords, Cristina's mind wandered back to her childhood in rural Italy, where music was woven into the fabric of everyday life. Her mother, a talented pianist herself, had taught Cristina how to sing as soon as she could speak. The young girl would spend hours in the family's tiny garden, belting out opera tunes for the bees and butterflies that flitted about.

But as she grew older, Cristina realized that her love of music was not just about singing – it was also about storytelling. She devoured books by Dante Alighieri and Giovanni Boccaccio, mesmerized by the epic tales of love, loss, and redemption. And so, when it came time to choose a role for La Bohème, Cristina knew she had found her muse.

As the curtains drew open, Cristina's voice soared above the orchestra, transporting the audience to the bohemian world of 19th-century Paris. Her performances were always infused with passion and vulnerability, drawing out emotions that left the crowd breathless.

But tonight was different. Tonight, Cristina felt like she was hiding a part of herself from the world. She had been experiencing strange visions – fleeting glimpses of a life she knew not her own. The faces in her dreams were unfamiliar, yet strangely familiar. It was as if she was trying to recall a memory from a past life.

As the opera reached its climax, Cristina's heart pounded in her chest. Was it possible that this voice, born of music and storytelling, was also a vessel for something more? Something ancient, something mystical?

The final notes faded away, and Cristina took her well-deserved bow to thunderous applause. As she stepped offstage, a figure emerged from the wings – an elderly woman with piercing green eyes.

"Cristina Muti," the woman whispered, "your voice is not your own."

And with that enigmatic phrase, everything changed for Cristina. The opera singer's fate was about to take a dramatic turn, one that would unravel secrets and weave a new tapestry of sound – both within herself and before the world.
