Cristina Pētersons stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. She had been traveling for hours, and the familiarity of Riga's layout was a welcome respite from the chaos of the city.

As she made her way through the crowd, Cristina's mind wandered back to her grandmother, Jāzeps. He had taught her the stories of Latvia's history, of its people who had fought against the Soviet occupation. She remembered the way he would speak with passion, his eyes twinkling behind thick-rimmed glasses.

Cristina's thoughts were interrupted by a voice calling out her name. "Krišta! Ah, it's been too long!" A woman with short, curly hair and a warm smile rushed towards her, opening her arms for a hug.

"Āna, how are you?" Cristina asked, as she hugged her back.

"I'm doing well," Āna replied, pulling back to examine Cristina's face. "You look like you've seen a ghost."

Cristina smiled wryly. "I have been thinking about my grandmother a lot lately."

Āna nodded sympathetically. "I know how that is. My own grandparents passed away when I was young. But we can still learn from them, right?"

As they walked through the city, Āna told Cristina about her own research on Latvia's cultural heritage. She had been studying the way that traditional music and dance were preserved in modern times.

Cristina listened intently, feeling a sense of connection to this woman who was carrying on the legacy of their shared heritage. As they walked, the sound of traditional music drifted through the air - the mournful strains of the kriegeris, accompanied by the clicking of the krīštuvalks.

They stopped at a small cafe, where Āna ordered a plate of latka and a cup of strong coffee. Cristina sipped her own coffee, feeling grateful for this chance to reconnect with her roots.

As they ate and talked, Cristina realized that she had been given a rare gift - the opportunity to learn from someone who truly understood the significance of their heritage. And as she looked at Āna, she felt a sense of pride and connection to her own identity.

"This is exactly what I needed," Cristina said, finishing her coffee.

Āna smiled. "I'm glad I could be here for you."
