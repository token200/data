Cristina Mercier walked into the bustling café, her eyes scanning the crowded room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Emma, sitting in the corner sipping on a latte and waving her over.

As she made her way to the table, Cristina couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement wash over her. It had been months since they'd last caught up, and she was eager to hear about Emma's latest adventures.

"Cristina Mercier!" Emma exclaimed, jumping up from her seat to give her friend a big hug. "It's so great to see you!"

The two friends spent the next hour catching up on each other's lives, discussing everything from their jobs to their relationships and hobbies. Cristina was thrilled to hear that Emma had recently started taking photography classes, and she couldn't wait to see her portfolio.

As they chatted, a tall, dark-haired man walked into the café and caught Cristina's eye. She felt a flutter in her chest as he smiled and made his way over to their table. "Mind if I join you?" he asked, introducing himself as Max.

Cristina Mercier shook her head, feeling a little flustered but trying to play it cool. Emma filled them in on the details of their conversation so far, and Max listened intently, asking thoughtful questions about everything from Cristina's favorite books to her childhood memories.

As they talked, Cristina found herself feeling more and more at ease with Max. There was something about his kind eyes and warm smile that put her at ease, and she couldn't help but feel drawn to him.

As the afternoon wore on, the three of them continued to chat and laugh together. Cristina Mercier left the café feeling happy and content, already looking forward to their next get-together. She knew that this was just the beginning of a beautiful friendship – or maybe something more.
