Jack Roy sat alone in his dimly lit study, nursing a whiskey on the rocks. The rain pattered against the windows like a relentless drumbeat, echoing the turmoil that churned within him. It had been five years since he'd last set foot in this place – his family's ancestral home in Scotland.

As a young man, Jack had always felt stifled by the expectations placed upon him. His father, a respected politician, had groomed him for greatness, but Jack's own desires lay elsewhere. He'd left to explore the world, to test his mettle against its challenges. But something had driven him back home.

The door creaked open, and a soft voice called out from the hallway, "Jack? I'm coming."

He didn't look up. "Ah, Mother," he said, his voice low and gravelly. His mother entered, her silver hair styled in a neat bob, her eyes tired but kind.

"I brought your favorite supper – haggis and mashed potatoes," she announced, setting a plate on the table beside him.

Jack waved a hand at the offering. "Thank you, Mother. But I think I've had enough for one night."

His mother hesitated, then sat down beside him. They ate in silence, the only sound the rain and Jack's quiet sipping of whiskey.

As they finished their meal, Jack's gaze wandered to a framed photograph on his desk – an old family portrait, taken decades ago. His father, younger than he was now; his sister, smiling with bright eyes that were now dull with age; and himself, full of life and purpose.

"Mother?" He asked softly, turning to her.

"Yes?"

"What did I ever do to deserve this life? This home?"

His mother placed a gentle hand on his knee. "You have two choices, Jack – the one you've always known, or a path you're just starting to explore. But know that no matter what lies ahead, you'll never be alone."

Jack's eyes stung with tears as he realized the depth of her love for him. In this moment, he understood that it was time to let go of the expectations and forge his own way.

"Thank you, Mother," he said finally, his voice cracking.

His mother leaned forward and kissed his cheek. "I'll always be here to support you, Jack – whenever you choose to come home."
