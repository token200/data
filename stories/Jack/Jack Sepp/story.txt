Jack Sebastian Sepp was no ordinary man. A former thief and con artist, he had seen it all - from high-stakes heists to small-time scams. But after a run-in with the law that left him with a broken ankle and a serious attitude adjustment, Jack had decided to leave his life of crime behind.

Or so he thought.

Jack worked as a security consultant, using his expertise to help corporations protect their assets from would-be thieves like himself. He was good at his job, but the temptation of easy money always lingered in the back of his mind.

One day, Jack received a call from an old acquaintance - a wealthy businessman named Marcus Blackwood. Blackwood had heard about Jack's security services and wanted him to investigate a potential robbery at one of his warehouses. The catch: the warehouse was located on the other side of town, and Jack knew that if he showed up alone, he'd be just another statistic in a long line of would-be thieves who got caught.

Jack arrived at the warehouse, accompanied by two burly guards and a handful of cameras. He surveyed the area, his eyes scanning for any signs of suspicious activity. As he searched, he noticed something odd - a small piece of paper stuck to the side of one of the crates.

He pulled it out, and a familiar symbol stared back at him. It was the mark of the Red Vipers, an infamous gang that Jack had crossed paths with in his earlier life as a thief. Suddenly, his instincts were on high alert. What was Blackwood hiding?

Jack's mind raced as he examined the symbol further. This wasn't just any ordinary robbery - it was personal. And Jack Sebastian Sepp was about to get pulled back into the world he thought he'd left behind.
