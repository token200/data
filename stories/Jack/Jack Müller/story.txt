Born Johann Gottfried Müller on a crisp winter morning in 1950, Jack had always been fascinated by the earth's secrets. Growing up in a small town nestled between two vast mountains, he spent countless hours pouring over dusty textbooks and listening to tales from his grandfather, a seasoned miner who had explored the depths of the local mines.
