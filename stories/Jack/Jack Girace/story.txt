Suddenly, the door burst open and in walked his trusted right-hand man, Marco. "Jack, we've received word from our sources that the billionaire collector is hosting an exclusive charity gala tonight," Marco announced, his voice laced with excitement.

Jack Girace's eyes sparkled with intrigue as he set his glass down on the desk.

The Shadow Syndicate had struck again, and Jack Girace was basking in the glory of it all.
