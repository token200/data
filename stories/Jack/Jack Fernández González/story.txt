Jack Fernández González stepped off the plane in Puerto Rico, his eyes squinting against the bright Caribbean sun. He had just finished a long stint as a journalist in New York City and was looking to escape the concrete jungle for a while.

As he made his way through customs, Jack's mind began to wander back to his childhood on the island. His abuela used to tell him stories of the old country – the lush rainforests, the crystal-clear rivers, and the vibrant markets that lined the streets. He had always been fascinated by the rich history and culture of Puerto Rico, but as he grew older, life in the city took over.

After a quick stop at his family's apartment in Santurce, Jack headed to his parents' old ranch in the countryside. The scent of freshly cut grass and baking empanadas filled the air as he pulled up to the house. His mother greeted him with open arms and a warm smile.

Over the next few weeks, Jack settled into a comfortable routine. He spent his days exploring the surrounding hills and valleys, learning about the old traditions from his parents. He also started working on a story about the struggles faced by small farmers in Puerto Rico – a topic that had been close to his heart since he began his journalism career.

As he sat at his desk, scribbling notes in a worn notebook, Jack felt a sense of peace wash over him. It was as if the island had finally come home – its rhythms and flavors were reawakening something deep within him. He thought about all the things he used to love when he was younger – snorkeling in Bioluminescent Bay, dancing to salsa music at the local club, and sipping coffee with his friends at a sidewalk café.

As night began to fall, Jack's mother called out from the kitchen window that dinner was ready. He made his way inside to find the delicious smell of arroz con pollo wafting through the air. They sat down together as a family, sharing stories and laughter – the kind that came from years of shared experiences.

As he looked around at his loved ones, Jack knew that this was where he belonged – in the midst of the lush greenery, surrounded by people who loved him with all their hearts. He realized that sometimes it takes leaving to find your way back home.
