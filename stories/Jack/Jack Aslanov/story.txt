Jack Aslanov stepped out of the misty evening air and into the dimly lit caf√©, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. It had been months since she'd last seen her old friend, Alexei Petrov, but rumors had been circulating that he was in town.

Aslanov spotted him sitting in the corner, nursing a cup of black coffee. She slid into the seat across from him, her long brown hair cascading down her back like a waterfall. "Alexei," she said, her voice low and husky. "It's been too long."

Petrov looked up, a hint of a smile on his lips. "Jack Aslanov, always a pleasure to see you." He reached out, extending a hand.

Aslanov shook it, feeling a spark of electricity run through her veins. They'd known each other since childhood, growing up in the same small town just outside Moscow. But their lives had taken very different paths after they left school.

Petrov was a journalist now, working for a prominent news agency, while Aslanov... well, that was a secret she kept hidden from the world. She worked as a freelance writer, taking on projects that needed a sensitive touch.

The conversation flowed easily, like they'd never been apart. They talked about everything and nothing, their words hanging in the air like mist. It was as if no time had passed at all.

But Aslanov couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that had been growing inside her for weeks. Something was off, something she couldn't quite put her finger on. She pushed it aside, focusing on the present moment.

As the night wore on, Petrov asked her about her latest project, a piece on corruption in the city's government. Aslanov hesitated, unsure if she should share more. But something about Petrov's eyes told her he was trustworthy.

"I'll need to see it," he said, his voice low and urgent. "I can help you get it published."

Aslanov smiled, feeling a sense of gratitude towards her friend. She knew that with Petrov by her side, she could face anything the world threw at her.
