Jack Lemoine trudged through the pouring rain, his long coat plastered to his back as he made his way to the local café. It was a drizzly evening in Paris, and he preferred it that way - the kind of night where nothing seemed to need saying.

As he pushed open the door, a bell above it rang out, and the proprietor looked up from behind the counter. "Jack Lemoine! Come on in, bonsoir," she said with a smile.

Jack shook his head, taking off his sodden hat as he stepped inside. The café was warm and cozy, filled with the scent of freshly brewed coffee and baked goods. He made his way to the counter, where Madame Dupont handed him a steaming cup of coffee without needing to be asked.

"Merci, Mademoiselle," Jack said, his voice low and gravelly from years of smoking.

Madame Dupont smiled knowingly. "You look like you've had a rough day, monsieur."

Jack snorted, taking a sip of his coffee as he slid onto a stool at the counter. He was a man who preferred to keep to himself, but there was something about Madame Dupont that made him feel at ease.

Just then, the door swung open and a young woman slipped inside, shaking the rain from her coat. Jack watched her as she approached the counter, taking in the way her eyes sparkled as she smiled at Madame Dupont.

"Un café, s'il vous plaît," the woman said, her voice husky and confident.

Madame Dupont raised an eyebrow. "And who might you be, mademoiselle?"

The woman hesitated for a moment before answering, "I'm Sophie, but please, call me so-fee."

Jack's interest was piqued as he listened to the way Madame Dupont asked follow-up questions and chatted with Sophie, trying to extract every detail about her. He couldn't help but notice the way Sophie laughed at something Mademoiselle said, or the way she smiled when Madame Dupont complimented her on her scarf.

As the evening wore on, Jack found himself drawn into their conversation, sharing stories and anecdotes that he hadn't shared with anyone in years. It was a rare moment of connection for him, one that left him feeling strangely exposed yet strangely at peace.

When Sophie finally left, promising to return soon, Jack felt a pang of disappointment. He turned back to Madame Dupont, who smiled knowingly. "You've got a soft spot for these girls, n'est-ce pas?" she said with a wink.

Jack shrugged, taking another sip of his coffee as he gazed into the flames of the fireplace. It was a truth he preferred to keep to himself, but Madame Dupont seemed to know him better than anyone else.
