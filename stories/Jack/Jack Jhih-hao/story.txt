I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Jack Jhih-hao. If you'd like, I can create a short story featuring this character. Please let me know what kind of story you're interested in (e.g. adventure, romance, mystery), and I'll do my best to craft an engaging tale.

If you don't have any specific preferences, here's a 400-word story about Jack Jhih-hao:

Jack Jhih-hao was a master thief known only by his nickname: The Ghost of Shanghai. With eyes that shone like polished jade and hair as black as the night sky, he moved with an uncanny silence through the crowded streets of old Shanghai.

No one knew where he came from or how he got his start, but rumors whispered that Jack had once been a humble street urchin who stumbled upon an ancient art of stealth and deception. Whatever his past, Jack's skills were undeniable – he could slip into a room unnoticed, snatch valuables from under the noses of the wealthy elite, and disappear into thin air.

One fateful evening, Jack received a message from a mysterious client offering him a lucrative job: steal a priceless artifact from the vaults of the Shanghai Museum. The catch? The artifact was said to be cursed, and anyone who tried to take it would never leave the museum alive.

Intrigued by the challenge, Jack accepted the job. Under the cover of darkness, he snuck into the museum, avoiding guards and security cameras with ease. As he made his way deeper into the labyrinthine vaults, a chill ran down his spine – he could feel the weight of ancient eyes watching him from the shadows.

Finally, Jack reached the artifact: a golden statue with an otherworldly glow emanating from its core. As soon as he touched it, the air around him seemed to thicken, and a low hum began to build in intensity. The museum's alarms blared to life, and Jack knew his time was running out.

With a flick of his wrist, Jack sent the statue hurtling through the air – but instead of catching it, he felt himself being pulled towards its pulsing core. In that instant, Jack Jhih-hao realized that maybe this curse wasn't so easily escaped after all...
