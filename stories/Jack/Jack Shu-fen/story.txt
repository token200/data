In the scorching summer of 1955, Jack Shu-fen, a young and ambitious journalist from Shanghai, received an assignment that would change his life forever. The Chinese Civil War had just ended, and the Communist Party was gaining momentum in mainland China. The once-vibrant city of Shanghai was on the cusp of transformation, with old-timers struggling to adapt to the new order.

As Jack navigated the winding streets of the French Concession, he noticed a peculiar man with a worn-out umbrella, clad in outdated clothing, and carrying an old suitcase. This stranger seemed out of place among the cosmopolitan crowd that had once thrived in Shanghai's international quarter. Jack sensed something intriguing about this enigmatic figure.

That evening, as he strolled through the rain-soaked streets, Jack stumbled upon a hidden alleyway where the man from earlier sat on a bench, his eyes fixed on some unknown point in the distance. Intrigued, Jack approached him cautiously and struck up a conversation.

To his surprise, the man introduced himself as Li Ming, an exiled writer who had fled mainland China during the Great Leap Forward campaign. Li shared with Jack the harrowing tales of China's brutal policies, the famines that ravaged villages, and the tragic loss of life. As they sipped tea under a cramped bridge, Jack discovered that his encounter with Li was more than chance; it was fate.

Over the next few weeks, Jack spent countless hours talking to Li Ming, listening intently as he spoke about China's turbulent history. Jack began writing articles, pouring out his emotions onto paper and penning stories of resilience in the face of oppression. His words ignited a fire that caught the attention of other refugees who had fled mainland China.

Together, they started an underground network called "Witnesses," where members would record testimonies from survivors, shedding light on the atrocities committed during China's turbulent past. As Jack Shu-fen and Li Ming worked tirelessly to gather stories, their words transcended borders and reached a wider audience, sparking hope in those who had lost faith in the world.

In 1957, Shanghai officially became a People's Republic of China, ushering in a new era for its residents. Jack Shu-fen stood alongside his fellow journalists, proud that they had played a part in shedding light on China's dark past, while Li Ming continued to write novels that captured the essence of human suffering.

Years went by, and Shanghai underwent another metamorphosis, but Jack never forgot his chance encounter with Li Ming. He returned to writing, this time chronicling the stories of those who had seen unimaginable horror, their voices now carrying a deeper meaning â€“ hope.
