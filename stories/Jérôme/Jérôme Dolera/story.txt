Jérôme Dolera was known for his wit and sarcasm, often leaving those around him both entertained and bewildered. As a writer and critic, he had made a name for himself in the literary world with his scathing reviews of lesser-known works.

One evening, Jérôme found himself at a dinner party hosted by a wealthy patron of the arts. The host, an old acquaintance from university days, had invited Jérôme to discuss the latest publications and share his expertise.

As they sipped their wine, Jérôme listened intently as the conversation turned to his latest review. "Ah, Jérôme Dolera's famous 'red pen'," the host said with a chuckle. "I'm not sure if you're being kind or cruel, old chap."

Jérôme raised an eyebrow, a hint of amusement dancing on his lips. "Kinder than cruel, I assure you. Someone has to tell these authors that their prose can be improved." He leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers together.

The host laughed, and the conversation continued. Jérôme's sharp tongue and quick wit kept everyone engaged, even if they didn't always agree with his opinions. As the night wore on, he found himself feeling more relaxed than he had all week.

At one point, the subject turned to a new novel that had been making waves in literary circles. "I'll be interested to see how Jérôme Dolera reacts to this latest offering," the host said, his eyes sparkling with curiosity.

Jérôme's expression remained neutral, but his mind was already racing ahead to the review he would write. He loved being the gatekeeper of sorts – separating the wheat from the chaff, as it were.

As the evening drew to a close, Jérôme stood up, his joints creaking in protest. The host smiled and clapped him on the back. "Thanks for coming out, old friend. We'll have to do this again soon." And with that, Jérôme Dolera departed into the night, ready to take on whatever literary landscapes lay ahead.
