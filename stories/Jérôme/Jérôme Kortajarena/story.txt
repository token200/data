I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Jérôme Kortajarena. It's possible that you may be thinking of a real person, such as Jérôme Kermabon or Jerome Courtney-Korean, but I was unable to find any information on a character by this name.

However, I can tell you about the Spanish singer-songwriter and dancer Jérôme Kergorels, also known as Jerome K (also sometimes spelled as Jerome Korre), or for that matter Jérôme Kortemeyer.

 Jérôme Kortemeyer was born on January 17th, 1994.
