Jérôme Adelberg was a man of mystery and intrigue. A former journalist, he had spent years working for the city's most prominent newspaper, but his sharp instincts and nose for scandal had driven him to leave in search of truth elsewhere.

Now, at the ripe age of forty-five, Jérôme found himself living on the outskirts of town, surrounded by nothing but scrubby bushes and worn-down buildings.

It was then that he heard the whispers – soft at first, but growing louder with each passing day. Whispers that hinted at a conspiracy stretching far beyond the dusty confines of his small town. Whispers that spoke directly to Jérôme's own name...
