He experimented with new recipes and techniques, always pushing himself to be better. And when he returned to Mülheim an der Ruhr, he decided to open his own restaurant, where he could share his love of food with the community.

The restaurant quickly became a sensation, attracting foodies from all over Germany. Jérôme's menu was a reflection of his diverse experiences, with dishes inspired by his travels and childhood. He served traditional German fare, alongside international delicacies, all made with love and care.
