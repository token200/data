Jérôme Järv was a man with an uncommon talent – he could communicate with inanimate objects. As a child, his parents had dismissed his claims as mere fantasy, but as he grew older, it became apparent that Jérôme's gift was all too real.

He would spend hours talking to the furniture in his family's antique shop, listening to their stories and learning about the people who had once owned them. The shop was a haven for him, filled with memories and whispers of the past.

One day, while arranging the shelves, Jérôme noticed an old clock that seemed out of place among the other items. As he wound it up, the clock began to speak in a low, gravelly voice, "I've been waiting for you, Jérôme. I've seen many hands set me back, but none as gentle as yours."

Intrigued, Jérôme started a conversation with the clock, learning about its history and the people who had owned it over the years. He discovered that it was crafted in Switzerland by a skilled horologist named Jacques, who had spent countless hours perfecting his craft.

As the days passed, Jérôme found himself returning to visit the clock more frequently, uncovering stories about Jacques' life and struggles. He learned about how Jacques had lost everything – his shop, his family, and his livelihood – all due to a catastrophic fire that had ravaged the city.

Moved by Jacques' tale, Jérôme began to help the clock's previous owners with various tasks, using its knowledge to fix antique mechanisms and restore damaged items. Word of his gift spread quickly, attracting collectors and enthusiasts from far and wide.

As time went on, Jérôme's relationships with inanimate objects deepened. He could sense their moods, understand their histories, and find ways to help them improve the lives of those who used them. Though he never revealed his secret to anyone outside of his family and a select few, his reputation as an "attuned" restorer spread far and wide.

Years went by, and Jérôme continued to communicate with objects from all walks of life – clocks, pianos, books, and even the occasional piece of furniture. And though his gift remained unique to him, it had created a network of connections between people, places, and things that transcended time and space.
