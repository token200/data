Jérôme Young stepped out of his worn leather jacket and onto the sun-baked streets of Marseille. The scent of fresh seafood wafted through the air, mingling with the salty tang of the Mediterranean. He took a deep breath, feeling the weariness of the day's journey slowly seep from his bones.

As he walked, Jérôme's mind wandered to the letter in his pocket. It was addressed to him, but there was no return address and only a single sentence: "Meet me at the Vieux-Port at midnight. Come alone." He had received it a week ago, on his way from Paris to Marseille. The mysterious message had been enough to prompt Jérôme to take a detour through this charming French port city.

As he turned onto Rue Grignou, the sound of seagulls filled the air. Jérôme's eyes scanned the crowded street, taking in the vibrant stalls selling everything from fresh produce to handmade crafts. He spotted a small café on his right and made a beeline for it.

 Inside, the aroma of rich coffee enveloped him, and he took a seat at the bar. The bartender, a gruff but kind-eyed man named Marcel, greeted him with a nod. Jérôme ordered a café noir and waited.

As he sipped his coffee, a figure emerged from the shadows near the window. Tall, with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair, she was dressed in a fitted coat that seemed to shimmer in the dim light. She slid onto the stool beside him, her presence both captivating and unnerving.

"Bonjour," she said, her voice low and husky. "I'm Sophie. I've been waiting for you."

Jérôme's gut told him something was off, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it. As they chatted, a connection forming between them that went beyond mere chance encounters, he began to feel an inexplicable sense of trust.

Sophie led him through the winding streets of Marseille, finally stopping at the edge of the Vieux-Port. The moon cast a silver glow over the water as she revealed her face, and Jérôme gasped in surprise – it was his sister, Colette, who had gone missing ten years ago.

As tears streamed down his face, Sophie took his hand, her eyes shining with an otherworldly intensity. "I've been searching for you, Jérôme," she whispered.
