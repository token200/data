Jérôme listened intently, nodding along and making thoughtful noises, his eyes lighting up with excitement whenever she spoke of her vision.

Over coffee and macarons, Jérôme offered Aurélie a deal: he would feature her work in an upcoming exhibition at his gallery, giving her a platform to showcase her talents to a wider audience. In return, she agreed to provide him with exclusive commissions for the next year, allowing Jérôme to further expand his portfolio and solidify his reputation as a pioneer of emerging talent.
