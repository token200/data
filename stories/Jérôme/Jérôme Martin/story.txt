Jérôme Étienne Martin was a man with a passion for restoring old cars to their former glory. Growing up in the French countryside, he spent countless hours tinkering with his father's vintage automobiles, learning the intricacies of mechanics and precision engineering.

As Jérôme Étienne Martin grew older, his love for classic cars only deepened. He pursued a degree in automotive restoration and eventually landed an apprenticeship with a renowned mechanic in Paris.

One day, a local museum approached Jérôme Étienne Martin with an unusual request: they needed someone to restore a 1962 Chevrolet Bel Air that had been donated to the institution. The car was in remarkably poor condition, but Jérôme Étienne Martin saw it as a challenge he couldn't resist.
