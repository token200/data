Jérôme Nowak was a name that commanded attention in the small town of Ashwood. As a child, he had always been fascinated by the supernatural and the unknown, often sneaking out of his bedroom window to explore the woods surrounding the village.

As he grew older, Jérôme's interests only deepened, leading him to study the occult and spiritualism at university. He became particularly drawn to the works of Edgar Allan Poe, whose dark and haunting stories seemed to speak directly to his own morbid fascinations.

After graduating, Jérôme moved to London, where he established himself as a successful paranormal investigator. His unique approach, which combined empirical research with intuitive sensibilities, quickly earned him a reputation as one of the leading experts in his field.

Despite his success, however, Jérôme's personal life was marked by tragedy. His younger sister, Colette, had died under mysterious circumstances when he was just a teenager, and he had never been able to shake the feeling that she had left behind some sort of unfinished business.

As Jérôme delved deeper into the world of the paranormal, he began to experience strange occurrences that seemed to be connected to his sister's death. Doors would slam shut on their own, and disembodied voices would whisper her name in the dead of night.

Despite his growing unease, Jérôme refused to give up on his work. He was determined to uncover the truth about Colette's demise, no matter how strange or terrifying it might be.

One fateful evening, as he sat in his dimly lit study surrounded by dusty tomes and flickering candles, Jérôme finally stumbled upon a clue that would change everything. A cryptic message scrawled on an ancient artifact revealed a shocking truth about Colette's fate, one that would leave Jérôme Nowak forever changed.

With the secrets of the paranormal now laid bare before him, Jérôme felt a sense of clarity wash over him, as if his sister had finally found peace. But at what cost? Only time would tell.
