Zoe Lāce, a free-spirited artist with a passion for the supernatural, stood at the edge of the old, weathered pier. The sun had long since set, casting a silver glow over the waves as they lapped gently against the wooden planks beneath her feet. She breathed in deeply, feeling the salty air fill her lungs, and closed her eyes, letting the sounds of the night wash over her.

As an avid believer in the mysteries of the unknown, Zoe had always been drawn to this place. Rumors swirled that it was once a hub for spiritual seekers, those who sought to tap into the power of the universe. Some said that on certain nights, when the moon hung low and the tides were just right, you could feel the presence of ancient energies stirring beneath the surface.

Zoe wasn't one to shy away from the unknown. She had spent countless hours poring over dusty tomes in the local library, searching for answers about her own family's history, which was steeped in myth and legend. Her grandmother, a respected healer and spiritual leader in their community, had passed down stories of ancestral spirits and the magic that flowed through the land.

Tonight, Zoe felt an inexplicable pull towards the water. She imagined herself floating on its surface, carrying the whispers of her ancestors to the depths below. The wind carried the faint scent of frangipani, a flower said to ward off evil spirits, but it only seemed to heighten her sense of unease.

Suddenly, a shadowy figure emerged from the darkness, walking towards her with an otherworldly gait. Zoe's heart skipped a beat as she opened her eyes to find a woman with skin like polished obsidian and hair that flowed behind her like a dark waterfall.

"You've been called," the woman said in a voice that resonated deep within Zoe's bones. "The spirits are restless, seeking your presence."

Zoe felt herself being drawn towards the woman, as if by an unseen thread. Without a word, she took a step forward, and then another, until she was standing before the obsidian-skinned woman, her heart pounding in time with the rhythmic lapping of the waves.

The woman reached out a hand and touched Zoe's forehead, and in that instant, the world around them dissolved into chaos. Colors swirled together in dizzying patterns, and Zoe felt herself being lifted from the pier, carried on a tide of energy towards some unknown destination.

When she opened her eyes again, she was back on solid ground, the woman nowhere to be seen. The pier lay deserted before her, except for a small note that had appeared on the wooden slats beside her feet – a single message scrawled in handwriting that seemed both familiar and strange: "Follow your heart, and you'll find your way home."
