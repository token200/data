Stephane Jain stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. As she waited in line to order her coffee, she couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. It had been months since she'd seen her sister, and the silence between them was starting to get to her.

As she reached the front of the line, Stephane Jain politely asked for her usual cappuccino, trying to shake off the feeling of nervousness that had settled in her stomach. She took a seat at a small table by the window, pulling out her laptop to work on her latest article.

Just as she was starting to get into a rhythm, a figure appeared beside her. "Stephane Jain?" a soft voice asked, making her heart skip a beat. It was her sister, Rachel.

For a moment, they just sat there in silence, the only sound the hum of the café's espresso machine. Stephane Jain finally broke the spell, forcing a weak smile onto her face. "Rachel," she said, trying to sound casual despite the emotions swirling inside her.

Rachel slid into the seat across from her, her eyes filled with a mix of sadness and understanding. "I'm so sorry it's been so long, Stephane Jain," she said, using her full name as if it was an old habit she couldn't shake. "I know I've been distant lately, but—"

Stephane Jain held up a hand, interrupting her sister's apology. "It's okay, Rach. I just needed some space, that's all." She took a deep breath, trying to gather her thoughts.

As they chatted, the tension between them began to dissipate, replaced by a sense of warmth and connection. They talked about everything and nothing, their conversation flowing easily as they delved deeper into each other's lives.

In the end, it was Rachel who broke the silence, reaching out to take Stephane Jain's hand in hers. "I'm sorry again, Stephane Jain," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. This time, there were no apologies needed – just a deep and abiding love between two sisters.
