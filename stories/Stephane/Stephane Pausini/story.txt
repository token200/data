I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Stephane Pausini. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created recently.

However, I did find information on Eros Ramazzotti and Phil Collins' song "Pi√π Belle Mesti", which features the lyrics 'Stephanie/Pauly' but does contain the name Stephane spelled slightly different.
