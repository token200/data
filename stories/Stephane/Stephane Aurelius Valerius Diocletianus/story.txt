The night wore on, and Stephane Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus knew it was time to return to his duties. Though he would one day rule Rome with an iron fist, in that moment, he was reminded that true power lay not in conquest but in understanding the intricate tapestry of human existence.

Years went by, and Stephane Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus ascended to the throne, leaving behind a legacy that would be remembered for centuries to come.
