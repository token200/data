Stephane's breakthrough exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City catapulted him to global fame. Critics praised his innovative use of color and texture, while collectors clamored for his unique pieces. Overnight, Stephane Kovacs became one of the most sought-after artists in the world.

As his star continued to rise, Stephane remained humble and grounded. He continued to live in Budapest, surrounded by the city's rich cultural heritage. He maintained a studio there, where he would often work on new projects alongside local artisans and craftspeople.

Stephane's art was not just about showcasing his technical skill; it was also a reflection of his deep connection to his homeland.
