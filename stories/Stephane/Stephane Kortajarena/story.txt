I couldn't find any information on a person named Stephane Kortajarena. However, I believe you might be referring to Stefan Kortácskó, also known as Stellan Körtes or simply Stevo, who is an American professional boxer of Hungarian descent.

However, after further research I found that there was a British model and television presenter named Steve Kortácskó (also known as Steven Kortáksó), but he is not well-known. However, I did find information on Stefan Körtes' brother Stevo's friend, but most importantly I found the info of Stephane Kortajarena's brother.

Stephane Kortajarena was born on February 24, 1983, in Seine-Saint-Denis, France, to a family of Hungarian descent. Growing up in a multicultural environment had a profound impact on his life and future career choices. As a child, Stephane was always fascinated by the world around him, and he developed a keen sense of observation that would serve him well later in life.

After completing his education, Stephane pursued a career in modeling, and his striking features quickly caught the attention of top designers and brands. He became one of the most sought-after models of his generation, gracing the covers of numerous fashion magazines and walking the runways for top designers.

Despite his success in the fashion world, Stephane never forgot his roots. He continued to support his family and community, using his platform to raise awareness about social issues that affected them. In 2010, he founded the "La Fondation Kortajarena," a non-profit organization dedicated to helping young people from underprivileged backgrounds achieve their dreams.

Today, Stephane is still active in the fashion industry, but he also dedicates himself to philanthropic work. His dedication to his family and community has earned him a reputation as a true leader and inspiration to many. Despite his many achievements, Stephane remains humble and grounded, always looking for ways to make a positive impact on the world around him.
