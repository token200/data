One day, Stephane received a call from an unknown number, offering her a chance to purchase a previously unseen work by one of the most elusive artists of all time. Intrigued, Stephane agreed to meet with the seller at a discreet location on the outskirts of town.

As she arrived, a figure emerged from the shadows, revealing himself to be none other than the artist's enigmatic nephew, Leon. With eyes that seemed to hold secrets of their own, Leon handed Stephane a small portfolio containing the promised work.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, they reached an agreement – a price that would make history and cement Stephane's reputation as one of the world's top art dealers. As she signed on the dotted line, Leon vanished into thin air, leaving Stephane with the portfolio and her next great challenge.

Stephane Nowak smiled to herself, knowing that this purchase would be the crowning jewel in her illustrious career. She made her way back to the agency, eager to share the news with her team. The call from Leon had been a gamble, but one that had paid off handsomely. As she walked into the office, portfolio in hand, Stephane knew that this was just the beginning of an epic adventure.
