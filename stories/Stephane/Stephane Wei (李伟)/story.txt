Stephane Wei, or Lee Wei as he was known to his friends and family back in Taipei, had always been fascinated by the mysteries of the universe. As a brilliant astrophysicist, he spent most of his career studying the behavior of black holes and dark matter.

Despite his success in his field, Stephane Wei couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more to life than just scientific theories and equations. He longed for adventure and excitement, something that would take him beyond the confines of his laboratory.

One day, while browsing through an ancient bookstore, Stephane Wei stumbled upon a mysterious tome bound in black leather. As he opened the book, he was shocked to discover that it contained ancient knowledge from a long-forgotten civilization. The secrets within the book spoke of a hidden world beyond our own, where stars and galaxies were but a mere illusion.

Stephane Wei's curiosity was piqued, and he became obsessed with uncovering the truth behind the mysterious book. He spent countless hours pouring over its pages, deciphering ancient symbols and codes. And then, one fateful night, it happened – Stephane Wei discovered that the book was more than just a simple artifact.

It led him to a secret portal hidden in the depths of his laboratory, which transported him to a realm beyond his wildest dreams. There, he encountered beings from other worlds, each with their own unique connection to the cosmos. The encounter changed Stephane Wei's perspective on life forever – no longer was he just an astrophysicist; he had become something more.

From that day forward, Stephane Wei roamed the universe, seeking answers and uncovering secrets. His name became synonymous with bravery and intellect, as those who heard of him whispered in awe of his incredible journey. Though he still wore a lab coat and wielded a calculator, few could tell if they saw Stephane Wei or Lee Wei – for to them, the boundaries between reality and fantasy had dissolved.
