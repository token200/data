Lina Andersen stepped into the small café, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of her friend. She spotted him sitting at a corner table, sipping on a cup of coffee and staring out the window. Lina made her way over to him, her heels clicking on the tile floor.

"Hey," he said, looking up as she approached. "Mind if I join you?"

Lina smiled and took a seat across from him. "Not at all."

The two friends fell into comfortable silence, enjoying their drinks and each other's company. Lina had known Max since college, where they'd bonded over late-night pizza and study sessions. Despite their vastly different majors - Lina was an English major, while Max was studying business - they'd remained close.

As they sipped their coffee, the conversation turned to their careers. Lina had landed a job at a publishing house just a few months ago, working on editing and proofreading manuscripts for aspiring authors. Max, meanwhile, had started his own consulting firm after completing law school.

"I never thought I'd say this, but I'm actually loving it," Lina said, shaking her head in amazement. "I was so sure I wanted to be a teacher or something."

Max chuckled. "You're still the same creative soul you've always been. You just found a way to express yourself that works better for your personality."

Lina smiled, feeling a sense of gratitude towards Max. He'd always known how to bring out her best qualities.

As they finished their drinks, Lina realized she needed some fresh air. She suggested a walk around the block, and Max agreed. The sun was setting, casting a warm orange glow over the city. They strolled in silence, taking in the sights and sounds of the evening rush hour.

Lina felt at peace with her decision to pursue editing. It allowed her to be creative without being too flashy or attention-seeking - traits that Max had always teased her about. But as she looked at her friend, she knew he saw her for who she truly was: a brilliant, insightful person with a quick wit and a sharp mind.

As they returned to the café, Lina leaned in and turned to Max. "You know what? I'm really glad we're friends."

Max smiled back at her. "Me too, Lina. We balance each other out pretty well."
