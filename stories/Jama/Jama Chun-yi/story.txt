She was a force to be reckoned with, this Jama Chun-yi, whose fiery spirit and quick wit had earned her a reputation as one of the city's most formidable k-pop idols.

As she walked into the trendy cafe, the barista couldn't help but do a double take. "Jama-sunbae!" he stuttered, bowing low in respect. Jama Chun-yi smiled sweetly, accustomed to the attention. She ordered a cup of matcha latte and settled into a corner table, her gaze sweeping over the eclectic decor.

As a member of the K-pop group "Rise," she had proven herself to be more than just a pretty face â€“ she was a talented songwriter, rapper, and dancer, capable of captivating audiences with her raw energy.

As she sipped her latte, Jama Chun-yi's thoughts turned to her upcoming concert, where she would perform an original song she had written especially for the event.
