Jama Korhonen stepped out of his small apartment, gazing up at the darkening cityscape. As a freelance writer, he was used to working alone, but tonight felt different. The streets seemed emptier than usual, and he couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching him.

A Finnish journalist by day and amateur sleuth by night, Jama had always been drawn to the darker side of Helsinki. He spent his free time scouring the city for stories, from crime novels to obscure historical events. But tonight's lead had piqued his interest like never before.

The cryptic message on his phone had read simply: "Look into the old hospital on Unioninkari." Jama's curiosity was piqued – he'd heard whispers of a long-abandoned psychiatric ward on the outskirts of town, but thought it was nothing more than urban legend. Now, something about the message felt too personal.

He hailed a taxi and headed towards the abandoned hospital, his mind racing with possibilities. As they drove, Jama's thoughts turned to his own history – his complicated relationship with mental health had always left him feeling like an outsider. He'd grown up in a family of immigrants, struggling to find his place in this strange new world.

The taxi dropped him off at the entrance of the hospital, where Jama was greeted by an eerie silence. The once-white walls were now covered in vines and moss, as if nature itself was trying to reclaim the space. He stepped inside, feeling a shiver run down his spine.

As he explored the deserted corridors, Jama stumbled upon an old patient file – dated 1955. A name caught his eye: Kirsikka "Kiki" Korhonen. His great-aunt, who had passed away just last week. The connection was too much to ignore.

Jama's eyes widened as a realization dawned on him. Someone knew about his family's past – and the message on his phone had been more than just a prank. He was onto something big, and he knew that nothing would ever be the same again.
