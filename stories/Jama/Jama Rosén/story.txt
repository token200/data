Jama Rosén, a young and ambitious journalist, had always been driven by a passion for uncovering the truth. Growing up in the vibrant streets of Stockholm, she was no stranger to the city's intricate web of secrets and lies.

As a reporter for the local newspaper, Jama spent most of her days digging through dusty archives and conducting interviews with sources who seemed reluctant to share their stories.

One day, while pouring over old police records, Jama stumbled upon a cryptic reference to a long-forgotten scandal that had rocked the city decades ago.
