Jama Rasmussen stepped into the crowded coffee shop, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of her missing friend, Emily. They had been inseparable since college, and Jama couldn't shake off the feeling that something was amiss.

As she waited in line to order her morning coffee, Jama's mind wandered back to their last conversation. Emily had seemed nervous and on edge, but Jama had brushed it off as mere stress from work. Now, with Emily nowhere to be found, Jama was starting to feel a sense of unease.

When Jama finally received her coffee, she decided to ask the barista if anyone had seen Emily. The young woman behind the counter shook her head, apologetic, but Jama thanked her for trying and continued on her way.

Determined to find Emily, Jama took out her phone and sent a text message to their mutual friend, Sarah. "Hey, have you heard from Emily lately? I haven't seen or heard from her since yesterday morning."

Sarah responded quickly, "No, I hadn't heard anything. Are you worried about her?" Jama hesitated for a moment before typing out a reply, "Yeah, I am. We're supposed to meet up tonight and she never showed up. It's getting really weird."

As Jama continued to search the coffee shop and surrounding streets, she noticed a faint smile on a stranger's face as he watched her from across the room. Suddenly, a chill ran down her spine - was this person following her?

Jama quickened her pace, but the stranger kept pace with her. She finally decided to duck into the nearby bookstore, hoping to lose him in the crowded aisles.

Once inside, Jama spotted Emily sitting at a table near the window, looking more nervous than ever. "Emily, what's going on?" Jama asked, her voice firm but concerned.

For a moment, Emily didn't respond, instead staring at Jama with an unsettling intensity. Then, in a low tone, she whispered, "I was followed. I think someone's been watching me for weeks."

Jama Rasmussen's heart sank as she took a seat across from her friend, feeling a sense of trepidation wash over her. She had always known that Emily had a troubled past, but this - this was something entirely different.
