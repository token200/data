Signe Chia-wei was a 25-year-old freelance writer living in Taipei, Taiwan. She spent her days sipping coffee and typing away on her laptop, producing articles for various magazines and blogs. Her work often focused on the intersection of technology and society, and she had developed a particular interest in the ways that social media was changing the way people connected with each other.

Despite her success as a writer, Signe struggled to find meaning in her life. She felt like she was just going through the motions, day after day, without any sense of purpose or direction. Her relationships were shallow and fleeting, and she often found herself feeling lonely even when surrounded by others.

One day, while working on a piece about the impact of social media on mental health, Signe stumbled upon an article by a psychologist who was studying the effects of technology on human behavior. The article mentioned the importance of taking breaks from screens and engaging in face-to-face interactions in order to maintain good mental health.

Inspired by the article, Signe decided to take a different approach to her own life. She started by setting aside device-free time each day, where she would put away her laptop and phone and engage in activities like reading, drawing, or practicing yoga. She also made an effort to connect with friends and family face-to-face, rather than relying solely on social media to stay in touch.

As the weeks went by, Signe began to notice a significant shift in her mood and outlook. She felt more grounded and centered, and she found that she was able to focus more clearly on her work. Her writing became more nuanced and insightful, and she started to attract attention from editors and readers alike.

Through this process of self-discovery and growth, Signe came to realize the importance of taking care of herself and finding meaning in her own life. She learned that success as a writer wasn't just about producing great work, but also about living a fulfilling and balanced life.
