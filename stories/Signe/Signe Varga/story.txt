Signe Varga stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As a private investigator, she had seen her fair share of shady characters and illicit dealings, but there was something about this particular case that had her on edge.

She took a seat at the bar, ordering a coffee as she pulled out her notebook and began to review the details of the case. The client, a wealthy businessman named Marcus Thompson, had hired her to investigate his daughter's disappearance. Signe had been working on the case for weeks, following leads and gathering evidence, but so far, she had come up empty.

As she sipped her coffee, Signe noticed a figure sitting in the corner of the café, watching her with an intensity that made her skin crawl. She couldn't quite make out their features, but there was something about them that seemed...familiar.

Signe's instincts told her to leave, to get out of there as quickly as possible, but she needed to know more. She took a deep breath and began to approach the mysterious figure, her eyes locked on theirs.

As she drew closer, Signe saw that it was a woman, with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. There was something about her that seemed...familiar, and suddenly, it clicked into place. This was someone Signe had met before, someone who had been involved in the case from the very beginning.

The woman's name was Lily, an old flame of Marcus Thompson's. Signe remembered now - Lily had been a key witness in the case, but she had seemed so shaken and intimidated that day. Now, as she sat across from Signe, her eyes locked on hers with a fierce determination.

"Signe Varga," the woman said, her voice low and husky. "I've been waiting for you."
