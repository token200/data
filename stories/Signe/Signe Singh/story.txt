Signe Singh was a 25-year-old freelance journalist who had always been fascinated by the stories of Kashmir. Born and raised in London to Indian parents, she had grown up listening to her grandmother's tales of partition, of love, loss, and liberation. The conflict-ridden region had captivated her imagination, and she spent countless hours researching, writing, and photographing its people.

One day, Signe received a cryptic message from a local contact in Srinagar – the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir. He invited her to meet at an abandoned tea stall on the outskirts of town. She arrived just as dusk was setting over the valley, casting a warm orange glow over the mist-shrouded mountains.

The tea stall owner, Abdul, greeted her warmly, his eyes locked on hers with a mix of curiosity and caution. Signe showed him her press ID, and he nodded, ushering her into a small room at the back of the stall. A young Kashmiri woman sat on a cushioned floor, her eyes fixed intently on Signe.

"My name is Nafisa," the woman said softly. "I'm from a village near Srinagar. Our village has been under siege for months."

Signe's journalist instincts kicked in as she pulled out her notebook and began to scribble notes furiously. Abdul handed her a cup of steaming tea, which she gratefully accepted.

Nafisa told Signe about the clashes between pro-India and pro-Pakistan factions, about the curfews, the checkpoints, and the checkpoints within checkpoints. She spoke of families torn apart, homes destroyed, and the countless lives lost.

Signe listened with rapt attention, her camera snapping away as she absorbed every detail. When Nafisa finished speaking, Signe took a deep breath, composed herself, and asked if she could photograph some of the stories she'd shared.

As the night wore on, Signe captured haunting images of Srinagar under siege: crumbling street signs, makeshift checkpoints, and weeping women clutching ruined furniture. The photographs would go on to be published in major international newspapers, shedding light on a conflict often ignored or misunderstood by the world.

Signe returned home with a newfound sense of purpose – to tell the stories that needed to be told.
