Signe Lemoine stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. It had been months since she'd last seen him, and yet, the memory of his smile lingered in her mind like a ghost.

She spotted him across the room, sitting alone at a small table by the window. His dark hair was shorter now, but his piercing blue eyes still sparkled with warmth whenever he looked at someone he cared about. Signe's heart skipped a beat as she made her way towards him, weaving through the sea of people.

As she approached, he looked up and caught sight of her. A soft smile spread across his face, and Signe felt a flutter in her chest. "Hey," he said, using the nickname only he ever called her. "It's been too long."

Signe slid into the chair opposite him, feeling a sense of ease wash over her. They spent the next hour catching up on each other's lives, sharing stories and laughter like they used to when they were younger.

But beneath the surface, Signe couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. She'd been keeping secrets from him lately – not just about her own life, but also about the ones she'd discovered about his past. The whispers of a tragic accident, of a love lost and a heart broken, lingered in her mind like a shadow.

As they chatted, Signe decided to take a risk. She reached into her bag and pulled out a small notebook, flipping through its pages until she came across the entry that made her heart ache. "We were meant to be together," it read, written in her own handwriting, years ago when she'd declared her undying love for him.

He looked up at her, his eyes searching hers for answers. "What is it?" he asked softly.

Signe hesitated, unsure of how to reveal the truth without breaking his trust. But as she met his gaze, she knew she couldn't keep it hidden anymore. "I think we're not meant to be together," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

The words hung in the air like a challenge, leaving Signe wondering if he would ever look at her in the same way again.
