Her full name, Signe Marie Navratilova, seemed to take on a new significance as she navigated the world of music, where identity and creativity were constantly being redefined.

As she honed her craft, Signe began to perform at local venues and open mic nights, quickly gaining a following among fans of jazz and experimental music. Her confidence grew with each performance, and she found herself drawing on a wide range of influences, from John Coltrane to David Bowie.
