As the day drew to a close, Signe settled into her small apartment, surrounded by stacks of research and scribbled notes. With a deep breath, she began typing out the first draft of her exposé, her words flowing effortlessly onto the screen. This was it – the moment of truth. And Signe Zawisza knew that when she published this story, the world would be watching, waiting for the scoop of a lifetime.
