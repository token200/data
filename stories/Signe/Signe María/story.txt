Signe María stood at the edge of the cliff, her feet bare and her toes curled over the precipice. The wind whipped through her long, curly hair as she gazed out at the endless expanse of ocean below. She felt small and insignificant, a tiny speck on the face of the earth.

But it was exactly that feeling of vulnerability that drew her to this spot. This place held a deep sadness within it, a sorrow that echoed through Signe María's very being. It was where she had come to escape the pain of her past, to lose herself in the vastness of the sea.

As a child, Signe María had been raised on a remote island, surrounded by an unforgiving landscape of stone and sand. Her parents had died when she was young, leaving her alone with nothing but the memories of their love. The isolation had hardened her, like the coral reefs that lined the shore.

But now, as a grown woman, Signe María struggled to find meaning in a world that seemed determined to leave her empty. She drifted from place to place, taking on odd jobs and making fleeting connections with strangers. Her heart remained locked tight, refusing to let love or trust seep in.

And yet, as she stood at the edge of this cliff, something stirred within her. A sense of restlessness, a longing for connection that went beyond mere survival. It was as if the wind itself was speaking to her, urging her to take the leap and see what lay beneath.

Signe María closed her eyes, feeling the sand shifting beneath her feet. She took a deep breath, letting the salty air fill her lungs. And then, with a sense of surrender, she let go.

The fall seemed endless, like an eternity of nothingness. But Signe María felt no fear, only a strange and exhilarating sensation, as if she were spreading her arms wide and embracing the unknown. When she finally landed, she lay on the sand, staring up at the sky in wonder.

Perhaps this was the start of something new, Signe María thought, her heart still guarded but her soul awakened. Maybe it was time to stop running from the world, and start facing it head-on. The ocean seemed to whisper in agreement, its waves crashing against the shore like a gentle, insistent heartbeat.
