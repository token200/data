Signe Järv stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. The misty Finnish air enveloped her like a damp shroud, heavy with the scent of pine and decay. She had been away for months, fleeing the suffocating grip of Helsinki's concrete jungle. Here, in this tiny town on the Karelian border, she hoped to find solace.

A young woman with an untamed mane of curly brown hair and a face that seemed chiseled from granite, Signe walked through the station, her boots scuffling against the tile floor. Her eyes were a deep shade of indigo, almost black, and they sparkled with a hint of mischief. She had always been drawn to the unknown, the unexplored corners of life.

As she emerged into the pale winter sun, Signe felt a sense of freedom wash over her. The trees seemed to stretch up to the sky like skeletal fingers, their branches etched against the grey sky like a delicate pen and ink drawing. She breathed in deeply, feeling the cool air fill her lungs, and began to walk.

The streets were narrow and winding, lined with ancient wooden houses that seemed to lean in towards each other as if sharing secrets. Signe wandered, taking in the sights and sounds of this forgotten corner of Finland. She felt like a traveler in a foreign land, eager to explore every hidden nook and cranny.

As she walked, the sound of laughter carried on the breeze, mingling with the scent of freshly baked bread wafting from a nearby bakery. Signe's stomach growled with hunger, and she followed the enticing aroma to a small café tucked away on a side street. Inside, the room was warm and cozy, filled with the soft hum of conversation and the clinking of cups.

Signe slid onto a stool at the bar, ordering a steaming cup of coffee and a slice of dark rye bread slathered in butter and jam. As she waited for her food to arrive, she struck up a conversation with the baker's wife, a stout woman with a kind face and a twinkle in her eye.

"You're new here," the woman said, nodding towards Signe. "I can see that."

Signe smiled, feeling a sense of belonging wash over her. Maybe this was where she was meant to be – in this small town on the edge of nowhere, surrounded by the beauty and mystery of the Finnish wilderness.
