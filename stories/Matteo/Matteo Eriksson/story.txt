Matteo Eriksson stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the sleepy streets of Malmö. It was a chilly autumn evening, and the Swedish city was bathed in a warm orange glow. As he made his way through the quiet station, Matteo's mind wandered back to why he'd returned to his hometown.

A year ago, Matteo had left Malmö behind, eager to escape the suffocating familiarity of his life as a photographer. His work had taken him to some of the world's most stunning landscapes, but the isolation had started to take its toll. He'd begun to feel disconnected from the people and places that had once been so dear to him.

Now, Matteo was back in Malmö to care for his ailing mother. She'd been diagnosed with Alzheimer's, and despite the best efforts of the medical team, her condition continued to deteriorate. As the eldest child, it was up to Matteo to be by her side during this difficult time.

As he walked through the streets, Matteo felt a mix of emotions: sadness, guilt, but also a sense of nostalgia. He thought back to his childhood days exploring the city's canals and waterfronts with his friends, capturing their adventures in photos that would one day become some of his most beloved works.

Matteo stopped at the corner of Gustav Adolfsgatan and Norreplanen, where he'd taken countless pictures over the years. The old buildings still stood tall, but they seemed smaller now, as if the city itself was shrinking before his eyes. He pulled out a worn notebook from his bag and began to sketch the familiar scene, letting his pencil wander across the page.

As the hours passed, Matteo's drawing gave way to thoughts of his mother, and all the memories he'd made with her. He recalled the way she used to smile at him when he showed her his latest photos, the way her eyes would light up whenever he took her on a walk along the canal.

Eventually, Matteo tucked his notebook away and set off towards home, feeling a small sense of peace settle over him. He knew that being here, in Malmö, with his mother by his side, was where he needed to be right now.
