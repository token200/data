When asked about his inspiration, Matteo would often mention his love of nature, saying it was the source of his creativity. "I find solace in the beauty of the world around me," he would explain. "It's as if I'm not creating art at all – I'm simply capturing a moment in time."

As word of his talent spread far and wide, people began to clamor for Matteo Girace's attention. Galleries and collectors sought him out, eager to commission pieces from the rising star. And yet, despite the pressure and expectation that came with fame, Matteo remained grounded, true to himself and his art.
