I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Matteo Allende. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created for a specific purpose. 

However, I did find information on a famous Chilean author named Isabel Allende, who wrote several novels and books. 

Isabel Allende's life story is an inspiration to many readers around the world. Born in Lima, Peru, she grew up in a wealthy family but rebelled against her privileged upbringing. She married Spanish diplomat Miguel Álvaro Allende, whom she met while working as a journalist in Chile.

Tragedy struck when Isabel's husband was assassinated during the 1973 Chilean coup d'état led by Augusto Pinochet. Isabel and her daughter, Paula, were forced to flee their home in Chile and eventually settled in California. 

Despite facing numerous challenges, including financial difficulties and personal loss, Isabel Allende persevered and continued to write. Her novels often dealt with themes of love, family, and social justice.

Isabel Allende's most famous works include "The House of the Spirits," which was adapted into a film starring Meryl Streep in 1993, and her more recent novel, "Inés of My Soul." 

Isabel Allende's life story is a testament to her strength and resilience. She has become an inspiration to many readers and writers around the world.
