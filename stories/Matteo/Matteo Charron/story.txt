Matteo Charron stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the familiar landscape of his hometown. The small town of Saint-Pierre was not much changed since he had left five years prior, but Matteo knew every nook and cranny like the back of his hand.

As he made his way through the quiet streets, he couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. He thought about all the memories he had made in this town, from the countless hours spent exploring the nearby woods to the laughter-filled nights at the local caf√©.

Matteo's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of his mother's voice calling out from behind him. "Matteo! Matteo Charron!" She hurried towards him, a warm smile spreading across her face.

"Bonjour, Maman," he replied, embracing her in a tight hug. His mother, Marie, had always been his rock, supporting him every step of the way as he pursued his passion for art.

The two spent the morning catching up over coffee and croissants at the local bakery. Matteo's mother asked about his latest projects and listened intently as he showed her his sketches and paintings. She was proud of the talented young artist he had become, just like she always knew he would be.

As they sat outside in the park, watching the sun begin to set behind the hills, Marie turned to Matteo with a serious expression. "You know, I've been thinking," she said. "It's time for you to come back and help me with the family business."

Matteo's heart skipped a beat as he considered his mother's words. The family business, a small art studio that had been in their family for generations, was in need of someone with his skills to revive it.

He looked at his mother, her eyes shining with hope, and knew that this was an opportunity he couldn't pass up. "Oui, Maman," he said finally. "I'll be back soon."
