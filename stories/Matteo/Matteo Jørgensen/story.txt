Matteo Jørgensen stepped off the train and onto the platform, taking in the salty air of the coastal town. He had come to visit his aunt, Helga, who lived in this quaint little place by the sea. As he made his way through the station, he noticed a group of locals eyeing him curiously. Matteo Jørgensen was used to drawing attention, but he was also comfortable with it.

As he walked towards his aunt's small cottage, he saw Helga herself waiting for him on the porch, a warm smile on her face. "Ah, Matteo Jørgensen! It's so good to see you!" she exclaimed, giving him a hug. Matteo Jørgensen hugged her back, feeling a sense of comfort and belonging in this familiar place.

After exchanging pleasantries with Helga, Matteo decided to explore the town on his own. He wandered through the narrow streets, taking in the colorful buildings and bustling shops. People nodded at him as he passed by, some even stopping to chat for a few minutes. Matteo Jørgensen was used to being an outsider in his own hometown of Copenhagen, but here, he felt like he fit right in.

As the day drew to a close, Matteo met up with Helga again, this time for dinner at a local seafood restaurant. Over plates of fresh fish and shellfish, they talked about everything from their childhood memories to their dreams for the future. Matteo Jørgensen found himself feeling more relaxed than he had in weeks.

After dinner, as they strolled along the beach, Helga asked him about his plans for the rest of his visit. Matteo thought for a moment before answering. "I was thinking of taking some time to work on my art," he said finally. "I've been feeling a bit stuck lately." Helga nodded encouragingly and suggested that they spend the next day together, exploring the town and getting him out of his creative rut.

Matteo Jørgensen smiled, feeling grateful for his aunt's support. He knew that with Helga by his side, he could face anything life threw his way.
