After graduating, Matteo went on to work as an artist-in-residence at a local gallery, where he continued to hone his craft and push the limits of what was possible. His art became increasingly provocative, tackling themes of social justice and environmental degradation. Critics raved about his talent, praising him for his courage and creativity.
