I couldn't find any information on a historical figure named "Saltanat Julius Caesar Octavianus Augustus." However, I believe you may be confusing this with the real-life Roman Emperor Gaius Octavius Thracianus, who later became known as Augustus. Alternatively, there was also a 7th-century Arab leader and emir named Saltanat (also spelled Saladin), however, she was not related to Julius Caesar or Octavianus.

If you meant something else then I'm happy to create a story with the fictional character of your choice for you.
