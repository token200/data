Saltanat Morel's hands moved with precision, expertly shaping the clay into a fragile vase. The sunlight streaming through the studio window highlighted the fine lines etched on her face, map-like from years of concentration.

Born in Cairo to artists' parents, Saltanat had always felt pressure to follow in their footsteps. Her mother was a painter, and her father, a sculptor – both masters in their own right. But Saltanat's true passion lay not with visual art, but with words. She devoured books on history, philosophy, and literature, spending hours lost in the pages of T.S. Eliot and Albert Camus.

After completing her studies in Arabic Literature, Saltanat turned to writing poetry – an endeavor that both thrilled and terrified her. It was a secret she shared only with her closest friends, those who understood the fragility and power of words.

As she worked on her latest piece, Saltanat's mind wandered back to her childhood days spent listening to stories by her father. He would weave tales from ancient Egyptian mythology, transporting her to worlds both magical and desolate. It was through these stories that Saltanat discovered her love for language – the way it could evoke emotions, conjure images, and bridge cultures.

With a sigh of satisfaction, Saltanat placed the vase on its pedestal, admiring the delicate dance of lines and curves. Her hands lingered on the cool surface, remembering the first time she'd written a poem that had left her breathless. The words flowed like water, effortless and pure – an experience both exhilarating and terrifying.

As she stepped back to survey her work, Saltanat's thoughts drifted to the long-forgotten stories of the desert women who'd inspired her mother's paintings. Those untold voices whispered in her ear, urging her to share their own stories with the world. It was a responsibility she took seriously – to give voice to those whose voices had been silenced.

Saltanat dipped her brush into a new color palette, feeling an energy build within her. She knew that writing poetry wasn't just about words on paper; it was a battle for understanding and empathy. Her stories might never be heard by the world at large, but they were hers – an expression of the beauty and fragility she saw in every face.

As the sun began to set outside, casting a warm glow over her studio, Saltanat's eyes locked onto the vase once more. Its gentle curves seemed to whisper secrets back to her – of the stories waiting to be told, the words that needed to be shared.
