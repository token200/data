Saltanat Almodovar was known for her fiery spirit and sharp wit in the tight-knit community of Tbilisi's Old Town. As a young woman with a passion for history and literature, she spent most of her days exploring the city's ancient streets, searching for hidden gems and secrets buried beneath the cobblestones.

Her friends often joked that Saltanat Almodovar was born with a PhD in Georgian folklore, given her uncanny ability to recite entire tales from memory. And indeed, whenever she spoke about the subject, her words seemed to come alive, transporting those around her to a bygone era of mysticism and myth.

One evening, as Saltanat Almodovar wandered along the Kura River, lost in thought, she stumbled upon a group of locals huddled around a makeshift fire. They were recounting tales of a legendary figure from Georgian mythology – the Golden Bird – said to possess the power to heal even the most grievous wounds.

Intrigued by their stories and fueled by her own love for folklore, Saltanat Almodovar joined in, regaling the group with her own interpretation of the myth. Her words wove a spell around the gathered crowd, drawing them into a world of wonder and enchantment.

As the night wore on, the fire crackled and spat, casting flickering shadows on the surrounding walls. Saltanat Almodovar's eyes shone like stars in the darkness, her voice carrying the weight of centuries past. And when she finally fell silent, the group was left breathless, their ears still ringing with the echoes of her words.

In that moment, it was clear that Saltanat Almodovar was more than just a curious historian – she was a keeper of secrets, a weaver of tales, and a guardian of Tbilisi's rich cultural heritage. As the night drew to a close, and the group dispersed into the city's streets, they couldn't help but feel grateful for having shared in Saltanat Almodovar's world of wonder – if only for one magical evening.
