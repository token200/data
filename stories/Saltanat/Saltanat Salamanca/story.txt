In the scorching desert city of Cartagena, Colombia, a young woman named Saltanat Salamanca was born with a fierce spirit and an untamed mane of curly hair the color of dark chocolate. As she grew up, Saltanat Salamanca became known for her boldness and her unwavering dedication to justice.

Saltanat Salamanca's life took a dramatic turn when she discovered that her family's ancestral home, a beautiful colonial mansion on the outskirts of the city, was being threatened by a corrupt businessman who sought to tear it down and build a high-rise development. The thought of destroying the historic building and displacing its inhabitants was abhorrent to Saltanat Salamanca.

Determined to save her family's legacy, Saltanat Salamanca embarked on a mission to gather evidence and rally support from the community.
