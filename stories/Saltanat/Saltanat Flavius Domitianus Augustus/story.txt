Determined to protect her people and her land, Saltanat Flavius Domitianus Augustus embarked on a perilous journey to forge alliances with neighboring kingdoms and strengthen Palmyra's defenses.

Eventually, her reputation reached the ears of the Roman Emperor himself, who was impressed by Saltanat's exceptional abilities. He offered her a place at his court, but Saltanat Flavius Domitianus Augustus declined, preferring to maintain her independence and continue serving her people.

And so, Saltanat Flavius Domitianus Augustus remained a thorn in the side of Roman expansion, always ready to defend her land and her people against any threat. Her legacy lived on for generations, inspiring future leaders with her bravery, intelligence, and unwavering commitment to her people.
