Saltanat Fernandez stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of her contact. As a journalist, she had been investigating corruption in the local government for months, and finally, she had received a tip about a high-ranking official who was willing to spill the beans.

With her camera slung over her shoulder and notebook at the ready, Saltanat made her way through the crowded station, asking questions of locals and vendors alike. She had been warned that this official would be difficult to reach, but she was determined to get the story.

As she turned a corner, she spotted a figure waiting for her by the water fountain. It was an old man with a kind face, who introduced himself as Ahmed. "You're Saltanat Fernandez," he said, his eyes twinkling. "I've been expecting you."

Saltanat's instincts told her to be cautious, but there was something about Ahmed that put her at ease. He led her through the winding streets of the old city, pointing out landmarks and sharing stories about the history of the place.

Eventually, they arrived at a small tea shop tucked away in a quiet alley. Ahmed ushered Saltanat inside, where an elderly woman with a warm smile greeted them. "Welcome, Saltanat Fernandez," she said, as if they were old friends. "I'm Jamila, and I have something to share with you."

Jamila poured steaming cups of tea into two delicate ceramic cups, and began to speak in hushed tones about the corruption that had been plaguing the city for years. Saltanat's ears perked up as she listened, taking furious notes on her pad.

As they sipped their tea, Ahmed leaned forward, his eyes locked on hers. "Saltanat Fernandez," he said, his voice low and serious. "I want to make sure you have all the facts. Are you willing to take on this story?"

Saltanat nodded, her heart racing with excitement. She knew that this was the break she had been waiting for, and she was determined to see it through to its conclusion.
