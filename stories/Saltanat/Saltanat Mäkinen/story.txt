Saltanat MÃ¤kinen, a Finnish-Swedish singer-songwriter, stepped onto the dimly lit stage of Helsinki's iconic Tavastia Club. Her eyes scanned the sea of expectant faces, her dark hair shining under the spotlight.

Her eyes sparkled with joy, lost in the sea of adoring fans.

Throughout the night, Saltanat navigated the club with ease, effortlessly weaving through a setlist that took the audience on a sonic journey from Finland's snow-covered landscapes to Sweden's cozy cafes. She crooned tender ballads like "Lost in Translation" and "Snowflake", her voice conjuring images of winter wonderlands.

The highlight of the evening came when she performed an acoustic version of her new single, "Finnish Heartbeat".
