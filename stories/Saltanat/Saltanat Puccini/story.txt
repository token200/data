Saltanat Puccini stepped out of her small flat in Florence, breathing in the crisp morning air. She tied her hair back into a ponytail and adjusted her glasses before setting off towards the Arno River. The sun was just starting to peek over the hills, casting a warm glow over the city.

As she walked, Saltanat thought about the letter she had received that morning from her sister, Maria. It seemed Maria had fallen in love with a young man named Alessandro, and was now expecting their first child. Saltanat's mind began to wander back to when she was a teenager, listening to her mother's tales of courtship and marriage.

Saltanat stopped at the riverbank, watching as fishermen cast their nets into the water. She remembered how much her mother had loved these early morning strolls along the Arno. As a child, Saltanat would sit on her mother's lap and listen to the sound of the water lapping against the shore.

As she stood there, lost in thought, Saltanat noticed an elderly woman sitting on a nearby bench, watching her with kind eyes. The woman beckoned Saltanat over, inviting her to join her for a cup of coffee.

Over steaming cups of espresso, the woman told Saltanat about her own life story - how she had lost her husband in World War II and raised three children on her own. Saltanat listened intently, feeling a sense of solidarity with this stranger who seemed to understand her own struggles.

As they sipped their coffee, Saltanat pulled out the letter from Maria and began to read it aloud to the woman. The old woman smiled knowingly as she heard about Alessandro's kindness and gentle nature.

The two women sat in silence for a moment, watching as children played along the riverbank. Finally, the elderly woman spoke up, "You must write to your sister, Saltanat. Let her know that you are there for her, not just for Maria, but for all of Alessandro's family as well."

Saltanat smiled, feeling a sense of purpose wash over her. She tucked the letter back into her pocket and set off towards home, determined to become the kind of aunt Maria had always wanted - one who was present, supportive, and full of love.

As she walked away from the riverbank, Saltanat felt a sense of connection to her own mother's legacy, and knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, she would face them with courage and kindness.
