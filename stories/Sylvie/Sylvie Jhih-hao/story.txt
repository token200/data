As the evening wore on, Sylvie took to the stage to perform an impromptu set, singing folk songs and playing the guqin – an ancient Chinese zither. The crowd was entranced by her talent and charisma, hanging on every word as she wove a spell of community and connection.

In the aftermath of the performance, Sylvie's phone buzzed with congratulatory messages from friends, family, and fellow artists. Her manager called to schedule more commissions, and her agent offered to book her for upcoming festivals and events across Asia.
