Upon arriving at the mansion, Sylvie Jones noticed an eerie atmosphere that seemed to cling to every stone and beam. She began to survey the premises, taking in the dusty cobwebs and creaking floorboards. As she moved from room to room, a chill ran down her spine as she sensed the presence of something malevolent lurking just out of sight.
