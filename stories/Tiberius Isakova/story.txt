Tiberius Isakova stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the worn benches and faded advertisements for the local coffee shop. He had been traveling for days, fleeing the bureaucratic red tape that seemed to suffocate him in his role as head of the Ministry of Interagency Coordination.

As he made his way through the station, Tiberius's gaze fell upon a small, dusty newspaper stand tucked away in a corner. The headline read "Lost and Found" in bold letters above a photo of a young woman with piercing green eyes and a mischievous grin. Her name was Lilya Petrova, and according to the article, she had been reported missing by her family five years prior.

Tiberius's thoughts were interrupted by a gentle tap on his shoulder. He turned to find a petite woman with short, dark hair and a kind smile. "Excuse me, are you looking for something?" she asked, her voice soft but firm.

"I'm searching for information," Tiberius replied, producing his ID card from his pocket. The woman's eyes widened in surprise before she composed herself, handing him a small notebook with the details of Lilya Petrova's disappearance.

As he flipped through the pages, Tiberius noticed that the last entry was dated five years ago. He looked up to find the woman watching him intently. "What do you know about this case?" he asked gruffly.

The woman hesitated before responding, "Not much, but I've been trying to help Lilya's family find out what happened to her. They're still looking for answers." Her eyes locked onto Tiberius's, and he felt an unexpected pang of guilt. He knew the feeling of being lost and forgotten, of having one's questions left unanswered.

Tiberius spent the rest of the day scouring the station for any information about Lilya Petrova. The trail led him to a small café on the outskirts of town, where he met with an old informant who claimed to have seen Lilya arguing with a group of men in a seedy part of town.

As Tiberius listened intently to the informant's tale, he felt a spark of purpose ignite within him. For the first time in years, he felt like he was doing something more than just going through the motions. He was starting to uncover the truth, one small piece at a time.

The café owner, an elderly woman with warm eyes and a knowing smile, watched Tiberius leave the station with a sense of satisfaction. "Sometimes," she whispered to herself, "it's the ones who are lost that find their way."
