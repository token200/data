Brage Harris was known for his unrivaled talent on the football field. As a star quarterback in college, he had already garnered attention from scouts and fans alike. But it wasn't just his impressive throws and quick reflexes that made him stand out - it was his unwavering dedication to his craft.

As a child, Brage spent hours practicing his passes in the backyard with his father, who had been a high school coach. He would run drills until the sun set, determined to become the best player he could be. And as he grew older, that drive only intensified.

When Brage arrived at the university, he was a force to be reckoned with. He led his team to victory after victory, earning him the nickname "The General" among fans and opponents alike. But behind the scenes, Brage was a man of few words. He preferred to let his actions speak for themselves on the field.

Despite his success, Brage struggled with self-doubt and pressure. He knew that one mistake could cost his team the game, and the weight of that responsibility often bore down on him. But he refused to give in to fear or uncertainty. Instead, he channeled that energy into his training, pushing himself harder than ever before.

As the years went by, Brage's legend grew. He led his team to victory after victory, earning him a spot on the NFL draft board. And when the day finally came, he was taken with the first overall pick - a moment he had dreamed of since childhood.

But as Brage stepped onto the NFL field for the first time, something unexpected happened. The rush of adrenaline and excitement gave way to a sense of unease. He felt like an imposter, like he didn't belong among the likes of which he had grown up idolizing.

In that moment, Brage realized that his journey wasn't just about individual success - it was about representing his family, his team, and himself. And with that realization came a newfound sense of purpose. He dedicated himself to being the best version of himself on and off the field, using his platform to inspire and uplift those around him.

Years later, when Brage's number was retired in honor of his achievements, he stood on the field, tears streaming down his face. It was a moment of vindication, but more than that - it was a reminder that the true measure of greatness lies not in the accolades we receive, but in the positive impact we have on those around us.
