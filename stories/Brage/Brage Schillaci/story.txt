Brage Schillaci stepped into the smoky jazz club, his eyes scanning the dimly lit room for any sign of familiarity. The air was thick with the smell of cigarette smoke and worn leather, transporting him back to his youth in the rough-around-the-edges neighborhood where he grew up.

As a child, Brage had spent countless nights like this one, hiding from his parents' arguing and listening to the sounds of the city outside their apartment window. But it was here, amidst the cacophony of notes and rhythms, that he found solace. The saxophonist who now stood on stage, blowing into his instrument with reckless abandon, reminded Brage of the very same sounds that had once provided comfort.

Years passed, and Brage grew up to be a man of few words but many stories. He spent years working as a mechanic, tinkering with engines and fixing broken things, much like he fixed broken lives through his own work as a social worker. But music was always in the back of his mind, an itch he couldn't scratch until it finally led him to this very stage.

As Brage made his way deeper into the club, he spotted her – Maria, the lead singer with a voice that could shatter glass and warm hearts. She sang like she poured her soul onto the microphone each night, raw emotion spilling out in every word. Brage felt an inexplicable connection to her, as if their lives had intersected at some point before this moment.

He slid into the empty seat beside Maria, his hand instinctively reaching for hers under the table. As they gazed up at the stage, the saxophonist's music merged with theirs, transporting them both back to that first time they'd heard each other sing in a park bench on a rain-soaked summer evening.

Without breaking eye contact, Brage began to recite the poem Maria had written for him – 'Your eyes hold oceans where sunflowers bloom.' They exchanged knowing glances, their minds lost in memories of shared laughter and long-forgotten whispers.

As the band wrapped up their final set, Brage stood up to applaud along with Maria. Together, they took a step forward as one being, into that unknown night filled with promise.
