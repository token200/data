Brage Tóth stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar sounds of the city enveloping him like a warm hug. It had been months since he'd returned to Budapest, but the city felt no less alive, no less pulsing with energy.

As he made his way through the station, Brage's thoughts turned to the letter in his pocket – the one from his estranged father, inviting him back for a visit. He hadn't seen or heard from the man in years, not since Brage was a teenager. But something about the familiar script and the hint of longing had drawn him back.

He hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of his childhood home – an apartment building on the outskirts of town, near the Danube. The driver eyed him warily as he climbed in, but Brage paid no mind; he was too busy lost in memories of nights spent on the balcony, watching the stars twinkle over the river.

The taxi finally pulled up outside a worn stone building with a faded sign creaking in the breeze. Brage paid and stepped out onto the sidewalk, feeling a sense of trepidation wash over him as he approached the door. He took a deep breath and pushed it open.

Inside, he found himself face-to-face with a stranger – a younger version of his father, with the same piercing blue eyes and craggy features that had once made Brage feel so lost and unsure. For a moment, they just stared at each other, two generations colliding in a burst of emotion.

"Hello, Brage," his father finally said, a rough voice filled with longing. "Welcome home."

Brage smiled, feeling the weight of years lift from his shoulders. It was time to start healing, to reconnect with a piece of himself he thought he'd lost forever. He took his father's hand and stepped into the unknown, ready to face whatever came next – with Brage Tóth, full name and all, finally at home.
