Brage Zawisza stepped out of the rain-soaked streets and into the dimly lit bar, the neon signs outside giving way to a warm glow within. He slipped onto a stool at the end of the counter, his eyes scanning the room for familiar faces.

The bartender, a gruff but affable man named Mikael, raised an eyebrow as Brage took a seat. "The usual, Brage?" he asked, nodding towards the bottle of vodka that sat beside him like a trusted companion.

Brage nodded, taking a sip before running his tongue over his lips. It was a gesture he'd performed countless times in this very bar, but one that never lost its comfort. The whiskey burned down his throat, warming his chest and spreading through his veins like a slow-moving fire.

As the night wore on, Brage's thoughts began to wander. He couldn't shake the feeling of restlessness that had been building inside him for weeks now. It was a sense of discontent that he'd grown accustomed to over the years, one that made it difficult to settle into anything for more than a few days at a time.

Brage's mind turned to his life as an ex-soldier, one that had left its mark on him long after he'd walked out of the military. He'd struggled to find work, to find purpose outside the structured routine of combat and patrol. His friends from his unit seemed to be doing better, finding success in various careers and making families. But for Brage, it was like trying to fill a void that no amount of money or recognition could ever quite erase.

As he lost himself in thought, a figure caught his eye - a young woman with piercing green eyes, her dark hair pulled back into a tight ponytail as she chatted to Mikael. There was something about the way she laughed, the way her smile danced across her face, that made Brage's chest tighten.

Without thinking, he pushed off from the stool and walked over to the table where the woman sat. "Mind if I join you?" he asked, his voice low and rough from disuse.

The woman looked up, startled, before breaking into a radiant smile. "Not at all," she said, her eyes sparkling with amusement as Brage slid onto the chair beside her.
