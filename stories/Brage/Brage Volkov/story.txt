Brage Volkov stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the rain-soaked streets of Seattle. The city's perpetual grey skies seemed to match his own melancholy mood. He had always been drawn to the darker corners of life, where the lost and forgotten dwelled.

As a former mercenary turned private investigator, Brage had seen his fair share of violence and despair. His latest case, however, was different. A young woman named Lena had approached him with a mystery that seemed almost mythical in its complexity. Her sister, a talented musician, had gone missing under circumstances that no one could explain.

Brage lit a cigarette as he walked down the rain-slicked sidewalk. The neon lights of the city's bars and clubs reflected off the wet pavement like a diseased rainbow. He knew every alleyway, every dive bar, and every shady character in this town. And yet, he had no leads on Lena's sister.

As he turned onto 15th Avenue, Brage spotted a figure huddled on the sidewalk outside a rundown record store. The sign above the door read "Moonlight Records" – a place where music lovers and outcasts gathered to escape the world outside. The man on the sidewalk seemed lost in thought, his eyes fixed on the floor.

Brage approached him cautiously, sensing something familiar about the stranger's demeanor. They exchanged words, and Brage learned that this was Viktor, Lena's sister's manager. Viktor told Brage that Lena had been researching an urban legend – a mythical artist known only as "The Echo." Rumors said The Echo had the ability to capture the essence of a person's music, trapping it within his own haunting melodies.

Brage listened intently, his mind whirling with possibilities. He knew he was in over his head, but something about this case resonated with him. Maybe it was the darkness that lurked beneath every surface or perhaps the faint promise of redemption. Whatever the reason, Brage Volkov had to uncover the truth behind Lena's sister and The Echo.

With a newfound sense of determination, Brage turned Viktor loose on the city streets, telling him to dig deeper into Moonlight Records' past. As he walked away, the rain began to let up, revealing glimpses of hope in the desolate landscape. For the first time in months, Brage felt like he might finally find some solace in this broken world. The darkness still lurked within, but it was no longer enough to consume him whole.
