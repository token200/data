Brage Charpentier sat alone in his dimly lit workshop, surrounded by half-finished projects and scattered tools. The scent of wood shavings and oil wafted through the air as he worked on his latest masterpiece - a intricately carved wooden box adorned with delicate patterns.

As a master craftsman, Brage was known for his attention to detail and unwavering dedication to his craft. His hands moved deftly, shaping the wood into beautiful curves and patterns that seemed to come alive in the light.

Brage's obsession with woodworking began when he was just a boy, watching his father carve intricate wooden toys on their family farm. From that moment on, Brage knew he wanted to carry on the family tradition.

Years of hard work and practice had honed Brage's skills to perfection. His clients adored him for his creations - each piece told a story and conveyed a sense of serenity that was hard to find in today's fast-paced world.

As he worked, Brage's mind wandered back to the commission he had received from Lady Charlotte, the wealthy patron who commissioned most of his work. She wanted a wooden chest adorned with golden filigree - something truly exceptional. Brage had been stumped at first, but after weeks of experimenting, he finally nailed down the design.

He stepped back from the table and admired his handiwork, a small smile playing on his lips. Lady Charlotte would love it. With renewed confidence, Brage set to work on adding final touches - a delicate latch and an embossed pattern that seemed to shimmer in the light.

Just as he was finishing up, there was a knock at the door. It was his apprentice, Pascal. "Sir, I've brought your tools," Pascal said with a respectful bow. "And news from Lady Charlotte - she wants you to start working on the commission next week."

Brage's eyes sparkled as he smiled at Pascal. He loved teaching the young man and watching him grow into a skilled craftsman in his own right.

As they packed up for the day, Brage couldn't help but feel grateful for this life of wood and creation. In his workshop, surrounded by tools and half-finished projects, he felt at peace - exactly where he belonged. With a satisfied smile, he shut the door behind them and settled back into work, the scent of wood and oil enveloping him once more.
