Brage Arias stood at the edge of the cliff, gazing out at the endless expanse of ocean below. His piercing blue eyes seemed to hold a thousand secrets, and his raven-black hair whipped about his face in the salty wind. It was a sight that made many men pause, and some even trembled with envy.

But Brage wasn't concerned with impressing anyone. He had his own demons to contend with – the memories of a past he'd rather forget, the scars that crisscrossed his body like constellations in the night sky. Yet, despite it all, he felt alive, as if the stormy seas and turbulent skies were coursing through his very veins.

As a mercenary, Brage had seen his fair share of battles. He'd fought in wars, on distant shores, and in forgotten cities. His reputation preceded him – some said he was unbeatable in combat; others whispered that he had the devil's own luck. The truth lay somewhere in between, but one thing was certain: when Brage Arias charged into a fray, chaos followed.

Tonight, however, he'd come to a place of solitude, seeking refuge from his wandering thoughts. A seagull swooped down, its eyes fixed on him like a predator sizing up prey, before vanishing into the darkness. The silence was oppressive, but Brage didn't mind. He liked it here – among the crumbling stones and worn wooden signs that bore the weight of history.

As he walked along the deserted beach, Brage stumbled upon an old guitar buried beneath the sand. Dust coated its surface, and the strings seemed to whisper to him in a forgotten language. Without thinking, he picked up the instrument and strummed a melancholy tune. The music weaved a spell around him – the wind carried it out to sea, where it merged with the whispers of the waves.

Brage's song echoed through the night, an air of longing that seeped into his very being. And though the darkness closed in around him like a shroud, he felt no fear. For in this solitary moment, surrounded by the endless expanse and haunting melodies, Brage Arias was at peace – a fleeting respite from the turmoil that had driven him to this place.
