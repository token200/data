Brage Viktor Korolev was a man of mystery and intrigue. His piercing blue eyes seemed to bore into those he met, as if sizing them up for potential usefulness. As a former KGB operative turned freelance investigator, Brage had earned a reputation for being one of the most skilled and ruthless operatives in the business.

Despite his tough exterior, however, Brage had a soft spot for those in need. He had spent years honing his skills as a spy and assassin, but after a particularly grueling assignment went sideways, Brage had decided to leave the world of espionage behind and start anew.

Now, working out of a cramped office in a dingy part of town, Brage took on cases that didn't involve high-stakes government work. His latest client was a wealthy businessman who suspected his wife of embezzling funds from their company. The businessman, Alexander Petrovich, had begged Brage to investigate and put an end to the alleged theft.

Brage spent days interviewing employees and gathering evidence, but as he dug deeper, he began to suspect that there was more to the story than met the eye. It wasn't until he received a cryptic message from an unknown sender that Brage realized the true extent of Alexander's troubles.

The message read: "Look again at the books, Mr. Korolev." Brage's instincts told him to trust his gut, so he spent the next few days re-examining the financial records. And what he found shocked him to his core. It turned out that Alexander's wife was not the embezzler - but rather a pawn in a much larger game.

As Brage pieced together the evidence, he couldn't help but think of his own complicated past. How many people had been used and manipulated by those in power? And how many others had fallen victim to the same kind of deceit?

With the truth finally revealed, Brage made a decision: he would use his skills to expose the real culprits and bring them to justice. It was a risk, but one that Brage Viktor Korolev was willing to take. After all, someone had to keep the world's powers-that-be in check.
