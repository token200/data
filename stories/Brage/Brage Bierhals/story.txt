Brage Bierhals stood at the edge of the fjord, his eyes scanning the mist-shrouded waters. The salty air whipped through his dark hair as he gazed out at the endless expanse of blue. A small wooden boat bobbed gently in the distance, its occupant lost to Brage's sight.

As a young boy, Brage had spent countless hours exploring these fjords with his father, a seasoned fisherman who taught him the ways of the sea. But it was not just the fishing that drew Brage to this place - it was the sense of freedom that came with it. The feeling of being small yet connected to something much larger than himself.

Years had passed since then, and Brage had grown into a man with a troubled past. His family's farm had fallen on hard times, and his father's disappearance during a fishing trip still lingered as an unspoken question in their minds. Some said he'd been swept overboard by a rogue wave; others whispered that Brage himself was to blame.

Theories swirled around him like the mist that shrouded the fjord. But Brage knew the truth - or at least, what he believed to be the truth. He had found his father's old wooden boat, half-buried in the sand on a remote island. And there, inside its worn hull, he'd discovered a note with only two words: "Forgive me".

Brage's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps crunching on the gravel shore behind him. He turned to see a young woman approaching, her eyes fixed intently on his face. She carried a small pack slung over one shoulder and a fishing rod in her hand.

"Who are you?" Brage asked gruffly, his instincts on high alert.

"I'm Eira," she replied, her voice soft and melodious. "I've been searching for you, Brage Bierhals."

Brage raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. "What do you want?"

Eira smiled, her eyes sparkling with a hint of mischief. "I think we can help each other, Brage. I have information about your father... and about yourself."

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the fjord in a warm orange glow, Brage's heart began to stir with a mixture of hope and trepidation. The journey ahead would be long and difficult, but for the first time in years, he felt like he might finally find the answers he'd been searching for.
