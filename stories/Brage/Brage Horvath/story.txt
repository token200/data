Brage Horvath stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As a private investigator with a reputation for being one of the best in the city, he had seen it all. But tonight was different. Tonight, he had received a cryptic message from an old acquaintance that hinted at a high-stakes case.

Brage Horvath made his way to the bar, ordering a whiskey as he surveyed the room. The patrons were a rough bunch, but they seemed harmless enough. He spotted a figure in the corner, hood up and face obscured, and nodded to himself. That was probably his contact.

As he approached the stranger, Brage Horvath noticed that they were sipping on a cup of black coffee. "You look like someone who needs help," he said, dropping into the chair across from them.

The figure hesitated for a moment before pulling up their hood, revealing piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. "My name is Lila Blackwood," she said, her voice husky and confident. "And I have information about a valuable artifact that's been stolen."

Brage Horvath raised an eyebrow. "What makes you think I'm the man for the job?"

Lila smiled, a sly curve to her lips. "You have a reputation, Brage Horvath. One of being untouchable. And I need someone who can get the job done without drawing attention to themselves."

Brage Horvath nodded thoughtfully, taking a sip of his whiskey. He had been in tough spots before, but this one sounded like it could be worth the risk. "Tell me more about this artifact," he said, leaning forward.

Lila leaned in close, her voice barely above a whisper. "It's called the Starlight Serenade. A priceless violin that can only be played by someone with pure intentions."

Brage Horvath raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. This was going to be a tough case. But he was ready for it. After all, he was Brage Horvath, private investigator extraordinaire.
