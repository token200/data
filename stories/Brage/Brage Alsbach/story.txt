Brage Alsbach stepped into the dimly lit tavern, the smell of smoke and ale wafting up to greet him. He had been on the run for days, ever since his latest escapade went awry. The infamous thief and smuggler had earned a reputation that preceded him - a name whispered in fear by those who knew of his exploits.

Brage made his way to the bar, his eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. He spotted a familiar figure huddled in the corner, nursing a mug of ale. It was Lena, an old acquaintance and fellow thief.

As he approached, Lena looked up and flashed him a quick smile. "Brage, I thought you'd be long gone by now," she said, nodding towards his worn leather jacket.

"Can't escape my past that easily," Brage replied, taking a seat next to her.

The patrons of the tavern eyed them warily, but Lena seemed unfazed. She signaled the bartender for another round and leaned in close.

"I've got information on a job that might interest you," she whispered.

Brage's ears perked up at the mention of work. He had been living off scraps for weeks, ever since his last score went sour. A new mark could be just what he needed to get back on track.

"What is it?" he asked, his curiosity piqued.

Lena handed him a note with a cryptic message scrawled on it. "Meet me at the old windmill on the outskirts of town at midnight," she said, before downing her ale in one swift motion.

Brage tucked the note into his pocket and signaled for the bartender to keep the drinks coming. He spent the next few hours listening to rumors and gossip from the regulars, all the while keeping a weather eye out for any potential threats.

As the night drew to a close, Brage slipped back onto the streets, feeling a spark of excitement reignite within him. The thrill of the hunt was back in his veins, and he knew that with Lena on his side, he could take on anything that came their way.

For now, though, he had a job to plan and execute. And with the windmill looming in the darkness, Brage Alsbach smiled to himself, knowing that the real adventure was only just beginning.
