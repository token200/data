Brage Martinez Lopez was a young and ambitious journalist who had always been drawn to the darker side of human nature. Growing up in a small town in Mexico, she had seen firsthand the effects of corruption and violence on her community. Determined to make a difference, Brage had pursued a career in investigative journalism, determined to shine a light into the darkest corners of society.

Her latest story was about a series of mysterious disappearances in the city's underbelly, where gangs and cartels held sway. Brage spent countless hours interviewing witnesses, scouring police records, and tracking down leads, all in an effort to uncover the truth behind the vanishings.

As she delved deeper into her research, Brage began to feel a sense of unease that she couldn't shake. She was being watched, she was sure of it - and not just by her subjects, but by unseen forces lurking in the shadows. She tried to brush it off as paranoia, but the feeling only grew stronger.

One night, as she was leaving her office, Brage noticed a figure waiting for her outside. It was a man with a scar above his left eyebrow, and he introduced himself only as "El Loco". He handed her a small note with a single sentence scrawled on it: "Turn back now, while you still can".

Brage felt a chill run down her spine as she realized that El Loco must have been following her. But she was not one to be intimidated - at least, not yet. With a newfound determination, Brage tucked the note into her pocket and set off into the night, determined to finish her story no matter what dangers lay ahead.

As she walked, Brage couldn't help but wonder who El Loco was and what he wanted from her. Was he a friend or a foe? And what secrets lay hidden behind his scarred face? Only time would tell, but one thing was certain: Brage Martinez Lopez was in this for the long haul.

With a fierce glint in her eye, she pressed on, ready to face whatever lay ahead. The darkness closed in around her like a shroud, but Brage knew that she was not afraid - she was just getting started.
