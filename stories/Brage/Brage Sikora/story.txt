Brage Sikora stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the small town of Ravenswood. It had been ten years since he'd last set foot in this place, and yet, the familiarity felt like a warm hug on a cold winter's night.

As a child, Brage had lived with his aunt in this very town, where he'd spent countless hours exploring the woods and getting into mischief with his best friend, a boy named Kaito. But life had taken him far away from Ravenswood – to the city streets of New York, where he'd become a rising star in the art world.

Now, as Brage made his way through the quaint streets, he couldn't help but notice how much things had changed. The old diner was still serving up plate after plate of flannel-battered burgers, and the town square was still home to the annual summer festival. But there were new faces, too – tourists, mostly, snapping photos in front of the iconic Ravenswood sign.

Brage's thoughts wandered back to Kaito, who'd long since moved away to chase his own dreams. They'd lost touch over the years, but Brage had heard that Kaito was doing well – making art and selling it for a good price. He couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy; he still painted, but it wasn't like it used to be.

As he turned onto Main Street, Brage spotted his aunt standing outside her old bookstore. She looked older now, but just as warm as ever. "Brage! Oh, it's so great to see you!" she exclaimed, opening her arms wide for a hug.

Over the next few days, Brage settled back into life in Ravenswood. He met up with Kaito, who was indeed doing well – and they spent hours reminiscing about old times over plates of fried chicken at the diner. He even started working on some new art pieces, inspired by the quiet beauty of his hometown.

It wasn't the same as it used to be, but Brage realized that Ravenswood had always been a part of him, whether he was here or not. And for that, he was grateful. As he stood in his aunt's bookstore one evening, surrounded by shelves of dusty novels and familiar scents, Brage felt a sense of peace settle over him.

He took out a sketchbook and began to draw – the trees outside, their branches tangled with snow. He lost himself in the lines and colors, letting the art flow from his fingers like the river that ran through Ravenswood's heart.
