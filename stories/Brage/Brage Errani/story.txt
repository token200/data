Brage Errani stepped into the dimly lit bar, the sounds of clinking glasses and hushed conversations enveloping him like a shroud. A figure in the corner, hood up and face obscured, seemed to be watching him with an unnerving intensity.

The bartender, a grizzled old man named Viktor, raised an eyebrow as Brage slid onto the stool beside him. "What can I get you tonight, Brage?"

"Just whiskey," Brage replied, his voice low and gravelly.

Viktor nodded, pouring a generous shot of amber liquid into a worn glass. As Brage downed it in one gulp, Viktor's gaze lingered on his face. He had seen the shadows that followed Brage Errani like a constant companion, the air around him thick with an almost palpable unease.

"You hear anything new from the Other Side?" Viktor asked, his tone neutral but laced with curiosity.

Brage's eyes seemed to cloud over, and for a moment, it was as if he stared into a realm beyond the mortal world. "Nothing yet," he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper. "But I'm waiting."

The patrons of the bar exchanged uneasy glances, sensing that Brage Errani was more than just a man with a penchant for dark places and lost souls. They knew him to be one who navigated the gray areas between worlds, where the living and the dead blurred into a single, ethereal haze.

As Brage finished his drink, he pushed off from the stool and turned toward the door. The figure in the corner didn't move, its presence undiminished by the passing of time or the ebb and flow of life.

"Wait," Viktor called out, his voice tinged with a mixture of trepidation and concern. "What about Zara?"

Brage's gaze lingered on Viktor for a moment before shifting away. "She'll be fine," he said, his tone flat. "Until the darkness finds her, that is."

And with that, Brage vanished into the night, leaving behind only the faint scent of smoke and the whispers of those who dared to follow him into the shadows.

In the realm of the Other Side, where Brage Errani wandered like a restless spirit, he waited patiently for the call that would draw him back into the world of mortals. The darkness was patient, too, biding its time until it could claim Zara and all those other souls who dared to trespass on its domain.

As for Brage himself? Only the whispers remained, a haunting reminder of his name as a figure lost in the labyrinthine paths between worlds.
