Brage Jensen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the desolate station. It had been years since he'd last set foot in Ravensburg, and yet the familiar sense of unease still lingered. As a child, Brage had spent summers here with his grandparents, listening to their tales of the town's rich history and mythic legends. But as he grew older, he found himself increasingly drawn away from the small, rural community.

Now, at 25, Brage had returned to Ravensburg after a decade abroad, seeking solace in the quiet rhythms of his childhood home. His grandfather, the town's beloved storyteller, had passed away just months prior, leaving behind a legacy of dusty tomes and whispered secrets. Brage aimed to uncover some of those stories himself.

As he made his way through the station, Brage spotted a figure watching him from across the room – an old woman with eyes that seemed to hold a thousand years of knowledge. She beckoned him over with a crooked finger, leading him to a small café tucked away in the station's corner.

 Inside, the air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and worn leather. The woman – whom Brage later learned was Agnes – slid into a booth across from him, her eyes glinting like dark gemstones. "You're back," she said, voice low as smoke. "I've been expecting you."

Over steaming cups of black coffee, Agnes regaled Brage with tales of Ravensburg's forgotten lore: the ghostly whispers in the abandoned mill, the hidden grove where ancient rituals were performed beneath moonlight. As the hours slipped by, Brage found himself enthralled – these stories weren't just relics of a bygone era; they spoke to something deep within him.

But as the night wore on and the café emptied out, Agnes leaned in close, her voice barely audible over the creaking wooden floorboards. "There's one story you shouldn't tell," she whispered, eyes narrowing like winter snowflakes. Brage listened intently, sensing that this was a secret worth keeping.

Agnes vanished into the night, leaving Brage with more questions than answers. Yet he knew one thing: Ravensburg had claimed him once again – and he'd spend years unraveling its mysteries, thread by thread, like a master weaver unwrapping an intricate tapestry. The darkness within these walls was about to become his home.
