Brage Välja was a man shrouded in mystery. His existence was as elusive as a ghost, and few had ever laid eyes on him. Rumors swirled that he was an Estonian revolutionary, fighting against the Soviet occupation of his homeland. Others claimed he was a spy, using his skills to infiltrate the highest echelons of the regime.

The truth was far more complicated.

Brage Välja was born in 1942, just as Estonia was being occupied by the Nazis and later the Soviets. His parents were Estonian nationalists who had fought against both regimes, but Brage himself took a different path. He became a master thief, using his skills to survive in the dark alleys of Tallinn.

As he grew older, Brage's thievery turned to espionage. He worked for a group of Estonian resistance fighters, using his skills to gather intelligence and smuggle information out of the country. But as the years passed, Brage became disillusioned with the violence and bloodshed that came with it.

He began to use his talents for more benevolent purposes. He started a secret network, using his connections to help those in need. Whether it was smuggling vital supplies into besieged cities or providing crucial information to dissidents, Brage's work went unnoticed by most.

But there were those who knew of his exploits. A small group of Estonians had come to trust Brage, recognizing the good that he did in the shadows. They called him "Välja", which meant "outside" in their native language – a fitting nickname for someone who existed outside the reach of authority.

One night, as the Soviet Union was tightening its grip on Estonia, Brage received a message from an old ally. A group of dissidents were being hunted by the authorities, and needed Brage's help to escape. With his skills and network at their disposal, they made it out alive – but not without leaving behind a trail of clues that would lead to Brage.

Years later, as Estonia regained its independence, whispers began to circulate about a mysterious figure who had played a crucial role in the country's freedom. The name "Brage Välja" was never spoken aloud, but those who knew him understood the truth. He was the ghost of Estonian revolution, forever bound to the shadows – but always watching, always waiting for the next opportunity to make a difference.
