Brage Kovalenko stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It had been months since he'd last set foot in Ravenswood, a town where memories both fond and painful lingered around every corner.

As he made his way through the deserted streets, Brage's thoughts turned to the past. He remembered the summers spent playing cricket on the outskirts of town with his friends, their laughter echoing off the hillsides. But those carefree days were long gone, replaced by a sense of restlessness and discontent that had driven him away from Ravenswood all those years ago.

Now, at 30, Brage found himself back in the same town he'd left behind as a teenager, with no clear reason why except for a nagging sense of obligation. He had always been close to his family, particularly his father, who had passed away recently, leaving him feeling lost and without direction.

As he walked, the trees seemed to grow taller, casting long shadows across the pavement. Brage's footsteps slowed, and he found himself standing in front of the old stone cottage where he'd grown up. The windows were boarded up, and the door hung crookedly on its hinges, as if waiting for someone to come home.

He pushed open the creaking door and stepped inside, his eyes adjusting to the dim light within. The air was thick with dust and memories, each corner of the room holding a story or two from Brage's past. He wandered through the rooms, taking in the familiar sights and sounds, before coming to rest on the old armchair by the window.

Brage Kovalenko sat down, feeling the weight of his years settle upon him like a shroud. It was time to confront the demons that had driven him away from Ravenswood so many years ago, and face whatever lay ahead with courage and determination.
