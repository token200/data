Brage Becker was a man with a mysterious past, and his enigmatic smile seemed to hide secrets that only he knew. As a former hitman, he had spent years working for various crime syndicates, taking on high-stakes jobs and eliminating targets with precision and ease. But after a stint in prison, Brage had decided to leave the business behind and start anew.

Now, at 35, Brage was trying to make a go of it as a freelance writer. He worked odd jobs for small publishers and magazines, churning out articles on everything from true crime to sci-fi novels. His writing style was raw and unapologetic, like his persona - rugged, yet oddly captivating.

Despite his newfound love of words, Brage couldn't shake off his reputation. People would spot him in a crowded room and do a double take, unsure whether they were staring at a former assassin or a mild-mannered writer. Brage didn't mind the whispers and pointed fingers; he was used to being an outsider.

One day, while working on a piece about serial killers for a major newspaper, Brage received an offer to interview his old boss, Victor Vex. The man had been instrumental in setting Brage on his path of violence, but now Vex seemed willing to make amends - or perhaps simply to use Brage as leverage.

As Brage sat down with Vex in a cramped café, he couldn't help but wonder what the old man wanted from him. Did he really want closure, or was it just another way for Victor to exert control over his former protégé? Brage listened intently as Vex recounted stories of their past escapades, and an unsettling familiarity crept in.

For a moment, it felt like no time had passed at all - the old habits and emotions came flooding back. But then Brage looked away, focusing on the words flowing across his notebook page. He scribbled furiously, his pen moving in time with the sound of Vex's smooth voice. It was almost as if he were writing about someone else - a man he'd left behind years ago.

Brage Becker's past still lingered, but for now, it was just background noise. As he finished the interview and walked out into the city streets, he knew that his words would be his shield against the shadows of his own making.
