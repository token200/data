Brage Sharma stood at the edge of the cliff, gazing out at the vast expanse of ocean before him. The wind whipped through his dark hair, carrying the scent of salt and seaweed. He was a man who found solace in solitude, and the rugged coastline had become his sanctuary.

As a former soldier, Brage had seen his fair share of battles. But after leaving the military, he couldn't shake the feeling of restlessness that lingered within him. The trauma he'd witnessed on the battlefield still lingered, refusing to be silenced by the passing of time.

Brage took a deep breath, the cool ocean air filling his lungs. He closed his eyes, letting the tranquility of the moment wash over him. The world seemed quieter here â€“ the only sounds the waves crashing against the shore and the cries of seagulls wheeling overhead.

His thoughts wandered to his family, whom he'd left behind when he joined the military. His wife, Lena, had been his rock, supporting him through the darkest days. But even their love hadn't been enough to shield him from the horrors he'd endured.

As Brage opened his eyes, a figure emerged from the distance. It was an old man, dressed in worn jeans and a faded fishing jacket, with a weathered face creased by years of squinting against the sun. The stranger approached him with a slow pace, his eyes locked on Brage's.

"You're not like the others," the old man said, his voice low and gravelly. "You've got a weight upon you, one that presses down upon your shoulders."

Brage felt a jolt of surprise. How did this stranger know? He'd long ago pushed away those who cared for him, fearing he was too much to bear.

The old man continued, his words dripping with wisdom. "I, too, have known the weight of carrying burdens. But I've learned that sometimes, it's necessary to let go of what you cannot carry."

In that moment, something shifted within Brage. The fog began to clear from his mind, and he saw a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, there was a way for him to find peace, not by carrying the weight of his past but by learning to release it.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the sky in hues of gold and pink, Brage nodded at the old man. "Thank you," he said softly. And in that moment, he felt the first tentative steps towards healing begin to take place.
