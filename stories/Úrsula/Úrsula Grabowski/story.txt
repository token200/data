Úrsula was overjoyed and quickly accepted the offer. With this opportunity, she knew that her art would finally reach the wider world beyond Willow Creek.

Henry's gallery was filled with admirers eager to see the enigmatic artist's latest creations. As for Úrsula Grabowski, she stood proudly among her art, basking in the knowledge that her hard work had finally paid off.
