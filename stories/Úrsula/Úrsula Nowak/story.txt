Úrsula Nowak stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting by the window, his dark hair messy and his eyes lost in thought. It had been months since they'd last spoken, and Úrsula couldn't help but feel a pang of curiosity about what had brought him to this place.

As she made her way through the sea of strangers, Úrsula's mind wandered back to their past encounters. There was the time they'd spent hours discussing literature in university, their debates raging like a never-ending storm. And then there was the night they'd gotten lost in the city, wandering hand in hand through streets that seemed to stretch on forever.

Úrsula finally reached her destination and slid into the empty chair across from him. "Mind if I join you?" she asked, trying to sound nonchalant despite the butterflies in her stomach.

Her companion looked up, a hint of surprise on his face before breaking into a warm smile. "Not at all," he replied, his voice low and smooth. "I was starting to think I'd have to find someone else to keep me company."

Úrsula laughed, feeling a sense of ease wash over her. They chatted for hours, reminiscing about old times and making plans for the future. Úrsula felt like she'd known him forever, their connection still strong despite the distance between them.

As the sun began to set outside, casting a golden glow over the café, Úrsula realized that she was grateful for this chance encounter. It had been months since she'd seen him, but it felt like no time at all. She leaned back in her chair, feeling a sense of contentment wash over her. This was what life was all about – unexpected moments with people who truly understood you.

The hours slipped away, and Úrsula finally stood up to leave. As she reached for her coat, her companion grasped her arm, his eyes locking onto hers. "I'm glad I ran into you," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "And I'm glad I got to meet your new name – Úrsula Nowak – again."
