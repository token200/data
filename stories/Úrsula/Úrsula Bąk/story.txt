Úrsula Bąk was an enigmatic figure, shrouded in mystery and whispered about in hushed tones among those who knew her. Her eyes seemed to hold secrets, pools of dark water that drew you in but refused to yield their depths. Few people had ever seen her smile, and those who claimed it was said to be a fleeting thing, a brief flash of something like joy before she vanished into the shadows.

Úrsula was a master weaver, renowned for her exquisite tapestries woven from threads of every color and texture. Her work seemed to hold the essence of life itself, as if the very fabric of reality had been woven into its intricate patterns. Some said that her loom was magical, imbuing the threads with hidden powers.

Yet Úrsula's gifts were not without a price. Many who commissioned her work reported experiencing vivid, disturbing dreams after completing their tapestries. Others claimed to have lost precious items or heard whispers in their ears when the weaving was done. Some even whispered that Úrsula had made pacts with dark forces, trading away bits of one's soul for every thread.

I first encountered Úrsula on a rainy night, huddled over her loom in a cramped attic space above a dusty antique shop. I had heard rumors about her work and was both fascinated and repelled by the stories. As I watched, she wove with slow, deliberate strokes, as if each thread held the weight of the world.

When she finally looked up at me, our eyes met for an instant before her gaze dropped away, leaving me feeling both uneasy and drawn to her. She offered me a piece of fabric, woven from threads that shimmered like moonlight on water, and I knew then that I was under her spell.

I asked her what secrets she had woven into the tapestry, and Úrsula merely smiled – a fleeting thing, indeed – before vanishing into the shadows. The next morning, I found myself lost in a labyrinth of twisted corridors and forgotten rooms, with only the whispers of the threads to guide me back to reality.

I returned to find Úrsula long gone, her loom silent and still. But as I reached for the tapestry, I felt an unseen presence wrap itself around my heart, reminding me that some secrets were better left unsaid, and that the price of beauty was often paid in the currency of our souls.
