Úrsula Emily Thomas was a name that commanded respect, but few people knew the person behind it. Born to a family of modest means, Úrsula grew up with a fierce determination to succeed. She worked multiple jobs while pursuing her education, earning a degree in engineering and landing a high-paying job at a prestigious firm.
