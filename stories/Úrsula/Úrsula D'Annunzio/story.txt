Úrsula D'Annunzio stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him across the way, sipping on a coffee and staring out the window at the rain-soaked streets of Paris. It had been years since they last met, but Úrsula could still recall the intensity of their conversations like it was yesterday.

As she made her way over to the table, he looked up and caught her eye. His gaze lingered for a moment before returning to his coffee, as if trying to gauge whether or not to acknowledge her presence. Úrsula smiled wryly to herself; she knew better than to push him.

She slid into the chair across from him, her hands wrapped around a cup of steaming hot tea. "Mind if I join you?" she asked, her voice husky with a hint of Italian accent.

He shook his head, still not meeting her eye. Úrsula leaned back in her chair, letting out a deep sigh. They had once been inseparable, bound together by their love of art and philosophy. But life had taken its toll, and they'd drifted apart like two ships passing in the night.

As she sipped her tea, Úrsula couldn't help but think about what could have been if they'd stayed together. Would they have created something beautiful, a fusion of their talents that would have changed the world? Or would they have simply existed, lost in each other's orbits?

The waiter arrived to take their order, and Úrsula opted for a simple salad while her companion ordered a plate of escargots. As they waited for their food to arrive, the silence between them felt like a palpable thing, thick with unspoken words.

When the waiter departed, Úrsula finally broke the silence. "What brings you back to Paris?" she asked, her voice softer than before.

He looked up at her then, his eyes searching hers as if trying to recall something long forgotten. "I came for the same reason I left," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "The city calls to me, Úrsula D'Annunzio."
