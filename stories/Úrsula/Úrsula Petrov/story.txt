Úrsula Petrov stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Leonid, sipping on a cup of coffee in the corner and made her way over.

As she approached, Leonid looked up and smiled. "Úrsula! It's been too long," he said, standing up to greet her with a warm hug.

Úrsula returned the gesture, feeling a sense of relief wash over her as she settled into the booth across from him. She had been traveling for weeks, trying to escape the memories that haunted her. But being back in Moscow felt like coming home – if "home" was defined by the familiar rhythms and routines of Úrsula Petrov's life.

The café bustled with activity as they ordered their drinks and began to catch up on each other's lives. Úrsula filled Leonid in on her latest art project, a series of paintings inspired by her favorite Soviet-era architecture. She had always been fascinated by the intricate details and grandiose designs that seemed to spring from nowhere.

Leonid listened intently as Úrsula spoke about her passion for history and preservation. He nodded thoughtfully, his eyes lighting up with interest. "I never knew you were so passionate about it," he said, leaning forward in his seat.

Úrsula smiled wryly, feeling a sense of nostalgia wash over her. It was hard to believe that she had spent years studying and working on the very thing that now filled her days – but also haunted her at night. She pushed the thoughts aside, focusing on the present moment as Úrsula Petrov sat across from her dear friend.

As they continued to chat, the hours slipped by unnoticed. The world outside receded into the background as Úrsula and Leonid lost themselves in conversation, their words flowing easily back and forth like a well-rehearsed dance.
