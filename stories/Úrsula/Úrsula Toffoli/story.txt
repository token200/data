Úrsula Toffoli was known for her sharp wit and quick tongue in the underground art scene. As a painter, she had gained recognition for her unique blend of street art and surrealist techniques. Her bold works of art could be seen adorning the walls of abandoned buildings throughout the city.

One evening, Úrsula received an invitation from the enigmatic curator, Mr. Harrington, to showcase her work at his new gallery. He promised that it would be a night to remember, with the who's who of the art world in attendance. Úrsula was hesitant at first, but the prospect of exposure and criticism from the right people won her over.

As the night of the exhibition arrived, Úrsula set up her stand and waited anxiously for the guests to arrive. The gallery was dimly lit, with an eerie silence hanging over the crowd. Suddenly, a voice echoed through the room, "Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to my humble abode...". Mr. Harrington made his entrance, resplendent in his tailored suit, his eyes scanning the room with an air of superiority.

Úrsula watched from her corner of the gallery as Mr. Harrington worked the crowd, shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries with the patrons. She was approached by a few collectors and critics, all eager to discuss her art and its meaning. Úrsula fielded their questions confidently, her charm and charisma on full display.

However, as the night wore on, Úrsula began to feel a growing sense of unease. Mr. Harrington seemed overly interested in her work, almost possessive. He would often interrupt her conversations with other attendees, asking pointed questions about her inspiration and techniques. It was as if he was trying to prove that he knew more about her art than she did herself.

Úrsula's unease turned to anger as the evening drew to a close. She excused herself from Mr. Harrington and made her way home, her mind reeling with thoughts of betrayal. As she lay in bed, she couldn't help but wonder if Úrsula Toffoli had been too eager to please. The memory of Mr. Harrington's condescending smile still lingered in her mind, a bitter taste that refused to be washed away.

The next morning, Úrsula received an email from Mr. Harrington, offering her a solo exhibition at his gallery in the near future. She deleted it without hesitation, knowing that she had made the right decision by distancing herself from him. From now on, Úrsula Toffoli would chart her own course, free from the manipulations of those who sought to control her art and her identity.
