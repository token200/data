In the bustling streets of Taipei, a young woman named Úrsula Tzu-chi navigated through the crowded alleys with ease. Her long black hair flowed behind her like a river, and her bright brown eyes sparkled with curiosity as she took in the sights and sounds of the city.

Úrsula was no ordinary Taiwanese girl. She possessed a unique gift – the ability to communicate with animals. As a child, she had discovered that she could understand the language of creatures, from the chirping of birds to the chattering of monkeys. Her parents, both Buddhist monks, had recognized her talent and encouraged her to hone it.

As Úrsula walked through the market, she came across a group of vendors selling exotic animals. She knelt down beside a small rabbit, speaking softly to calm its trembling heart. The rabbit nuzzled her hand, and Úrsula smiled, knowing that she had made a new friend.

A nearby vendor noticed Úrsula's affection for the rabbit and approached her. "You have a gift, little one," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "Many believe that our city is cursed by the spirits of old."

Úrsula looked up at him warily, but the vendor continued, "Some say that a powerful sorceress, known only as the White Tiger, once ruled over Taipei. Her spirit still lingers, causing chaos and destruction wherever she goes."

 Úrsula's ears perked up at the mention of the White Tiger. She had heard stories of the legendary creature, but never thought she would encounter her. The vendor handed her a small, intricately carved wooden box.

"For you," he said, his eyes glinting with a knowing look. "A gift from an old friend. Open it when the time is right."

With that, Úrsula Tzu-chi tucked the box into her bag and continued on her way, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. She knew that she would need all her wits and cunning to outsmart the White Tiger and restore peace to the city.

As she disappeared into the crowd, the vendor watched her go with a sense of pride. Úrsula Tzu-chi was indeed a special young woman, one who possessed the heart and courage to take on even the most formidable foes.
