Elsa Kovacs stepped out of her small apartment and into the chilly morning air, taking a deep breath as she gazed up at the city skyline. As a freelance writer, she had grown accustomed to working from home, but sometimes she needed a change of scenery. The sounds and smells of the bustling streets were invigorating, if a bit overwhelming.

As she walked to the nearest café, Elsa's mind began to wander back to her latest article. She was researching the history of Budapest, her favorite city in the world. Her fingers drummed against her thigh as she mentally arranged the facts into a coherent narrative.

Upon arriving at the café, Elsa spotted a familiar face across the room – her best friend and fellow writer, Szabi Gergely. They exchanged warm smiles and made their way to their usual table by the window.

"Good morning, Kovacs," Szabi said, nodding in greeting. "I see you're as efficient as ever."

Elsa chuckled, settling into her seat. "Someone has to keep up with my demanding editors back in Paris."

As they sipped their coffee and went over their respective projects, the conversation flowed easily from one topic to another. It was moments like these that Elsa cherished – quiet evenings spent with a friend, discussing everything and nothing.

After a few hours of writing and catching up, Elsa closed her laptop and stood up, stretching her arms overhead. "Time for me to get back to work," she said, smiling at Szabi. "I have a deadline to meet."

Szabi nodded, standing as well. "Good luck with it, Kovacs. I'm sure you'll ace it, as always."
