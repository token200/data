The team leader, Dr. Kathryn Lee, was impressed by Elsa's connection to the animal and asked for her assistance in communicating with the bear. Elsa agreed, and over several tense meetings, she was able to understand the bear's needs and help the scientists find a way to peacefully resolve the situation.

With her gift still working its magic, Elsa continued to make a positive impact on the world around her.
