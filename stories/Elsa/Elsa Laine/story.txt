Elsa Laine stood alone in the empty ice rink, her breath misting in the cold air. As a child prodigy figure skater, she had spent countless hours on this very same ice, perfecting her craft and pushing herself to new heights.

But now, at 25, Elsa felt trapped. She had retired from competitive skating years ago, opting instead for a quieter life as a children's party entertainer. It was a far cry from the pressure-cooker world of elite figure skating, but it allowed her to keep her hands busy and bring joy to young faces.

As she gazed out at the rink, Elsa's mind wandered back to her glory days. She remembered the thrill of landing a triple axel, the rush of adrenaline as she took the ice for the first time, and the countless hours spent perfecting her technique under the watchful eye of her coach, Marie.

Elsa's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of laughter and chatter coming from outside the rink. A group of children had arrived for a birthday party, and Elsa was ready to put on a show. She laced up her skates, adjusted her sparkly costume, and took to the ice once more.

As she twirled and leaped across the rink, Elsa felt a sense of freedom she hadn't experienced in years. It was like she was back in her teenage years, competing for medals and glory on the international stage. The crowd cheered as she executed a flawless triple lutz, and Elsa couldn't help but smile.

For a few fleeting moments, Elsa Laine was 15 again, careening across the ice with abandon and joy. As the party came to an end and the children departed, Elsa took one final lap around the rink, savoring the feeling of being on top of her game.

As she stepped off onto dry land, Elsa felt a sense of contentment wash over her. She may not be the world's greatest figure skater anymore, but she was still able to bring happiness to others through her art. And that, she thought with a smile, was all that truly mattered.
