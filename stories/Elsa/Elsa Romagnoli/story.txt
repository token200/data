Elsa Romagnoli stepped onto the bustling streets of Rome, her long, curly brown hair bouncing with each step. A native Roman, she knew every nook and cranny of the city like the back of her hand. But despite her familiarity with the city, Elsa felt lost. She had just received news that her beloved nonno, Giovanni Romagnoli, was in a coma at the local hospital.

Determined to be by his side, Elsa hastened towards the hospital, her heels clicking on the pavement. As she burst through the doors, a sea of worried faces turned towards her. Her sister, Francesca, rushed forward to envelop her in a tight hug.

"Elsa, cara, we're so glad you're here," Francesca whispered, tears streaming down her face.

Elsa's eyes welled up with tears as she took in the scene before her. The hospital room was filled with anxious family members and friends, all gathered around Giovanni's bedside. Elsa's heart ached as she saw her nonno's frail body, hooked up to machines beeping softly.

As the minutes ticked by, Elsa stood vigil beside her father's side, holding his hand tightly. She had always been close to her nonno, learning traditional Italian recipes from him in the kitchen and listening to stories of their ancestors' bravery during World War II. The thought of losing him was unbearable.

Just as Elsa was starting to feel overwhelmed, her phone buzzed with a text from her sister. "Nonna is on her way," Francesca wrote. "She's going to stay with you until Giovanni wakes up."

Elsa smiled faintly, feeling a glimmer of hope. Her nonno might be in a coma, but he was never truly alone. With the love and support of his family surrounding him, he would fight this illness with all his might.

As the hours passed, Elsa stood by her father's side, holding his hand and talking to him softly. She knew that soon, Giovanni Romagnoli would be back on his feet, laughing and joking like always. And until then, she would be there for him, unwavering and unshakeable.
