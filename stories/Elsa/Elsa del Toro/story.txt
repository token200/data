Her parents, Juan and Maria del Toro, were both renowned performers in their own right, and they had instilled in Elsa a love of creative expression from a very young age.

As she grew older, Elsa's talents began to shine through. She started writing her own songs and performing them at local open mic nights, where she quickly gained a following among fellow musicians and music enthusiasts alike. It wasn't long before Echoes in the Dark was formed, with Elsa as its lead vocalist.

Under Elsa del Toro's guidance, the band took off like wildfire, playing sold-out shows across the country and racking up critical acclaim for their energetic live performances and emotionally charged songs. But behind the scenes, Elsa struggled to balance her creative passions with the pressures of fame and the demands of a tight touring schedule.

Despite these challenges, Elsa del Toro remained committed to her art, using music as a means of expression and catharsis in equal measure. Her songs were confessional, honest, and deeply personal, drawing on her own experiences with love, loss, and heartbreak. And it was this vulnerability that connected with fans like nothing else, making Echoes in the Dark a band to watch – and listen to.

For Elsa del Toro, music was more than just a career or a hobby – it was who she was, both inside and out. It was her escape from the pressures of everyday life, as well as her gateway to self-expression and creative freedom.
