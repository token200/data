Elsa Jasinska trudged through the snow-covered streets of her small town, her eyes fixed on the ground as if willing the flakes to disappear. She hated this time of year, when everyone's smiles seemed to fade like the fading light.

As she turned a corner, Elsa spotted him â€“ Finnley Walker, the boy who had captured her heart with his bright smile and infectious laugh. They'd been friends since childhood, but lately, their friendship had taken a different turn.

Elsa quickened her pace, her boots crunching on the frozen gravel. She didn't want to be seen by Finnley just yet; she needed time to figure out how to feel about him in a way other than friendship. As she approached the town square, Elsa caught sight of Finnley standing alone, his arms wrapped around himself like a shawl.

She slowed down, unsure if she should approach or keep her distance. But something about Finnley's posture tugged at her heartstrings. She took a deep breath and stepped forward, the snow crunching beneath her feet.

Finnley turned, his eyes locking onto hers with an unspoken question. Elsa hesitated for a moment before breaking into a tentative smile. "Hey," she said softly.

The familiar warmth of their friendship flickered to life like a spark igniting dry leaves. Finnley's face lit up, and he ambled towards her, his boots trudging through the snow. As they stood together in silence, Elsa felt the weight of her emotions shift, like ice melting under the warm rays of the sun.

"Hey," Finnley said finally, his voice low and gentle. "What's on your mind?"

Elsa hesitated, unsure how to express the mix of feelings swirling inside her. She thought about her full name, Elsa Jasinska, and how it felt strange to be thinking of herself as more than just a town girl.

"Nothing," she lied softly, not quite ready to reveal her true self.

Finnley nodded, his eyes searching hers, but he didn't push the issue. Instead, he wrapped an arm around her shoulders, pulling her close in the quiet, wintry night.
