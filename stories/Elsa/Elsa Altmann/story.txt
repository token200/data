Elsa Altmann trudged through the snow-covered streets, her eyes fixed on the small cottage in the distance. It was a place she had always called home, where the memories of her past lingered like the frost on the windows.

As she approached the door, Elsa felt a mix of emotions swirling inside her. She had left this life behind years ago, fleeing from the scrutiny and expectations that came with being the Altmann princess. But now, she was back, seeking refuge in the quiet solitude of the countryside.

Elsa pushed open the door and slipped inside, releasing a sigh of relief as the warmth enveloped her. The cottage was small, but it was hers, filled with the familiar scents and sounds of her childhood. She moved quietly, not wanting to disturb the stillness, as she made her way to the kitchen.

As she began to prepare dinner, Elsa's mind wandered back to her life in the castle. She remembered the lavish balls, the diplomatic meetings, and the constant attention from the royal family. But most of all, she remembered the isolation, the feeling of being trapped behind a mask of perfectness.

Elsa smiled wistfully as she chopped the vegetables for stew. She was no longer that person, at least not on the surface. The real Elsa Altmann had been hiding in plain sight, her true self locked away behind a wall of ice and snow.

As she cooked, the aroma of simmering stew filled the cottage, transporting Elsa back to happier times. She thought of her sister, Anna, who had never stopped believing in her, even when she couldn't believe in herself. The two sisters had grown apart over the years, but Elsa knew that their bond was unbreakable.

As the sun set outside, casting a golden glow over the cottage, Elsa felt a sense of peace settle within her. She was home now, and for the first time in years, she felt like herself again.
