Born Luisa Yang in Shanghai, China, she had always been passionate about cooking. Her parents, both skilled chefs themselves, encouraged her interest from a young age, teaching her the intricacies of traditional Chinese cuisine. As she grew older, Luisa's passion only intensified, and she decided to pursue a career in culinary arts.

After completing culinary school, Luisa worked her way up through various restaurants, honing her skills and building a network of contacts within the industry. Eventually, she landed a job at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Paris, where she refined her technique and learned from some of the best chefs in the world.

Despite the demands of running a busy restaurant, Luisa remained committed to using only the freshest ingredients and supporting local suppliers.

One evening, as she was prepping for the dinner service, Luisa's sous chef, Maria, approached her with an idea. "Luisa, have you ever thought of expanding our menu to include more vegetarian options?" Maria asked. Luisa's eyes lit up as she considered the possibility. It was a great idea, and one that would not only cater to the growing demand for plant-based cuisine but also showcase her creativity and commitment to using only the freshest ingredients.

Luisa Yang smiled to herself as she pondered the possibilities. With Maria's help, she would create a new menu that was both innovative and delicious. The future of "Saffron" looked bright, and Luisa couldn't wait to share it with her customers.
