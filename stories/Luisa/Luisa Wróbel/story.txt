Luisa Wróbel stepped into the bustling café, her eyes scanning the crowded room for any sign of her friend. She spotted him sitting at a corner table, sipping on a cup of coffee and staring intently at his laptop screen. Luisa made her way through the throng of people, exchanging nods and hellos with the regular patrons.

As she approached her friend's table, he looked up and flashed a warm smile. "Hey, Lu! What brings you here?" Luisa slid into the chair across from him, taking in the sight of his messy brown hair and the lines of code streaming across his screen.

"Just grabbing a coffee before I head to work," she replied, running her fingers through her own dark hair. She took a sip of the rich, bold brew, feeling it revive her after a long morning of editing. Luisa Wróbel had always been a night owl, content to spend hours poring over manuscripts and making notes in the quiet of the evening.

Her friend chuckled, nodding sympathetically. "I know the feeling. Sometimes I feel like I'm stuck in a never-ending cycle of code and caffeine." Luisa laughed, recognizing the sentiment. She and her friend had met in college, bonding over their shared love of literature and writing.

As they chatted, Luisa Wróbel found herself lost in conversation with her friend, discussing everything from the latest literary trends to their personal struggles. It was a rare moment of connection for both of them, one that came only when they were able to put aside their individual pursuits and simply be together.

Eventually, Luisa's friend excused himself, citing an urgent deadline to meet. Luisa watched him disappear into the crowd before turning her attention back to her own coffee cup. She took a sip, feeling the warmth spread through her veins as she settled in for a few minutes of quiet contemplation. The world outside receded, and all that was left was the gentle hum of the café's machines and the soft beat of her own heart.
