Luisa Hassan was a force to be reckoned with. The 35-year-old Somali-British entrepreneur and activist had made a name for herself in London's business community, but it was her tireless work on social justice that truly set her apart.

Born and raised in East London, Luisa had grown up witnessing firsthand the effects of poverty and inequality on her community. Her parents, who had fled Somalia as refugees, had worked tirelessly to build a better life for their family, but they had also seen how systemic issues like racism and xenophobia held them back.

Determined to make a difference, Luisa pursued a degree in social policy and began working with local charities and advocacy groups. She quickly realized that the key to creating lasting change was not just about speaking out, but about building coalitions and mobilizing people to take action.

In 2015, Luisa co-founded "Sahar," a grassroots organization dedicated to empowering migrant women and girls in East London. Through Sahar's work, she had helped hundreds of women access education, employment training, and healthcare services, and had also challenged discriminatory practices by local authorities and service providers.

As Sahar grew, so did Luisa's profile. She began speaking at conferences and events around the world, sharing her story and advocating for greater recognition of migrant women's experiences. Her message was simple yet powerful: that everyone deserves dignity, respect, and equal opportunities, regardless of their background or nationality.

Luisa's work had also caught the attention of local politicians, who sought her counsel on policy matters affecting migrant communities. In 2020, she was appointed as a special advisor to the Mayor of London on issues related to migration and social inclusion.

Despite the many demands on her time, Luisa remained committed to Sahar's core mission. She continued to work tirelessly with volunteers and partners, always seeking new ways to amplify their voices and advance their cause.

One evening, as she was leaving a meeting with government officials, Luisa received a text from her mother, who had been watching from afar. "You are changing the world, mummy," it read. Luisa smiled, feeling a sense of pride and purpose that she knew would stay with her for years to come.
