After completing high school, Klara Ayumi decided to pursue a degree in music at a prestigious university. There, she was exposed to various genres and styles, broadening her musical horizons. Her time at university was marked by late-night jam sessions with fellow musicians and rigorous practice sessions that pushed her boundaries as an artist.

Upon graduation, Klara Ayumi landed a job at a local jazz club, where she could perform regularly and learn from the best musicians in town. It was here that she met fellow saxophonist and composer, Takashi, who would become a lifelong friend and collaborator.
