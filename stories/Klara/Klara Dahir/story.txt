After completing her education, Klara moved to Nairobi, Kenya, where she landed an internship at a local newspaper. She quickly proved herself to be a talented writer and researcher, and soon found herself working on more prestigious projects.

One day, Klara received a tip about a potential scandal involving a high-ranking government official. Intrigued, she began to dig deeper, pouring over documents and conducting interviews with sources close to the official.
