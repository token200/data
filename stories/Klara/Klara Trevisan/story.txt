Klara Trevisan stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of life. As an immortal being, she had grown accustomed to observing humanity from a distance, but it was moments like these that reminded her of what she had been missing.

She took a seat at the bar, ordering a cup of black coffee as she gazed out the window. The rain pattered against the glass, casting a rhythmic melody that seemed to match the beat of her own heart. Klara Trevisan had lived for centuries, accumulating knowledge and wisdom like a treasure trove. Yet, with each passing year, she found herself drawn to the simple pleasures of human existence.

As she sipped her coffee, a young couple entered the café, holding hands and laughing together. Their joy was infectious, and Klara Trevisan felt a pang in her chest. She had witnessed countless moments like this over the centuries – first loves, weddings, birthdays, and goodbyes. Each one etched into her memory, a reminder of what it meant to be human.

The couple settled into a booth near the window, lost in their own little world. Klara Trevisan watched them, fascinated by their vulnerability. She had long since shed the need for attachments, embracing the freedom that came with immortality. But there was something about this young pair that drew her in, a sense of hope and possibility.

As the rain intensified outside, the couple began to whisper, sharing secrets and dreams with one another. Klara Trevisan listened, mesmerized by their intimacy. She felt a strange sense of longing, as if she were witnessing a moment from her own past. For a fleeting instant, she forgot about her immortal existence, forgetting that she was just an observer.

The couple finished their coffee, smiling at each other before leaving into the stormy night. Klara Trevisan remained seated, lost in thought. She knew she would never truly be a part of this world, but for moments like these, she felt connected to it in ways she couldn't explain. As she stood to leave, she smiled wistfully, feeling the weight of her centuries-long existence settle upon her shoulders once more.
