Klara Fliesbach was a recluse, preferring the solitude of her small, cluttered apartment to the bustling streets of Berlin. Few people knew much about her, and those who did often whispered stories of her mysterious past.

As a child, Klara had been an outcast in her family's nomadic circus troupe. Her parents were fortune tellers and performers, but Klara was different – she was born with synesthesia, the ability to see numbers and patterns as colors and shapes. While her siblings could see only black and white, Klara's world was a kaleidoscope of hues.

One fateful night, Klara's family left Berlin in search of new audiences for their show. But during a freak storm, Klara became separated from her parents and siblings. When the circus finally arrived at its next destination, Klara was nowhere to be found.

Years passed, and the Fliesbachs eventually lost contact with each other. Some said Klara had joined another traveling troupe or even eloped with a fellow performer. Others claimed she'd been spirited away by an eccentric patron, her synesthesia making her uniquely valuable as a fortune teller's assistant.

But Klara knew none of this was true. She remembered the storm and her frantic search for her family, but after that, everything went dark. When she finally emerged from her long slumber in Berlin, she found herself alone and adrift, surrounded by unfamiliar sights and sounds.

Now, as a grown woman, Klara lived a simple life, keeping to herself and relying on her keen senses to navigate the city. Her apartment was a testament to her unique vision – shelves lined with glowing LED lights, geometric patterns on every surface, and a perpetual haze of incense hanging in the air like a shroud.

Despite her isolation, Klara felt an intense connection to the world around her. She could see numbers and shapes etched into every brick façade, every fluttering leaf on the trees outside, and every beat of the human heart that passed through her door.

And when strangers came knocking on her apartment door, seeking answers or guidance, Klara would listen – always listening – for in the world's colors and patterns, she saw hidden truths waiting to be deciphered.
