Klara Laan trudged through the dusty streets, her eyes scanning the crowded market stalls for any sign of the message she had received. The small town of New Eden was always buzzing with activity, but to Klara, it felt like a different world altogether.

As a skilled hacker and information broker, Klara had built a reputation for herself as someone who could uncover even the most sensitive secrets. And now, she had been approached by a mysterious client with a job that promised more than just a simple payday.

The message had read simply: "Meet me at the old windmill on the outskirts of town at midnight. Come alone." Klara's instincts told her to be wary, but her curiosity got the better of her. She couldn't resist the thrill of the unknown.

As she approached the abandoned windmill, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was an old man with piercing blue eyes and a mop of white hair.

"Klara Laan," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "I've heard a lot about you."

Klara's instincts went on high alert, but she kept her expression neutral. "And I've heard even more about you," she replied, her tone dripping with sarcasm.

The old man chuckled. "I'm not here to play games, Klara. I have information that could change the course of history. And I need your skills to get it out."

Klara raised an eyebrow. "What kind of information?"

The old man leaned in close. "A confidential document, hidden away by the government. It contains evidence of a massive corruption scandal that goes all the way to the top."

Klara's eyes widened as she took in the implications. This was big. Very big.

"Tell me more," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

The old man handed her a small device containing the document. "Get it out there, Klara. And make sure they know that New Eden is watching."

With that, he disappeared into the night, leaving Klara alone with the weight of the world on her shoulders. She smiled to herself as she turned to leave, already thinking about how she was going to get this job done.

The old man's words echoed in her mind: "New Eden is watching." And she knew exactly what that meant.
