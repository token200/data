Klara Kalniņš stepped out into the chill autumn air, her eyes fixed on the worn stone wall that loomed before her. The city's grey buildings seemed to blend together, indistinguishable from one another in the drizzle that shrouded them.

She had lost count of days since she'd last spoken with anyone. The weight of her silence had become almost a burden, one she was determined to shake. Klara pulled a small notebook from her jacket pocket and flipped through its yellowed pages. A poem scrawled across the first page seemed to mock her now: "When silence is my only friend..."

A faint rustling sound came from behind the wall. Klara's eyes narrowed as a figure emerged, hood up and face obscured by shadows.

"You're looking for someone," she stated flatly, not bothering with small talk.

The stranger hesitated before nodding once, then dropped their head in an almost imperceptible gesture of submission. "Just trying to find answers," they muttered, voice barely audible over the rain's relentless patter.

Klara took a step closer, eyes never leaving theirs. "You don't know what it means to lose everything. To be left with nothing but echoes."

She opened her mouth to continue, but words failed her. Instead, she nodded once, and turned away from the stranger. Behind the worn stone wall lay a labyrinth of narrow alleys, each one bearing a faintly different history.

As they wandered together, the rain began to subside. Raindrops still clung to their eyelashes like tears. The city's sounds – chatter, horns blaring, footsteps echoing off walls – created a disorienting cacophony that threatened to overwhelm Klara at every turn.

They passed a child playing with scraps of paper, laughing in the downpour as she danced through puddles filled with rainwater and discarded trash. A man hawking newspapers on the corner caught their eye, the morning headlines announcing some new catastrophe or crisis.

The streets twisted deeper into themselves until they emerged onto a square crowded with people from all walks of life – young couples holding hands, families picnicking under umbrellas, gruff old men playing cards with strangers. Klara found herself wanting to belong among them all, if only for an instant.

But time had no patience, and before she could fully surrender, the stranger spoke up once more. "Do you know where I can find it?"
