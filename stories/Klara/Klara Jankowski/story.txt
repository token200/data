Klara Jankowski stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the sleepy station for any sign of familiarity. She had been traveling for days, ever since she left behind the only home she had ever known. The small town of Ravensburg, nestled in the rolling hills of rural Poland, was a world away from the bustling streets of Warsaw, where Klara now found herself.

As she collected her suitcase and made her way through the crowded station, Klara's mind wandered back to the life she left behind. Her parents had passed away when she was young, leaving her in the care of her aunt, who had raised her as one of her own. But with her 18th birthday came a new reality: Klara was an orphan, and the state was obligated to provide for her.

The letter from the Warsaw Orphanage had arrived unexpectedly, offering Klara a place at their prestigious boarding school. It was a chance to escape the poverty and hardship of Ravensburg, to learn the skills necessary to build a better life for herself. And so, with a mixture of excitement and trepidation, Klara set out on her journey.

As she made her way through the city streets, Klara marveled at the towering skyscrapers and bustling cafes that seemed to stretch on forever. She had never seen anything like it before, and the cacophony of sounds and smells was almost overwhelming. But despite the initial overwhelm, Klara felt a sense of wonder and excitement wash over her. This was her chance to start anew, to forge a new path for herself.

As she walked, the imposing spires of the orphanage loomed ahead, its stone fa√ßade glinting in the sunlight. Klara's heart swelled with emotion as she pushed open the heavy wooden door and stepped inside. For the first time in her life, she felt like she was truly home.

With a deep breath, Klara let the weight of her past fall away, leaving behind the dusty hills and cramped apartments of Ravensburg. In this new world, anything seemed possible. She would learn to navigate its complexities, to forge alliances and friendships, and to build a future that was all her own. The journey ahead would be long and difficult, but Klara Jankowski was ready.
