Klara Sánchez-Gijón, a 30-year-old Cuban-American journalist, sat at her desk, sipping on a strong cup of café con leche. She stared out the window of her tiny apartment in Queens, New York, where the sounds of car horns and chattering pedestrians filled the air. Klara's mind was elsewhere, though – focused on her latest investigation into the exploitation of migrant workers in the city.

As a child, Klara had listened to stories from her abuela, who had fled Cuba during the revolution. The struggles she faced as a refugee had sparked a fire within Klara to tell the stories that needed to be told. She began her career in journalism at a local newspaper, where she quickly rose through the ranks to become a prominent investigative reporter.

Klara's latest exposé was the most ambitious yet – she was tracing the supply chain of produce from small farms in Queens to high-end restaurants throughout the city. Her research led her down a rabbit hole of corruption and abuse, with some farmers being paid pennies on the dollar for their labor while others were taking advantage of vulnerable workers.

Determined to expose the truth, Klara spent long hours interviewing workers, farmers, and restaurant owners. She documented evidence of wage theft, hazardous working conditions, and even cases of physical violence against migrant workers. The more she learned, the more her conviction grew – she had to get these stories out into the world.

One night, as she was pouring over notes and sources, Klara received a call from an anonymous source claiming to be a farm worker. "Klara, I think we have something big," the voice said. The next day, she arrived at the designated meeting spot – an abandoned warehouse in Brooklyn – with her camera crew in tow.

The source led them to a hidden room deep within the warehouse, where a group of migrant workers were being held captive by their employer. Klara's heart swelled as she documented the scene on camera, her mind racing with questions and demands for justice. This was just the beginning of a long fight, but for Klara, it was already worth it – to give a voice to those without one.

With her phone in hand, ready to call for backup, Klara whispered into the camera, "This is just the tip of the iceberg."
