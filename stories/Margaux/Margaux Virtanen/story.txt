She had always been driven by a passion for music, pouring her heart and soul into every performance.

Backstage, Margaux Virtanen's bandmates, Alex and Jamie, waited anxiously to hear how the show had gone down. "She absolutely killed it out there," Alex exclaimed, as Margaux Virtanen grinned from ear to ear.
