Margaux Fliesbach stepped into the grand ballroom, her eyes scanning the crowded space for a glimpse of her estranged sister, Adeline. The chandelier above them refracted light onto the polished floor, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the room. Margaux's gaze lingered on a familiar face - their cousin, Henrietta, who was busy regaling a group of guests with tales of their family's history.

As she navigated through the throng, Margaux couldn't shake off the feeling that she didn't belong here. Her relationship with Adeline had been strained for years, ever since their parents' tragic accident left them both orphaned and alone. The guilt and anger that had simmered beneath the surface for so long finally boiled over when they discovered that Adeline was the sole beneficiary of their inheritance.

Now, as Margaux stood in this crowded room filled with people who knew her sister so much better than she did, she felt like an imposter. Her full name, Margaux Fliesbach, seemed almost laughable now - a relic of a past life she had left behind.

Henrietta spotted her and hurried over, concern etched on her face. "Margaux! Darling, I'm so glad I found you," Henrietta exclaimed, enveloping Margaux in a warm hug.

As they parted ways to mingle with the other guests, Margaux caught snippets of conversations - Adeline's laughter echoing through the room, the hushed whispers about their family's dark past. She knew she would never be able to truly fit in here, not after what had happened between her and Adeline.

Despite this, Margaux found herself drawn to Henrietta's warmth and kindness. They chatted about everything from literature to art, their conversation flowing effortlessly as they discovered shared interests. For the first time that evening, Margaux felt like she was among people who truly understood her.

As the night wore on, Margaux knew it was time to leave. She said her goodbyes, thanking Henrietta for a welcome respite from the animosity that had long defined her relationship with Adeline. As she stepped out into the cool evening air, Margaux Fliesbach felt a glimmer of hope - perhaps one day, she would be able to rebuild her life and leave the shadows of her past behind.
