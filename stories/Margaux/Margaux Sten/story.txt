One rainy evening, Margaux Sten received a visit from her old colleague, Alex, who was now working for a wealthy businessman. He handed her a folder containing some cryptic information about his client's daughter, Emily Wilson. Apparently, Emily had gone missing five years ago, and the police case had gone cold.

Intrigued, Margaux Sten agreed to take on the case. She spent hours poring over the files, searching for any lead that might crack the mystery wide open. Her mind was racing with theories and suspects as she made her way through the dark alleys of the city.

The next day, Margaux Sten set out to interview Emily's family members. She met with Emily's parents, who were frantic with worry.

Margaux Sten's eyes narrowed as she listened. This was more than just a simple missing person case - there was something fishy going on here. She decided to dig deeper and follow a lead about Emily's phone records.
