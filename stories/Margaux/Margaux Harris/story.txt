Margaux Harris stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the crowded station. She had been on the road for weeks, chasing every lead on her latest investigation. As a private investigator, Margaux had seen it all – the good, the bad, and the ugly. But this case was different.

She had received a cryptic message from an anonymous source, hinting at a high-stakes embezzlement scheme involving some of the city's most powerful business leaders. The only problem was, no one seemed to know what was going on, or who was behind it all.

Margaux spotted her contact waiting for her by the entrance, a petite woman with a shaved head and piercing green eyes. "You're late," she said, as Margaux approached.

"Sorry about that," Margaux replied, falling into step beside her. "Traffic."

As they walked through the station, Margaux filled in the details of what she had learned so far. Her contact listened intently, nodding along as Margaux spoke.

"So, it looks like we're talking about a massive money laundering operation," Margaux concluded. "The kind of thing that could bring down an entire city."

Her contact smiled grimly. "I'm glad you're on the case, Margaux. We need someone with your skills to dig deep and uncover the truth."

As they emerged from the station, Margaux spotted a sleek black car parked by the curb. Her contact opened the door for her, revealing a smooth-voiced operator inside.

"Good evening," he said, with a charming smile. "I'm here to take you on your first lead. We have reason to believe that one of our sources may be willing to talk... but only if they're brought directly to them."

Margaux exchanged a look with her contact. This was it – the moment she had been waiting for.

She slipped into the car, feeling a thrill of excitement as the engine roared to life beneath her. She knew that this case could change everything – and she was ready to take on whatever came next.
