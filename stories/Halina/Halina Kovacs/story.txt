Halina Kovacs stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the crowded station for any sign of her friend. It had been years since they'd last spoken, but a cryptic message from an old acquaintance had brought Halina back to her hometown.

As she made her way through the throng of people, Halina's thoughts turned to the past. She and her childhood friend, Sofia, had grown up together, exploring the woods and sharing secrets. But after high school, they'd drifted apart, each pursuing their own paths in life.

Halina's eyes landed on a familiar face - her old teacher, Mrs. Patel, who was now running the local caf√©. Halina pushed open the door and stepped inside, where the warm scent of coffee enveloped her. Mrs. Patel looked up from behind the counter, a hint of surprise on her face as she took in Halina's appearance.

"Long time no see, Halina," Mrs. Patel said, wiping down the counter with a smile. "What brings you back to our humble town?"

Halina slid onto a stool at the counter and ordered a cup of coffee, taking a moment to collect her thoughts before speaking. She'd come back for Sofia's sake - her friend had received news that she was terminally ill, and Halina felt compelled to be there for her.

As they sipped their coffee together, Mrs. Patel filled Halina in on the latest gossip from town, including the recent arrival of a new family in the old Victorian house on Elm Street. Halina's ears perked up at this - she had memories of playing hide-and-seek with Sofia in that very same house.

Their conversation was interrupted by a knock at the door - it was Sofia herself, pale and frail but still radiating her signature spark. Halina rushed to hug her friend, feeling a mix of emotions as they held each other tightly. As they sat down together, Halina knew that she'd be there for Sofia every step of the way, just as their friendship had always been there for her.

For now, at least, the past was coming back to haunt them in the most wonderful way.
