Halina Fernández González was known for her unique gift – she could communicate with plants. As a child, she would spend hours in her grandmother's garden, listening to the whispers of the flowers and trees.

Slowly but surely, the plants began to respond, stretching their stems and leaves towards the sky.

Abuela Rosa watched with pride as Halina grew into a powerful young woman, capable of making a real difference in the world.
