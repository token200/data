As she entered her early twenties, Halina began to explore her own style, blending traditional techniques with modern perspectives. Her bold brushstrokes and vivid colors captured the attention of art critics and collectors alike. Before long, her work was being showcased in galleries across the globe.

Despite her rapid rise to fame, Halina remained humble and grounded. She credited her parents for instilling in her a love of art that knew no bounds. Alessandro Alighieri's emphasis on experimentation and innovation had rubbed off on his daughter, encouraging her to push the boundaries of what was possible.
