One day, as she sat at her desk, pouring over a stack of documents, Halina's phone rang once more. It was an anonymous caller, claiming to have information about a high-profile scandal that would shatter everything Halina thought she knew. Her heart racing with anticipation, she listened intently – the game had changed once again.
