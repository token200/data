One day, Halina Ferragni received an invitation to speak at a prestigious conference in New York City. She was thrilled at the opportunity to share her entrepreneurial journey with a global audience and decided to use the platform to launch her latest venture - a line of sustainable fashion products. The event was scheduled to take place in just a few weeks, and Halina Ferragni knew she had to work tirelessly to prepare.

As the big day approached, Halina Ferragni poured her heart and soul into finalizing the presentation, rehearsing her speech, and making last-minute adjustments to the product line.
