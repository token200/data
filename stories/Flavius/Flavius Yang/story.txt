Flavius "Fla" Yang was known for his unorthodox approach to life. As a skilled martial artist and detective, he had a knack for getting out of sticky situations. His full name, which he rarely introduced himself with, seemed fitting - Flavius had a sense of mystery surrounding him, while Yang added a touch of modernity.

Fla's latest case was a peculiar one. A wealthy socialite had hired him to investigate the theft of a rare antique vase. The police were stumped, and the socialite was willing to pay top dollar for any lead. As Fla began his investigation, he noticed that everyone involved seemed genuinely shaken by the theft.

He spent hours questioning witnesses, scouring the crime scene, and analyzing clues. His unorthodox methods often raised eyebrows, but his results spoke for themselves. One evening, as he was reviewing the evidence, an idea struck him. He decided to pay a visit to the socialite's business partner, who had seemed overly nervous during their initial interview.

As Fla entered the office, he noticed something peculiar - a small inscription on the edge of the desk that read " Property of FLAVIUS YANG." Suddenly, it clicked into place. The thief was not after the vase itself, but rather a specific message or symbol etched onto its surface. With renewed determination, Fla set out to unravel the mystery.

His search led him to an unlikely suspect - a young artist who had been working on a series of pieces inspired by ancient cultures. When confronted, the artist confessed to creating the inscription as a form of artistic expression, not with malicious intent. The socialite was relieved, and Fla's reputation as a brilliant detective was solidified.

As he walked out of the office, Fla smiled to himself. It had been another day in the life of Flavius Yang, where the lines between good and evil were often blurred. He made a mental note to update his contact list with his full name - it seemed fitting that his next case would be just around the corner.
