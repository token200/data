Years of tireless dedication had paid off, and Flavius Jian's name was now synonymous with bravery and discovery. His latest expedition, led to the uncharted ruins of a lost city deep in the jungle. The air was thick with humidity as he led his team through the dense foliage, the sounds of the rainforest growing louder with each step.

As they emerged into a clearing, Flavius Jian's eyes widened in awe. Before him lay a sprawling metropolis, its ancient structures still standing testament to the ingenuity of a long-lost people. His team flocked around him, eager to begin their excavation work.
