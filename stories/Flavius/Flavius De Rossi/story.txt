Flavius De Rossi was a man of uncommon wit and charm. As a renowned historian, he had spent years pouring over dusty tomes in search of hidden truths. His latest obsession was the enigmatic figure of Emperor Caracalla, who ruled Rome with an iron fist during the 3rd century AD.

One fateful evening, as Flavius De Rossi sipped his wine and pored over a particularly intriguing manuscript, he stumbled upon an entry that left him breathless.
