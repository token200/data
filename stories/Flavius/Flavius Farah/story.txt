Flavius Farah was a man shrouded in mystery. He lived and breathed history, with an encyclopedic knowledge that bordered on obsession. As a curator at the prestigious Museum of Antiquities, he spent his days surrounded by relics from bygone eras, yet his true passions lay elsewhere.

Flavius's fascination with ancient civilizations was all-consuming. He spent every spare moment studying the intricacies of long-lost cultures, pouring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in search of hidden truths.
