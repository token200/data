Flavius Altmann was a man of mystery and intrigue. A skilled thief and con artist, he had earned a reputation for being able to talk his way out of (or into) just about any situation. With a quick wit and an even quicker draw, Flavius had made a name for himself on the streets of 19th century London.

One night, Flavius Altmann found himself in the employ of a wealthy patron, who had offered him a lucrative deal: steal a valuable necklace from the mansion of the city's most esteemed socialite. The job was supposed to be an easy one, but as soon as Flavius stepped into the mansion, he knew something was off.

As he made his way through the crowded ballroom, Flavius kept a close eye on the hostess, Lady Harrington. She was known for her sharp tongue and quick temper, and Flavius knew that if she even suspected him of being up to no good, he would be out of there faster than you could say "high-society etiquette."

With the necklace safely in his pocket, Flavius made his way back to his patron's waiting arms. But as soon as they collected their payment, Flavius knew that he had to lay low for a while. The socialite's husband was notorious for being ruthless when it came to protecting his family's reputation.

Flavius spent the next few weeks on the run, always staying one step ahead of his pursuers. He changed his appearance, used fake identities, and even resorted to hiding out in an old attic above a pawnshop in the East End. It was a far cry from the luxurious mansion where he had pulled off the theft.

But despite the danger and uncertainty, Flavius Altmann couldn't help but feel a thrill of satisfaction as he watched his patron collect their winnings and smile like a fool at the social gathering that night. He had played the game, and come out on top. And for now, that was all that mattered.

As he settled into his new hiding spot above the pawnshop, Flavius couldn't help but wonder what the next move would be. Would he stick to the life of a thief, or try something else? Only time would tell. But one thing was certain: Flavius Altmann would always have an edge, and would never back down from a challenge.
