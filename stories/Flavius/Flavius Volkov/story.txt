Flavius Volkov stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the bustling streets of Moscow. The chilly winter air hit him like a slap in the face, but he hardly noticed as his eyes scanned the crowded sidewalks for any signs of trouble.

As a former Spetsnaz operative turned freelance mercenary, Flavius had seen his fair share of chaos and bloodshed. But he had never lost his sense of purpose - to protect those who couldn't protect themselves from the shadows that lurked in every corner of this treacherous city.

Tonight was no exception. A high-stakes poker game at a exclusive club on the outskirts of town was supposed to be going down, and Flavius had received intel that a notorious gangster would be in attendance. The man's name was Viktor Kuznetsov, and rumor had it that he was willing to do whatever it took to get ahead - including murder.

Flavius made his way through the crowds, blending in seamlessly with the revelers as he worked his way towards the entrance. His hand rested on the grip of his pistol, ready for anything that might happen.

As he pushed open the door and stepped inside, a bell above it rang out, alerting the patrons to his presence. Flavius scanned the room, his eyes locking onto Kuznetsov in an instant. The gangster was seated at a table near the back of the club, surrounded by an entourage of burly men who looked like they could take on a small army.

Flavius smiled to himself as he made his way towards the bar, ordering a drink as he kept a watchful eye on Kuznetsov. The gangster's eyes flicked up to meet his, and for a moment, Flavius thought he saw a spark of recognition - or perhaps even admiration.

But it was quickly extinguished as Viktor turned back to his game, his attention focused solely on the stakes at hand. Flavius watched him with an intensity that bordered on fascination - what drove this man to be so ruthless, so devoid of empathy?

As he sipped his drink and waited for the perfect moment to strike, Flavius couldn't help but wonder if this was it for Viktor Kuznetsov. Would he leave Moscow tonight with a fortune in cash, or would Flavius Volkov have other plans? Only time would tell.
