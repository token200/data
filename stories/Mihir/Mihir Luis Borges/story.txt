I must correct you - there is no record of a person named Mihir Luis Borges. However, I can write a story inspired by Jorge Luis Borges, an Argentine writer.

In the misty streets of Buenos Aires, a young man named Mihir Luis Borges wandered aimlessly, lost in thought. He was the son of a diplomat and had grown up surrounded by languages and cultures, but his true passion lay in literature. As he strolled through the city's literary quarter, he stumbled upon a small bookstore that seemed to hold secrets and tales from another world.

The store was run by an old man with piercing eyes, who introduced himself as Carlos Argentino Daneri. He claimed to have known Mihir Luis Borges' father and had taught him the art of storytelling when he was just a child. As they sat in the dimly lit shop, surrounded by shelves of dusty books, Daneri began to read from an ancient tome.

The words on the pages seemed to weave a spell around Mihir Luis Borges, transporting him to realms both familiar and unknown. He felt the presence of his father, who had passed away when he was just a boy, guiding him through the labyrinthine corridors of time. As Daneri spoke, Mihir Luis Borges' imagination took flight, conjuring worlds that defied logic and reason.

Hours turned into days as Mihir Luis Borges spent every waking moment in the bookstore, devouring the words of Daneri like a starving man at an all-you-can-eat feast. He began to see patterns and connections between seemingly disparate ideas, and his own writing took on a life of its own.

As the sun set over Buenos Aires, Mihir Luis Borges left the bookstore with a newfound sense of purpose. His words would weave together tales of time travel, infinite libraries, and labyrinths that led to nowhere. He knew that he had found his calling, and that Carlos Argentino Daneri was not just a mentor but a guardian angel guiding him towards the truth.

With every step, Mihir Luis Borges felt himself becoming one with the world of words, leaving behind the uncertainty and doubt that had once plagued him. His journey as a writer had begun, and he knew that it would take him to places both wondrous and unsettling, but ultimately, into the very heart of his own soul.
