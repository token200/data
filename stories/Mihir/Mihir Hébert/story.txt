Mihir Hébert was known for his unorthodox approach to detective work. As a private investigator, he often found himself entangled in the darkest corners of human nature. His latest case, a high-profile murder at a wealthy socialite's estate, had Mihir Hébert on high alert.

The victim, 35-year-old socialite Sophia Lane, was found dead in her bedroom with no signs of forced entry or struggle. The only clue was a small note left on the bedside table with a cryptic message: "You'll never find me." Mihir Hébert knew that this case would require all his skills and experience to crack.

As he began to investigate, Mihir Hébert discovered that Sophia Lane had many secrets hidden beneath her polished facade.
