Mihir Karlsson was a man consumed by his work. As a renowned astrophysicist, he had spent years studying the mysteries of the universe, pouring over data and running simulations in an effort to unlock its secrets.

Despite his incredible success in his field, Mihir's personal life suffered as a result. His wife, Sarah, had long since given up trying to keep him connected to reality. She would often joke that Mihir's relationships were limited to the vast expanse of space, and their own marriage was just another celestial body hurtling through the void.

But Mihir couldn't help it. He was too close to the edge, too caught up in his work to truly appreciate the beauty of the world around him. His eyes would glaze over as Sarah tried to engage him in conversation, her words and laughter lost on him.

One night, Mihir received an invitation from a colleague to attend a prestigious astronomy conference in Norway. The opportunity was too great to pass up, and he booked his ticket without hesitation.

As the plane soared through the skies, Mihir felt a thrill of excitement that he hadn't experienced in years. He spent hours poring over papers and abstracts, his mind racing with possibilities and theories.

But when he arrived at the conference, something strange happened. The attendees weren't just fellow scientists - they were humans, with stories and struggles and hopes that didn't revolve around the latest discovery. Mihir was struck by their connection to each other, a sense of community that eluded him in his solitary world.

Over the next few days, Mihir began to see the world through new eyes. He watched as a group of students worked together to build a telescope, laughing and joking as they went about their task. He attended a lecture on the importance of human connection in science, feeling a lump form in his throat as he realized how far off course he had strayed.

As the conference came to a close, Mihir knew that he couldn't go back to his old ways forever. He couldn't abandon Sarah and their life together, but he also couldn't ignore the sense of loneliness that had been growing inside him for so long. Maybe it was time to strike a balance between his love of science and his love of people. The universe had given him a chance to see things differently - now it was up to him to take it.
