Mihir Muti was known throughout the city for his peculiar habit of collecting forgotten memories. As a child, he would often wander into dusty old shops and libraries, searching for scraps of history that had been lost to time.

As he grew older, Mihir's fascination with forgotten memories only deepened. He became a collector of sorts, scouring the city for items that held significance but were otherwise overlooked. There were old postcards, yellowed newspaper clippings, and even a few forgotten photographs.

Despite his somewhat reclusive nature, Mihir was a man of great kindness. He would often give away the memories he collected to those who truly needed them most – an elderly woman who had lost her way in life, a young couple looking to start their own family, or a soldier struggling to cope with the trauma of war.

One day, while exploring the city's ancient quarter, Mihir stumbled upon an old, forgotten museum. The building itself was a mess, but inside, he discovered a treasure trove of memories waiting to be uncovered. There were artifacts from centuries past, including ancient coins, mysterious texts, and even a few pieces of clothing that had once belonged to royalty.

Among the dusty exhibits, Mihir found one particular item that caught his eye: an old, leather-bound book. As he opened it, he discovered pages filled with handwritten notes – the words of a long-forgotten poet.

Entranced by the poet's words, Mihir spent hours pouring over the book. He read of love and loss, of hope and heartache. And as he read, something strange began to happen – memories that were not his own started to flood into his mind.

He remembered walking hand in hand with a young woman on a moonlit beach; listening to a jazz band play in a smoky nightclub; feeling the warmth of a summer sun on a childhood vacation. The memories were vivid and real, and they changed Mihir in ways he could hardly comprehend.

As the days passed, Mihir began to realize that his collection of forgotten memories had given him something far greater than just dusty relics – it had given him a sense of connection to the world around him. And with this newfound understanding, he continued to collect memories, not just for himself, but for those who truly needed them most.
