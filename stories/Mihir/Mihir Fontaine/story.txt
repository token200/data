As they strolled along, Mihir Fielded questions on his company's latest breakthroughs in renewable energy, discussing the potential applications of their innovative technology and the steps he envisioned taking to bring it to the masses.

Despite the chaos of the city around him, Mihir Fontaine seemed lost in thought, pondering the implications of recent developments in his field.
