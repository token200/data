Mihir Rothbauer stood at the edge of the rooftop, his eyes scanning the city below. The neon lights of the skyscrapers twinkled like diamonds against the dark sky, and for a moment, he felt invincible.

As a young entrepreneur, Mihir had built his business from scratch, fueled by an insatiable hunger for success. He had always been driven, pushing himself to be better, faster, stronger. And it had paid off â€“ Rothbauer Inc., his tech firm, was now on the cusp of being acquired by a rival company.

But as he gazed out at the city, Mihir felt a pang of disillusionment. He thought about all the late nights, the endless meetings, and the sacrifices he had made for his business. His relationships were few and far between, and those that did exist were strained from neglect.

Mihir's mind began to wander back to his childhood, growing up in a small town in India. He remembered the warmth of his mother's cooking, the sound of his father's laughter, and the feeling of freedom that came with being surrounded by nature. It was a world he had left behind as he set out to make his mark on the business world.

He turned to face the rooftop bar, where a group of partygoers were laughing and chatting over drinks. Mihir couldn't help but feel like an outsider among them. They were carefree, living in the moment, while he was forever stuck in the present, focused on the next deal, the next milestone.

Just then, his phone buzzed with a text from his sister, Akshita. "Hey bro, when are you coming home? I need to see you." Mihir smiled wistfully, feeling a lump form in his throat. He knew he couldn't stay away forever, but for now, the city beckoned, and so did his business.

Mihir took a deep breath and pushed open the door to the rooftop bar. He was greeted by the bartender, who recognized him with a nod of respect. "The usual, Mihir?" The entrepreneur nodded, feeling a sense of comfort wash over him. It was a small respite from the chaos of his life, but it was enough.

As he sipped his drink, Mihir couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more to life than just success and power. He knew he needed to find a balance, to rediscover the joy and simplicity of life before the city took over.
