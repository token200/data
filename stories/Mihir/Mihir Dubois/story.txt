Mihir Dubois stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the unfamiliar streets of the small town he had come to visit. As a renowned archaeologist, he had spent his career uncovering secrets of the past, but this trip was personal - to pay his respects to his great-grandfather, who had met his untimely demise on these very grounds.

Mihir Dubois made his way through the quiet streets, taking in the quaint architecture and dusty shops that lined the main thoroughfare. He stopped at a small caf√©, ordering a cup of black coffee as he scanned the local newspaper for any mentions of recent discoveries or excavations.

The bell above the door jingled as Mihir Dubois walked in, drawing curious glances from the patrons within. His piercing green eyes and sharp jawline made him stand out in the cozy establishment, but it was his worn leather satchel slung over his shoulder that truly marked him as an outsider.

As he waited for his coffee to arrive, Mihir Dubois's mind wandered back to his great-grandfather's tale. He had always been fascinated by stories of lost civilizations and forgotten histories, and his great-grandfather's tragic fate only added to the allure. According to family lore, Rajesh Dubois - Mihir's ancestor - had been leading an expedition in this very town when he stumbled upon a long-buried treasure.

The coffee arrived, and Mihir Dubois took a steaming sip, feeling the bitterness wash over his tongue. He knew that finding the treasure would be no easy task, but he was determined to uncover the secrets of his family's past. As he sat there, lost in thought, a young woman with bright pink hair and a warm smile approached him.

"Hi, mind if I join you?" she asked, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.

Mihir Dubois shook his head, smiling as she settled into the chair opposite him. "Not at all," he replied, intrigued by this unexpected encounter.

The two struck up a conversation, exchanging stories and laughter as Mihir Dubois learned that this young woman was a local historian, passionate about preserving the town's hidden treasures. And in that moment, Mihir Dubois knew that he had found a valuable ally in his quest to uncover the truth about Rajesh Dubois and the fabled treasure of the past.
