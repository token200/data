Mihir Larsen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. It had been ten years since he'd last set foot in his hometown of Oslo. A decade spent chasing the American dream, building a life as a finance executive in New York City.

As he made his way through the quiet streets, memories began to flood back. The smell of freshly baked skål cookies wafting from the bakery on Rådstrættens Gate. The sound of children laughing at the Tøyen Amusement Park on warm summer evenings. Mihir's thoughts turned to his family – his parents, who had always been his rock, and his younger sister, Sofie.

Sofie had grown into a brilliant artist, her paintings now exhibited in galleries across Oslo. Mihir's heart swelled with pride as he imagined her standing proudly beside one of her pieces. He made a mental note to look up her contact information and arrange a visit for the summer.

Mihir arrived at his family's old stone house, its façade still bearing the scars of the great fire that had ravaged the city in 1909. He pushed open the creaky front door, calling out into the silence: "Tante? Tante Helga?" The only response was the echo of his own voice off the walls.

As he settled into his childhood bedroom, memories came flooding back – lazy summer days spent playing football with Sofie in the backyard, helping his father repair the family's ancient bicycle on the garage floor. His mother's warm smile as she handed him a freshly baked bread roll at breakfast time.

Mihir realized that despite his successful career, he had been living someone else's dream. He longed to reconnect with his roots and rediscover the simple joys of life that Oslo held. The thought filled him with excitement, even a hint of trepidation.

The rest of the day blurred together as Mihir spent time catching up with old friends, exploring hidden corners of the city he'd never noticed before, and finding himself once more in his own skin – strong, yet fragile; grown-up, yet childlike.
