But Mihir's determination to survive had propelled him forward, leading him to build a life for himself as a skilled thief and con artist.

One fateful night, Mihir found himself at the edge of his world, facing off against the notorious crime lord, Viktor Varga. The two men clashed in a dimly lit alleyway, their fists flying as they battled for control of the city's underworld.
