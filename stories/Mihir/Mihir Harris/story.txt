As a renowned expert in ancient mythology, Mihir Harris had spent years studying the arcane arts, delving deep into dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls.

One fateful evening, as Mihir Harris strolled through the campus gardens, he stumbled upon a cryptic message scrawled on a stone bench. The words seemed to shimmer in the fading light, beckoning him closer. With an air of curiosity, Mihir Harris knelt beside the bench and deciphered the message.
