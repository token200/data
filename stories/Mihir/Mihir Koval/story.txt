Mihir Koval stood at the edge of the old wooden dock, his eyes fixed on the grey waters of the Baltic Sea. The wind whipped his dark hair into a frenzy as he gazed out at the horizon, lost in thought.

As a young man, Mihir had grown up in this small coastal town, surrounded by the salty air and the endless expanse of water. He had always felt drawn to the sea, with its mysterious power and unpredictability. But it was his late father's words that had set him on his current path: "The sea is a mirror, Mihir. It reflects our deepest desires and darkest fears."

Mihir had spent years studying the art of navigation, learning the ancient techniques passed down through generations of sailors. He had built his own boat, a sturdy vessel he named "Korvus" after the raven god of the sea.

Now, at the age of thirty-five, Mihir was on a quest to chart the unmapped waters of the Baltic. His mission was to uncover hidden treasures and lost cities, said to be buried beneath the waves.

As he stood on the dock, a faint cry echoed across the water. A young girl, no more than ten years old, clung to the side of Korvus's hull, her eyes wide with fear. Mihir recognized the look; it was the same one his own father had worn before him when he set out on his first voyage.

Without hesitation, Mihir leapt into the water, swimming towards the girl with a powerful stroke. As he reached her side, she wrapped her arms around his neck, holding tight as if she might sink beneath the surface without his support.

Mihir pulled the girl aboard Korvus and handed her a life jacket, speaking softly to calm her down. "Don't worry, little one," he said, his voice like a gentle breeze on the water. "I'll keep you safe."

As they sailed further out into the open sea, Mihir couldn't shake the feeling that his journey was not just about charting new waters but also about uncovering his own past and his connection to the mysterious sea.

The wind whipped through his hair once more, carrying with it the whispers of his father's words: "The sea is a mirror..." Mihir smiled, knowing that he was one step closer to understanding the secrets that lay hidden beneath its surface.
