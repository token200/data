Mihir Isakova sat alone at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of files in front of him. As the CEO of NovaTech, one of the world's leading tech firms, he was no stranger to pressure and responsibility. But tonight, something felt different.

It wasn't just the weight of the company's future bearing down on him – it was the nagging sense that he'd made a terrible mistake. A few months ago, Mihir had made the bold decision to invest heavily in an untested startup, convinced by their charismatic CEO, Alexei Petrov, that they were onto something revolutionary.

Now, as Mihir delved into the financial records, he realized that NovaTech was hemorrhaging money at an alarming rate. The startup was flailing, and Alexei's lavish lifestyle was being propped up by investor funds meant for the very company Mihir now led.

A faint knock on the door interrupted his thoughts, and his assistant, Rachel, poked her head in. "Mihir, you've got a call from Alexei," she said, her voice low with concern.

Mihir's gut twisted into knots as he picked up the receiver. On the other end was Alexei, smooth-talking as ever. "Hey, Mihir! What's going on? I heard we're making some...adjustments to the budget."

The pause on the other end was palpable. "Mihir, my friend," Alexei drawled, "I think it's time we talked about the elephant in the room – your company's not exactly thriving under your leadership."

Mihir felt his face burn with rage and embarrassment as he struggled to keep his tone level. How dare this man, someone he had trusted implicitly, question his judgment? But a part of him knew Rachel was right: NovaTech was on the brink of collapse.

"Alexei, I...I didn't realize," Mihir stammered, trying to salvage what was left of his dignity. "We'll get it under control. I promise."

There was another pause, this time longer and more ominous. "Mihir Isakova," Alexei said finally, the words dripping with disdain, "I think you need a little...wake-up call."
