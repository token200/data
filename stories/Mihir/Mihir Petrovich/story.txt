Mihir Petrovich arrived at the local café, a nondescript building on the outskirts of town that seemed to be a hub for locals and travelers alike. He ordered a cup of black coffee and took a seat by the window, his eyes scanning the room as he waited for someone to approach him.

A young woman, her face etched with concern, made her way over to Mihir Petrovich's table. "You're the journalist, aren't you?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. "I've heard so much about you."

Mihir Petrovich nodded, his expression neutral. "I'm here to investigate the Ashwood tragedy," he said. "What do you know?"

Mihir Petrovich's eyes narrowed. He knew that in a town like Ashwood, where gossip spread like wildfire, nothing was ever as simple as it seemed. He made a mental note to speak with the local sheriff and begin asking questions.

As he sipped his coffee, Mihir Petrovich couldn't help but feel a thrill of excitement at the prospect of unraveling the mystery. He had a reputation for being one of the best in the business, and he intended to prove it once again by uncovering the truth behind the Ashwood tragedy.

With a sense of purpose, Mihir Petrovich set out into the unknown, ready to follow the trail of clues wherever they might lead him.
