Yamaguchi Salamanca, also known as Uncle, sat in his favorite armchair, sipping on a cup of green tea. His piercing eyes scanned the room, taking in every detail. As the capo di todos, he was accustomed to being surrounded by those who feared and respected him.

His nephew, Hector Salamanca, entered the room with a nervous expression on his face. Uncle's gaze narrowed as he sensed something was amiss. "What is it, Hector?" he asked gruffly.

Hector hesitated before speaking. "I've been having some... issues with the Mexican cartel, Uncle. They're trying to muscle in on our territory."

Uncle's expression remained stoic, but his eyes flashed with anger. He knew that this was a threat to his power and reputation. "Tell me more," he growled.

Hector took a deep breath before continuing. "I've been trying to negotiate with them, but they're not willing to back down. They think they can take our territory by force."

Uncle's face turned red with rage. He knew that this was a challenge to his authority, and he would not be threatened. He stood up from his chair and began pacing around the room.

"I'll handle this myself," he said, his voice low and menacing. "You're just a puppet, Hector. I'm the one who will deal with these insolent fools."

As Uncle continued to pace, Hector couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. He knew that his uncle was capable of ruthless tactics, and he didn't want to be on the receiving end of them.

Just then, the door burst open and in walked Mike Ehrmantraut, Uncle's trusted enforcer. "I've got some information about the cartel," Mike said, a hint of a smile on his face.

Uncle's eyes locked onto Mike, and he nodded for him to continue. As Mike spoke, Uncle's expression changed from anger to calculating interest. He knew that this was an opportunity to take care of his rival once and for all.
