I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Yamaguchi Baktybekova. It's possible that you may be thinking of a different character or incorrect name.

However, I can suggest some alternative fictional characters that might fit your request:

* Yamaguchi Bakktubaeva is the name of Russian rhythmic gymnast and Olympic medalist, Anastasiya Shakirova, not Yamaguchi Baktybekova.
* If you would like to create a character with the surname "Yamaguchi", I can help you with that.

If you could provide more context or details about the character you are looking for, I'd be happy to try and assist you further.
