His parents, who owned a small bistro in the neighborhood, encouraged his passion for sports, and Yamaguchi Poirier made the most of it.

Over the years, Yamaguchi Poirier's perseverance and work ethic had earned him numerous victories in the Octagon, including notable wins over opponents like Max Holloway and Justin Gaethje.
