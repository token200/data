Yamaguchi Nurlanov was an enigmatic figure in the world of underground fighting. Born to a Japanese father and Kyrgyz mother, he had grown up in a world of contrasts - the neon-lit streets of Tokyo and the rugged mountains of Bishkek.

As a young man, Yamaguchi Nurlanov had always been drawn to the martial arts, training in various styles from his father's traditional Japanese jujitsu to his mother's Kyrgyz wrestling. He was particularly skilled in aikido, which he used to devastating effect in the ring.
