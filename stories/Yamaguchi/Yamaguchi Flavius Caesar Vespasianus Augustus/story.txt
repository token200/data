I couldn't find any information on a person named Yamaguchi Flavius Caesar Vespasianus Augustus. It is possible that this person is fictional or not a public figure.

However, I can create a story about a character with the given name, but please note that it will be entirely fictional and not based on any real historical figure:

With her parents' guidance, she set out on a perilous journey to meet with the enemy king's emissary. She carried a small gift - a beautifully crafted wooden box adorned with intricate patterns and symbols of peace.

As she sat across from her opponent, Yamaguchi Flavius Caesar Vespasianus Augustus opened the box, revealing a delicate crystal orb that shone like a beacon of hope in the darkness.
