Antti Zariņš stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the unfamiliar surroundings of Riga's old town. A Finnish exchange student, he had been studying abroad for several months now, immersing himself in the vibrant culture of Latvia. His full name, Antti Zariņš, echoed through his mind as he thought about the adventures that lay ahead.

As he made his way through the cobblestone streets, Antti's thoughts turned to his host family, the Žilinskai. They had taken him under their wing, teaching him how to cook traditional Latvian dishes and introducing him to the rich history of the city. His host mother, Jelena, was particularly fond of cooking for him, often serving up hearty plates of aukstā kāpostu zupa (sour soup) and rupjmaize (dark bread).

Antti's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of laughter and music drifting from a nearby café. He followed the noise to find a group of locals gathered around a lively performance of traditional Latvian folk songs. Antti watched, mesmerized, as the dancers twirled and leaped across the stage, their colorful costumes shimmering in the fading light.

After the performance, one of the dancers approached him, introducing herself as Līna. They struck up a conversation about music and dance, and Antti found himself lost in discussion with this charming young woman from Riga. As the night drew to a close, Līna invited him to join her at an upcoming festival, promising a night of traditional dancing and food.

Antti's full name felt especially relevant as he accepted the invitation, his mind racing with excitement for the adventures that lay ahead. Over the coming weeks, he found himself drawn deeper into Riga's vibrant cultural scene, attending performances and festivals, and making new friends like Līna. As Antti Zariņš navigated this foreign but welcoming world, he knew that his time abroad was shaping him in ways he could hardly imagine.
