Despite the chaos that seemed to follow Antti, he was a brilliant horticulturist. He had a deep understanding of the intricate relationships between plants and their environments, which allowed him to coax even the most reluctant blooms into vibrant life.

One sunny afternoon, as Antti was busy pruning a patchwork of rare herbs, his best friend, Maria, stopped by for a visit. She had been struggling with her own garden, plagued by pests and diseases that seemed impossible to eradicate.
