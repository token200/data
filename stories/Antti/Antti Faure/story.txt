One day, Antti Faure received a visit from the local police department, requesting his help in cracking a particularly tricky case. A valuable artifact had been stolen from the city's museum, and all leads seemed to have gone cold. The police were stumped, but Antti Faure was intrigued by the challenge.

He accepted the case and began his investigation, scouring the streets of Helsinki for any signs of the thief or clues that might lead him to the stolen artifact. His keen eye spotted a small inconsistency in the security footage, which he quickly followed up on.
