Antti Kalejs was no ordinary Finnish musician. With his soulful voice and poetic lyrics, he had built a loyal following in the Nordic music scene. As the lead singer of the band "Midnight Requiem," Antti Kalejs' melancholic melodies had captured the hearts of fans from Helsinki to Stockholm.

Born in 1985 in Espoo, Finland, Antti Kalejs grew up surrounded by the sounds of traditional Finnish folk music. He began singing and playing the guitar as a teenager, inspired by the likes of Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen.

Their debut album, "Echoes in the Attic," was a critical and commercial success, praised for its raw emotion and literary lyrics. Antti Kalejs' voice soared on tracks like "Lost in the Haze" and "Whispers in the Dark," drawing comparisons to the greats of Nordic music.

His second album, "Fires in the Night," was a departure from the folk-rock sound of their debut, incorporating elements of electronic music and ambient textures. The result was a hauntingly beautiful album that solidified Antti Kalejs' reputation as one of Finland's most innovative songwriters.

Despite his success, Antti Kalejs remained humble and dedicated to his art. He spent hours writing songs in his small apartment in Helsinki, pouring his heart and soul into every lyric and melody. His music was a reflection of his own struggles and triumphs, as well as the hopes and fears of those around him.

In 2015, "Midnight Requiem" released their third album, "Ghosts of Winter," which earned widespread critical acclaim.
