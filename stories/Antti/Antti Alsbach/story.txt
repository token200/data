Antti Alsbach trudged through the dense forest, his worn boots making barely a sound on the damp earth. As a detective with the Helsinki Police Department's Cold Case Unit, he had seen it all - the gruesome murders, the heartbreaking pleas for justice, and the endless hours spent searching for answers.

But this case was different. This one haunted him still, years after it first went cold. A young woman named Lena Andersson had disappeared from a popular club in downtown Helsinki, leaving behind only a cryptic message scrawled on her phone: "They're watching me".

Antti's eyes scanned the forest floor, his mind replaying the events of that fateful night. He had been assigned to reopen the case after new evidence came to light - a suspicious witness who had come forward with a contradictory story.

As he pushed aside branches and fought against the encroaching darkness, Antti stumbled upon an old wooden bench. It was half-buried in the undergrowth, but it looked like it hadn't been disturbed in years. He sat down, running his hands over the weathered wood, searching for any signs of disturbance.

And then, he saw it - a faint scratch on the surface, almost imperceptible. Antti's heart skipped a beat as he realized this must have been the work of Lena herself, or perhaps someone trying to mislead him.

He carefully examined the area, collecting every shred of evidence he could find. The air was thick with anticipation as he pieced together the fragments of Lena's final moments.

Suddenly, Antti's phone buzzed in his pocket. He pulled it out, scanning the screen before a chill ran down his spine - the message on Lena's phone had been sent to an old burner number, one that still existed.

A spark of hope ignited within him. This could be the break he needed. With renewed determination, Antti delved deeper into the digital world, tracing the IP address back to its source. The trail led him to a dingy internet café on the outskirts of town.

As he walked through the crowded room, Antti's eyes scanned for any sign of Lena or her killer. He spotted a familiar face - a former clubgoer who had given conflicting testimony in his original interview. Antti made his way over, his voice firm but controlled as he asked the man to come with him.

The suspect stumbled out of the internet café, flanked by two officers as they cuffed him and read him his rights. For once, justice seemed within reach. As Antti watched the scene unfold before him, a sense of satisfaction washed over him - perhaps this case wasn't so cold after all.
