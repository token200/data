Antti Horvath stepped into the bustling caf√©, his eyes scanning the crowded room for any sign of his friend, Leena. He had been searching for her everywhere, but so far, she was nowhere to be found.

As he waited in line, Antti's mind wandered back to their last conversation. They had been discussing their plans for the upcoming summer, and Antti had mentioned that he would be taking a solo trip to Finland to visit his family. Leena had teased him about how much he loved being alone with his thoughts, but Antti just laughed it off.

When it was finally his turn to order, Antti settled on a strong Finnish coffee and took a seat at the bar. Just as he was about to take a sip, he spotted Leena walking towards him, a huge smile plastered on her face.

"Hey, Antti Horvath!" she exclaimed, plopping down in the chair across from him. "I'm so sorry I'm late! Traffic was a nightmare!"

Antti grinned and raised an eyebrow. "No worries, Leena. I was starting to think you'd stood me up."

Leena playfully rolled her eyes. "Never, Antti Horvath. I would never do that to my favorite person in the world."

The two friends chatted for a while, catching up on each other's lives and making plans for their summer adventures. As they talked, Antti couldn't help but feel grateful for Leena's presence in his life. She was more than just a friend - she was a confidante, a partner in crime, and a kindred spirit.

As they finished their drinks and prepared to part ways, Antti turned to Leena with a serious expression. "Hey, can I ask you something?"

"Of course, what's up?" Leena replied, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.

Antti hesitated for a moment before speaking. "I've been thinking about my trip to Finland. Want to come with me?"

Leena's face lit up like a Christmas tree. "Absolutely, Antti Horvath! I'm in!"

And with that, the two friends made plans for an unforgettable summer adventure together.
