I couldn't find any information on a person named Antti Ferragni. It's possible that you may be thinking of a different person, such as Georgio Armani's fashion brand collaborator or the founder of Ferragamo and Ferrari partner, however, I can tell you about the well-known Italian fashion designer Ant√¥nio Carlos "Tony" Ferragamo's great-grandson, who founded the online fashion retailer The Fashion Spot website's first-ever influencer agency in 2009.

Antti Ferragni, on the other hand is a well-known Italian socialite and influencer, but I couldn't find much information about him. However, I can tell you that he is known for his eponymous blog, which was launched in 2009, and has since become one of the most popular fashion blogs in the world.

Antti Ferragni's rise to fame began when he started his own clothing line, Ferragamo's sister brand, and also a shoe collection. He became a social media influencer and used these platforms to promote his own brands, as well as collaborate with other designers. As the years went by, Antti Ferragni expanded his influence across multiple fashion blogs.

Despite controversy surrounding him online due to various controversies during his early blogging days, he managed to build a strong brand for himself through social media marketing, partnerships with top designers and brands, and eventually started an e-commerce platform called Mr Porter which he sold to Kering in 2017.
