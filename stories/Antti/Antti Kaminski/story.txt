Antti Kaminski, a former Special Forces operative turned mercenary, sat in the dimly lit bar, nursing a whiskey on the rocks. His rugged features and piercing blue eyes told tales of a life lived on the edge.

As he sipped his drink, Antti's mind wandered back to his days with the Finnish military. He had been one of the best, part of an elite unit that conducted covert operations behind enemy lines. After leaving the service, he had drifted into the world of private security work, taking on missions from various clients.

Tonight was no exception. Antti had received a cryptic message about a high-stakes extraction job in Eastern Europe. The pay was too good to pass up, and he had agreed to meet with the client at midnight.

As he waited for his contact, Antti's thoughts turned to his past. Born into a family of military veterans, he had always felt the weight of expectation on his shoulders. His father, a decorated war hero, had been a constant presence in his life. When Antti joined the military, it was as if he had finally found a sense of purpose.

But that purpose had taken its toll. The memories haunted him still â€“ the screams of the wounded, the stench of death, and the endless nights spent huddled in foxholes, waiting for dawn to break. Antti knew he wasn't alone; many veterans struggled with PTSD and the emotional scars that came with it.

The door to the bar creaked open, and a figure slipped inside. It was a woman, dressed in black, her eyes scanning the room until they landed on Antti. She approached him with a calculated stride, handing him a folder containing the mission details.

"Antti Kaminski," she said, her voice husky. "I see you're still in demand."

He took the folder, his eyes narrowing as he began to read. The extraction job would require him to infiltrate a heavily guarded compound and extract a high-value target. Antti's instincts prickled; this was going to be a tough one.

"Tell me more about the target," he said, his voice firm.

The woman smiled, her lips curving upward. "That's need-to-know, Antti Kaminski. You'll find out soon enough."
