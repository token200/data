Antti Novák walked into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for any familiar faces. He spotted a figure in the corner, sipping on a coffee and staring into space. It was his old friend, Kalle.

As Antti approached, Kalle looked up and nodded in greeting. "Hey, Novák," he said, using Antti's full name as if it were an honor to do so. Antti chuckled and took a seat across from him.

The two friends had grown up together in the small town of Helsinki, exploring the city's hidden corners and sharing secrets. Now, as adults, they found themselves at crossroads, unsure of what the future held. Kalle was considering a move abroad, while Antti was stuck in a rut, working a mundane office job.

As they sipped their coffee, Kalle began to share his plans with Antti. He had always been drawn to the city's underground art scene and wanted to make a name for himself as a photographer. Antti listened intently, remembering the countless hours they spent together, capturing moments on film.

Antti's own passion for photography lay dormant, buried beneath the monotony of his daily routine. But listening to Kalle sparked something within him. He felt a sense of nostalgia wash over him, remembering the thrill of snapping the perfect shot and sharing it with the world.

"I'm seriously considering leaving," Kalle said, his eyes sparkling with excitement. "I need to take a chance and see where this path takes me."

Antti nodded in understanding. "You'd be crazy not to," he replied, using Antti's full name once more. It was a term of endearment, one that only a few people dared to use.

As the night wore on, the two friends reminisced about old times and shared their dreams for the future. In that moment, Antti felt a sense of clarity wash over him. Maybe it was time to take a chance, to chase his own passions and see where they led him. The idea sent shivers down his spine, but he knew one thing – with Kalle by his side, he would never be alone.
