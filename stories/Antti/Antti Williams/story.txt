Antti Williams, a rugged and charismatic Finnish detective, sat at his desk, sipping a strong cup of coffee. The rain pattered against the window, casting a gloomy atmosphere over the small office in Helsinki. It was a typical Wednesday morning, but Antti's mind wasn't on the usual routine of paperwork and crime reports.

He had received a mysterious letter yesterday, with no return address and only three words: "My sister." The message seemed insignificant, yet something about it nagged at him. He couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to it than met the eye.

Antti's thoughts drifted back to his own life. His sister, Aino, had gone missing five years ago during a trip abroad. The police had given up on the case, but Antti had never let go of hope. Maybe this message was connected to her disappearance?

He decided to pay a visit to the local café where he often met with informants and fellow detectives. Over a plate of Karelian pasties and a cold beer, he asked around about anyone who might have sent such an enigmatic letter.

One of his contacts, a retired cop named Kari, looked at him seriously. "I know someone who knows something," he said quietly. "Meet me at the harbor tonight."

That evening, Antti made his way to the dock, where Kari was waiting for him. He led him to a small boat moored in the shadows.

"This is Mikko, Aino's boyfriend when she disappeared," Kari explained, gesturing toward a man dressed in dark jeans and a hoodie. "He never spoke about what happened to her, but... "

Mikko hesitated before speaking up. "I was going through some old files when I found a note from Antti – your sister, Aino." He handed Antti a crumpled piece of paper.

The words on the page were simple: "Look for me in Rovaniemi." It was an obscure town far north, almost impossible to reach without a flight. Antti's eyes locked onto Mikko's. This could be it – his chance to finally find out what happened to Aino.

Without hesitation, Antti thanked Mikko and set off on the long journey to Rovaniemi. He knew he would face many challenges along the way, but one thing was certain: this message had sparked a fire within him that wouldn't extinguish until justice was served.
