Antti Kovacs, a former Special Forces operative turned mercenary, sat in the dimly lit bar, nursing a whiskey on the rocks. His rugged features and piercing blue eyes seemed to bore into those who dared meet his gaze. The air was thick with tension as he listened to the whispers of the patrons, all of whom knew better than to cross Antti Kovacs.

A former member of Finland's elite military unit, Sisu, Antti had left it all behind after a fateful mission went horribly wrong. Haunted by the memories of what he'd seen and done, he'd turned to mercenary work, using his skills to take on high-stakes missions for those willing to pay top dollar.

As he sipped his drink, a young woman with piercing green eyes slid onto the stool beside him. "Mind if I join you?" she asked, her voice husky and confident.

Antti raised an eyebrow but didn't respond. The woman smiled and leaned in close. "I'm Lena, by the way."

"Kovacs," he replied gruffly, his accent thick and unfamiliar to those who hadn't grown up speaking it.

Lena's eyes sparkled with curiosity as she ordered another round for both of them. As they talked, Antti found himself drawn to her sharp wit and quick intelligence. For the first time in years, he felt a glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, he'd left his demons behind.

But as the night wore on, Antti's instincts began to kick in. He noticed a group of rough-looking men eyeing them from across the room, their intentions clear. "Looks like we've got some unwanted company," Lena said, her hand slipping onto the butt of her gun.

Antti nodded and stood up, his eyes scanning the room for potential exits or threats. With a few swift movements, he dispatched the would-be thugs, leaving them to slink away in disarray. As the dust settled, Antti turned back to Lena, who raised an eyebrow at his efficiency.

"You're quite the package, Kovacs," she said with a smile.

Antti snorted, taking another swig of whiskey. "I'm just trying to make a living."
