Antti Salvini stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the desolate station. It had been five years since he'd last set foot in Helsinki, but the memories remained as vivid as ever. He took a deep breath, feeling the salty air fill his lungs, and began to walk towards the old café on Korkeavuoren.

Inside, the familiar scent of coffee and smoke enveloped him like a warm hug. The bartender, a gruff old man named Juhani, looked up from behind the counter and raised an eyebrow.

"Antti, what brings you back?" he asked, his voice as gravelly as ever.

Salvini slid onto a stool, running a hand through his dark hair. "Just passing through," he said, his eyes drifting towards the old photographs on the walls. "I needed to clear my head."

Juhani nodded, pouring him a shot of vodka without asking. Salvini tossed it back, feeling the liquor burn its way down his throat.

It had been five years since he'd left Helsinki, leaving behind the only life he'd ever known. He'd been a rising star in the city's underground music scene, but a scandal had forced him to flee. Now, he drifted from town to town, playing small gigs and living off scraps.

As he sipped his coffee, Salvini watched a young couple enter the café, laughing and holding hands. They looked like they belonged in a dream world, not this one. He shook his head, feeling a pang of regret.

"Want to talk about it?" Juhani asked, his voice softening.

Salvini took a deep breath, letting the memories wash over him. "Just a lot of what-ifs," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "What if I'd stayed? What if I'd never left?"

Juhani nodded sympathetically. "You can't turn back the clock, Antti."

Salvini smiled wryly, feeling a glimmer of hope. Maybe Juhani was right. Maybe it was time to move on, to find a new sound and a new purpose.

As he finished his coffee, Salvini stood up, his eyes scanning the café one last time. The photographs seemed to be watching him, their subjects frozen in time like ghosts.

"Thanks for listening," he said, turning to leave.

Juhani nodded, a small smile playing on his lips. "Come back soon, Antti. We'll have another shot waiting for you."
