Antti Wagner sat alone in his small, cluttered office, surrounded by stacks of dusty files and forgotten dreams. He was a man of few words, with a rugged exterior that hid a heart full of sorrow.

As a former detective, Antti had seen it all – the worst of humanity's darker corners. But after a decade spent chasing down cold leads and solving gruesome crimes, he'd finally cracked under the pressure. His marriage had crumbled, his friends had distanced themselves, and even his own mother couldn't bear to look at him.

Years passed, and Antti retreated from the world. He took up woodworking as a hobby, churning out intricate wooden boxes and figurines in his spare time. The rhythmic thud of his plane against the wood was soothing, almost therapeutic.

One day, a knock at the door broke the silence. It was his old partner, Heli. She'd heard rumors that Antti had been seen leaving town one night, never to return. But there he was, looking as rugged and worn as ever.

"Thought you'd lost your mind for good," Heli said, eyeing the stacks of files and the half-finished wooden box on his desk.

Antti shrugged, a small smile creeping onto his face. "Just needed some fresh air, I guess."

Heli settled into a chair, watching Antti work on a new piece – a delicate wooden bird with intricate feathers and wings. As he worked, she asked him about the old cases they'd solved together. The ones that still haunted him to this day.

Antti's eyes clouded over as memories flooded back. The screams of victims, the weight of guilt bearing down on his shoulders, the shattered lives of those left behind... He paused, his hands stilled mid-air, as if collecting himself from a storm.

"You know," Heli said softly, "you're still one of the best. I need your help with something."

Antti raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. For the first time in years, he felt like coming back to life – just for that moment, at least.

Over a cup of cold coffee and stale cookies, Antti told Heli about his dreams of leaving town once more. The wood shop had become a refuge, but even its soothing rhythms couldn't silence the whispers from within. Maybe, with her help, he could find redemption too – in the midst of darkness.

As they packed up to leave, Antti smiled wryly at himself, wooden bird still clutched tightly in his hand. He was back, for now. And this time, maybe, just maybe he'd be brave enough to face whatever came next.
