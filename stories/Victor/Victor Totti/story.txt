Victor Totti stepped out of his worn leather jacket and into the dimly lit tavern, the smell of stale beer and sweat hanging heavy in the air. A former mercenary and wandering assassin, he had lost count of the number of lives he'd claimed over the years. Some said he was cursed, that his presence brought nothing but death and destruction.

As he made his way to the bar, a hooded figure caught his eye, sitting alone in the corner. There was something familiar about them, yet Victor couldn't quite place it. He took a seat next to the stranger, ordering a whiskey from the bartender as he waited for his drink to arrive.

"You're not from around here, are you?" the mysterious figure asked, their voice low and gravelly.

Victor raised an eyebrow. "I get that a lot."

The hooded figure pushed back its hood, revealing a young woman with piercing green eyes. Victor's instincts screamed at him to be cautious, but there was something about her that put him at ease.

"My name is Elara," she said, extending a hand. "And you are...?"

"Victor Totti," he replied, taking her hand in a firm handshake.

As they sipped their drinks, Victor found himself opening up to Elara in ways he never thought possible. She listened with an intensity that made him feel like he was the only person in the world.

"What brings you here?" she asked, as the night wore on and the tavern began to empty.

Victor hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. But something about Elara's presence put him at ease, so he told her his story - of the lives he'd claimed, the battles he'd fought, and the scars that still lingered.

Elara listened, her eyes never leaving his face, as Victor recounted his tale of violence and survival. When he finished, she reached out and placed a hand on his arm.

"You're not just an assassin," she said softly. "You're a survivor."

In that moment, something shifted inside Victor. For the first time in years, he felt like he was being seen, truly seen, rather than just being judged or feared. He smiled, feeling a weight lift from his shoulders.

As they parted ways outside the tavern, Elara handed him a small package. "For next time we meet," she said with a smile.

Victor took the package, feeling a glimmer of hope for the first time in years. Maybe, just maybe, he wasn't alone after all.
