Victor Mikhailov stepped out of his small apartment and onto the streets of Moscow, the chilly morning air stinging his face. He wrapped his coat tighter around him as he made his way to the city's oldest café, where he knew he'd find his friend, Sofia, already sipping on a warm cup of coffee.

As Victor entered the cozy café, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee enveloped him, and he felt a sense of comfort wash over him. Sofia looked up from her book and smiled as he approached their usual table by the window.

"Good morning, Viktor," she said, using his full name for the first time that day.

Victor Mikhailov chuckled and took a seat across from Sofia. "Good morning, Sofia. You know I prefer Viktor to Viktori, but it's been a while since anyone's called me that."

Sofia laughed and poured Victor another cup of coffee from the pot on the table. As they sipped their drinks in comfortable silence, Victor couldn't help but feel grateful for the friendship he shared with Sofia.

Their conversation turned to the latest news about the city's art scene, and Victor mentioned a new exhibition at the Tretyakov Gallery that he was eager to check out. Sofia promised to accompany him the following week, and they made plans to meet up again before then.

As they finished their coffee, Sofia glanced at her watch and stood up. "I have a meeting to get to," she said, using Victor's full name once more for emphasis. "It was great catching up with you, Viktor Mikhailov. Take care of yourself, okay?"

Victor watched as Sofia walked out of the café, feeling grateful for their deep connection. He took one last sip of his coffee and left the cozy spot, looking forward to his upcoming visit to the Tretyakov Gallery and another chance to spend time with his dear friend Sofia.

As he disappeared into the bustling streets of Moscow, Victor felt a sense of contentment wash over him, knowing that in a city full of strangers, he had found a true companion in Sofia.
