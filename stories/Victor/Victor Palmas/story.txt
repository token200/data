Victor Palmas was a man consumed by his passion for photography. His fingers moved with precision as he adjusted the aperture and shutter speed, capturing the perfect moment on film. As a renowned photographer, Victor had worked with some of the most prestigious clients in the industry.

Despite his success, Victor's personal life was far from glamorous. He lived in a small studio apartment in the city, surrounded by his equipment and half-finished projects. His relationship with his ex-wife, Sofia, was still complicated, and they rarely spoke. Victor preferred it that way, as he didn't want to get tangled in her drama.

One evening, as Victor was reviewing his recent work, he received an unexpected visit from Sofia. She stood at the door, looking as beautiful as ever, but with a hint of sadness in her eyes. "I've been thinking about us, Victor," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I know we haven't spoken in years, but I still care for you."

Victor's expression remained stoic, but he felt a flutter in his chest. He didn't know how to respond, as he had built walls around himself to protect against the pain of their failed marriage. Sofia left soon after, leaving Victor alone with his thoughts.

The next day, Victor received an email from Sofia, inviting him to meet her at a local café. Curiosity got the better of him, and he agreed to meet her there. As he sat down across from Sofia, he noticed the faint lines etched into her forehead and the gray hairs that had begun to sprout in her once-luxurious locks.

Sofia took Victor's hand, and for a moment, they locked eyes, their connection still palpable despite the years apart. "I'm sorry, Victor Palmas," she said softly. "I was wrong to leave you all those years ago."

Victor looked away, his heart still heavy with emotion. He didn't know if he could forgive Sofia or find it in himself to open up again. But as they sipped their coffee and talked long into the night, Victor felt a glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, he was ready to face the past once more.

As the evening drew to a close, Victor stood up, his mind reeling with thoughts and emotions. He knew that no matter what happened next, Sofia would always be a part of him, like the lens on his camera – never truly forgotten.
