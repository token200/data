Victor Szabo stepped into the dimly lit caf√©, his eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As a former CIA operative turned private investigator, he had seen his fair share of shady characters and illicit dealings. His thick, Hungarian accent seemed to blend in seamlessly with the urban landscape of New York City.

Szabo made his way to the bar, ordering a whiskey on the rocks as he surveyed the patrons. A young woman sat alone at a table by the window, her eyes fixed intently on her laptop screen. He recognized the telltale signs of cybercrime - she was using an unsecured network to access sensitive information.

As Szabo approached the woman, his instincts told him that something wasn't quite right. She looked up, startled, as he introduced himself. "I'm Victor Szabo, private investigator," he said, flashing a badge.

The woman's demeanor shifted from nervous to wary. "What do you want?" she spat, crossing her arms over her chest.

Szabo leaned against the counter, his eyes locked on hers. "My client believes that your company is involved in some shady dealings. I'm here to get to the bottom of it."

The woman snorted, rolling her eyes. "You think we're just some fly-by-night operation? We're a legitimate business, with real clients and legitimate profits."

Szabo raised an eyebrow, intrigued by her defensiveness. He leaned forward, his voice taking on a persuasive tone. "I'm not here to make accusations, sweetheart. I just need to know the truth. Can you do that for me?"

For a moment, Szabo thought he saw a glimmer of uncertainty in the woman's eyes. Then, her mask slipped back into place, and she shook her head. "No."

Szabo nodded, tucking his badge away. He had seen enough. "Alright, then. I'll be keeping an eye on you. You can count on it."

As he turned to leave, Szabo couldn't shake the feeling that he was missing something - a key piece of evidence or a crucial detail that would crack the case wide open. But for now, he had to trust his instincts and follow the lead. Victor Szabo was in this for the long haul, no matter what secrets lay hidden beneath the surface.
