Victor Põld was a man consumed by his work. A renowned Estonian engineer, he spent most of his waking hours designing innovative solutions to improve the country's infrastructure. His colleagues often joked that he had only one love in life: engineering.

Despite his demanding profession, Victor was known for his kindness and dedication to his family. He lived with his wife, Maria, and their two young children in a cozy apartment overlooking Tallinn's Old Town. On weekends, you could find Victor helping out at the local farmer's market, where he would regale customers with tales of his latest engineering triumphs.

One sunny Saturday morning, as Victor was loading crates of freshly picked strawberries into his small van, a group of children gathered around him, their eyes wide with excitement. "Papa Põld, what's your most amazing invention?" they chimed in unison. Victor chuckled and scratched his rugged beard. "Ah, my young friends, I've got a story for you. You see, just last week, I designed a new system to optimize the flow of water through Tallinn's canals."

As he spoke, Maria appeared at his side, carrying a basket of freshly baked dark rye bread. "Victor, don't work too hard today," she cautioned, playfully snatching a piece of bread from his pocket. Victor smiled and wrapped an arm around her waist. "Don't worry, my love. I'll take it easy. But soon, the city will be singing my praises!"

The children laughed at the idea, their eyes sparkling with curiosity. As they watched Victor carefully load his van and head off to the office, they turned to Maria and asked, "Momma, is Papa Põld really the greatest engineer in Estonia?" Maria smiled and ruffled her children's hair. "I think he just might be," she said, smiling at Victor's proud profile as he disappeared into the distance.

Back at his cluttered office, Victor lost himself in the world of gears and pulleys, his mind racing with ideas for the next big project. The sounds of Tallinn drifted through the window – laughter from children playing in the park, the distant chime of the city's famous bell tower. As he worked, a sense of contentment settled over him: Victor Põld was exactly where he belonged.
