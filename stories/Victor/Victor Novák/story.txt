Victor Jan Novák, a former professional rugby player, sat in his small café, nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee. It had been five years since he last stepped onto the pitch, and the silence was deafening. He couldn't shake off the feeling that a part of him was still out there, waiting to be unleashed.

Victor's eyes wandered around the café, taking in the familiar sights of worn wooden furniture and faded rugby posters on the walls. He had spent countless hours within these walls, discussing strategy with his teammates, sharing stories of their respective childhoods, and dreaming of the next big match.

As he sat there lost in thought, a young boy walked into the café, clutching a rugby ball to his chest. Victor watched with a mixture of nostalgia and longing as the boy's eyes sparkled with excitement as he began to imagine himself on the pitch. He remembered when he was once that same age, full of energy and dreams.

The boy caught sight of Victor and froze, unsure whether to approach or not. Victor smiled weakly and beckoned him over. The boy hesitated for a moment before cautiously making his way towards him.

"Hi there," Victor said softly. "You like rugby?"

The boy nodded enthusiastically, and Victor began to reminisce about his own rugby days. He told the boy stories of victories and defeats, of teamwork and perseverance. As they talked, the boy's eyes lit up with excitement, and for a moment, Victor felt like he was back on the pitch, surrounded by friends and adrenaline.

After a while, the café began to empty out, and Victor realized it had been hours since he'd ordered another drink. The boy said his goodbyes and promised to return soon. As Victor watched him leave, he felt an unexplained sense of purpose stirring within him. Maybe, just maybe, there was still time for Victor Jan Novák to come back to the game.

For the first time in years, Victor felt a glimmer of hope that he might not be done yet. It wasn't going to be easy, but with the boy's infectious enthusiasm, perhaps he could rediscover his love for rugby and forge a new path forward. With renewed determination, Victor Jan Novák slowly got up from his chair, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
