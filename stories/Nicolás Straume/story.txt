Nicolás Straume stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. It had been years since he'd last set foot in Ravenswood, the small town where he grew up. The once-thriving industrial hub now lay in decline, its factories shuttered and its people dwindling.

As a young man, Nicolás had always felt restless, driven by a restless energy that could never be contained within these narrow streets. He'd left Ravenswood as soon as he was old enough, bound for the bright lights of the city, where he made a name for himself in the art world. Paintings of Ravenswood's landscape – its rugged coastline and abandoned factories – had become his signature style.

But after years of living elsewhere, Nicolás found himself back in Ravenswood. The town was quieter now, its pace slower, as if it too was waiting for something to stir once more. His mother had passed away a few months ago, leaving him the old family homestead on Willow Creek Road.

As he walked through the empty streets, Nicolás noticed the familiar rhythms of life that still lingered here – children playing in the park, shopkeepers haggling over prices, farmers hauling their daily produce to market. The town was quiet and alive, its pulse subtle but real.

At his mother's homestead, Nicolás discovered a world frozen in time. Trunks still overflowed with her clothes and books, and the kitchen table held an unopened plate of dinner leftovers from the night before. His mother would never forgive him for not staying to help clean up after her passing.

Over the next few weeks, as he settled back into Ravenswood life, Nicolás began painting again – capturing the faded grandeur of the old factories, the way sunlight filtered through boarded-up windows like a dying ember. He painted more than just landscapes now; he painted memories – the childhood laughter in the park, his mother's hands moving deftly over the kitchen counter.

And yet, with every brushstroke, Nicolás felt an itch growing inside him. This wasn't what he'd come back for – not exactly. It was as if Ravenswood had claimed a piece of him when he left, and now it wanted more. He couldn't shake the feeling that his past, and his present, were inextricably tangled.

As night fell over Ravenswood once again, Nicolás leaned against his mother's old rocking chair – worn wooden joints creaking softly. This was home now. Maybe, just maybe, he could stay a little longer this time.
