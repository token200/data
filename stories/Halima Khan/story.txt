Halima Khan stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. She had been away for three months, and the smell of stale air and exhaust fumes hit her like a slap in the face. It was as if no time had passed at all.

Halima was a woman with a past she didn't want to acknowledge, a present she struggled to control, and a future that seemed uncertain. Growing up on the streets of Karachi had taught her to rely only on herself, to trust no one, and to expect nothing from anyone but a fight. She had left home after a family argument, determined to make a name for herself in the city.

As she made her way through the crowded station, Halima spotted a familiar face - her cousin, Amira, holding a worn leather suitcase by the handle. "Halima! Beta!" (child) Amira exclaimed, dropping the bag and sweeping Halima into a tight hug.

The two women had grown apart over the years, but their shared experience of being orphans had created an unbreakable bond between them. Amira's family had taken her in when they were both young, providing a makeshift home until she was old enough to leave for university.

After three months of traveling and working as a waitress, Halima finally had enough money to visit Amira for the first time since leaving. The reunion was emotional, with both women tearing up over each other's company.

Amira took Halima on a tour of the city, showing her old haunts and new sights. They laughed together at memories from their childhood, reminiscing about late-night strolls along the beach and sleepless nights huddled around candles in cramped alleyways.

As they walked through the bazaars, Halima noticed the way Amira's smile faltered for a moment as she passed by a street vendor selling handicrafts - her father had made them when he was alive. It was then that Halima realized how much her cousin missed him still.

Over the next few days, the two cousins explored Karachi together, taking in its vibrant culture and rich history. They danced to Sufi melodies at a rooftop cafe, sharing tears of laughter over silly jokes and late-night whispers of hopes and dreams for their futures.

Halima had always been wary of getting too close, fearing that if she let someone in, they would leave her just like everyone else did. But with Amira by her side, she felt a sense of belonging she hadn't experienced since childhood.
