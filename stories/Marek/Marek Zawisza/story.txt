Marek Zawisza stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of his old acquaintance, Kasia. It had been months since they last spoke, and Marek was beginning to think he'd never see her again. But as he made his way through the crowded space, a familiar smile caught his attention.

Kasia sat at the bar, sipping on a mug of ale, her raven-black hair cascading down her back like a waterfall. Marek's heart skipped a beat as he approached her, his long legs striding confidently towards her table.

"Marek Zawisza," Kasia said, her voice husky and warm, "I should have known you'd show up eventually."

Marek slid onto the stool beside her, running a hand through his dark hair. "You knew I would, Kasia. You always did know where to find me."

As they caught up on old times, Marek couldn't help but notice the changes in Kasia. Her eyes seemed brighter, her laughter more carefree. She was no longer the brooding, introverted girl he'd once known.

Over mugs of ale and plates of steaming food, Marek and Kasia reminisced about their time together, their adventures on the battlefield, and their losses. It was a bittersweet conversation, but one that left both of them feeling lighter, as if they were shedding old burdens.

As the night wore on, Marek realized he'd been given a rare gift: a second chance at friendship with someone who had always understood him better than anyone else. He leaned in closer to Kasia, his voice barely above a whisper.

"Thank you for being here, Kasia. For seeing me, even when I didn't think anyone could."

Kasia's eyes met his, and Marek saw the old spark of their bond reigniting between them. It was a flame that would never truly fade, no matter what challenges lay ahead.

In that moment, Marek knew he'd made the right decision in coming to this tavern, searching for a piece of himself lost long ago. For with Kasia by his side, he felt like he could face anything, knowing he had someone who understood him – Marek Zawisza – someone who would stand by him no matter what the future held.
