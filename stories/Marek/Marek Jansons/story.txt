Marek Jansons stepped into the dimly lit pub, the cold winter air clinging to his trenchcoat like a shroud. He scanned the room, his piercing green eyes locking onto the figure of Lena, her raven hair standing out against the sea of patrons. As he made his way towards her, the patrons parted like the Red Sea, whispers and knowing glances exchanged among them.

Marek Jansons was a man with a reputation, one that preceded him like a specter. A former CIA operative turned rogue, he had built a name for himself as a master of manipulation and deception. His skills were in high demand, but at a steep price - his loyalty was for sale to the highest bidder.

Lena slid onto the stool beside him, her hand brushing against his as she took a sip of her drink. "You're late," she said, her voice husky with amusement.

Marek Jansons flashed her a disarming smile, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "Traffic," he lied, taking a seat beside her.

The bartender slid a whiskey-stained glass down the bar, and Marek Jansons tossed back the contents in one swift motion. Lena raised an eyebrow as he slammed the glass down onto the counter, but said nothing.

As they sipped their drinks in silence, the weight of Marek Jansons' past bore down on him like a physical force. He had lost loved ones to the very world that now sought his expertise. The scars still lingered, etched into his psyche like a battle-hardened shield.

Lena broke the spell, her voice low and even. "I have a job for you," she said, her eyes glinting with calculation.

Marek Jansons' gaze snapped back to hers, his mind already racing with possibilities. He knew that when Lena asked for help, it was a sure thing - but at what cost?
