Marek Yu stepped out of the crowded train station and into the crisp morning air. As a freelance journalist, he had grown accustomed to the fast-paced lifestyle that came with it. With his trusty notebook and pen in hand, Marek Yu set off to meet his source for the story of the week.

His source was a reclusive businessman who had been accused of embezzlement by several investors.

From covering local events to taking on high-profile cases, Marek Yu's career had been nothing short of meteoric. His colleagues often joked that he was born with a reporter's instinct, and while it wasn't entirely true, Marek Yu knew that it was close enough.

He arrived at the agreed-upon location – a small café on the outskirts of town – and spotted his source waiting for him. The businessman, known only as "Mr. Lee," seemed nervous but cooperative, and Marek Yu quickly got to work.

For the next hour, Marek Yu peppered Mr. Lee with questions about his involvement in the embezzlement scheme. As he scribbled notes furiously in his pad, Marek Yu's mind whirred with connections and plot twists. He was on the cusp of something big, and he knew it.
