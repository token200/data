Marek Esther sat alone in her small apartment, staring blankly at the wall as she listened to the sounds of the city outside. It had been a year since her best friend, Alex, passed away, and Marek was still struggling to come to terms with the loss.

As she lost herself in thought, Marek's mind began to wander back to the good times they shared together. She remembered the laughter, the late-night conversations, and the adventures they had embarked on as teenagers. It was a bittersweet reminder of what could never be again.

Just then, her phone rang, breaking the silence. It was her sister, Sofia, calling to check in. Marek hesitated for a moment before answering, not wanting to burden Sofia with her emotions.

"Marek, how are you doing?" Sofia asked, concern evident in her voice.

Marek sighed, feeling a lump form in her throat. "I'm okay, sis. Just missing Alex, that's all."

Sofia listened attentively on the other end of the line before responding, "I know it's hard, Marek. But you're not alone. We're all here for you. Why don't I come over and we can talk about it?"

Marek agreed, feeling a wave of gratitude towards her sister. Sofia arrived an hour later, bearing a tray of fresh-baked cookies and a warm smile.

As they sat down to eat, Marek opened up to Sofia about her feelings of guilt and grief. Sofia listened attentively, offering words of comfort and support. For the first time in months, Marek felt like she was letting go of some of the weight that had been holding her back.

Over the next few hours, they talked and laughed together, sharing stories and memories of Alex. It was a bittersweet reminder that even though he was gone, his legacy lived on through their friendship and shared experiences.

As Sofia prepared to leave, Marek turned to her and said, "Thank you for being here for me, sis. I don't know what I'd do without you."

Sofia smiled and hugged her tight. "You'll never have to find out, Marek Esther. We're in this together, always."
