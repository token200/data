As Marek Wei-lun drew closer to his goal, he could feel the weight of destiny upon him. The prophecy had foretold that he would face great trials before succeeding in his quest. But with every step forward, he grew stronger, his resolve unshakeable. Would Marek Wei-lun be able to fulfill his duty and save the empire? Only time would tell.
