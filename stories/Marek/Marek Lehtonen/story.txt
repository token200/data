Marek Lehtonen sat at his desk, staring blankly at the latest design for his new restaurant venture. As a seasoned restaurateur and entrepreneur, he had always been driven by a passion for innovation and creativity. But as he sipped his lukewarm coffee, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing.

Just then, his phone rang. It was his business partner, Marko. "Hey Marek, I have some news," Marko said. "I just got back from a meeting with a potential investor and it looks like we've got a deal."

Marek's face lit up. This could be the break they needed to take their restaurant to the next level. But as he listened to Marko explain the details of the investment, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of unease.

"Okay, so what exactly does this investor want in return for their investment?" Marek asked, trying to sound nonchalant.

"Well, they're looking for 20% equity," Marko replied. "But I think we can negotiate that."

Marek hesitated for a moment before responding. He had always been proud of his independence and the fact that he didn't owe anyone anything. But as he looked around at his restaurant, which was still in its infancy, he knew they needed all the help they could get.

"Okay, fine," Marek said finally. "We'll take it."

The next few weeks were a blur of activity as they worked to finalize the deal and prepare their restaurant for launch. But despite his best efforts, Marek couldn't shake the feeling that he had just made a deal with the devil himself.

As the big day approached, Marek's nerves began to fray. He paced back and forth in front of the kitchen counter, going over every possible scenario in his head.

But on opening night, everything went according to plan. The restaurant was packed with happy customers, and Marek's staff worked tirelessly to keep up with demand.

As he watched his business partner bask in the glow of success, Marek couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. Maybe this wasn't the end of independence after all. Maybe it was just the beginning.

The months that followed were some of the best of Marek's life. He worked tirelessly to ensure the restaurant remained on top of its game, while Marko handled the administrative side of things. Together, they created a culinary empire that wowed critics and customers alike.

And though he would always be wary of compromise, Marek knew that sometimes, it took having someone to watch your back to make all the difference in the world.
