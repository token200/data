Marek Ivanov had always been drawn to the world of street art. As a child, he spent hours sketching in his notebook, experimenting with different techniques and styles. His parents, though not initially supportive of his artistic pursuits, eventually came to see the passion and dedication that drove Marek.

After completing high school, Marek decided to pursue a career in graphic design, but it wasn't long before he found himself feeling stifled by the constraints of traditional design. He began to crave something more – something that allowed him to express his creativity on a larger scale.
