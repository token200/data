Marek Allende stepped into the dimly lit caf√©, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of his contact. He had received a cryptic message earlier that morning, summoning him to this very place. As he waited by the bar, he couldn't help but wonder who was behind the mysterious summons.

A figure emerged from the shadows, dressed in a long coat and a fedora. "Marek Allende," they said, their voice low and gravelly. "I've been looking for you."

Allende's instincts told him to be cautious, but he nodded curtly, his hand resting on the butt of his gun. The figure handed him a small folder, containing a single photograph.

"This is her," the figure said, their eyes glinting in the dim light. "She's been in trouble, Marek Allende. Someone is watching her, following her every move."

Allende's grip on the folder tightened as he recognized the face. It was his sister, Sofia, a journalist who had been investigating some of the city's most powerful corruption cases.

"What do you want me to do?" he asked, his voice firm but controlled.

The figure smiled, their lips curling upwards. "I want you to protect her," they said. "She's in danger, Marek Allende. You're the only one I can trust."

Allende felt a surge of anger and determination. He knew that taking on this case would put him in harm's way, but he also knew that he couldn't just stand by while his sister was being targeted.

"I'll do it," he said finally, his voice steady. "But you need to tell me more about what's going on."

The figure nodded, producing a small device from their pocket. They pressed a button, and a holographic display flickered to life above the table.

"Listen carefully, Marek Allende," they warned. "What you're about to hear is classified information. You can't share it with anyone else."

Allende nodded, his eyes fixed on the display as he listened intently to the briefing that followed.
