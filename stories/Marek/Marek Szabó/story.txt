Marek Szab贸 knew that he had done something truly remarkable, and he couldn't wait to see how the collector would react when he saw his masterpiece for the first time.

For Marek Szab贸, there was no greater joy than bringing something old back to life, and he knew that this was just the beginning of an incredible journey.
