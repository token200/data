I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Marek DiCaprio. However, I assume you meant to ask for a story about Leonardo DiCaprio's character from a specific movie.

Here's a 400-word story based on Jack Dawson from "Titanic" (1997) - a character that was played by Leonardo DiCaprio:

The moon cast its silvery glow over the vast ocean, illuminating the horizon where the Titanic had once majestically sailed. The sea was calm, with only the faintest hint of currents that had once driven the ship to meet its tragic fate.

Marek, a friend of Jack's from their days on the streets of Liverpool, stood at the edge of the cliff, his eyes fixed on the waves below. He couldn't help but think about how things could have turned out differently if Jack were still alive. The memories of that fateful night still haunted him – the sound of screams, the feel of icy water seeping into his bones.

As he stood there, Marek felt a sense of nostalgia wash over him. He remembered the way Jack had made him laugh, the way he had always been willing to take risks and push boundaries. Jack's spirit seemed to be with him still, guiding him through life's ups and downs.

Marek took a deep breath, feeling the salty air fill his lungs. He thought about how far he'd come since those days on the streets – the triumphs and failures, the loves and losses. But most of all, he remembered Jack's unwavering optimism, his infectious enthusiasm for life.

With a sense of purpose, Marek began to walk along the cliffside path, feeling the rough stones beneath his feet. He knew that life was fragile, that it could slip away from us in an instant. And yet, as he looked out at the ocean, he felt a sense of hope – a reminder that even in the darkest moments, there is always a way forward.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Marek reached into his pocket and pulled out a small photograph of Jack and Rose standing together on the Titanic's deck. He smiled, feeling Jack's presence around him. In that moment, he knew that Jack was still with him, guiding him through life's triumphs and tribulations. And with that knowledge, Marek felt invincible – ready to take on whatever challenges came his way.
