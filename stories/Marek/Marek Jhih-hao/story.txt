Marek Jhih-hao stepped off the train and onto the bustling streets of Taipei, her eyes scanning the crowded platform for any sign of familiarity. A native Taiwanese woman with a mop of curly black hair and a warm smile, Marek Jhih-hao had spent countless hours studying the language and culture of her homeland, but she had never quite felt like she belonged.

As she made her way through the station, Marek Jhih-hao's thoughts turned to her family, who had left Taiwan for the United States years ago. Her parents had sent her a small package in the mail earlier that day, filled with traditional Taiwanese cookies and a note in Mandarin that read: "" (Māma xǐ huàn zài nà lǐ).

Marek Jhih-hao's stomach growled at the thought of the sweet treats, but she wasn't here to indulge in nostalgic comfort food. She was on a mission to reconnect with her roots and find out why her parents had left Taiwan in the first place.

After a short taxi ride, Marek Jhih-hao arrived at the old family home, now converted into a small tea house. The owner, an elderly woman named Auntie Lee, welcomed Marek Jhih-hao with open arms and offered her a steaming cup of oolong tea.

As they sat down to talk, Marek Jhih-hao asked about her parents' past, but Auntie Lee seemed hesitant to share too much. It wasn't until later that evening, when the tea house was quiet and the streets were empty, that Auntie Lee revealed the truth: her daughter had left Taiwan due to financial difficulties, and Marek Jhih-hao's father had been a struggling artist who couldn't make ends meet.

Marek Jhih-hao listened intently, feeling a sense of understanding wash over her. She realized that her parents' decision to leave had been motivated by a desire for stability and security, but also by a deep-seated fear of not being able to provide for their family.

As the night drew to a close, Marek Jhih-hao thanked Auntie Lee for her honesty and promised to stay in touch. She left the tea house with a newfound appreciation for her heritage and a sense of connection to the people who had shaped her life.
