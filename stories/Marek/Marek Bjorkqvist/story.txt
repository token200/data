Despite being drafted 17th overall by the Chicago Blackhawks, Bjorkqvist spent his early years in the minors, honing his skills and working tirelessly to improve his game.

However, it wasn't long before Bjorkqvist's hard work paid off. In 2009-2010, he made his NHL debut with the Blackhawks, immediately making a name for himself as a shutdown defender.

He led by example, always pushing himself to be better, even when no one was watching. And it paid off.
