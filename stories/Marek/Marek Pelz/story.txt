Marek Pelz stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of freshly brewed coffee wafting through the air. He had been away for months, and it felt like an eternity since he'd last set foot in his hometown of Prague.

As he made his way to the café where he was meeting his old friend, Tom, Marek couldn't help but think about how much had changed since his departure. The city seemed smaller, yet somehow larger, as if the absence of so many familiar faces had left a void that could never be filled.

Tom spotted him first, and his bright smile lit up the dimly lit room. "Marek Pelz! It's been too long!" he exclaimed, opening his arms for a warm hug.

Over steaming cups of coffee, Tom filled Marek in on all the gossip from his time away. Marek listened intently, laughing and nodding along as his friend recounted stories of their mutual friends and acquaintances.

As they chatted, Marek couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. He had always loved Prague, with its winding streets and historic buildings, but now it felt like he was seeing the city through new eyes. The memories that once seemed so vivid were starting to fade, replaced by a sense of wonder at how much he'd taken for granted.

As they sipped their coffee, Marek noticed a young woman sitting across from them, her eyes fixed intently on his face. He felt a flutter in his chest as she caught his eye and smiled, but quickly looked away, her expression neutral once more.

After finishing their drinks, Tom suggested a walk through the city, pointing out new shops and cafes that had opened since Marek's departure. As they strolled, Marek couldn't help but feel grateful for his friend's company, even as he knew it was only temporary.

Eventually, Tom bid him farewell, promising to catch up again soon. Marek watched as his friend disappeared into the crowd, feeling a pang of sadness at the thought of being separated once more. But as he turned to make his way back home, he caught another glimpse of the young woman from the café, this time with a glint in her eye that suggested she might be waiting for him.

Marek Pelz couldn't help but wonder what the future held, and if maybe – just maybe – this was where his journey next would take him.
