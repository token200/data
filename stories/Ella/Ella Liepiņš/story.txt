Ella Liepiņš stepped into the quiet café, her eyes scanning the dimly lit room as if searching for someone. She spotted an empty stool at the counter and slid onto it, the worn leather creaking beneath her weight.

The barista, a young woman with pierced lips and a kind smile, greeted Ella with a nod. "Kopēki, sēja?" – Coffee, black?

Ella shook her head, her dark hair falling like a curtain around her face. She had always preferred the bitter taste of coffee to the sweetness of life.

As she waited for her drink, Ella's mind wandered back to the events that had led her here. A talented musician with a passion for classical guitar, she had once been on the brink of stardom in Riga, Latvia. But a tragic accident during a performance had left her hand permanently damaged, shattering her dreams.

Now, at 30, Ella found herself living in exile, her music reduced to mere memories and longing gazes at old photographs. Her guitar collection, once the source of solace and inspiration, lay silent and still.

The barista handed Ella a steaming cup, which she accepted with a quiet sigh. She took a sip, feeling the rich flavors wash over her as if trying to revive a lost passion.

As Ella sipped her coffee, memories began to resurface – of summer concerts in the Old Town, of sold-out shows at the National Opera House, and of late-night jam sessions with friends who had since scattered like leaves on autumn winds. The bittersweet taste of nostalgia filled her mouth as she closed her eyes, allowing the emotions to wash over her.

When Ella opened her eyes again, the barista was watching her with a curious gaze, sensing that there was more to this reserved woman than met the eye. "Kadē?" – When?

Ella smiled faintly, and a glimmer of defiance sparked within her. She glanced around the café, ensuring no one was listening in. The sound of classical guitar echoed through her mind – not just as music, but as a symbol of resilience, of hope.

With newfound determination, Ella picked up the cup and began to hum a gentle melody. It was a quiet start, perhaps, but it was a beginning nonetheless, a tentative step into a future where music and memory intertwined like the strings on her silent guitar.
