Ella Jhih-hao was a young and ambitious artist living in the vibrant city of Taipei. Her full name, which she rarely introduced herself with, reflected her Chinese heritage and the unique sound of her Taiwanese mother's pronunciation. Ella's art studio was a cozy little space filled with canvases, paint-splattered easels, and an array of creative supplies.

One day, Ella received an email from a prominent gallery in Taipei, inviting her to showcase her work in their upcoming exhibition. She was both thrilled and intimidated by the opportunity. As she delved into preparing her portfolio, Ella's mind wandered back to her childhood, where she spent hours sketching the intricate carvings on her grandmother's wooden furniture.

The night before the exhibition, Ella Jhih-hao sat at her easel, staring blankly at a half-finished painting. She felt overwhelmed by the pressure of presenting her art to a crowd of strangers. Just as she was about to give up, her phone rang – it was her grandmother, calling to wish her good luck.

"Ella, I know you're nervous," her grandmother said in her soft, melodious voice, "but remember why you started creating art in the first place. It's not just about impressing others; it's about sharing a piece of yourself with the world."

Ella took a deep breath and began to paint again, this time with renewed passion and confidence. The next day, Ella Jhih-hao arrived at the gallery, her heart pounding with excitement. As she set up her stand, she felt a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over her.

The exhibition was a huge success, with art lovers and critics alike marveling at Ella's unique style and technique. As she packed up her belongings to leave, Ella couldn't help but think that her grandmother had been right all along – it wasn't about the external validation; it was about sharing her true self with the world. From that day forward, Ella Jhih-hao knew that she would continue to create art that was authentic and meaningful, no matter what lay ahead.
