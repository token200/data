Ella's instincts told her that this was no ordinary invitation. She had been investigating a series of strange occurrences in the city's sauna culture, and she suspected that this might be connected to one of her cases.

The next evening, Ella arrived at the Löyly sauna, her eyes scanning the dimly lit interior for any sign of her mysterious caller.
