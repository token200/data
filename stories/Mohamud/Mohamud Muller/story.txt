Mohamud Muller was a man with a passion for art and a penchant for adventure. A Swedish-Djiboutian sculptor, he had spent years honing his craft in the studios of Stockholm and the souks of Mogadishu. His work was a fusion of traditional Somali designs and modern European techniques, resulting in pieces that were both visually stunning and deeply meaningful.

One day, Mohamud Muller received an invitation to create a public installation for the city of Oslo's annual cultural festival. The theme was "identity," and the commission came with a stipend of $50,000. Overjoyed by the opportunity, Mohamud Muller set to work immediately, brainstorming ideas that would not only showcase his skills but also reflect the complexities of his own identity.

As he worked on the project, Mohamud Muller found himself drawn to the concept of "roots." He envisioned a massive stone sculpture, adorned with intricate patterns and motifs that spoke to his Somali heritage. The piece would be titled "Beneath the Surface," and it would serve as a poignant reminder of the tensions between cultural identity and global connectivity.

Months went by, and Mohamud Muller's creation began to take shape. The Oslo city officials were thrilled with the progress, but they also expressed concerns about the cost. Would the piece be feasible within the allocated budget? Mohamud Muller remained undeterred, convinced that his vision was worth the investment.

Finally, the day of the festival arrived, and "Beneath the Surface" was unveiled to a packed audience. The response was overwhelmingly positive, with many attendees commenting on the beauty and power of the sculpture. As for Mohamud Muller, he knew that he had not only created something remarkable but also given voice to his own experiences as a Somali-Swedish artist. His work would continue to inspire others, bridging cultural divides and celebrating the richness of human identity.
