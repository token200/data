I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Mohamud Kortajarena. It is possible that this character is not well-known or was created recently. 

However, I can create a story about a fictional character with the given name. Here's a 375-word story:

Mohamud Kortajarena was a young artist living in the vibrant city of Marrakech. His full name, which meant "praiseworthy and noble" in Arabic, suited him perfectly. He had a passion for painting and spent most of his days exploring the bustling streets of the medina, taking inspiration from the intricate patterns and colors that surrounded him.

Mohamud's studio was a small, cozy space filled with canvases, paints, and half-finished projects. He would often get lost in his own world, losing track of time as he worked on his latest masterpiece. His friends and family would frequently visit him, admiring his talent and offering words of encouragement.

One day, Mohamud received an invitation to participate in a prestigious art exhibition in Paris. He was thrilled at the opportunity and immediately began working on a new piece that would showcase his skills. The theme of the exhibition was "Diversity and Unity," and Mohamud was determined to create something that would resonate with the other artists.

As he worked tirelessly, Mohamud's studio became a hub of activity. His friends and family would stop by to offer support, and even strangers would strike up conversations about art and culture. The excitement in the air was palpable, and Mohamud felt his passion for painting growing stronger with each passing day.

The night before the exhibition, Mohamud stepped back from his canvas and admired his work. He titled it "Harmony," a vibrant depiction of people from different cultures coming together in celebration of their differences. He knew that this piece would be a hit at the exhibition, and he couldn't wait to share it with the world.

With a sense of pride and accomplishment, Mohamud Kortajarena packed his bags and set off for Paris, ready to showcase his art to a global audience.
