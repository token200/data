Mohamud Kalejs was a young Somali refugee who had been living in Minnesota for only a few months. He had fled his war-torn homeland with his family, leaving behind everything he knew and loved. Despite the challenges he faced, Mohamud remained determined to build a new life for himself.

As he navigated the unfamiliar streets of Minneapolis, Mohamud struggled to find his place in the community. He was constantly asked where he was from, as if his nationality defined him entirely. "I'm Somali," he would say patiently, trying to explain that it wasn't just about where he was born or raised.

Mohamud's greatest fear was losing himself in the process of adapting to a new culture. His parents had instilled in him a strong sense of identity and tradition, but as he grew older, he began to question whether those values were still relevant in his new life.

One day, while volunteering at a local community center, Mohamud met a group of Somali-American youth who shared his concerns. They discussed their own struggles with cultural identity and belonging. The group's leader, a charismatic young woman named Amna, encouraged them to celebrate their heritage rather than trying to hide it.

Mohamud took Amna's words to heart. He began attending Somali cultural events and cooking classes, where he learned the art of making traditional dishes like sambusa and hilib laaf. As he explored his roots, Mohamud felt a sense of connection to his community that he had been missing.

His family noticed the change in him too. "Mohamud Kalejs is finding himself," his mother would say with pride. His parents smiled as they watched their son rediscover his Somali identity, now intertwined with his new American life.

As the months passed, Mohamud grew more confident in his dual heritage. He realized that being Somali wasn't just a part of his past but also a vital aspect of his present. And when people asked him where he was from, he would say proudly, "I am Mohamed Kalejs, and I am home."
