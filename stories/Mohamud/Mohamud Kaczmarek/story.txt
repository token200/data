Mohamud Kaczmarek stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for any familiar faces. As a freelance journalist, he had grown accustomed to working from anywhere, but there was something about this particular coffee shop that drew him in. Maybe it was the smell of freshly brewed coffee or the soft hum of conversation, but Mohamud felt at home.

He spotted a figure huddled in the corner, nursing a cup of black coffee. As he approached, the figure looked up, and their eyes locked in a brief moment of recognition. It was his source, a former government official who had agreed to meet with him about a sensitive story.

Mohamud sat down across from his source, whose name was always Mr. Jenkins when speaking on the record, but tonight it seemed he wanted Mohamud Kaczmarek by his name. "So, what do you want to know?" Mr. Jenkins asked gruffly, eyeing the notebook and pen in Mohamud's hand.

Mohamud took a deep breath, his mind racing with questions. He had been investigating corruption within the government for months, but every lead seemed to end in a dead-end. Tonight might be different. As they spoke, he scribbled notes furiously, his eyes darting back and forth between Mr. Jenkins' face and the pages of his notebook.

The conversation flowed easily, like they had done many times before. Mohamud knew that look in Mr. Jenkins' eye – it was a mix of fear and defiance. He sensed that this story was bigger than he had initially thought, and his heart quickened with excitement.

As they wrapped up their meeting, Mohamud stood to leave, tucking his notebook into his bag. "Thank you, Mr. Kaczmarek," Mr. Jenkins said, a hint of irony in his voice. Mohamud smiled wryly, knowing that he was actually Mohamud Kaczmarek, and that this story would be one for the record books. He took a final sip of his own coffee before leaving the café, already mentally preparing himself for the long hours ahead.
