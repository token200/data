He continued to paint, using his art as a means to connect with his Somali community and promote cross-cultural understanding. His work became a symbol of hope and resilience, inspiring others to embrace their differences and find strength in their shared humanity.

He remained dedicated to his art and his people, using his platform to raise awareness about the struggles faced by refugees and immigrants worldwide.
