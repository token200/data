Mohamud Morel stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of saltwater and seaweed enveloping him like a warm hug. He had been away for years, but the rhythms of life in this small coastal town remained unchanged.

As he made his way through the quiet streets, the sunlight casting long shadows behind him, Mohamud's thoughts turned to the reason for his return. His mother, Fatima, lay ill in bed, her once-strong hands now fragile and pale. The doctor's prognosis was uncertain, but one thing was clear: Mohamud had to be there for her.

He arrived at his family's old house, the door creaking beneath his hand as he pushed it open. The interior remained unchanged, the same faded patterns on the walls, the same faint scent of cooking spices hanging in the air. It was a home that held memories and stories, each one etched into its very foundations.

Mohamud's eyes scanned the room, searching for any sign of his mother. He found her in the living room, reclining on a plush cushion, her eyes closed as if lost in sleep. He approached her slowly, not wanting to startle her.

"Fatima," he whispered, gently placing a hand on her forehead.

She stirred, opening her eyes to meet his. A faint smile played on her lips as she looked up at him. "Mohamud," she whispered back, her voice barely audible.

The two sat in silence for a moment, the only sound the gentle lapping of waves outside. Then, Fatima's grip on his hand tightened. "I'm sorry, Mohamud. I'm so sorry I haven't been strong enough for you."

Mohamud squeezed her hand reassuringly. "You don't have to apologize, Mama. You're not alone. I'm here now, and I'll take care of you."

As the days passed, Mohamud devoted himself to his mother's care, nursing her back to health with a fierce determination. He sat by her side, held her hand, and whispered words of love and comfort into her ear.

In those moments, surrounded by the familiar rhythms of life in this small coastal town, Mohamud felt a sense of peace wash over him. It was as if the threads of his past and present had finally begun to weave together, forming a tapestry of hope and belonging.

And though the road ahead would be uncertain, one thing was clear: Mohamud Morel would face it with courage, love, and the knowledge that home was where the heart was.
