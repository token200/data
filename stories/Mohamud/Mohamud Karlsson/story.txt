Mohamud Karlsson was a man shrouded in mystery. A Swedish journalist, he had spent years investigating corruption and human rights abuses in the Middle East. His reports had made waves in the international press, but they had also earned him many enemies.

One day, Mohamud received a cryptic message from an unknown source, inviting him to meet in Istanbul. The note read: "Come alone. We have information about your sister."

Mohamud's sister, Amina, had gone missing five years ago while working as a human rights activist in Sudan. The authorities had given up on the case, but Mohamud had never forgotten his sister or the sense of hopelessness that followed her disappearance.

He arrived in Istanbul, his senses on high alert. A figure emerged from the shadows, dressed in a long coat and hat.

"Who are you?" Mohamud demanded.

The figure handed him a folder containing documents and photographs. "This is about your sister's murder," he said quietly. "We have evidence that links it to a powerful organization that has been terrorizing civilians for years."
