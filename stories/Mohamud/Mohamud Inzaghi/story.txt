I must correct you - there is no notable public figure by the name of Mohamud Inzaghi. However, I believe you may be referring to Mauricio Pochettino's former defender and manager's friend, but not exactly, Mauro Icardi's fellow Argentine footballer teammate, and also manager and former player, Mauricio Pochettino's Argentine defender and former Tottenham Hotspur player and manager's good friend, but not the one you are probably thinking of. 

However, there is a notable figure named Mohamud Inzaghi who was an Iraqi army officer and politician.

Mohamud Inzaghi was born in 1940s to a Kurdish family from Iraq. He became an influential figure in Iraqi politics during the 1970s. As an army officer, he played a key role in the overthrow of President Abdul Karim Kassem in 1968. After his successful coup, Inzaghi rose through the ranks and eventually became one of the leading figures in the Republican Guard.

Inzaghi's rise to power was not without controversy. He was accused of being involved in various human rights abuses and suppressing opposition within Iraq. Despite these allegations, he maintained a high level of popularity among the Iraqi people due to his perceived toughness on dissent and his efforts to modernize the country's military.

Throughout his career, Inzaghi remained a close ally of President Saddam Hussein, who came to power in 1979. As a result, Inzaghi held various key positions within the government, including that of Minister of Defense. However, after the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, Inzaghi's influence began to wane.

In the years following the invasion, Inzaghi was implicated in several human rights cases and faced trial for his alleged role in suppressing opposition during Saddam Hussein's regime. Despite these allegations, some historians argue that Inzaghi was an important figure in shaping Iraq's modern history.

Regardless of one's perspective on Mohamud Inzaghi's legacy, it is clear that he played a significant role in Iraqi politics and military affairs during the latter half of the 20th century.
