Mohamud Berzina was known throughout the small town of Azalia for his exceptional baking skills. As a young boy, he would spend hours in the kitchen with his grandmother, learning the intricacies of traditional Somali pastries and cakes. Her teachings had stuck with him, and now at 25, Mohamud Berzina owned his own bakery, where he brought a taste of his homeland to the local community.
