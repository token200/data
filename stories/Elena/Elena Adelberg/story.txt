Elena Adelberg stepped off the crowded subway car and onto the bustling streets of Manhattan. As she made her way through the throngs of people, her eyes scanned the sidewalks for any signs of trouble. She had spent years honing her skills as a private investigator, and she knew that in this city, you couldn't always trust your instincts.

Elena's eyes landed on a small, sleek sedan parked by the curb. A woman with short, spiky hair sat behind the wheel, eyeing the Adelberg Investigations office building across the street with interest. Elena recognized her - it was Sofia Rodriguez, a rival PI who had been trying to poach her clients for months.

Without hesitation, Elena turned on her heel and strode towards the sedan. The woman's eyes flicked up in surprise as Elena approached, but she quickly regained her composure.

"What can I do for you, Elena?" Sofia asked, her voice dripping with sweetness.

Elena smiled wryly. "Just making sure you're not slumming it with the help, Sofia. What brings you to my neck of the woods?"

Sofia's smile faltered for a moment before she regained control. "Oh, I'm just in town for a conference. But I have to say, I've been looking for a new challenge. And I hear Adelberg Investigations is the place to be."

Elena snorted. "Well, you've come to the right place. But let me make one thing clear: I don't take kindly to competition. Especially when it's coming from someone as...unscrupulous as yourself."

Sofia's eyes narrowed, but Elena could see the faintest glimmer of amusement in her gaze. "Oh, I'm shaking in my boots, Elena. But I think we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement. After all, there are plenty of cases out there that need solving, and two PIs with your skills aren't going to have an easy time competing for them."

Elena raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite herself. It seemed Sofia was offering her a way in - not a partnership, exactly, but a tentative truce. Elena considered it for a moment before nodding.

"Alright, Sofia. Let's play nice. But don't think this means I'm going to let my guard down anytime soon."

Sofia laughed, the sound low and husky. "I wouldn't have it any other way, Elena."
