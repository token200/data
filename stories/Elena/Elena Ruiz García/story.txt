Elena Ruiz Garc√≠a stepped off the crowded bus and onto the bustling streets of Madrid. As she made her way through the throngs of people, her eyes scanned the faces for one familiar figure - her younger brother, Carlos.

It had been two years since their parents' tragic death in a car accident, leaving Elena to care for Carlos alone. She had put her own life on hold to raise her little brother, but now that he was old enough, she felt it was time to start looking after herself again.

As she walked down the street, Carlos caught sight of her and ran towards her with a big smile on his face. "Elena! I'm so glad you're here!" he exclaimed, throwing his arms around her waist.

Elena smiled back at him, feeling a mix of emotions - happiness to see her little brother again, but also worry about the future. She had always put Carlos first, and now that he was growing up, she knew she couldn't keep putting her own needs on hold forever.

Just then, their mother's old friend, Sofia, appeared out of nowhere, carrying a large basket of food. "Hola, Elena! I brought lunch for you both," she said, handing the basket to Carlos.

Elena took a bite of the delicious tapas, feeling a sense of comfort and nostalgia wash over her. Sofia had been like a second mother to their family, always there to offer a listening ear and a helping hand.

As they ate, Elena couldn't help but think about what lay ahead for herself and Carlos. She knew she couldn't stay in Madrid forever, not with her own dreams of studying art and becoming a photographer. But for now, she was content to be here with her little brother, enjoying the simple pleasures of life.

After lunch, they decided to take a stroll through the Retiro Park, enjoying the sunshine and the vibrant colors of the flowers. As they walked, Elena couldn't help but feel grateful for this moment, this chance to spend time with Carlos before she moved on to bigger things.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm glow over the city, Elena knew that she would always treasure these moments with her little brother. And even though she had no idea what the future held, she knew that as long as she had Carlos by her side, she could face anything that came their way.
