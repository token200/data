Mathilda Nieminen stood at the edge of the frozen lake, her eyes fixed on the distant woods. It was a crisp autumn morning, and the air was alive with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. She breathed it in deeply, feeling the chill of the winter months slowly seeping into her bones.

Mathilda had always felt most at home when she was alone with nature. As a child, she would spend hours exploring the forests and fields surrounding her small village, collecting leaves and pinecones for her makeshift craft projects. Her parents, though loving, were always busy with their own lives – her father's carpentry shop and her mother's weaving – so Mathilda found solace in the quiet solitude of the natural world.

As she gazed out across the frozen lake, a memory crept into her mind like a ghostly presence. It was one of those fleeting, ephemeral moments that seemed to hold an entire lifetime within it. She must have been 10 years old at the time – maybe even younger. Her best friend from childhood, Anna, had taken her on this very same journey, and they'd spent hours watching the snowflakes dance in the pale sunlight.

But then, disaster struck. A sudden storm rolled in, catching them off guard. Mathilda remembered the sound of branches snapping and ice cracking beneath their feet as they struggled to make it back to safety. The final memory was one of Anna's laughter, her bright blue eyes shining with excitement even as the wind howled around them.

The years had passed since then, but the ache within Mathilda's chest remained a constant companion. She'd lost Anna that day – died in a tragic accident just short of their 12th birthday. The village would never be the same without her presence, and for Mathilda, the pain seemed to intensify with each passing year.

As she stood on the lake's edge now, the wind whipping her dark hair into a frenzy, Mathilda felt an odd sense of calm wash over her. It was as if the forest itself was trying to tell her something – that time had passed, but memories remained, frozen in the ice and snow like a thousand delicate shards.

With a gentle sigh, she took her first step onto the lake's surface, her boots crunching softly into the thawing ice. The sound echoed through the stillness, and for an instant, Mathilda thought she could hear Anna's laughter again – faint but unmistakable. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she looked out across the frozen expanse, feeling a strange sense of peace settle within her.

Perhaps it was only her own imagination playing tricks on her, or perhaps something deeper was happening. Either way, Mathilda felt a spark ignite within her – a flame that flickered to life in the darkness, like a candle lit by the dying embers of yesterday's memories. And though she knew it wouldn't change what had been lost forever, for this moment at least, she could let go of grief and simply breathe.
