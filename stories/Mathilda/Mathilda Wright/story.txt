Mathilda Wright stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It was a chilly autumn morning, and the misty air clung to her skin like a damp shroud. She pulled her coat tighter, the familiar weight of her belongings in her bag a comforting presence.

As she emerged from the station, Mathilda's gaze fell upon the crumbling Victorian mansion that loomed before her. Her eyes lingered on the faded façade, the windows boarded up and the door ajar as if inviting her to enter. She took a deep breath, a mix of trepidation and anticipation stirring in her chest.

The Wright estate had been her family's home for generations, but after her parents' tragic passing, Mathilda was left with nothing but memories and the weight of her own secrets. The once-grand mansion now stood as a testament to her family's decline, its beauty faded like the pages of an old book.

As she approached the entrance, a figure emerged from the doorway – her brother, Elijah. His eyes narrowed as he took in Mathilda's worn attire and the familiar air of solitude surrounding her. For a moment, they stood there, the only sound the creaking of old wooden floorboards beneath their feet.

"Eli," Mathilda said finally, breaking the silence. "It's been years."

Elijah stepped aside, allowing Mathilda to enter. The interior of the mansion was musty and still, the air thick with the scent of decay. As she moved through the rooms, Mathilda couldn't help but feel a sense of disorientation – this was her childhood home, yet it felt like a stranger's lair.

Elijah followed her, his footsteps echoing off the walls. "You're here for the reading," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "The one you've been researching."

Mathilda nodded, her eyes drifting toward the dusty old library that dominated one corner of the room. She had spent years tracking down the rare texts she needed, piecing together a puzzle of secrets and lies that would unravel the truth about their family's dark past.

As the morning sun crept higher in the sky, casting long shadows across the floor, Mathilda knew that this was just the beginning – a journey into the heart of her own history, and perhaps, finally, toward a sense of redemption.
