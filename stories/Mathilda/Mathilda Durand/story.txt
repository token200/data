Mathilda Durand stood at the edge of the old, creaky pier, her eyes fixed on the waves crashing against the shore. It was a typical summer evening in Ravenswood, with the air thick with the scent of saltwater and sunscreen. The town's annual festival was in full swing, but Mathilda had always found it to be a bit too much for her taste.

As she gazed out at the water, memories began to surface. Memories of her childhood, spent exploring these very same streets and piers with her best friend, Leo. They'd spent countless hours playing tag, chasing seagulls, and trying to catch the perfect wave. But life had other plans for them, and they grew apart as they entered their teens.

Mathilda's thoughts were interrupted by a faint whistle. She turned to see Leo standing at the end of the pier, his eyes locked on hers with an unmistakable grin. He was a few years older now, but that mischievous glint in his eye remained unchanged.

The two friends shared a long-standing rivalry, one fueled by a deep affection for each other. They'd constantly try to outdo one another, whether it was in pranks, competitions, or even just who could eat the most fish and chips at the local cafe. But beneath all that banter, they knew there was something more.

As Mathilda watched, Leo started to make his way towards her, the whistle growing louder with each step. When he reached the pier's edge, he leaned against the railing, his eyes never leaving hers. "Hey, Maddy," he said, using the nickname only he ever used for her.

Mathilda's cheeks flushed as she smiled back at him. They'd grown up together, shared countless secrets and dreams, and yet somehow, they still felt like strangers to each other. She shook off the feeling, turning to Leo with a mischievous grin of her own. "What are you doing here?"

Leo chuckled. "Just watching the sunset, I guess. Thought it might be nice to reminisce about old times."

Mathilda nodded, taking a step closer to him. The pier creaked beneath their feet as they stood side by side, gazing out at the waves. In that moment, the past seemed to fade away, and all that was left was the present â€“ the two of them, standing on the edge of Ravenswood, bound together by threads of friendship and memories that refused to die.
