Mathilda Vargas Llosa stepped out of the misty morning air and into the grand foyer of the family estate, her eyes scanning the opulent decorations with a mix of disdain and detachment. She was a woman of few words, and even fewer emotions.

As she entered the room, the butler, Mr. Jenkins, bowed low to greet her. "Good morrow, Miss Vargas Llosa. A lovely day, isn't it?"

Mathilda's gaze flicked to the clock on the wall, its mechanical tick-tock a reminder that time was wasting. "It's not," she said curtly. "I have a meeting with my lawyer at 10."

Mr. Jenkins nodded discreetly and withdrew, leaving Mathilda to her thoughts. She wandered over to the window, gazing out at the lush gardens below. Her mind, however, was elsewhere.

The family had always been influential, their name synonymous with wealth and power. But Mathilda's life had not turned out as she'd expected. She was the youngest of four siblings, and her parents' expectations weighed heavily on her shoulders. Her brother, Alejandro, had taken over the family business; her sister, Sofia, pursued a high-society marriage; and even their eldest sibling, Carlos, had followed in the footsteps of their father's late career as an artist.

Mathilda, however, had other plans. She'd always been drawn to the world beyond the estate's walls – a world of art, music, and literature. Her passion lay with poetry, but her family had deemed it a frivolous pursuit for someone of their stature.

As she lost herself in thought, Mathilda heard the soft voice behind her. "May I join you?"

She turned to see her younger brother, Sebastian, hovering by the door. His eyes sparkled with mischief, and Mathilda's heart softened ever so slightly.

"What are you doing here?" she asked gruffly.

Sebastian smiled mischievously. "Just wanted to steal a moment with my favorite sister."

Mathilda smiled wryly. No one had called her that in years – not since childhood, when Sebastian was the only one who'd seen past the mask of indifference.

Together, they stood by the window, gazing out at the day ahead. For the first time in years, Mathilda felt a spark of excitement ignite within her. She wasn't sure what the future held, but with Sebastian by her side, she knew that anything was possible.

As they parted ways, Mathilda felt a glimmer of hope – not for herself, perhaps, but for her younger brother. For once, it was he who looked to her as his guiding light, and in that moment, something within Mathilda shifted ever so slightly.
