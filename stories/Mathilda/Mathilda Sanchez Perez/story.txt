Mathilda Sanchez Perez was always known as Miti to her close friends and family. She had a spark in her eyes that could light up even the darkest of rooms. Born and raised in the vibrant city of Havana, Cuba, Miti grew up surrounded by the rich sounds and smells of salsa music, Cuban coffee, and the rhythmic beat of the maracas.

As a child, Miti was fascinated by the stories of her abuela, who would regale her with tales of her own adventures as a young woman in Cuba. Abuela's words were like a warm hug on a cold winter day, filling Miti's heart with hope and determination. She knew that one day she too would make her mark on the world.

Growing up, Miti was a curious and creative soul. She spent most of her free time practicing dance, playing music on her guitar, or painting vibrant murals on the walls of her neighborhood. Her passion for art and music only grew stronger as she entered adulthood, inspiring her to pursue a career in both fields.

Miti's big break came when she landed a spot in a prestigious art program at the University of Havana. There, she met like-minded individuals who shared her dreams and passions. Together, they formed a tight-knit community that supported each other through thick and thin.

Years went by, and Miti's talents began to gain recognition. Her artwork was featured in galleries throughout Cuba, and her music was played on the radio stations of Havana. People from all walks of life would stop her on the street, saying "¡Miti, tu música es la vida!" ("Miti, your music is life!") as they danced to the rhythm of her guitar.

As she stood on stage, feeling the energy of the crowd, Miti knew that Abuela's words had come true. She was living her dream, and it felt like home. With a smile spreading across her face, Miti strummed the final chord, knowing that this was where she belonged – as an artist, as a woman, and as Mathilda Sanchez Perez.
