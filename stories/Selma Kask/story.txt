Selma Kask was a 25-year-old graphic designer from Tallinn, Estonia. She had always been fascinated by the way people interacted with their surroundings and how it affected their behavior and emotions. Growing up in a small coastal town, she spent most of her childhood exploring the woods and observing the way the natural world influenced the locals.

As she grew older, Selma became increasingly interested in the field of psychology and human behavior. She decided to pursue a degree in design with a focus on user experience (UX), hoping to apply her knowledge of human behavior to create more intuitive and engaging interfaces for people.

After completing her studies, Selma landed an internship at a prestigious design firm in Tallinn. Her work involved conducting extensive research on the needs and preferences of clients, as well as designing prototypes that would effectively meet their demands.

One day, while browsing through a local art gallery, Selma stumbled upon an exhibition featuring works by Estonia's most renowned artist, Jaanis Ruubel. Among the paintings, one piece in particular caught her eye: "The Forgotten Forest". The large-scale painting depicted a dense, primeval forest where trees seemed to writhe and twist in agony.

Selma was struck by the eerie feeling that accompanied this work. It was as if she had stepped into the very heart of the forest itself, surrounded by an overwhelming sense of despair and desolation. In an impulsive moment, she decided to contact Jaanis Ruubel himself.

Their conversation left a lasting impression on Selma. The artist spoke candidly about his own emotional struggles during the creation of "The Forgotten Forest". He revealed that he had based the painting on a real location deep in the Estonian woods – a place where an ancient forest had been intentionally cleared by local authorities to make way for new agricultural projects.

This information sparked something within Selma. She felt compelled to embark on a personal journey, delving deeper into the connection between humans and their environment. She quit her internship and began planning a series of solo expeditions across Estonia's most remote regions.

The first stop was a place called Kõrvemaa – an old, abandoned mine where, during World War II, over 3000 people were trapped underground for weeks due to the Soviet army's air raid on Tallinn. According to local legend, those who managed to escape would often suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.

As Selma ventured deeper into Kõrvemaa, she sensed an almost palpable weight of history and trauma. The mine seemed to be shrouded in a perpetual gloom, its stone walls reflecting the anguish that had been inflicted upon those trapped within. She spent days documenting her observations and interviewing local residents who shared stories about their families' experiences during World War II.

Selma's findings would eventually become a critically acclaimed book titled "Echoes of the Forgotten". It not only explored Estonia's wartime history but also probed into the lasting psychological impact on generations that followed. Selma's narrative captured the eerie connection between a place and its people, leaving readers with an unsettling feeling – much like she had experienced during her visit to Jaanis Ruubel's gallery.

The book quickly gained attention from media outlets across Estonia, but for Selma, this was just the beginning of her quest. She went on to collaborate with local authorities and NGOs to develop initiatives focused on preserving abandoned sites as "memory places". This involved converting areas like Kõrvemaa into community-run museums that honored the stories of people who lived – or perished – within their walls.

In the years that followed, Selma continued her exploration of Estonia's uncharted territories. She created digital narratives about forgotten forests, old abandoned mines and wartime prisons. Her work sparked both fascination and controversy among locals, sparking heated debates on how to preserve history while honoring those who came before us.

One evening, while sipping coffee in a small café near the Tallinn port, Selma received an unexpected call from Jaanis Ruubel himself. "Your book opened doors," he said quietly, over the phone. "It brought out secrets that had been buried for decades."

As she hung up, tears began to well up in Selma's eyes. That moment marked a turning point for her – it solidified her purpose as an artist, not just to tell stories about Estonia but to also give voice to those who had remained silent.

Years later, when asked about the significance of "The Forgotten Forest", Jaanis Ruubel replied that it represented his own attempt to convey the anguish that people feel when a connection with nature is disrupted. In a quiet corner of Tallinn's Old Town, an exhibition featuring Selma Kask's work was held – and amidst her haunting photographs and stories, a painting by Jaanis stood proudly as testament to their shared vision: a reminder of how Estonia's most troubled past serves as a poignant mirror for its present, and perhaps even more so, the future.
