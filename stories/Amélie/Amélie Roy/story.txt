Amélie Roy stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar station. It had been months since she'd left Paris, fleeing the city's suffocating grip after a painful breakup. The small town of Willow Creek, nestled in the heart of Montana, was meant to be a refuge – a place where she could escape the memories and rebuild.

As Amélie made her way through the station, the warm sun on her skin felt like a gentle hug. She had always loved this time of year, when the world seemed to slow down and the air vibrated with possibility. The townspeople, too, were quiet and kind, welcoming strangers with open arms.

Her grandmother, Ouelle, waited for her outside the station. Amélie's mother had passed away a few years ago, leaving Ouelle to care for their farm – the only inheritance Amélie could think of as she'd left Paris with nothing but a suitcase and a dream.

Ouelle swept Amélie into a warm hug, her eyes shining with tears. "Bienvenue à Willow Creek, chère," she whispered.

The drive from the station took them along winding roads, past fields of golden wheat and wildflowers that danced in the breeze like ballerinas on stage. As they approached the farm, Amélie felt a spark of excitement – this was where her stories came alive. Her grandmother had told her tales of the land's secrets, of hidden waterfalls and ancient forests, waiting to be discovered.

As they reached the farmhouse, Amélie spotted a figure standing by the door, arms crossed against his chest. "C'est toi," he said with a grin, as she approached him – the one person who'd stayed behind when she left Paris: Théo.

Théo had been Amélie's confidant back in Willow Creek, and their friendship had blossomed into something more over time. When Amélie realized her feelings went beyond friendship, they hesitated to reveal them to each other.

Now, as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky with hues of pink and orange, Amélie smiled up at Théo. "Je suis revenue," she said softly – I've come back.

Without a word, Théo stepped forward, his eyes locked on hers, and took her hand. The world around them melted away, leaving only the gentle hum of crickets and the promise of new beginnings.
