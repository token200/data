Lea Järvinen stepped into the dimly lit studio, her eyes scanning the room for any signs of life. As a renowned photographer, she had spent countless hours in cramped spaces like this one, but there was something peculiar about this particular shoot.

The model, a petite young woman named Emma, sat poised on the edge of the bed, her gaze fixed intently on Lea. The setup was simple: a single lamp casting a warm glow over the scene, and the faint scent of old books wafting from the shelves surrounding them.

"Lea?" Emma's voice broke the silence, hesitant. "What's going on?"

Lea smiled, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "Just capturing the essence of this space," she said, gesturing to the camera. "I want to freeze time for a moment."

Emma raised an eyebrow but nodded, settling back into position. Lea snapped pictures, capturing the intricate patterns on Emma's skin, the subtle way her eyes sparkled in the dim light.

As the session progressed, Lea began to notice something peculiar – Emma seemed...off. Not quite right. She couldn't quite put her finger on it, but there was an underlying tension, a sense of restlessness that Lea couldn't ignore.

"Emma?" she asked, her voice softer now. "What's going on? You seem...different."

Emma hesitated, then leaned forward, her voice barely above a whisper. "I'm not myself today," she said. "Something...else is here with me."

Lea's eyes narrowed, her mind racing. She had worked with models before, but never one who claimed to be possessed by something otherworldly.

"I see," she said finally, trying to keep her tone neutral. "Let's just focus on the shot, then."

But as Lea continued to take pictures, she began to feel an inexplicable presence in the room – a shadowy figure lurking just beyond the edge of her vision. It was as if Emma had mentioned something out of a shared delusion.

When the shoot finally ended, Lea turned off the camera and gathered her things. "I think we're done," she said, trying to usher Emma toward the door.

But Emma lingered, her eyes locked on some point beyond Lea's shoulder. And in that moment, Lea swore she saw a flash of shadowy energy, like something was passing from one body to another – and she knew that this shoot would be unlike any other.
