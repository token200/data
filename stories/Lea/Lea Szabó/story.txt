Lea Szabó stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. It had been months since she'd last seen her friend, Rachel, and Lea was determined to catch up.

As she waited in line, Lea's mind wandered back to the events that had led her here. She'd left Hungary six months ago, after a painful breakup with her boyfriend, Áron. The memory of his rejection still stung, but Lea was determined to start anew.

She ordered a coffee and took a seat at the bar, just as Rachel spotted her and waved enthusiastically. Lea smiled, feeling a wave of relief wash over her.

"Lea! It's been ages!" Rachel exclaimed, sliding onto the stool beside her.

Lea leaned in, happy to have someone to talk to. "I know, it's crazy how fast time passes," she said, sipping her coffee. "What have you been up to?"

Rachel launched into a story about her latest art project – a series of paintings inspired by the Hungarian countryside. Lea listened intently, nodding along as Rachel spoke.

As they chatted, Lea found herself opening up to Rachel in ways she hadn't expected. The two friends had always been close, but since Lea's departure, their communication had become sporadic. Now, with Rachel's warm smile and infectious laugh, Lea felt like she was getting a second chance at friendship.

But as the hours passed, Lea began to feel a pang of restlessness. She knew that staying in Budapest wouldn't be enough; eventually, she'd have to face the fears that had driven her here in the first place.

Rachel seemed to sense her unease and reached out, taking Lea's hand in hers. "You're not going to get stuck in Budapest forever, you know," she said softly.

Lea squeezed her friend's hand reassuringly. She knew Rachel was right. With a newfound determination, she made a promise to herself: to take the next step towards healing and rediscovery.

As they parted ways outside the café, Lea felt a sense of peace wash over her. She knew that no matter what lay ahead, she'd face it with courage – thanks to the unwavering support of friends like Rachel.
