Despite her many accomplishments, Lea de' Medici remained humble and kind-hearted, always willing to lend a helping hand to those less fortunate than herself. Her compassion earned her numerous allies among the city's poor and marginalized, who came to regard her as a guardian angel in disguise.

One such ally was Lorenzo dei Medici, Lea's cousin and close friend. Together, they plotted to reform Florence's oppressive laws and establish a more just society for all its citizens. Their efforts were met with fierce resistance from the city's entrenched elite, but Lea de' Medici remained undeterred, using her intelligence and cunning to outmaneuver their opponents at every turn.
