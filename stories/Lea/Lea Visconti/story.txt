Lea Visconti had always been a free spirit, never one to conform to societal expectations. As the eldest child of the powerful Visconti family, she was expected to follow in her parents' footsteps and secure an advantageous marriage. But Lea had other plans.

Growing up, Lea had been fascinated by the ancient art of alchemy, spending hours poring over dusty tomes and conducting experiments in her makeshift laboratory. Her parents, while not entirely understanding their daughter's passion, did their best to support her interests.

As Lea entered adulthood, she became increasingly restless, feeling trapped by the expectations placed upon her. She longed to explore the world beyond her family's castle walls, to experience the thrill of discovery and creation for herself. Her parents, however, remained resolute in their desire for her to secure a suitable marriage.

One day, Lea received an offer from a wealthy merchant who proposed that she join him on one of his business ventures. The promise of adventure and independence was too enticing to resist, and Lea accepted the proposal.

As she set out on her journey, Lea's parents were devastated. They had never considered the possibility of their daughter leaving the family fold, and they struggled to come to terms with the loss. But Lea was determined to forge her own path, using her skills and knowledge to build a new life for herself.

Years later, Lea Visconti returned to her family's castle as a successful entrepreneur and adventurer in her own right. Her parents, though still a bit dismayed by their daughter's unconventional choices, couldn't help but be proud of the strong and capable woman she had become.

Lea smiled wryly as she reflected on her journey, thinking back to the countless hours spent studying alchemy and experimenting with new potions. It was that passion that had set her on this path, and she knew it would continue to guide her for years to come.
