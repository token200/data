Lea Johansson stepped out of her small apartment, taking a deep breath of the crisp morning air. As a freelance writer and part-time barista, she was used to early starts. But on this particular morning, something felt different.

As she made her way to the coffee shop where she worked, Lea's mind wandered back to the strange occurrences that had been happening in her neighborhood lately. Tools gone missing from yards, paint cans knocked over in front of houses, and the sound of whispers carried on the wind at night. It was as if someone - or something - was watching her.

Lea quickened her pace, feeling a shiver run down her spine. She pushed open the door to the coffee shop, greeted by the warm smile of her boss, Maria.

"Good morning, Lea! The usual," Maria said, referring to the large cup of black coffee that Lea always ordered.

As Lea began to prep for the day's customers, she noticed a piece of paper on the counter with a cryptic message scrawled on it: "The eyes that see are not the ones that look." Lea's heart skipped a beat as she recognized the phrase from an old mythology book she had been reading.

She felt a chill run down her spine as Maria handed her a tray of steaming cups. "You okay, kiddo?" Maria asked, noticing Lea's pale complexion.

Lea forced a smile and took a deep breath. "Just a little tired, that's all."

As the day went on, Lea couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. She kept catching glimpses of movement out of the corner of her eye - only to turn and find no one there. The whispers seemed louder now, echoing in her ears like a warning.

As closing time approached, Lea gathered her things and made a hasty exit. As she stepped back into the quiet streets, she felt a presence behind her. She spun around, but it was just Maria, smiling and waving goodbye.

"See you tomorrow, kiddo," Maria said, as Lea disappeared into the night.

Lea didn't wait to see what other mysteries the day would bring. She quickened her pace, her heart pounding in her chest, as if she was running from something - or someone - that only she could see.
