When she finished reading, the audience erupted into applause, whistling and cheering for more. Lea Wiśniewska smiled, her face glowing with a quiet satisfaction. She had shared her art with strangers, but in that moment, they felt like old friends.

As she took her final bow, Lea Wiśniewska couldn't help but think back to the early days of her career, when she would read her work on street corners and in tiny cafes.
