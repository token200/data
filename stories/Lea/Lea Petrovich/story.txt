Lea Petrovich stepped into the bustling café, her bright blue eyes scanning the crowded room with a mixture of curiosity and wariness. As a former spy, she had grown accustomed to being in the shadows, but her latest mission had brought her back into the light.

She spotted her contact, a woman named Sophia, sitting at a small table by the window. Lea made her way over, weaving through the throng of patrons with practiced ease. Sophia looked up as Lea approached, her eyes locking onto hers with a hint of recognition.

"Lea Petrovich," Sophia said, her voice low and smooth. "I see you're back in town."

Lea slid into the seat across from Sophia, her gaze sweeping the café before settling on the other woman. "What have you got for me, Sophia?"

Sophia leaned forward, a small smile playing on her lips. "I have information about your sister's disappearance. It seems she was involved with some... unsavory characters."

Lea's eyes narrowed, her mind racing with possibilities. She had been searching for answers for months, and this could be the break she needed.

"What do you know?" Lea pressed, her voice firm.

Sophia hesitated before speaking, her words spilling out in a rush. "I have reason to believe that your sister was working for a rogue agent within the government. Someone who has been using their position to further their own interests."

Lea's eyes widened, her mind reeling with the implications. She had suspected as much, but to hear it confirmed by someone she trusted was a welcome respite from the uncertainty.

"Who is it?" Lea asked, her voice low and deadly.

Sophia glanced around the café before leaning in closer. "I'm not sure yet," she admitted. "But I'll find out. And when I do, you can bet I'll bring them down."

Lea nodded, a fierce determination burning within her. She would stop at nothing to uncover the truth and bring her sister's killers to justice. As Lea Petrovich, she was ready for whatever lay ahead.
