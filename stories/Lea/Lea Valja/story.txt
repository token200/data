Lea Valja stepped into the crowded café, scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Maria, sipping on a latte in the corner and made her way over. As she approached, Maria looked up and smiled.

"Hey, Lea! Long time no see," Maria said, setting down her cup.

Lea took a seat across from Maria and ordered a coffee. "I've been meaning to ask you, have you seen any new movies lately?" she asked, curiosity getting the better of her.

Maria nodded enthusiastically. "Actually, I just saw the latest Sofia Coppola film. It was amazing."

Lea's eyes lit up. She had always been a fan of Coppola's work and had seen all of her films multiple times. As they chatted, Lea couldn't help but think about how much she wanted to meet Sofia one day.

After finishing their drinks, Maria suggested they take a walk along the riverfront. The sun was setting, casting a warm glow over the water. They strolled in comfortable silence, watching the boats drift by.

As they walked, Lea's mind began to wander back to her own passion project – a photography series she had been working on for months. She had always loved capturing the beauty of nature through her lens and was determined to show it off at an upcoming art exhibit.

"Hey, Maria? Can I ask you something?" Lea said suddenly, turning to her friend.

Maria looked at her curiously. "What's up?"

Lea hesitated for a moment before speaking. "I've been thinking about starting my own business. Something related to photography and art."

Maria's eyes lit up with excitement. "That sounds amazing, Lea! You're so talented – I have no doubt you'll make it happen."

As they continued their walk, Lea felt a surge of determination and gratitude towards her friend for believing in her. She knew that with Maria by her side, she could conquer anything.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Lea Valja made a mental note to start working on her business plan right away. With her friend's encouragement, she was ready to take the leap and turn her passion into a reality.
