Lea Perin stood at the edge of the bustling market square, her eyes scanning the vibrant stalls as she searched for any sign of trouble. As a member of the city watch, it was her job to keep the peace and maintain order in this thriving metropolis.

With her short, dark hair tied back in a practical knot, Lea Perin surveyed the crowd with a practiced air of caution. She had been watching the market all morning, taking note of who was where and what they were doing. So far, everything seemed normal – though she did spot a suspicious character lurking around the edge of the square.

Lea Perin's gaze narrowed as she took in the stranger's rough-looking clothing and scuffed boots. There was something about him that didn't add up. She made a mental note to keep an eye on him, just in case he decided to cause any trouble.

As she turned back to the market stalls, Lea Perin spotted her friend, Jax, hawking his wares at a nearby stall. She strode over to join him, flashing him a quick smile as she reached out to buy one of his famous embroidered cloths.

"Hey, Léa!" Jax exclaimed, using the affectionate nickname only he used. "What brings you to the market today?"

"Just keeping an eye on things," Lea Perin replied, her expression serious. "There's something about that stranger over there that doesn't sit right with me."

Jax followed her gaze and raised an eyebrow as he spotted the suspicious character. "Yeah, I saw him earlier," he said quietly. "He's been asking questions about the new shipment of goods arriving tonight."

Lea Perin's grip on the cloth tightened in her hand. She knew that shipment was supposed to be a routine delivery – but if someone was asking too many questions, it could mean trouble.

Without hesitation, Lea Perin strode off towards the city gate, Jax following closely behind. Together, they made their way through the crowded streets, determined to get to the bottom of whatever was going on in this bustling market square. As they walked, Lea Perin knew that she and her friend were ready for whatever came next – they had each other's backs, no matter what.

Together, they moved swiftly and silently towards their destination, determined to put an end to any potential trouble before it began.
