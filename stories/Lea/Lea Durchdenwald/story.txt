I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named "Lea Durchdenwald". However, I believe you may be referring to the character from the novel and film series "Red Queen" by Victoria Aveyard.

If that's correct, here's a 400-word story based on Lea Durwyn:

The cold air stung her cheeks as Lea Durwyn stepped off the carriage and onto the cobblestone streets of New London. Her eyes scanned the crowded market stalls, searching for any sign of her buyer, Lord Antlerdale. She had been hired to procure a rare shipment of silversmiths' tools, rumored to be hidden deep within the city's underbelly.

As she navigated through the throngs of people, Lea's gaze landed on a familiar figure - Finn, the captain of the guard, watching her from across the square. Their eyes met for a brief moment before he turned away, his expression unreadable.

Lea sighed and continued on her way, weaving past vendors selling everything from rare spices to second-hand clothing. She had heard whispers that Lord Antlerdale's true intention was not to trade the tools, but to use them as leverage in a game of power politics between the ruling families. Lea knew better than to trust such schemes; she had seen what happened when people underestimated her and her skills.

As she turned down a narrow alleyway, the sound of clanging metal grew louder. She followed the noise to a small, rundown workshop hidden behind a tattered curtain. A burly man with thick arms and a missing tooth grinned at her from beneath his bushy eyebrows.

"You're here for the tools," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "I've got them right where you want them."

Lea's eyes narrowed as she examined the workbench. The tools were indeed there, but she noticed that some of the components were missing. She smiled to herself - this was going to be a fun negotiation.

"I'll take them," she said, her voice dripping with amusement. "But first, I need something in return."

The man's grin faltered for a moment before he nodded and produced a small pouch from beneath his apron. Lea's eyes widened as she counted the gold coins within - this was going to be worth more than she had initially thought.

"Let's shake on it," she said, extending her hand.

As their palms touched, Lea felt a spark of electricity run through her body. She quickly pulled back, her expression neutral once more. It seemed that Finn might have been right all along - there was something about Captain Antlerdale that didn't add up.

With the tools safely in her possession, Lea made her way back to the carriage, already thinking two steps ahead of Lord Antlerdale's plans. She had a feeling that this game of cat and mouse would be far from over.
