Lea Cooper stepped into the small café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting at the corner table, nursing a cup of coffee and staring out the window.

It had been two years since she'd last seen him, but the memory of their parting still lingered in her mind like an open wound. The city lights twinkling outside seemed to fade into the background as Lea approached him, her feet carrying her on autopilot towards his table.

As she drew closer, he looked up and their eyes met for a fleeting moment before his gaze dropped back to his coffee cup. Lea felt a pang in her chest but pushed it aside, taking a seat across from him instead.

"So, what brings you here?" she asked, breaking the silence.

He shrugged, his shoulders barely rising above the tablecloth. "Just passing through. Thought I'd grab a cup of coffee before I head out again."

Lea raised an eyebrow. "You always were one for vagueness, weren't you?"

A faint smile crept onto his face, and she felt her heart skip a beat as their eyes locked once more. It was the same spark that had drawn her to him in the first place – the one that made her want to unravel all of his secrets and understand what lay beneath.

"I'm just not the 'stay-in-one-place' type," he said finally, chuckling at the thought.

Lea laughed too, feeling a weight lift off her shoulders. "I remember you once told me that getting restless was what drove you to explore new places."

The corners of his mouth twitched upward. "You're right. It's just that sometimes, even when I'm moving from one place to another, the world feels small and insubstantial. Until I see someone who challenges all my preconceptions about life."

Lea's heart swelled at the words, feeling like he was speaking directly to her. She reached out, her hand grazing his as she placed it on top of hers.

"It still does," she whispered.

He didn't say anything else, just looked up at her with a deep understanding in his eyes. In that moment, Lea knew that some things never changed – that their connection was more than just geography or circumstance; it was the core of who they both were.

The city outside might have been full of possibility and uncertainty, but within those walls of the café, time had stood still for one very long second.
