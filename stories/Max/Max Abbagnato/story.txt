Max Abbagnato stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station with a practiced air of detachment. As a freelance journalist, he'd grown accustomed to moving from place to place, never staying long enough to put down roots.

With a worn leather bag slung over his shoulder, Max made his way through the crowded corridors, nodding curtly at fellow commuters as he went. His full name was Max Abbagnato, and he'd always found that keeping people at arm's length helped him stay focused on his work.

He hailed a taxi outside the station and gave the driver an address – an old apartment building on the outskirts of town, where his contact for the day would be waiting. As they sped through the streets, Max pulled out his phone and began to review notes from their previous conversation. He was working on a story about local social services, and he wanted to get as much information as possible.

The taxi dropped him off at the apartment building, a nondescript tenement with peeling paint and rusty fire escapes. Max climbed the stairs to the third floor, where his contact – a woman named Sophia – waited for him in a cramped, dimly-lit room.

Over the next hour, Sophia filled Max in on the latest developments from the social services department. He listened intently, taking notes and asking questions as she spoke. When she finished, he thanked her and stood up to leave.

As he walked back down the stairs, Max couldn't help but feel a twinge of fatigue. This was what it meant to be a journalist – always chasing leads, always digging for truth. He made his way back to the station, where he picked up another train bound for the next town on his route.

The wheels rolled beneath him as he settled into his seat, lost in thought. Max Abbagnato had seen so many places, met so many people. But no matter where he went or who he met, there was one thing that remained constant: his drive to uncover the truth.
