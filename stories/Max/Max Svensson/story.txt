Max Svensson stepped into the dimly lit pub, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. He had been searching for weeks, following every lead, every rumor, every hint that might bring him closer to finding his sister.

It was seven years since her disappearance, and the pain still felt like an open wound. Max's parents had long given up hope, but not him. He was convinced that she was still out there, waiting for him to find her.

As he made his way to the bar, a figure caught his eye - a young woman with piercing green eyes, sipping on a whiskey. She looked up as Max approached, and their gazes locked in a moment of mutual understanding.

"Mind if I join you?" Max asked, taking a seat next to her.

The woman smiled, her lips curling up into a small smile. "Not at all," she said. "I'm Lena."

Max nodded, his eyes never leaving hers. "I'm Max. And you are...?"

Lena leaned in closer, her voice barely above a whisper. "I've heard stories about you, Max. About your sister's disappearance."

Max felt a shiver run down his spine as he sat up straighter. "What do you know?" he asked, his voice firm.

Lena hesitated, glancing around the room before settling back into her seat. "I was at the old motel where she stayed, on the night she disappeared," she said. "I saw a figure lurking outside her room. A man with a scar above his left eyebrow."

Max's heart skipped a beat as he processed the information. This was it - this was the lead he had been searching for.

Lena's eyes locked onto his once more, and Max could see the fear and uncertainty in them. "I know this might sound crazy," she said, her voice trembling. "But I think you should be careful, Max. The man with the scar...he's not what he seems."

Max nodded, a plan already forming in his mind. He knew that he had to take care of himself now - and find his sister before it was too late.

As they finished their drinks, Max leaned back in his chair, his eyes never leaving Lena's face. "Thank you," he said softly. "I owe you one."

Lena smiled again, her green eyes sparkling with a hint of mischief. "You can repay me by getting out there and finding your sister," she said.

With a newfound sense of determination, Max Svensson stood up, his eyes fixed on the road ahead. He was closer than ever before - and he wouldn't rest until he had found his sister, no matter what it took.
