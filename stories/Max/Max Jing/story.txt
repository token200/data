Max Jing was an 18-year-old high school student who had always been fascinated by ancient civilizations. He spent most of his free time reading about the history and culture of various cultures, from the Egyptians to the Aztecs.

One day, while exploring the internet, Max stumbled upon a mysterious online forum dedicated to lost cities. The community was filled with enthusiasts and experts alike, sharing theories and discoveries about hidden metropolises that had been forgotten by history. Max was hooked, and soon he found himself spending hours browsing through the threads, devouring every piece of information.

As he delved deeper into the world of lost cities, Max began to notice a recurring theme: many of these civilizations were said to have possessed advanced knowledge of astronomy and mathematics. Intrigued, Max decided to focus his research on this aspect, pouring over ancient texts and trying to decipher the secrets hidden within.

It was during one of his late-night browsing sessions that Max came across a cryptic post from a user named "ArchaeoMax." The message read: "Look for the stars in the shape of an eagle. It's where the truth lies." Max was stumped, but something about the phrase resonated with him.

Days turned into weeks, and Max continued to search for clues. Finally, he stumbled upon an ancient text that mentioned a lost city hidden deep within the Amazon rainforest, whose inhabitants were said to have worshipped an eagle deity. According to the text, this city was connected to the mysterious constellation of the Southern Cross.

Convinced that he had finally found what he was looking for, Max Jing sat down at his desk and began to calculate the coordinates. As he did so, a sense of excitement washed over him â€“ could it be true? Was he on the verge of uncovering a centuries-old secret?

Max's eyes sparkled with determination as he gazed up at the stars, his mind racing with possibilities. Who was this "ArchaeoMax," and what secrets lay hidden in the depths of the Amazon? Max Jing knew that he had to find out.
