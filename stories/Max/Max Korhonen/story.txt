Max Korhonen was a man of few words, but his gaze could pierce through the thickest of walls. A former detective from Helsinki, Finland, he had spent years solving cases that left no room for doubt, only questions. His reputation preceded him - a rugged individual with an unyielding commitment to justice.

One fateful evening, as the winter snow fell gently over the city, Max received a phone call from an unknown number. The voice on the other end whispered a single phrase: "They're watching you, Korhonen." The hairs on his neck stood on end as he hung up, his mind racing with possibilities.

With a steady hand and unwavering resolve, Max began to investigate. He started by retracing his steps from the previous day, wondering if someone had followed him. As night fell, he walked through the deserted streets of Helsinki, eyes scanning every alleyway and street corner.

A chill ran down his spine as he noticed a figure lurking in the shadows, watching him with an intensity that made Max's skin crawl. He approached cautiously, hand resting on his pocket, containing a small notebook filled with cryptic notes and evidence collected from previous cases.

Suddenly, the figure stepped forward, revealing a young woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. She whispered a single word: "Zoe." A memory flashed in Max's mind - a case he had solved years ago involving a girl named Zoe. It dawned on him that the mysterious caller was someone from his past, connected to a case he thought he'd closed.

Without hesitation, Max followed Zoe through winding alleys and backstreets of Helsinki, navigating towards an unknown destination. The air was filled with tension as they traversed the dark streets, each step mirroring their shared history.

As the snowfall grew heavier, Max finally caught up to Zoe, who led him to a small caf√© on the outskirts of town. Inside, he found the girl from his past perched on a stool, surrounded by empty coffee cups and faded photographs. The words "they're watching you" echoed through her eyes as she whispered one final phrase: "Trust no one."

Max Korhonen understood then that some questions left only more doubts, but with Zoe's warning, he was determined to unravel the truth behind the whispers in the night, no matter how far it led him.
