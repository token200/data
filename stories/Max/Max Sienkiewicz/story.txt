Max Sienkiewicz stepped out of the rain-soaked streets of New York City, his trenchcoat clutched tightly around him like a shield. As a private investigator, he had seen it all - the dark alleys, the seedy clubs, and the desperate clients who wandered into his office with tales of woe.

But there was something different about this case. A young woman, no more than 20 years old, stood on the sidewalk, her eyes fixed on Max as if she saw right through him. Her name was Sarah, and she claimed to be a journalist investigating a series of mysterious disappearances in the city's underbelly.

As they spoke, Max couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to Sarah than met the eye. She seemed...off, her words laced with an unnerving intensity that made him wonder if she was hiding something. But despite his reservations, he found himself drawn into her world, like a moth to a flame.

Their investigation led them deep into the city's seedy underbelly - dingy bars, abandoned warehouses, and deserted streets lined with flickering streetlights. Max's instincts screamed at him to turn back, but Sarah pushed on, driven by a singular purpose.

As they delved deeper, the shadows seemed to grow longer and darker, as if they were alive. Max couldn't shake the feeling that he was being herded towards some unknown fate, one that would either reveal the truth behind the disappearances or consume them both whole.

Finally, after hours of searching, they stumbled upon a rundown nightclub on the outskirts of town. The sign creaked in the wind, reading "The Red Door". Max's gut told him this was it - the place where Sarah's investigation would lead her down a dark path from which there was no return.

As they stepped inside, the music swirled around them like a vortex, and Max knew that he had to let go. This was no ordinary case, but a descent into the very heart of madness itself. He watched as Sarah disappeared into the crowd, a fierce determination burning in her eyes.

And then, everything went black.

When Max came to, he was lying on the sidewalk, his head throbbing with pain. The rain had stopped, and an uneasy calm had descended over the city. As he stumbled back to his office, he knew that something fundamental had changed within him - a doorway into madness had swung open, and there was no going back.
