Max Ruiz García was a man in his mid-30s, with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair that fell across his forehead in messy, unkempt locks. He had a rugged air about him, as if he'd spent years working outdoors, but it was more than just the scruffiness that gave off this impression - there was an aura of vulnerability beneath.

As a young man, Max had grown up on the streets of Barcelona, with no father figure in his life to speak of. His mother worked multiple jobs to make ends meet, leaving him to fend for himself from a tender age. But despite the hardships, Max never lost his sense of determination. He was a quick learner, and soon found work as an apprentice in a small metal workshop.

Years went by, and Max proved himself to be one of the most skilled craftsmen among the apprentices. However, he had bigger ambitions - to build something of his own, something that would set him apart from the crowd. And so, with the help of some savings and a bit of luck, Max set out on an adventure that took him across Europe.

He traveled to Italy, where he honed his skills as a furniture maker, then on to France, where he fell in love with a beautiful Frenchwoman named Colette. Together, they built a small workshop from the ground up, and slowly but surely, their dreams began to take shape.

Years later, Max Ruiz García stood proudly behind the counter of his own bespoke furniture store, where clients came from far and wide to commission pieces that were both beautiful and functional. He had worked tirelessly for two decades, building not just furniture but a reputation as one of the finest craftsmen in the world.

But despite all his success, there was still a part of Max that longed for something more - a sense of belonging, of connection with others. And so, when Colette passed away suddenly after a long battle with illness, Max's world came crashing down around him. For a while, he couldn't bear to leave the workshop, fearing that if he did, his dreams would fade like dust in the wind.

And yet, as time went by, Max began to realize that life was not about what you made but who you shared it with. So, one day, he decided to close up shop and travel once more - this time with Colette's memory as his guide.
