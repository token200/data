Max Visconti stepped into the crowded café, scanning the room for his friend Luca. He spotted him sitting in the corner, sipping on a cappuccino and scrolling through his phone. As he made his way over, Luca looked up and flashed Max a warm smile.

"Hey, Max Visconti! What brings you here tonight?" Luca asked, gesturing to the empty chair across from him.

Max took a seat and ordered a coffee, chatting with the barista as she expertly steamed the milk. "Just grabbing a quick coffee before my shift starts," he replied. "I've got a long night ahead of me."

Luca nodded sympathetically. "You know you don't have to work that late, Max Visconti. You're one of the best bartenders in town."

Max chuckled and shook his head. "Someone's gotta pay the bills, right? Besides, I love being behind the bar. It's my happy place."

As they chatted, a group of rowdy patrons stumbled into the café, causing a commotion. Max and Luca watched with amusement as the group struggled to order drinks, their antics becoming more and more absurd by the minute.

Suddenly, one of them spilled an entire tray of drinks all over the table next to Max Visconti. "Oh no!" he groaned, reaching for his napkin to clean up the mess.

Luca jumped up from his seat to help. "Don't worry, I've got this," he said, expertly grabbing a handful of napkins and starting to blot the spill.

As they worked together to contain the damage, Max couldn't help but feel grateful for his friend's quick thinking and sense of humor. Luca Visconti was more than just a friend – he was a partner in crime, always ready to lend a helping hand (or drink) whenever Max needed it most.

Together, they managed to salvage the situation and get back on track, laughing and joking as they went. It was moments like these that reminded Max of why he loved working at the café so much: for the camaraderie, the laughter, and the chance to share them all with his best friend, Luca Visconti.
