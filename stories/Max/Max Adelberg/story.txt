Max Adelberg was a man with a reputation for being one of the most unlucky people in New York City. His friends and family had all but given up on him, convinced that he was cursed with a string of bad luck that would never end.

Despite his hapless nature, Max was a good guy at heart. He worked as a freelance writer, trying to make ends meet by scribbling articles for local publications. His writing wasn't exactly Pulitzer Prize-winning material, but it paid the bills and gave him a sense of purpose.

One day, Max received an email from his landlord informing him that he had fallen behind on rent. Again. This was the third time in as many months that Max had been put out on the street due to unpaid bills. Feeling defeated, Max decided to take a walk through Central Park to clear his head.

As he strolled along the winding paths, Max stumbled upon a small antique shop tucked away between two towering skyscrapers. The sign above the door read "Curios and Antiques," and the windows were filled with an assortment of strange and exotic items.

On a whim, Max pushed open the door and stepped inside. The shop was dimly lit, with shelves stretching up to the ceiling and display cases overflowing with dusty trinkets. Behind the counter stood an elderly woman with piercing green eyes, who regarded Max with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion.

"Welcome to Curios and Antiques," she said, her voice low and gravelly. "I'm Maude. What brings you in here today?"

Max explained his situation, feeling a little embarrassed about being unemployed again. Maude listened intently, nodding her head from time to time.

"I think I might have just the thing for you, Max," she said with a sly smile. "Come with me."

Maude led Max to a back room filled with strange and unusual items. There were vintage typewriters, antique clocks, and even an old-fashioned payphone. In the center of the room stood an ornate wooden box adorned with intricate carvings.

"This is my famous 'Lady Luck' box," Maude explained. "Legend has it that if you open this box and read the words inside, your luck will change for better or worse."

Max hesitated, feeling a mix of skepticism and curiosity. But something about Maude's warm smile put him at ease. He opened the box and pulled out a small piece of paper.

To his surprise, the words on the page were exactly what he needed to hear: "Believe in yourself, Max, and your luck will change forever."

Max looked up at Maude, feeling a spark of hope ignite within him. Maybe, just maybe, things were about to get better for this hapless guy after all.
