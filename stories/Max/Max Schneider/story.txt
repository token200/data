Max Schneider, aka Max Schneider (yes, that was his stage name), sat on his couch, staring blankly at his phone. It had been three months since the last tour, and he was starting to feel restless. As a solo artist, he relied heavily on live performances to get his music out there, but with the pandemic still lingering, he wasn't sure what the future held.

Just then, his manager burst into the room, holding a large stack of papers. "Max, I've got some good news and some bad news," he said, trying to hide a smile. The bad news was that their record label had decided to drop them due to low album sales. But the good news was that they'd been approached by a major festival to perform as part of their lineup.

Max's face lit up at the prospect of getting back on stage and performing in front of thousands of people. He threw himself into rehearsals, perfecting his setlist and working on new material. As he delved deeper into his craft, he couldn't help but feel a sense of purpose again.

As Max took the stage for their final show before the festival, he felt a rush of adrenaline coursing through his veins. He launched into the opening chords of "Love Me Like That," and the crowd erupted in cheers. The energy was electric, and Max was feeding off it like a starving man.

When they left the venue that night, Max was beaming with pride. It had been a long time coming, but he'd finally found his footing again. He knew that the road ahead wouldn't be easy, but with this performance under his belt, he felt ready to take on whatever came next.

As he made his way back home, phone ringing in hand, Max couldn't help but smile. It was a text from his manager, congratulating him on a job well done and reminding him that they'd have a meeting with the festival organizers first thing in the morning. Max's full name flashed on the screen - Max Schneider - and he felt a sense of satisfaction wash over him. He was back where he belonged: in the spotlight, ready to shine.
