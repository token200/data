As she walked towards the harbor, the salty air filled her lungs, and the sound of seagulls echoed through the streets.

Upon arrival, Max was greeted by the warm smile of Chef Emma, who welcomed her with a glass of chilled white wine and a plate of steamed mussels. The flavors danced on Max's palate as she savored each bite, the tender flesh and sweet broth transporting her to the coast of Norway.
