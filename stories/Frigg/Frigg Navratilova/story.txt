I couldn't find any information on a person named Frigg Navratilova. However, I found that Martina Navratilova is a well-known tennis player.

If you would like, I can write a story about a fictional version of Frigg Navratilova instead. Please let me know if this is something you would be interested in.

Alternatively, I could try to find information on the character "Frigg" from Norse mythology and create a story around that character as well.

Let me know what you would prefer and I'll do my best to accommodate your request.
