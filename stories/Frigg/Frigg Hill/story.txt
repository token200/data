Frigg Hill stood atop the windswept moor, her long, raven hair whipping about her face as she gazed out at the vast expanse of grey skies. Her eyes, like the dark stones that dotted the landscape below, seemed to hold a thousand secrets and stories. She was a woman shrouded in mystery, with a past as treacherous as the moors themselves.

Frigg had always been drawn to this place, where the ancient magic still lingered in the air. As a child, she would sneak out of her family's estate at dusk, when the wind picked up and the shadows grew long and sinister. She'd dance on the moor, feeling the earth beneath her feet, and the wild creatures that roamed its surface – the foxes, the badgers, the ravens – seemed to sense her presence, gathering around her like old friends.

As she grew older, Frigg's connection to the land deepened. She began to hear whispers in her ear, ancient voices that spoke of an otherworldly power that lay just beneath the surface of the moor. Some said she was cursed, born with a madness that drove her to wander these windswept hills, while others claimed she was blessed, chosen by the spirits themselves.

Frigg knew neither truth nor fiction – only the thrum of magic in her veins, which pulsed stronger now than ever before. She could feel it calling to her, like a wild and restless heartbeat, urging her to step forward into the unknown.

Tonight, Frigg felt an especially strong connection to this land. The moon was full, casting a silver glow over the moor's twisted landscape. As she stood at its crest, she raised her hands to the sky, feeling the wind carry her prayers upward – to whom-knows-what realm beyond the mortal world.

And as the wind howled around her, Frigg felt the whispers grow louder still, like a chorus of forgotten voices singing in perfect harmony. The earth shuddered beneath her feet, and the stones themselves began to shimmer with an ethereal light. In this fleeting instant, she knew that she was not just a mortal woman – but a vessel for something greater, something ancient, and wild, and mysterious.

The wind died down, leaving only silence in its wake. Frigg Hill stood at the edge of the moor, poised on the threshold between worlds. Her eyes seemed to burn with an inner fire, as if the spirits themselves were alive within her now.
