Frigg Sánchez-Gijón stepped into the bustling market square, her eyes scanning the vibrant stalls that lined the cobblestone streets. As the daughter of a renowned healer, she had grown up surrounded by the sights and smells of exotic spices and herbs. Her full name, Frigg Sánchez-Gijón, was often met with curiosity from those who didn't know her well – but to those in the know, she was simply "Frigg," the most skilled apothecary's apprentice in all the land.

As she wove through the crowds, Frigg's fingers trailed over the intricate patterns on a nearby scarf, tracing the threads of silver and gold that seemed to shimmer in the sunlight. She had always been fascinated by the way these tiny details could hold hidden secrets – much like her own family's history, which was steeped in mystery and intrigue.

Her thoughts were interrupted by a familiar voice, calling out across the market: "Frigg! Frigg Sánchez-Gijón, is that you?" It was her childhood friend, a young merchant named León, who had just arrived from the distant city of Valencia. The two had grown up together, exploring the winding alleys and hidden gardens of their native town.

León caught up to her, his face creased with excitement. "I've got news, Frigg! I've been commissioned by the Duke himself to supply him with rare herbs for his famous medicinal elixir." He grinned, his eyes sparkling with pride. "And he wants me to get them from you – specifically, that rare strain of chamomile you grew last summer."

Frigg's face lit up with a smile, her mind racing with the possibilities. She knew just the spot in the nearby forest where she had cultivated the precious herb – and with León's help, she would be able to harvest it in no time.

As they made their way through the market, Frigg couldn't help but feel a sense of pride knowing that her full name, Frigg Sánchez-Gijón, was about to become synonymous with excellence – at least when it came to rare and exotic herbs.
