Frigg Schulz sat alone in her small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and scraps of paper covered in her hasty notes. She was a brilliant mathematician, but her obsessive nature had left her little time for socializing or even proper hygiene.

As she poured over her latest manuscript, Frigg's mind wandered back to her childhood. Growing up, she had always been fascinated by the intricate patterns and structures that underlay every aspect of mathematics. Her parents, both engineers themselves, encouraged her curiosity, providing her with endless puzzles and brain teasers to keep her engaged.

But as she grew older, Frigg's focus became more singular. She threw herself into her studies, neglecting everything else in favor of unlocking the secrets of number theory. Her friends began to fade away, replaced by stacks of papers and coffee cups that never seemed to empty.

Now, at 30 years old, Frigg was on the cusp of a breakthrough. Her latest proof, for a long-held conjecture in elliptic curves, had finally coalesced into something tangible. She sat back in her chair, her eyes shining with excitement as she reviewed the final lines of code on her computer screen.

As she read over her work, Frigg felt a strange sense of detachment from her own existence. She was no longer just Frigg Schulz, but a vessel for the mathematical concepts that had driven her for so long. Her thoughts began to drift into abstract realms, where numbers danced like celestial bodies and geometric shapes swirled with elegance.

The knock at the door broke the spell, and Frigg snapped back to reality. It was her landlady, Mrs. Gummelsdörfer, come to collect the rent on time as always. Frigg hesitated, feeling a pang of embarrassment about the state of her apartment. She had been so caught up in her work that she hadn't noticed the dust accumulating on the shelves.

With a forced smile, Frigg ushered Mrs. Gummelsdörfer into the main room and pointed out the scattered papers and bookshelves. "I'll tidy up," she promised. As she watched the landlady leave with a relieved smile, Frigg couldn't help but feel a twinge of sadness. For the first time in years, she felt like she was finally getting close to something – but at what cost?

As she returned to her manuscript, Frigg's eyes narrowed into slits of focus. She knew that this breakthrough wouldn't be easy to share with anyone, not even those closest to her. But for now, it was all hers – a solitary triumph in the quiet hours before dawn.
