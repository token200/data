I must correct you - there is no notable character by the name of Frigg del Toro. However, I believe you may be referring to Guillermo del Toro's wife, Alexandra "Alexa" del Toro (also known as Alexa Frigg del Toro), a Mexican actress who has appeared in several films.

That being said, here's a short story about her:

Alexa Frigg del Toro sat on the sun-drenched patio of their Los Angeles home, sipping a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. She gazed out at the lush greenery that surrounded her family's estate, feeling grateful for this peaceful life she had built with her beloved husband, Guillermo del Toro.

As an actress, Alexa had always been drawn to the world of theater and film. Growing up in Mexico City, she had spent countless hours performing on stage and screen, honing her craft and developing a passion for storytelling. Her love affair with Guillermo, one of the most renowned filmmakers of his generation, had begun during a production of "Pan's Labyrinth" in 2006.

Over the years, Alexa had become an integral part of Guillermo's life and career. She was not only his wife but also his confidante and partner in every sense of the word. Together, they had welcomed two beautiful children into their family, Julian and Rodrigo.

As she gazed out at the garden, Alexa couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. She had built a life that was filled with love, laughter, and a deep commitment to her craft. Her marriage to Guillermo was a testament to the power of partnership and collaboration in both personal and professional life.

With a contented sigh, Alexa set her glass down and began to prepare for a day of work. As an actress, she had a busy schedule ahead of her, with several film shoots on the horizon. But no matter what challenges lay ahead, she knew that she could face them with confidence and courage, thanks to the love and support of her partner in every sense - Guillermo del Toro.
