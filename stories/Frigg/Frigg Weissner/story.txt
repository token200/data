Frigg Weissner stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway, her eyes scanning the bustling streets of Kreuzberg. The neon lights of the bars and clubs reflected off the wet pavement, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across her face. She was a vision in black leather and ripped fishnets, her blonde hair styled in a messy bob.

As she walked, Frigg's gaze darted between passersby, searching for someone - or something. She had received a cryptic message the night before, summoning her to this exact location. The note had read: "The Oracle awaits." Simple, yet unsettling.

Frigg's thoughts turned to the Oracle, an enigmatic figure rumored to possess ancient knowledge and hidden power. Rumors swirled about her abilities - was she a seer, a sorceress, or something more sinister? Frigg didn't care what the truth was; she needed answers.

She stopped at a street corner, surveying the crowd as she waited for her next clue. A group of punk rockers nearby began to argue with a vendor selling bootlegged CDs. The commotion drew Frigg's attention - and also that of a young man watching from across the street.

He was lean and angular, his dark hair slicked back and eyes intense. For an instant, their gazes locked, and Frigg felt an unexpected jolt of recognition. Who was this stranger?

Suddenly, the stranger vanished into the crowd. The vendor called out to her, offering a CD - a rare copy of Bauhaus' "Bela Lugosi's Dead". Frigg snatched it from his hands and tucked it into her backpack.

The Oracle's presence beckoned again. This time, she found herself standing before an ancient-looking door hidden behind a dumpster. The sign above the door read: "Temple of the Eternal Night".

As Frigg stepped inside, the air thickened with incense, and whispers coalesced into words: "Welcome, Frigg Weissner...We have been waiting." A low hum emanated from the shadows, vibrating through her very being.

Frigg's eyes adjusted to the dim light. The Oracle sat cross-legged on a raised dais, eyes closed in meditation. She opened them now, their piercing blue fixed intently upon Frigg.

"Your journey begins," the Oracle whispered, "a path that will take you into the heart of darkness and back again."

Frigg took a step forward, ready to face whatever lay ahead. The Temple's secrets were hers to uncover - and the world would never be the same.
