Frigg Kovacs stepped into the crowded cafe, her eyes scanning the room for any familiar faces. As a private investigator, she had seen it all – from stolen diamonds to family secrets. But tonight, she was on the hunt for something different.

Frigg took a seat at the bar, ordering a whiskey as she pulled out her phone and dialed a number. It rang several times before a smooth voice picked up.

"Hello, Frigg Kovacs," it said. "I see you're looking for me."

She smiled to herself, knowing exactly who was on the other end of the line. Her ex-partner, Max Wells, had been missing for weeks, and she had finally received a tip that he might be in contact.

"I need your help, Max," she said, her voice low and even. "I have reason to believe you're involved in something big."

There was a pause before Max responded. "What are you talking about, Frigg? I've been keeping my nose clean."

She raised an eyebrow. "Save it for someone else, Max. I know you too well. Meet me at the old warehouse on 5th and Main at midnight if you're telling the truth."

The line went dead, leaving Frigg to nurse her drink and ponder what she might find when she arrived at the warehouse. She had a feeling this case was going to be bigger than she anticipated.

As she finished her whiskey and prepared to leave, a figure caught her eye across the room. A young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair sat alone at a table by the window, watching Frigg with an intensity that made her skin prickle.

Frigg felt a shiver run down her spine as she realized this woman might be connected to Max's disappearance – or worse. She finished her drink, tucked her phone away, and headed out into the night, ready to uncover the truth about Frigg Kovacs' latest case.
