Frigg Koval was known for her sharp wit and quick tongue, able to talk her way out of almost any situation. As the lead detective on the cases that baffled the rest of the department, she earned a reputation as one of the best in the business.

But Frigg's talents didn't stop at solving crimes; she had a knack for getting under people's skin, often leaving them wanting more. This was especially true when it came to her nemesis, billionaire playboy Harrison Green.

Their game of cat and mouse had been going on for months, with Frigg constantly staying one step ahead of the wealthy socialite. She knew his every move before he did, and he couldn't help but feel a twisted attraction to her tenacity.

One night, Frigg received an invitation to a high-society gala at Harrison's mansion, hoping to finally get the upper hand in their game. As she walked into the grand foyer, she could feel the weight of Harrison's gaze upon her.

The evening wore on, with Frigg and Harrison engaging in a dance of verbal sparring, each trying to outmaneuver the other. But beneath the surface, something was amiss. For the first time, Frigg noticed a flicker of vulnerability in Harrison's eyes, a glimmer that suggested there might be more to him than just his arrogant facade.

As the night drew to a close and the guests departed, Frigg made her move, cornering Harrison in the study. "You're not as slick as you think you are, Green," she said, her voice low and husky.

Harrison's eyes narrowed, but for a moment, Frigg saw something there that gave her pause. It was a hint of recognition, of understanding – and perhaps even attraction.

"You know me too well, Koval," he said, his voice dripping with venom. "But don't think this means I'll go down without a fight."

Frigg smiled, knowing she'd won just enough ground to keep the game going. As she left the mansion, she couldn't help but wonder what lay beneath Harrison's polished exterior – and whether she might be willing to take another bite of his bait.
