Frigg Fontaine stood at the edge of the rooftop garden, her long black hair whipping in the gentle breeze. As the lead designer at Fontaine & Co., she had spent countless hours overseeing the development of new projects, but tonight was different. Tonight, she was taking a much-needed break from the hustle and bustle of city life.

As she gazed out over the glittering lights of the city below, Frigg's mind wandered to her childhood. Growing up in a family of modest means had instilled in her a strong work ethic and determination. But it was her mother, a talented artist herself, who had encouraged Frigg's creative side from a young age.

"Your designs will change the world, Frigg," she would say, her eyes sparkling with conviction. And Frigg had always believed her.

Years later, as Frigg Fontaine, she had built a reputation for her innovative and forward-thinking approach to architecture. Her buildings were not just structures, but works of art that reflected the city's personality. But tonight, as she stood in the quiet stillness of the rooftop garden, Frigg felt like she was losing touch with the person she used to be.

She thought back to the countless hours she had spent sketching and designing as a child, her mother by her side. She remembered the thrill of bringing an idea to life, of watching it transform into something beautiful. And she realized that she had forgotten how to enjoy the process for herself.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Frigg took a deep breath and let her gaze fall on the city skyline once more. This time, however, she saw not just buildings and lights, but the people who inhabited them. She saw children playing in the streets, lovers strolling hand-in-hand, and friends laughing together.

In that moment, Frigg Fontaine knew that she had been given a gift â€“ the chance to remember why she started designing in the first place. And with renewed purpose, she turned away from the edge of the rooftop garden, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.
