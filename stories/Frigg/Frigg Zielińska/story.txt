Frigg Zielińska stood at the edge of the old wooden pier, her eyes fixed on the distant horizon where the Baltic Sea met the grey sky. The wind whipped through her dark hair, and she wrapped her scarf tighter around her neck, the chill of the evening air biting at her skin.

As a member of the local coast guard, Frigg had spent countless hours patrolling these waters, but tonight felt different. She sensed it in the way the sea seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for something to stir beneath the surface.

Frigg's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps approaching from behind. It was her colleague, Kostya, who flashed a tired smile at her. "Hey, Zielińska! You okay? You've been out here for hours."

"I'm fine," Frigg replied, not looking away from the sea. "Just lost in thought, I suppose."

Kostya nodded sympathetically and sat down beside her on the weathered wooden planks. The two women sat in silence, watching as the stars began to twinkle above.

As they waited, memories began to surface for Frigg – of late nights spent talking with her grandfather about the sea, of summers spent sailing on Lake Szczecinskie with her siblings. Her mind was a maze of emotions and reflections, but she knew she couldn't let them consume her now.

The sound of Kostya's voice broke the spell, reminding Frigg that they had to stay focused. "We've got a report of a possible shipwreck nearby," he said, handing her a radio. "It looks like it happened last night."

Frigg took the radio and began to scan through frequencies, her heart racing as she pieced together the reports from other boats in the area. It was going to be a long night, but with Kostya by her side, she felt ready to face whatever lay ahead.

As they set off towards the reported location, Frigg Zielińska knew that this would be more than just another rescue mission – it would be a test of their skills and their resolve. The sea might be unpredictable, but she was determined to ride its waves and emerge victorious on the other side.
