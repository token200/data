Frigg Davies sat alone in her small apartment, staring out the window as the rain pattered against the glass. She was lost in thought, her mind wandering back to the day that had changed everything for her. It was a year ago today since she'd received the letter from the mysterious stranger, informing her that her estranged mother was dying.

Frigg's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her phone buzzing on the coffee table. She picked it up, expecting it to be a call from her best friend, Rachel, but instead found a text from an unknown number. "Meet me at the old oak tree in the park at midnight," it read.

A shiver ran down Frigg's spine as she felt a sense of unease wash over her. She knew that the old oak tree was on the outskirts of town, and it was rumored to be haunted by the ghost of a young girl who had died there many years ago. But something about the message drew her in, making her feel like she needed to know what this stranger wanted.

That night, Frigg made her way to the park, her heart pounding in her chest. As she approached the old oak tree, she saw a figure waiting for her in the shadows. It was a woman with long, curly hair and piercing green eyes - Frigg's mother.

"Hello, Frigg," her mother said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I've been waiting for you."

Over the next few hours, Frigg's mother revealed to her that she had been watching over her from afar, proud of the strong, independent woman Frigg had become. She told her about her own struggles and hardships, and how she had made mistakes that had cost her dearly.

As the night wore on, Frigg felt a sense of peace wash over her. For the first time in years, she felt like she was finally understanding her mother's side of things. As she hugged her goodbye, Frigg knew that she would carry her mother's legacy with her forever.

From that day on, Frigg Davies felt a newfound sense of purpose and belonging. She continued to navigate the ups and downs of life with courage and resilience, but now she did so with a deeper understanding of herself and those who came before her.
