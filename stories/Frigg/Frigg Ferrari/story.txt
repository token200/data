The result was a stunning line of cars that not only honored the Ferrari name but also showcased Frigg's vision for a sustainable future.

One day, Frigg received an invitation from the prestigious Venice Biennale to showcase her work alongside some of the world's top designers and artists. Eager to share her passion with a wider audience, she accepted the offer and traveled to Venice with her team in tow.

At the biennale, Frigg Ferrari's electric vehicles stole the show. Critics and visitors alike were captivated by the sleek designs and cutting-edge technology that went into each car.
