Frigg Laan stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station as if searching for something she knew was already there. It had been years since she'd set foot in Ravenshire, and yet, the familiar scent of damp earth and decaying leaves wafted through the air like a warm hug.

As she walked away from the train, Frigg Laan's gaze fell upon the small bakery still owned by her brother, Elrik. The sign above the door read "Laan Family Sweets" in faded letters, a reminder of their family's long-standing legacy. She smiled wistfully, remembering the countless afternoons spent helping Elrik mix and bake sweet treats for the villagers.

Frigg Laan made her way into the bakery, where Elrik looked up from behind the counter with a mixture of surprise and warmth. "Frigg! Long time no see," he said, setting aside his apron to envelop her in a firm hug.

The two siblings chatted for hours, catching up on lost years and sharing stories of their separate journeys. Frigg Laan spoke of her travels as a cartographer, mapping the uncharted territories of the far north. She showed Elrik the worn maps she'd collected along the way, each creased page telling a tale of adventure and exploration.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over Ravenshire, Frigg Laan knew it was time to settle back into her life. She had always been drawn to this place, where the rhythms of nature and the pulse of community still resonated deep within her. Though she'd built a new life elsewhere, there was no doubt that Ravenshire – and Elrik's bakery – would forever be home.

With a contented sigh, Frigg Laan settled into a stool at the counter, watching as Elrik expertly crafted a batch of flaky pastries. As the sweet aroma wafted through the air, she felt her heart fill with a sense of belonging, of being exactly where she was meant to be – surrounded by the people and places that made life worthwhile.
