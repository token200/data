"You know, Frigg, you're like a modern-day Indiana Jones," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. Frigg Balodis smiled, her eyes glinting in the dim light, but said nothing.

The next morning, they stumbled upon an ancient temple, hidden away for centuries. Frigg Balodis's heart racing, she led the way into the sacred space, where they discovered a treasure trove of artifacts and relics beyond their wildest dreams.
