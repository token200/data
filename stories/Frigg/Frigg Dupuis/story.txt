Frigg Dupuis stepped into the quiet café, her eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. She spotted her friend, Émile, sitting by the window, nursing a cup of coffee. As she approached, he looked up and smiled.

"Bonjour, Frigg," he said, his French accent warm and inviting.

Frigg Dupuis took a seat across from him, ordering a café au lait as they chatted about their latest projects. Émile was working on a novel, while Frigg Dupuis had been busy with her art studio, experimenting with new techniques.

As they sipped their coffee, the conversation turned to their shared love of music. Émile pulled out his phone and started playing some Django Reinhardt records, and Frigg Dupuis closed her eyes, letting the lively melodies transport her to another world.

After a while, Émile suggested they take a walk along the Seine. The sunlight was casting a warm glow over the city, illuminating the ancient stones of the buildings. As they strolled, Frigg Dupuis felt at peace, the rhythm of the river and the sound of the birds filling her senses.

As they walked, Frigg Dupuis couldn't help but think about her childhood in Belgium, where she had grown up surrounded by the rich sounds and smells of French culture. Her parents had encouraged her to explore her artistic side, and now, as an adult, she was proud to be making a name for herself in the art world.

Émile noticed her lost in thought and asked if everything was alright. Frigg Dupuis smiled wistfully and told him about her childhood memories of listening to Édith Piaf records with her parents. The music had brought back fond memories, but also a sense of longing for the place she had left behind.

As they reached the riverbank, Frigg Dupuis turned to Émile and said, "Merci for being here today. It means a lot to me." Émile smiled and replied, "De rien, Frigg. We're always happy to spend time with you."

And so, as they continued their walk along the Seine, Frigg Dupuis felt grateful for the simple pleasures in life – good friends, beautiful music, and a moment of peace in the city she loved.
