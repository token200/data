Frigg Schmidt trudged through the slushy streets of Copenhagen, her bright pink scarf wrapped tightly around her neck. The Danish winter was no joke, and she had learned to bundle up for it over the years. As a successful businesswoman in her mid-30s, Frigg was used to being seen as a pillar of strength and determination.

But beneath the tough exterior, Frigg's thoughts were consumed by a different kind of challenge. Her relationship with her boyfriend, Lars, had been on shaky ground lately. They had met at university, bonding over their shared love of indie rock music and mediocre coffee. But as they entered adulthood, Lars began to struggle with anxiety, causing tension between them.

Frigg tried to be supportive, but she couldn't help feeling like she was shouldering the weight alone. She took comfort in her job as a marketing manager at a local startup, where she could focus on campaigns and budgets rather than personal relationships. Still, she knew that avoiding Lars wasn't the solution - she needed to find a way to support him while also taking care of herself.

As she turned onto Vesterbrogade, Frigg spotted her best friend, Sofie, sipping coffee at a sidewalk cafe. She waved frantically and dodged into the warmth beside Sofie. The two friends chatted about everything from work gossip to their favorite TV shows, offering each other words of encouragement.

Sofie asked about Lars, but Frigg hesitated before opening up about her struggles. "I just feel like I'm not doing enough," she admitted, feeling a lump form in her throat. Sofie listened attentively, then offered some sage advice: "You are doing enough, Frigg. Just being there for him is something to be proud of."

Frigg took Sofie's words to heart as they finished their drinks and headed back into the chilly air. She knew she had a long road ahead of her - but with friends like Sofie by her side, she felt a renewed sense of hope. Maybe, just maybe, Frigg Schmidt could find a way to balance her personal and professional life, even in the midst of winter's chilliest grip.
