Frigg Bj√∂rkqvist sat alone in her small Stockholm flat, surrounded by dusty trinkets and forgotten photographs. She stared blankly at the wall, her eyes tracing the faint outline of a painting that had once adorned the space - a fading depiction of the Swedish countryside.

It was a cold winter's night, and Frigg's thoughts were consumed by memories of her late husband, Gustaf. They had been married for over three decades, their love growing stronger with each passing year. But life had other plans, and Gustaf had left this world far too soon.

As she lost herself in the haze of nostalgia, a faint knock at the door broke the silence. Frigg hesitated before getting up to answer it. She opened the door to reveal her best friend, Anna, holding a steaming cup of coffee and a warm smile.

"Hey, kiddo," Anna said, using the affectionate nickname she had reserved for only the closest friends. "I heard you needed some company tonight."

Frigg nodded, feeling a lump form in her throat as she ushered Anna inside. They sat down on the couch, surrounded by Frigg's collection of dusty trinkets and forgotten memories.

"I've been going through some old family documents," Anna said, passing Frigg the cup of coffee. "I found this letter from Gustaf, written just before he left us."

Frigg took a sip of the coffee, her eyes welling up with tears as she read the words on the page. It was a poem, penned by Gustaf in his own hand - a love letter that captured the essence of their relationship.

"'My dear Frigg,' he wrote. 'You are the sunshine that brightens my day, the stars that light up my night. Without you, I am but a shadow of myself.'"

As Frigg finished reading the poem, she felt a wave of emotion wash over her. It was as if Gustaf's words had transported her back to a time when life was simpler, and their love was new.

Anna wrapped an arm around Frigg's shoulders, holding her close as they sat in silence for a moment. Outside, the snow continued to fall, casting a serene silence over the city.

In that moment, Frigg felt a sense of peace wash over her - a reminder that even in the darkest of times, love and memories could sustain us. And with Anna by her side, she knew that she would always have someone to share those moments with.
