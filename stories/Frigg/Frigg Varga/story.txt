Frigg Varga stood at the edge of the frozen lake, her icy blue eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of movement. The snow crunched beneath her boots as she walked along the shore, her long black coat fluttering behind her like a dark wingspan. She was on a mission to uncover the truth about the mysterious disappearance of her sister, Astrid.

As a member of the Varga clan, Frigg had always been taught to prioritize loyalty and duty above all else. But when Astrid vanished without warning three months ago, leaving behind only a whispered rumor of dark magic and ancient powers, Frigg's world was turned upside down. She became obsessed with finding her sister, scouring the frozen wilderness for any clue that might lead her to Astrid.

Frigg had heard whispers of an ancient ritual taking place on this very lake, one that was rumored to summon a powerful entity from beyond the veil of the mortal realm. Some said it was Astrid who had performed the ritual, seeking power and answers in a world where magic was forbidden. Others claimed that Frigg's own sister had been consumed by darkness, corrupted by the same forces that now drove her.

As she walked along the lake's edge, Frigg felt the weight of her quest settling upon her shoulders like a mantle of ice. She knew she was playing with fire, tampering with powers beyond her control. But something within her pushed on, an insatiable hunger for truth and answers.

Suddenly, the wind picked up, whipping Frigg's hair into a frenzy as a gust of cold air swept across the lake. In that moment, she saw it: a shimmering portal where there had been nothing before. Her heart racing, Frigg knew what she had to do.

Without hesitation, she took her first step forward, stepping into the unknown world on the other side of the portal. The wind howled around her as the darkness closed in, but Frigg Varga walked forward, driven by a burning determination to uncover the truth about her sister's disappearance. She was ready to face whatever lay ahead, no matter the cost.
