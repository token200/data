Frigg Trevisan stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. The late afternoon sunlight cast long shadows across the crumbling brick walls, giving the old station an air of forlorn grandeur. It was a feeling she knew all too well.

As the last heir of House Trevisan, Frigg had spent years living in exile, hiding from those who would seek to claim her inheritance. Her father's betrayal still burned within her, fueled by the memories of what they'd lost together. The once-mighty Trevisan dynasty now reduced to a handful of scattered family members, forced to live on the fringes of society.

A chill wind picked up as Frigg made her way through the station, drawing curious glances from the few straggling passengers. She moved swiftly, her long coat billowing behind her like a dark cloud. Her raven hair was tied back in a tight braid, revealing piercing emerald eyes that seemed to bore into those she met.

As she emerged onto the platform, Frigg spotted a young woman watching her from across the way. The girl's gaze was hesitant at first, but as their eyes met, it transformed into something akin to curiosity. Frigg sensed a kindred spirit in this stranger – someone who, like herself, might not be what they seemed.

Frigg nodded curtly and began walking towards the young woman. "You're new around here, I take it?" she asked, her voice crisp and detached. The girl nodded nervously, fidgeting with a leather-bound book clutched in her hand.

"I'm Lila," Frigg continued, extending a slender finger. "And you are?"

Lila's smile was hesitant, but genuine. "I'm... just passing through," she stammered. "I heard this town had an old library hidden somewhere."

Frigg raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the girl's interests. She knew that there were tales of such a place, one said to contain ancient texts and forgotten knowledge – exactly the kind of thing that could bring her a measure of solace.

"Come with me," Frigg suggested finally, tucking her hand into her pocket as they made their way towards the town's outskirts. "I think I might know where you'll find what you're looking for."

Together, the unlikely pair vanished into the gathering twilight, bound by an unseen thread – one that hinted at a hidden destiny waiting to be unraveled.
