Frigg Lefevre stepped out of her worn leather jacket and onto the crisp spring air, taking in the sights and sounds of the bustling city. Her bright blue eyes scanned the crowded streets, searching for a familiar face - or a lead on her next case.

As a private investigator, Frigg had seen it all. From high-stakes corporate espionage to murder-for-hire, she'd been there, done that. But this one was different. A small, mysterious package had arrived at her doorstep just yesterday, with only one hint: "Meet me at the Red Door Café at midnight."

Curious, Frigg had made her way to the café, where a hooded figure handed her the package and disappeared into the night. Inside, she found a cryptic message etched onto a piece of black silk:

"Echoes of the past haunt our future"

Frigg's mind was racing. What did this message mean? Was it a warning or a clue?

As she pondered, Frigg noticed a familiar face across the café - Kael, her old flame and sometimes-partner-in-crime-solving. They exchanged warm smiles and exchanged stories of their respective cases.

Just as Frigg was about to brush off the meeting, a young woman approached them. "Miss Lefevre?" she asked nervously. "I think I have information about...the package."

Frigg's eyes locked onto the woman's trembling hands. She had an intuition that this case was connected to something much bigger.

"Tell me," Frigg said gently, ushering the woman into a booth.

"It's about my sister," she began, her voice shaking. "She went missing three years ago, and I've been searching for answers ever since."

Frigg listened intently as the young woman recounted her story. And when she finished, something clicked in Frigg's mind. The message on the silk, the disappearance of the sister - it all tied together.

"We're going to find your sister," Frigg promised, a plan already forming in her mind. "But we'll need help from people I trust."

Kael nodded in agreement, and together they set off into the night, ready to unravel the threads of a case that would take them on a wild ride through the city's underbelly.

As they disappeared into the shadows, Frigg couldn't shake off the feeling that this was only the beginning. And with the echoes of her past whispering in her ear, she knew that their journey would be filled with twists and turns - but also revelations and redemption.
