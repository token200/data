Frigg Hansen stepped out of her small, cluttered apartment and onto the bustling streets of Copenhagen. The smell of freshly baked bread wafted through the air as she walked towards the old windmill on the outskirts of town. It was here that Frigg had spent countless afternoons as a child, watching the sails turn and the grain being ground into flour.

As an adult, Frigg worked at her family's bakery, whipping up traditional Danish pastries and bread for the city's residents. But she felt stifled by the routine, like there was something more waiting for her just beyond the horizon.

Frigg had always been drawn to mythology, particularly the stories of the gods from her childhood. Her name was inspired by Frigg herself, the Norse goddess of love and marriage. She loved how those ancient women were strong, powerful, and unapologetic – qualities that she admired in herself but rarely displayed.

Today, Frigg had come to the windmill with a sense of purpose. She had been searching for an old cookbook her grandmother used to own, one that was said to contain secrets and recipes from the Viking era. The owner of the windmill, a kind old man named Søren, was rumored to possess it.

As Frigg climbed up to the top of the windmill, she spotted Søren sitting in his favorite chair, surrounded by dusty jars and shelves upon shelves of books. He looked up as she approached, his eyes twinkling with warmth.

"Ah, Frigg! Come to share some stories, I suppose?" he said, beckoning her closer.

Frigg smiled, feeling a sense of belonging for the first time in weeks. "No, Søren – though that would be lovely. I'm looking for something else."

Søren's expression turned curious as Frigg pulled out an old photograph from her pocket. It was a picture of a young woman with striking features and piercing blue eyes.

"Recognize anyone?" he asked.

Frigg's heart skipped a beat as she gazed at the face in the photograph. "I think I do," she whispered, feeling a spark ignite within her.

The old man smiled knowingly, as if he had known this moment was coming all along. "Well, Frigg – it seems you've got some Viking magic coursing through those veins after all."
