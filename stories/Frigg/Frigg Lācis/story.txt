Frigg Lācis stood atop the windswept hill, gazing out at the vast expanse of the Northern Fjords. The icy waters below sparkled like a thousand diamonds in the pale sunlight, and Frigg's heart swelled with a mix of emotions - longing and duty.

As the last of her people, the Lācis, were dwindling in numbers, Frigg felt the weight of responsibility on her shoulders. She was the elder, the wisest, and the strongest among them, and it fell to her to ensure their survival. But with each passing year, she couldn't shake the feeling that they were losing themselves, that their unique connection to this land was slowly fading away.

Frigg Lācis thought back to her childhood, spent exploring the ancient forests and hidden waterfalls of the fjords. Her people had lived here for generations, developing a deep understanding of the land's rhythms and secrets. She remembered her grandmother, Kāra, teaching her how to identify the medicinal plants that grew only on these shores, and how to listen to the whispers of the wind.

As she looked out at the sea, Frigg felt a pang of sadness. Her people were disappearing, one by one, until soon there would be none left but her. But she refused to give up. She would carry on their legacy, no matter what it took. Frigg Lācis squared her shoulders, determination etched on her face.

She began to walk down the hill, making her way back to her small cottage at the water's edge. Inside, she found her younger sister, Sūs, huddled over a makeshift loom, weaving a beautiful pattern from the threads of their ancestors' woolen cloak. Frigg sat beside her, watching as the intricate design came to life.

"You're keeping our people alive, little one," Frigg said, placing a hand on Sūs's shoulder. "Keep telling our stories, and our songs, and our traditions. We'll carry on even if there are no more of us left."

Sūs looked up at her, eyes shining with tears, but also with a fierce determination that mirrored Frigg's own. Together, they would preserve the Lācis legacy, no matter what lay ahead.

As night fell over the fjords, Frigg Lācis sat on the shore, listening to the wind whisper secrets in her ear. She knew that she would always be here, protecting and guiding those who came after her. And with that knowledge, she felt a sense of peace settle over her, like the gentle lapping of waves against the shore.
