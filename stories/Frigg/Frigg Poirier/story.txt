Frigg Poirier stood at the edge of the Grand Canyon, her feet planted firmly on the worn path. The wind whipped her long black hair into a frenzy as she gazed out at the endless expanse of rust-red rock. She was lost in thought, her mind consumed by the past.

It had been ten years since Frigg's sister, Lyra, had gone missing during their family's annual summer festival. The police investigation had turned up nothing, and Frigg's parents had eventually succumbed to grief. But Frigg couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

As she walked, the silence of the canyon began to stir within her a sense of resolve. She had spent years searching for answers, following every lead, every rumor, every whispered hint of Lyra's whereabouts. And yet, she remained no closer to the truth.

A faint hum caught Frigg's attention - the sound of a motorcycle engine, growing louder with each passing moment. She turned to watch as a sleek black bike skidded to a stop beside her, its rider - a ruggedly handsome young man with piercing blue eyes - scrambling off to dismount.

"Hey," he said, his voice low and smooth. "You okay?"

Frigg's first instinct was to push him away, but something about the stranger's expression stayed her hand. There was a kindness in his eyes that hinted at more than just casual concern.

"Yeah," she said finally, her voice barely above a whisper. "I'm fine."

The young man nodded sympathetically, taking a seat beside Frigg on the path. "You look like you're running from something," he said, his eyes flicking to her back before returning to hers.

Frigg hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. But there was something about this stranger that put her at ease - maybe it was the way he listened without interrupting, or the quiet confidence that radiated from him like a warm breeze on a summer's day.

She took a deep breath and told him everything - Lyra's disappearance, the police investigation, the endless search for answers. The stranger listened attentively, his expression growing increasingly somber as Frigg spoke.

When she finished, he reached out and placed a hand on her shoulder. "I think I can help you," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "But first, let's take a walk."

Frigg nodded, feeling an unexpected spark of hope ignite within her. She followed the stranger as he led her off the path, deeper into the canyon's mysterious heart. For the first time in years, she felt like she might finally find what she'd been searching for all along.
