Frigg Karlsson trudged through the snow-covered streets of Reykjavik, her boots crunching against the frosty pavement. As a freelance journalist, she had grown accustomed to working on tight deadlines and braving the elements.

As she walked, Frigg's mind wandered back to her latest assignment: an exposé on Iceland's growing environmental concerns. She had spent countless hours researching, interviewing experts and scouring government records. But despite her best efforts, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

A gust of wind blew through the square, whipping Frigg's dark hair into a frenzy as she quickened her pace. She ducked into a small café to escape the cold, ordering a hot coffee to warm her chilled bones.

As she sipped her drink, Frigg pulled out her notebook and began to scribble notes on her latest findings. Her editor had been breathing down her neck all week, demanding that she deliver something big – and fast. But Frigg was determined to get it right, even if it meant digging deeper than ever before.

Just then, a figure caught her eye: a young woman with piercing green eyes and a look of determination etched on her face. They exchanged brief smiles as the woman rushed past, leaving behind a small piece of paper on the table.

Frigg picked up the paper, smoothing out the crumpled surface to reveal a single sentence scrawled in hasty handwriting: "Meet me at the old lighthouse at midnight. Come alone." Her heart racing with excitement and trepidation, Frigg tucked the paper into her pocket, knowing that this was going to be a story unlike any she had ever told.

As the hours ticked by, Frigg's mind whirled with possibilities – and fears. Would this lead take her down a rabbit hole of intrigue, or could it be just another dead end? Only time would tell, but one thing was certain: Frigg Karlsson was ready to take on whatever came next.
