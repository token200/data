Frigg Andersson stood at the edge of the frozen lake, her eyes scanning the horizon as if searching for something just beyond the frosty veil. She wore a thick woolen coat, its fur-lined hood pulled up to ward off the biting wind, but it couldn't shield her from the chill that ran deep within.

Born and raised in this remote corner of Sweden, Frigg knew every inch of these frozen landscapes like the back of her hand. Yet, today she felt a sense of unease, as if some unseen force was stirring beneath the surface of the ice.

It had been three days since her brother, Jonas, had gone missing while out hunting. The local authorities had searched, but so far, no sign of him had been found. Frigg's parents were beside themselves with worry, and the village elder had offered to help her search, but she knew that what lay ahead would require more than just brute force.

She took a deep breath, feeling the cold air fill her lungs, and began to walk towards the lake's center. The ice creaked beneath her feet as she made her way across, her eyes fixed on some invisible point in the distance. Suddenly, a faint cry echoed across the water, sending shivers down her spine.

Without hesitation, Frigg quickened her pace, her heart pounding with excitement and fear. She could feel it too - something was off, something that didn't quite add up. The villagers had told stories of strange occurrences on this lake, of eerie lights flickering on the horizon, and whispers carried on the wind.

As she approached a particularly large ice floe, Frigg saw a figure trapped beneath its frozen surface. With shaking hands, she reached for her pocket knife and carefully began to free her brother's bound wrists. The ice creaked and groaned as it broke apart, revealing Jonas' pale face staring back at her.

But as she pulled him to his feet, something unexpected happened - Frigg felt a strange sensation wash over her, like the ice itself was alive and stirring. She took a step back, her eyes fixed on Jonas, who stood before her with an unsettling calm in his eyes.

"Frigg," he whispered, his voice carried away by the wind. "I've been here before. This isn't just any ordinary day."

Frigg's mind reeled as she stared at her brother, unsure what to make of his enigmatic words or what lay hidden beneath the surface of this frozen world they lived in.
