Frigg Zarins stepped into the dimly lit tavern, her eyes scanning the room with a mix of curiosity and caution. As a member of the infamous Blackwood clan, she was no stranger to intrigue and deception. Her long, raven-black hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall of night, drawing whispers from the patrons.

Frigg Zarins had always been known for her cunning and intelligence, qualities that had earned her a respected place within the clan's ranks. However, tonight, she sought something more – information. Rumors had been circulating about a potential threat to Blackwood's power, and Frigg was determined to uncover the truth.

As she made her way to the bar, a burly man with a thick beard turned to greet her. "Frigg Zarins, welcome to the Raven's Rest," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "What brings you here tonight?"

She ordered a whiskey, her eyes locked on the man as she waited for him to continue. He hesitated, then leaned in close. "There's been talk of a rival clan, one that seeks to supplant Blackwood's dominance."

Frigg Zarins' interest piqued, she nodded, her long fingers drumming a staccato beat on the bar. The man handed her a parchment with a crude map and several names scribbled on it. "Be careful, Frigg. These are not to be trifled with."

As she tucked the parchment into her cloak, a hooded figure caught her eye from across the room. They beckoned to her, their movements fluid and deliberate. Frigg Zarins' instincts told her this was someone worth meeting.

She slipped out of the tavern, following the mysterious figure through winding alleys and dark courtyards. The night air was thick with secrets, but Frigg Zarins was determined to uncover them all. As a member of the Blackwood clan, she had a reputation for being ruthless – but tonight, she was on the hunt for truth.

With each step, the shadows seemed to deepen, as if the very darkness itself was conspiring to aid her quest. And in that moment, Frigg Zarins knew she would stop at nothing to uncover the secrets hidden within the city's hidden recesses.
