Frigg Ivanov stood at the edge of the frozen lake, her long black coat fluttering in the biting wind. She gazed out across the expanse of ice, her piercing blue eyes seeming to see right through the surface. Her dark hair was pulled back into a tight bun, revealing a smattering of freckles across her cheeks that seemed almost otherworldly.

As a renowned glaciologist, Frigg had spent years studying the effects of climate change on these fragile ecosystems. But it was not just the science that drove her – it was a personal connection to this place. Her ancestors had been nomadic hunters in Siberia, and Frigg's own childhood memories were filled with tales of ice-worn sleds and moonlit nights spent gazing up at the stars.

She turned away from the lake and began trudging through the knee-deep snow, her boots crunching into the frozen crystals. Her team was waiting for her in the nearby research station – they had been tracking a peculiar shift in the permafrost's melting rate, and Frigg aimed to unravel its secrets.

As she walked, Frigg's mind wandered back to her parents, who had vanished on an expedition when she was just a teenager. Some said it was a tragic accident; others whispered of curses laid by their nomadic ancestors. Frigg didn't believe in ghost stories, but she did know that the harsh Siberian landscape could be unforgiving.

She pushed open the door to the research station and stepped inside, shaking off the snowflakes like confetti. Her team leader, Dr. Patel, greeted her with a warm smile.

"Good news, Frigg – our data suggests the permafrost is melting faster than expected," he said, as she hung up her coat and boots by the door.

Frigg's eyes narrowed behind her glasses. "That doesn't make sense. We've accounted for every variable. There must be something more going on."

Dr. Patel nodded in agreement. Together, they pored over maps and charts, searching for clues that might explain this anomaly. And as they worked, Frigg couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched – a sensation that had been growing inside her since her arrival at the station.

She glanced up from her notes to meet Dr. Patel's curious gaze, but his eyes seemed to hold only concern – not suspicion. Yet.
