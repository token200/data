Frigg Tamm was a woman like no other in the small, seaside town of Ravenshire. She had long, curly hair the color of sea foam and eyes that sparkled like the stars on a clear night. But it was her gift – or curse, depending on who you asked – that truly set her apart.

Frigg could see into the future.

It started when she was just a child, playing in the beachside sands with her friends. She would see glimpses of what was to come: a fleeting glimpse of a shipwrecked vessel on the horizon, or a shadowy figure lurking in the dunes. At first, she dismissed it as mere fancy, but as the visions grew stronger and more vivid, Frigg knew that something extraordinary was at work.

As she grew older, people began to seek her out, begging for guidance and advice. She would share with them what she saw – warnings of impending disasters, prophecies of great change, or whispers of secrets hidden beneath the waves. Some said she was a seer, while others claimed she was cursed by the sea itself.

Frigg didn't know which to believe.

But one thing was certain: her gift had changed her life forever. She had given up on ordinary pursuits like farming and trading, opting instead for a life of quiet contemplation by the ocean's edge. It was there that she received her visions, whispering secrets in her ear like the wind through the reeds.

Despite the isolation, Frigg found comfort in her solitude. The sea had always been a source of solace for her – its power and majesty humbling, yet beautiful. And when the storms raged outside, Frigg would close her eyes and listen to the whispers of the waves.

People began to notice the change in Frigg as she grew older. Her hair was now silver, not sea-foam blonde, but it still shone like moonlight. Her eyes still sparkled with a hint of mystery, as if the secrets of the deep were hidden within their depths. And though her gift had faded with age, those who knew Frigg understood that she remained attuned to the whispers of the waves – forever bound to the sea's power and wisdom.

Years went by, and Frigg became a legend in Ravenshire – a mysterious seer, a guardian of secrets, and a whispered warning of what was yet to come. But for Frigg herself, there was only the vast expanse of the ocean and its whispers, forever holding her close.
