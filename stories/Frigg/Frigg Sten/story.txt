Frigg Sten trudged through the snow-covered streets, her black boots crunching against the frozen crystals. The cold air stung her cheeks, but she didn't flinch, her eyes fixed on the small café in front of her. She had been searching for what felt like hours, and finally, she had found it.

Frigg pushed open the door, a bell above it ringing out as she stepped inside. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the faint scent of worn leather. Frigg's eyes scanned the room, taking in the sparse decorations and the handful of patrons huddled over their drinks.

She spotted an empty chair at the counter and made her way towards it. As she settled onto the stool, a friendly voice called out from behind the counter. "Can I get you something to drink, miss?"

Frigg turned to face the barista, a young woman with bright pink hair and a warm smile. "Just coffee," Frigg replied, her voice husky.

The barista nodded and poured Frigg a steaming cup. As she handed it over, their eyes met for a brief moment, and Frigg felt a spark of connection. But she didn't have time to indulge in small talk; she had a purpose here.

She took a sip of the coffee, letting the warmth spread through her veins. Her thoughts turned to the mission that brought her to this café. She was searching for answers, following a trail of cryptic clues and whispered rumors. The locals seemed tight-lipped, but Frigg was determined to uncover the truth.

As she sipped her coffee, she noticed a figure watching her from across the room. Tall, imposing, with piercing blue eyes that seemed to bore into her very soul. Frigg's instincts prickled; this was someone she needed to talk to.

Without hesitation, she set down her cup and strode over to the stranger. "Mind if I join you?" she asked, her tone crisp.

The man looked up, a hint of surprise in his eyes, but he nodded eventually. "Please do."

Frigg slid into the chair across from him, the silence between them palpable. She opened her mouth to speak, but before she could say anything, the stranger spoke up. "You're not like most people who come in here," he said, his voice low and smooth.

Frigg raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "And what makes you think that?"

The man leaned forward, his eyes glinting in the dim light. "Let's just say I've been expecting you."

For a moment, Frigg felt like she was drowning in those piercing blue depths. Then, with a quiet determination, she spoke up: "I'm here for answers."
