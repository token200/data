Frigg Ramazzotti was no ordinary being. She was an enigmatic sorceress with an air of mystique surrounding her like a shroud. With eyes that gleamed like sapphires in the night sky, she moved unseen among the mortal crowds, weaving spells of fate and fortune.

As a young woman, Frigg had demonstrated an unyielding affinity for magic, earning her a place among the secretive Council of Sages. Her name became synonymous with mastery and wisdom, whispered in awe by those who dared to approach her.

One fateful evening, as the autumnal moon cast its silver glow over the land, Frigg Ramazzotti walked into the dimly lit tavern of The Red Griffin Inn. Patrons turned to regard her, their curiosity piqued by the aura that surrounded her like a mantle of velvet.

She ordered a room for the night and sat alone at the bar, nursing a cup of ale as the patrons talked and laughed around her. With each passing moment, she absorbed the whispers and murmurs like a sponge drinking in knowledge. Her gaze drifted across faces, searching for hidden threads that could be woven into the tapestry of fate.

A young bard strummed his lute nearby, drawing Frigg's attention with an entrancing melody. The music resonated deep within her, awakening memories of days long past when she had listened to similar songs in ancient forests. Her fingers absently rose to tap a rhythm on the counter as if beckoned by some unseen force.

The bard noticed Frigg Ramazzotti watching him and smiled warmly, sensing an inexplicable connection with this enigmatic sorceress. Frigg smiled back at him, revealing secrets hidden within her own heart – like whispers shared among ancient ones who understood each other's language of stars and shadows.

The night wore on as Frigg Ramazzotti left the tavern under a moonlit sky that glowed brighter in response to her presence. As she vanished into the darkness, those who witnessed it sensed an unsettling knowledge: Frigg had not only listened but also heard – and with that knowledge came a portent of what was yet to come for all mortals.
