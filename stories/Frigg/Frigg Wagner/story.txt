Frigg Wagner stepped into the dimly lit pub, her piercing green eyes scanning the crowded room with a mixture of curiosity and disdain. She had always been drawn to the seedy underbelly of New Haven, where the desperate and downtrodden came to seek solace in the bottom of a whiskey glass.

As she made her way to the bar, a hush fell over the patrons, their eyes following Frigg's sleek figure in a mixture of fascination and fear. Few knew much about her past, but whispers of her involvement with the infamous Blackwood crime family had spread like wildfire through the city's underworld.

Frigg slid onto a stool beside an imposing figure, his chiseled features a testament to his lineage as a descendant of old money. He raised a brow in her direction, and Frigg smiled, her full lips curling upwards in a mischievous arc. "Whiskey," she purred, her voice husky and confident.

The bartender, a grizzled old-timer with a penchant for storytelling, handed her a glass filled to the brim with amber liquid. As she sipped it, Frigg's gaze roamed over the room, taking in the tangled web of relationships and rivalries that bound the city's underworld together.

She spotted a familiar face across the room - Victor LaGraine, a cunning thief with a reputation for pulling off the impossible heist. A spark of interest flared within her, and she made her way towards him, weaving through the crowd with an ease born of years spent navigating New Haven's treacherous landscape.

Victor's eyes widened as Frigg approached, his smile faltering for an instant before he regained his composure. "Frigg Wagner," he drawled, his voice dripping with a mixture of admiration and wariness. "What brings you to our humble abode tonight?"

Frigg chuckled, her eyes glinting with mirth as she settled onto the stool beside him. "Just passing through," she lied, her gaze darting towards the shadows where Victor's accomplices likely waited.

As the night wore on, Frigg expertly wove a web of intrigue and deception, using her considerable charm to extract information from those around her. She was Frigg Wagner, after all - a master manipulator with a talent for getting what she wanted, no matter the cost.

And in that dimly lit pub, surrounded by the city's most unsavory characters, she reigned supreme, her green eyes glinting like emeralds in the night.
