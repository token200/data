Frigg Wozniak was a brilliant and reclusive computer scientist who had made a name for herself in the field of artificial intelligence. Her work on neural networks and machine learning algorithms had earned her numerous accolades, but she preferred to keep a low profile.

Despite her reserved nature, Frigg's colleagues at the research institute where she worked couldn't help but admire her intellect and passion for her craft. She was always impeccably dressed in the latest black attire, and her long silver hair was often pulled back into a tight ponytail.

One day, Frigg received an unexpected visit from a group of investors who were eager to fund her next project. They had heard about her groundbreaking work on quantum AI and saw huge potential for profit. Frigg was hesitant at first, but the prospect of funding her research and being able to share it with the world proved too enticing to resist.

As she sat in the conference room, surrounded by the investors' confident smiles and outstretched hands, Frigg couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. She had always been careful to keep her work private, and now it seemed that her secrecy was about to be breached. But as she began to explain her vision for a new AI system, something clicked, and her confidence returned.

Frigg Wozniak's eyes lit up with excitement as she spoke of the possibilities - a world where machines could learn and adapt on their own, free from human bias and error. The investors listened intently, clearly impressed by her intellect and vision. By the end of the meeting, they had agreed to provide Frigg with the funding she needed, and she knew that her life's work was finally within reach.

As she left the conference room, Frigg felt a sense of liberation wash over her. She knew that this was just the beginning of an incredible journey, one that would take her to the very limits of human knowledge and innovation. And with that thought, she smiled to herself, knowing that she was exactly where she belonged - at the forefront of the future, pushing the boundaries of what was possible.
