Jake Grabowska trudged through the rain-soaked streets, his worn boots making splashing sounds on the pavement. As a private investigator, he'd grown accustomed to the drizzly Glasgow weather, but it didn't make it any more enjoyable.

Jake was on the hunt for a missing person – Emily Wilson, a 25-year-old nurse who'd vanished without a word from her family. The police were stumped, and that's where Jake came in. He'd been hired by Emily's sister to find her, and he was determined to do just that.

As he walked, Jake's mind wandered back to the case files he'd been poring over all night. There were inconsistencies in the alibis of Emily's friends and acquaintances, but nothing concrete. Jake needed a break, and fast. He spotted a small café tucked away on a side street and ducked inside for a cup of coffee.

The owner, a gruff but kind-hearted woman named Margaret, greeted Jake with a warm smile. "The usual, love?" she asked, and Jake nodded in agreement. As he waited for his coffee, he noticed a young woman sitting alone at the counter, nursing a cup of tea. There was something about her that caught his attention – maybe it was the haunted look in her eyes or the way she kept glancing over her shoulder.

"Who's your friend?" Jake asked Margaret, nodding towards the woman.

Margaret followed his gaze and raised an eyebrow. "Ah, that's Sarah McTavish. She's a bit of a loner, but I think she might be hiding something."

Jake's ears perked up at this. He excused himself from Margaret and made his way over to Sarah. As he sat down beside her, he asked, "What brings you out on a night like this?"

Sarah hesitated before speaking in hushed tones about a mysterious phone call she'd received earlier that day. The voice on the other end had whispered something cryptic – "Meet me at the old clock tower if you want to know the truth." Sarah had dismissed it as a prank, but now she wasn't so sure.

Jake's eyes locked onto hers. He knew he was onto something. "Tell me more," he said, his voice low and urgent.
