Jake Ken was a man consumed by his work. As a freelance writer, he spent most of his days holed up in his small apartment, typing away on his laptop. His latest project was a thriller novel, and he was determined to get it published.

One fateful evening, as Jake sat at his desk, staring blankly at the screen, he received an unexpected visit from his childhood friend, Emma. She had just moved back to their hometown after years of traveling abroad and was looking for a place to stay.

As they caught up on old times, Emma noticed something peculiar about Jake's behavior. He seemed distant, almost detached from reality. She gently probed him, asking if everything was okay, but Jake brushed it off, attributing his fatigue to the demands of meeting his deadline.

However, as the night wore on, Emma persisted in her concern. She watched as Jake's eyes glazed over, and his body language began to suggest that he was under some sort of duress. It dawned on her that something was very wrong.

Suddenly, a phone call interrupted their conversation. Jake's face lit up, and he excused himself to answer it. Emma noticed the look of panic in his eyes as he listened to the caller. The words "They're coming for you" echoed in the air, making Emma's skin crawl.

Jake quickly hung up, and with a mixture of urgency and desperation, handed Emma a folder filled with his manuscript. His final words were: "I have to get out of here. They'll find me if I don't disappear."

As Emma watched Jake hastily gather his belongings, she realized that he was hiding from something - or someone. The once vibrant writer had become a fugitive, forced to abandon his life and everything he held dear.

Without hesitation, Emma followed Jake as he fled into the night, leaving behind the only home they had ever known. Together, they vanished into the darkness, pursued by unknown forces that threatened to destroy their lives forever.
