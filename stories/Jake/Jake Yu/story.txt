His parents, both historians themselves, encouraged his curiosity, sending him to dig sites in Egypt and Mesopotamia for summers.

Years later, Jake's passion for archaeology led him to become a renowned expert in the field. He had published numerous papers on ancient artifacts and was sought after by museums and collectors from around the world.
