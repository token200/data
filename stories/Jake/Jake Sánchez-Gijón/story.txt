Jake Sánchez-Gijón stepped into the dimly lit tavern, the smell of stale beer and worn leather enveloping him like an old friend. He had been on the road for weeks, traveling through the dusty towns and villages of Spain, searching for a connection to his past. As he made his way to the bar, a gruff voice called out from behind the counter.

"Hey, amigo! Jake Sánchez-Gijón, I presume?"

Jake turned to face the bartender, a grizzled old man with a thick beard and a twinkle in his eye. "That's me," he replied, sliding onto a stool beside the bar.

The bartender poured him a mug of frothy beer without asking twice. "So, Jake, what brings you to our humble town?" he asked, wiping down the counter with a dirty rag.

Jake took a sip of his beer, letting the cool liquid wash over his parched throat. "I'm searching for something," he said, his eyes scanning the room as if expecting someone – or something – to jump out from behind the bar stools.

The bartender raised an eyebrow. "Something, eh? Maybe I can help."

Jake nodded, taking another sip of his beer. The bartender leaned in close, lowering his voice. "We've got a legend around here, Jake Sánchez-Gijón. A legend about a cursed treasure buried deep beneath the town's old church."

Jake's ears perked up at the mention of treasure, but he played it cool. "Treasure, you say? That sounds like just the thing I'm looking for."

The bartender smiled knowingly. "Be careful what you wish for, amigo. The curse is real, and it's said to drive men mad with greed and desire."

Jake laughed, a low, gravelly sound. He had always been drawn to danger, and this seemed like the perfect challenge. "I'm not one to shy away from a risk," he said, tossing a few coins onto the bar.

The bartender grinned, pushing a dusty old map towards Jake. "Good luck, Jake Sánchez-Gijón. May you find what you're looking for – but may it come with a price."
