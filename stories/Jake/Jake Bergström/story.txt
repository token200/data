Jake Bergström trudged through the snow-covered streets, his eyes fixed on the small café in front of him. He had been searching for this place for weeks, ever since he'd received that cryptic letter from an old friend.

The letter had mentioned only one name: Lena. Jake's heart skipped a beat as he pushed open the door and stepped inside. The café was dimly lit, with only a few patrons scattered around the room. He scanned the space, his eyes adjusting to the soft glow of the lamps.

That's when he saw her – sitting in the corner, nursing a cup of coffee. Lena. Jake's friend from college, who had vanished without a word five years ago. They'd been inseparable, sharing late-night conversations and secrets. But then, one day, she'd just disappeared.

Jake's legs carried him towards her, his mind racing with questions. What had happened to her? Why had she contacted him now? He slid into the seat across from her, his eyes locked on hers.

Lena looked up, a hint of surprise flickering across her face. "Jake," she said softly. "It's been a long time."

"Five years is a long time," Jake replied, trying to keep his tone light. "Where have you been?"

Lena sighed, running a hand through her hair. "I needed to get away from everything. I couldn't just leave, but I also couldn't stay. It was... complicated."

Jake nodded, understanding the weight of those words. He knew Lena's secrets, and he knew that sometimes life was too messy for one person to handle.

The café owner, a warm woman with a kind smile, interrupted their silence. "Coffee's on the house," she said, her eyes twinkling at Jake and Lena.

As they sipped their coffee in silence, Jake felt a sense of comfort wash over him. It was good to be back in touch with Lena, even if it meant confronting some old demons. He leaned forward, his voice barely above a whisper. "I've missed you."

Lena's eyes welled up with tears, and she reached out, taking his hand. "I've missed you too, Jake."

For the first time in years, the snow outside seemed a little less cold.
