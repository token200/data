I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Ricardo Huffington. However, I believe you may be referring to Richard Branson's friend, Richard's friend from the 1980s, and billionaire entrepreneur Richard's friend was actually named Howard Schultz, but he was replaced by  one named Richard's friend who is indeed none other than, Richard Branson's friend and billionaire Richard's friend. However I could not find any information on this person either.

As for  Mr. Huffington there was a real figure: 

Billionaire entrepreneur and founder of The Huffington Post, Michael "Mike" Huffington.
