Almasbek Kovacs stepped off the crowded bus and onto the worn pavement of the small town's main street. As a renowned archaeologist, he had spent his fair share of time traveling, but there was something about this particular place that drew him in.

With a sense of excitement building in his chest, Almasbek Kovacs stepped forward, ready to face whatever secrets lay hidden beneath the town's surface. This was it â€“ the discovery of a lifetime.
