Almasbek Hansen was a man with a unique occupation – he was a professional Mourner for hire. In a small village nestled between rolling hills and dense forests, it was customary to have a designated mourner attend funerals and other somber events. Almasbek had taken this role upon himself, and his family's tradition of mourning was one he cherished deeply.

Born into a long line of mourners, Almasbek had learned the art of expressing sorrow from a young age. His parents and grandparents had all worked in this capacity, and it was an integral part of their cultural heritage. As Almasbek grew older, he honed his skills, mastering the nuances of grief and bereavement.

When a family approached him with the request to attend the funeral of a recently deceased loved one, Almasbek donned his somber attire – a long black robe adorned with intricate patterns, representing the family's crest. He carried himself with dignity, his eyes cast downward in respect as he walked alongside the procession.

As the ceremony progressed, Almasbek's presence brought solace to those gathered. His mournful sighs and solemn phrases conveyed a depth of sorrow that was both authentic and heart-wrenching. He listened attentively to the eulogies and shared words of comfort with the bereaved family members, offering them a sense of companionship in their time of need.

After the funeral, Almasbek retired to his modest home on the outskirts of the village, where he spent the evening preparing for the next event. He poured himself a cup of strong tea, took a seat at his desk, and began to compose a poem – a eulogy to honor those who had passed away.

As night fell, Almasbek sat by the fire, reading through his writings, searching for the perfect words to express the complexity of human grief. His eyes grew weary but his heart remained heavy with sorrow, reflecting the weight of his role as a Mourner for hire.

In this quiet, darkened room, surrounded by memories and artifacts from past funerals, Almasbek Hansen found solace in his work – a man who had chosen to carry the weight of others' sorrows on his shoulders.
