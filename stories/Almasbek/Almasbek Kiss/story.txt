Upon arrival, Almasbek Kiss met with the Khan and a group of esteemed guests, including diplomats from neighboring countries. The situation was indeed dire: a rival tribe had begun to cause trouble along the border, threatening the fragile peace between nations.

With his trademark calm and confidence, Almasbek Kiss took charge of the meeting, offering words of wisdom and strategic advice that impressed all present. His reputation as a fierce warrior and skilled diplomat grew even further, solidifying his place in Kyrgyz history as one of its greatest heroes - Almasbek Kiss, a man whose bravery, strength, and intelligence had once again saved the day.
