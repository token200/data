Urmas Vuorinen was a man with a unique profession - he was a professional line stander. Yes, you read that right. In a world where pop culture and social media have created a culture of instant gratification, Urmas had taken it upon himself to make a living by waiting in lines for people who didn't want to wait themselves.

Urmas's day started early, as he would often arrive at the venue hours before the scheduled event or concert. He'd set up his makeshift stall, adorned with a sign that read "Line Stander - $20/hour" and would then patiently wait for his clients to arrive. Whether it was waiting in line for a new iPhone release or securing tickets to a sold-out concert, Urmas was always ready.

One sunny Saturday, Urmas received a call from his latest client, a busy professional named Emma. She had managed to score two tickets to a highly anticipated music festival, but didn't have time to wait in the long line herself. Urmas agreed to take her place, and arrived at the venue early to secure a good spot.

As the day went on, Urmas found himself chatting with fellow festival-goers, some of whom were genuinely interested in getting to know him. Others, however, seemed more concerned with taking selfies than engaging in meaningful conversation. Undeterred, Urmas continued to stand his ground, enjoying the music and atmosphere even as he waited.

As the festival came to a close, Urmas's client Emma arrived, exhausted but relieved. She thanked him profusely for his services, promising to recommend him to all her friends. As she walked away, Urmas smiled to himself, satisfied with another day well spent.

Urmas Vuorinen had long since made peace with his unusual profession. In fact, he found joy in the simplicity of it all - just him, waiting in line, and connecting with others along the way. It wasn't always easy, but for a man like Urmas, who valued patience and human connection above all else, it was a lifestyle he wouldn't trade for anything.

With his hourly earnings tallied up and his energy levels waning, Urmas packed up his things and headed home, already looking forward to his next gig as a professional line stander.
