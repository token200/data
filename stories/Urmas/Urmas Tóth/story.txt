Urmas Tóth was not your typical rockstar. A native of Tallinn, Estonia, he had grown up surrounded by the country's rich folk music heritage and had always been fascinated by the stories his grandfather told him of old Estonian traditions.

As a child, Urmas would often sneak into the attic of his family's old wooden house to listen to his grandfather play the accordion. The rhythmic sounds of traditional Estonian songs filled the air, transporting Urmas to another world where time stood still and the cares of everyday life faded away.

Urmas began to teach himself how to play the accordion at a young age, and soon he was joining in with his school friends to create impromptu folk bands. But it wasn't until he stumbled upon an old, battered vinyl record of Eesti kultuurikoor's classic 1950s recordings that Urmas found his true calling.

Entranced by the haunting melodies and powerful harmonies, Urmas knew that he wanted to share this kind of music with the world. He began writing his own songs, drawing inspiration from Estonian folklore and mythology. The lyrics poured out of him like a floodgate opened, filling pages with stories of love, loss, and longing.

Years went by, and Urmas's talent didn't go unnoticed. He started performing at local festivals and concerts in Tallinn, gradually building a following of enthusiastic fans who appreciated his unique blend of traditional Estonian sounds with modern sensibilities.

One day, while on tour in Paris, Urmas received an offer to perform at the legendary Théâtre du Châtelet. Eager to take his music to new heights, he accepted the invitation and spent months rehearsing his setlist.

When the night of the performance arrived, the audience was wowed by Urmas's raw energy and emotional depth. His accordion wept like a wounded soul as he sang about the ghosts of Estonian history, his voice soaring on the wind like a wild bird taking flight.

The applause that followed was thunderous, with many in attendance visibly moved to tears. In that moment, Urmas Tóth knew he had found his true purpose: to carry the torch of Estonian folk music into a wider world, sharing its timeless stories and haunting melodies with anyone who would listen.
