Urmas Hiroki was known for his sharp wit and cunning business sense in the cutthroat world of Tokyo's high finance. A rising star among the city's elite, he had built a reputation for being ruthless yet fair, always pushing the boundaries of what was considered acceptable in the pursuit of success.

Despite his reserved demeanor, Urmas was not one to be underestimated. Behind closed doors, he would unleash a torrent of sarcasm and humor that left even the toughest opponents struggling to keep up. His colleagues adored him for it, and his clients rewarded him with lucrative deals and high-profile connections.

One evening, as the sun dipped below the towering skyscrapers of Shinjuku, Urmas Hiroki received an unexpected visit from an old acquaintance. A former business partner turned rival, Koji had been trying to poach some of Urmas's most valuable clients for months, but so far, he had come up empty-handed.

"I see you're still riding high on your success," Koji sneered, his eyes flashing with malice. "But I've got news that might just shake things up."

Urmas listened patiently as Koji spun a web of deceit and half-truths, each sentence carefully crafted to make him appear the victim. But Urmas saw right through it. He knew Koji's tactics all too well.

"You're just trying to get under my skin, old friend," Urmas said with a smile, his voice dripping with amusement. "But I'm not biting."

Koji snarled and stormed out of the office, but Urmas knew he had won this round. As the door closed behind him, he leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers together in satisfaction.

Another day, another dollar â€“ or rather, another day, another million yen. The Tokyo elite might have underestimated Urmas Hiroki at first, but they were fast learning to respect him. And as for Koji? He was just a footnote in the grand story of Urmas's rise to success.
