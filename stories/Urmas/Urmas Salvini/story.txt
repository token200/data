His eyes seemed to hold a thousand secrets, and his smile could disarm even the most skeptical of individuals.

Urmas Salvini's past was shrouded in mystery, but one thing was certain: he had a reputation for being untouchable. His skills were unmatched, and those who crossed him did so at their own peril. He moved with an air of quiet confidence, his presence commanding attention without ever demanding it.

One fateful evening, Urmas Salvini found himself in the midst of a high-stakes poker game, surrounded by some of the most ruthless players in the world.
