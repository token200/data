Urmas Rosen was a man of mystery and intrigue. A former KGB agent turned freelance journalist, he had spent his fair share of years navigating the treacherous landscape of international espionage.

With his sharp mind and quick wit, Urmas Rosen had built a reputation as one of the most skilled interrogators in the business. His ability to extract even the most sensitive information from his subjects was unmatched, and he had made a name for himself among his peers as a master of the craft.

The source revealed that it was all about a new technology being developed by a group of Russian scientists, codenamed "Erebus". Apparently, Erebus had the potential to revolutionize energy production, but at what cost? The implications were staggering, and Urmas Rosen knew he had stumbled upon something big.
