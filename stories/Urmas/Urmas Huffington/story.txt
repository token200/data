I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Urmas Huffington. It's possible that this character doesn't exist or is not well-known.

However, I can create a new story with the character Urmas Huffington. Here it is:

Urmas Huffington was a brilliant and eccentric inventor who lived in the small town of Willowdale. He spent most of his days tinkering with gadgets and machinery in his cluttered workshop, much to the dismay of the local authorities. Despite this, Urmas's ingenuity and creativity knew no bounds.

One sunny afternoon, as Urmas Huffington was working on a new project, he received an unexpected visit from the town's mayor, Mrs. Jenkins. She had heard rumors about Urmas's latest invention and was eager to see it for herself. As she entered the workshop, Urmas greeted her with a wide smile and invited her to take a seat.

Urmas Huffington proudly displayed his latest creation: a machine that could convert thoughts into physical objects. The mayor was skeptical at first, but after witnessing the machine in action, she was amazed by its potential. She asked Urmas if he would be willing to use the machine to create something beneficial for the town, and Urmas eagerly agreed.

Over the next few weeks, Urmas Huffington worked tirelessly on perfecting his invention. He used it to create everything from new park benches to repaired bicycles. The townspeople were thrilled with the results, and soon, Urmas was in high demand. People would come from all over to see the machine and have their thoughts brought to life.

As Urmas Huffington's fame grew, so did his ego. He began to get caught up in his own success and started to prioritize his own needs above those of others. Despite this, he remained a beloved figure in Willowdale, and his invention continued to bring joy and prosperity to the community. And though he may have gotten a little too full of himself, Urmas Huffington's legacy lived on as one of the town's most brilliant and eccentric inventors.
