Urmas Makinen was known for his exceptional talent in playing the accordion, but few people knew about his humble beginnings. Born and raised in rural Estonia, he grew up surrounded by traditional folk music that would later influence his unique sound.

As a child, Urmas would often accompany his mother to local festivals and celebrations, watching in awe as older musicians expertly played traditional instruments. He was especially drawn to the accordion's rich, melancholic tones, which seemed to speak directly to his soul. By the time he was 10 years old, Urmas had already taught himself how to play a simple tune on an old family accordion.

Despite his passion for music, Urmas's parents encouraged him to pursue a more "practical" career. He considered studying engineering, but ultimately decided that music was where his heart truly lay. After completing secondary school, he enrolled in a prestigious music conservatory in Tallinn, where he honed his skills and developed a distinctive style that blended traditional Estonian folk with modern influences.

Years of hard work and dedication paid off when Urmas Makinen's debut album was released to critical acclaim. The album's unique blend of traditional and contemporary sounds captivated audiences across Europe, earning him a reputation as one of the most exciting new talents in the music scene.

Urmas continued to tour extensively, introducing his music to new fans and collaborating with fellow musicians from around the world. His passion for preserving traditional Estonian folk music was evident in every performance, but he also showed a willingness to push boundaries and experiment with new sounds.

Throughout his career, Urmas Makinen remained true to his roots, never forgetting where he came from or the values that had shaped him as an artist. He continued to inspire audiences with his beautiful accordion playing, reminding them of the power of music to transcend borders and cultures.
