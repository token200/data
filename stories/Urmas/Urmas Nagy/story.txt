Urmas Nagy stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for any familiar faces. As a renowned detective in Tallinn, Estonia, he had seen it all – from petty thefts to high-stakes kidnappings. But tonight, he was here on a personal mission.

Urmas Nagy took a seat at the bar, ordering a whiskey as he pulled out his phone and dialed a number. It rang a few times before his business partner, Martin, picked up.

"Hey, what's the situation?" Martin asked, his voice laced with concern.

"I've got a lead on my sister's disappearance," Urmas Nagy replied, his eyes narrowing as he sipped his whiskey. "She was last seen at the old windmill on the outskirts of town. I need you to meet me there ASAP."

There was a pause on the other end of the line before Martin spoke up. "What makes you think she's still alive?"

Urmas Nagy's jaw clenched as he thought back to their conversation earlier that day. "Because someone just called her phone and whispered 'you'll never find her'. I know it sounds like a red herring, but I have a gut feeling about this one."

Martin sighed. "Okay, I'm on my way. But be careful, Urmas Nagy. We don't know what we're up against here."

Urmas Nagy nodded to himself, even though Martin couldn't see him. He had always prided himself on his sharp instincts and quick thinking – skills that had served him well over the years.

As he waited for Martin's arrival, Urmas Nagy took a moment to glance around the café. The patrons were all locals, huddled in small groups or sipping their own drinks. He noticed a young woman sitting alone at a corner table, her eyes fixed on some invisible point across the room. There was something about her that caught his attention – maybe it was the way she seemed out of place among the others, or perhaps it was simply because she looked like someone who needed help.

When Martin arrived, Urmas Nagy filled him in on the details. Together, they set off towards the windmill, ready to face whatever lay ahead and bring Urmas Nagy's sister home safe and sound.
