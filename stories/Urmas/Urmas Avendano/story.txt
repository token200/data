With an uncanny ability to blend into his surroundings and adapt to any situation, Urmas Avendano had evaded capture time and again.

One day, a wealthy collector named Marcellus approached Urmas Avendano with a lucrative offer: steal the priceless Starlight Serenade diamond necklace from the museum's annual gala. The necklace was said to be cursed, but Marcellus didn't believe in superstitions.

Urmas Avendano listened intently as Marcellus outlined his plan, his piercing green eyes gleaming with interest. He knew that this job would be a challenge, but he was confident in his abilities.
