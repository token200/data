Urmas Kortajarena was a man of mystery and intrigue. A skilled thief and con artist, he had made a living out of swindling the wealthy and powerful from the streets of 19th century Europe to the high-society gatherings of America.

With his chiseled features and piercing green eyes, Urmas could charm his way into even the most secure rooms, disarming his marks with ease. His razor-sharp wit and quick tongue allowed him to talk his way out of (or into) just about any situation. But beneath the glitz and glamour, Urmas had a troubled past. A orphaned youth, he had learned early on to rely only on himself.

As he moved from city to city, gathering stories and tricks like a magpie collecting shiny trinkets, one name kept popping up: Leonora "Luna" Blackwood, a beautiful socialite with a reputation for being untouchable. Urmas had a fascination with Luna - not just her beauty, but the air of invincibility that surrounded her.

One night in New York City, Urmas finally caught his chance. He snuck into Luna's penthouse apartment, intent on relieving her of one of her famous diamond necklaces. But as he crept through the darkened halls, a figure emerged from the shadows - Luna herself. Instead of attacking him, she regarded Urmas with an unnerving intensity.

"You're not like the others," she said, her voice low and husky. "Most thieves I've met are driven by desperation. But you... there's something more to you." And in that moment, Urmas knew that Luna saw beyond his facade, saw the man beneath.

From that night on, Urmas found himself bound to Luna in ways he never could have imagined. A tentative partnership formed between them - one of thieves for each other, united against a world that seemed determined to keep its secrets hidden.
