Urmas Sandström stepped out of his small cottage, gazing up at the night sky. The Estonian winter was in full swing, and the stars twinkled like diamonds scattered across the velvet blackness. He breathed in the crisp air, feeling invigorated by the chill.

A skilled birch-bark boat maker, Urmas spent most of his days crafting vessels for the local fishermen. It was a tradition passed down through generations of Sandströms, who had lived on the banks of Lake Peipus for centuries. The gentle lapping of the water against the shore and the soft creaking of wooden hulls were music to Urmas' ears.

As he walked towards his workshop, a warm light spilled out from within, inviting him in from the cold. His apprentice, Jaan, looked up from sanding down a particularly stubborn crack on a new boat's hull. "Ready for you to try it out, Master Sandström?" he asked, gesturing to the partially completed vessel.

Urmas smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "Not yet, young one. First, let me check the measurements." He took out a wooden ruler and measured the length of the boat again, double-checking that everything was to perfection. The Sandström tradition didn't tolerate mistakes; only precision and attention to detail would do.

Once satisfied, Urmas gave a nod, and Jaan carefully handed him the oar. As he dipped it into the water and began to row, the rhythm of the strokes seemed to harmonize with the beating of his heart. The boat slid effortlessly across the lake's surface, as if responding to some ancient instinct.

Urmas closed his eyes, letting the cool breeze carry away the worries of the day. He was one with the natural world, a part of it – just like his ancestors had been. The sand between his toes felt the same way it did when he was a boy, playing on the shore.

A faint rustling sound broke the silence. Urmas opened his eyes to see Jaan watching him, a thoughtful expression on his face. "You know, Master Sandström," the apprentice said, "sometimes I wonder what you were like before...before the war, I mean." His voice was barely above a whisper.

Urmas' gaze drifted back out to the lake, his eyes misting slightly as memories began to surface. He had indeed known a time of peace, of living in harmony with nature and the people around him. But that was a lifetime ago – a different Urmas Sandström lived now, carrying on the family legacy even if it meant keeping secrets and stories locked away.

With a heavy heart, he set the oar aside, his movements becoming deliberate as he led Jaan back to the workshop. The birch-bark boat lay waiting, its wooden hull patiently ready for the next journey. And Urmas Sandström would continue to build vessels that carried people across Lake Peipus, carrying memories with them – and silently keeping secrets of the past hidden in the water's depths.
