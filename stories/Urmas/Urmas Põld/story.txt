Urmas Põld was a master of the ancient Estonian folk dance known as the "Muldviis." His long white beard and twinkling eyes seemed to hold secrets of the past, and his movements were said to be guided by an otherworldly force.

As a young man, Urmas had been fascinated by the stories of his ancestors, who had once performed the Muldviis under the light of the full moon. He spent countless hours practicing the intricate steps and watching the stars twinkle above, feeling the magic of the dance coursing through his veins.

Years went by, and Urmas became renowned throughout the land for his exceptional skills in the Muldviis. People would travel from far and wide to witness him perform, mesmerized by the hypnotic rhythm of his feet and the soaring melody of his voice. And yet, despite all the attention, Urmas remained humble and kind, always willing to share his knowledge with those who sought it.

One fateful evening, as the full moon hung low in the sky, a young apprentice named Aiga approached Urmas with a request for guidance. She had heard whispers of an ancient ritual that could only be performed by someone who possessed the true essence of the Muldviis. Intrigued, Urmas agreed to teach her the ways of the dance.

As they practiced under the moonlight, Urmas began to sense that Aiga was more than just a curious student – she had a deep connection to the land and its people, a spark within her that echoed his own passion for the Muldviis. Under Urmas Põld's guidance, Aiga slowly began to unlock the secrets of the dance, her movements becoming more fluid and synchronized with the rhythm of the forest.

As the night wore on, the air was filled with an otherworldly energy, as if the very spirits of the land had come alive through Urmas and Aiga's performance. The Muldviis danced on, a vortex of movement and sound that seemed to draw in all who watched, leaving them breathless and enchanted by the magic of Urmas Põld and his young apprentice.
