Born to a family of modest means, Urmas had always been encouraged to pursue her passion for art. Her parents, though struggling financially, had sacrificed everything to provide their daughter with the best education possible. And so, Urmas María's talent was nurtured from an early age, as she honed her skills in painting and sculpture.

As she entered adulthood, Urmas María began to make a name for herself in the art world.

She continued to live in La Calle Luna, where she was revered by the community as a local treasure.

One day, a prominent art dealer stumbled upon Urmas María's work at a local gallery exhibition. Enchanted by her raw talent and infectious energy, the dealer offered Urmas a lucrative deal – one that would catapult her career into the stratosphere.
