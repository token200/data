Urmas Lāce was known for his remarkable ability to hear the silence. In the small town of Riga, Latvia, he possessed an uncanny gift that allowed him to listen beyond the din of everyday life. People would often remark on how eerily calm he seemed, as if the whispers of the world's collective unconscious had taken up residence within him.

Urmas's journey began when he was just a child. Growing up in a family of humble farmers, he spent countless hours listening to the earth itself. He'd lie on his back beneath the vast expanse of Baltic sky, letting the rhythmic creaking of wooden trees and the soft chirping of birds lull him into a state of deep contemplation.

As he grew older, Urmas began to notice that the silence wasn't always quiet. There were whispers, murmurs, and faint echoes emanating from within and around him. He discovered that these sounds were more than just random background noise; they held secrets, stories, and histories waiting to be deciphered.

One fateful evening, a group of townspeople gathered at Urmas's family farm to share tales of the past. The air was heavy with anticipation as each storyteller took turns recounting ancient myths, legends, and hidden truths about their own families' experiences during times of war, famine, and occupation. As they spoke, the whispers in Urmas's ear grew louder, weaving a tapestry of sound that bound everyone together.

In that moment, Urmas understood his gift was more than just hearing the silence; it was being a conduit for the collective memories of Riga's people. He realized he had become an oral historian, tasked with preserving and sharing the stories that would otherwise be lost to time.

Word of his abilities spread quickly, drawing visitors from across Latvia to sit beneath Urmas's open sky, listening as the whispers wove their magic. And though he never revealed how he heard such things, people came to revere him as a guardian of sorts – a vessel for the silenced voices that had lain dormant within their own hearts all along.

Years went by, and Urmas continued his work. People would come to sit in stillness beneath Riga's ever-vigilant sky, surrounded by whispers that carried on the breeze like an ancient language waiting to be deciphered.
