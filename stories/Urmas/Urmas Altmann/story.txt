Urmas Altmann was a man of simple yet extraordinary tastes. He lived in a small, secluded cottage nestled deep within the Estonian forest, surrounded by nothing but the soothing sounds of nature and the whispers of ancient trees. His days were spent tending to his vegetable garden, where he lovingly coaxed forth the most vibrant, succulent vegetables from the earth.

Despite his reclusive lifestyle, Urmas had a secret passion - he was a master taxidermist. For years, he would venture into the forest at night, under the soft glow of moonlight, to collect the bodies of birds and small mammals that had fallen prey to the nocturnal hunters. He would meticulously preserve their forms, creating lifelike sculptures that seemed to stir with life in his hands.

One fateful evening, a young woman named Lida stumbled upon Urmas' cottage while searching for shelter from a fierce storm. She was drawn in by the scent of wood smoke and baking bread, which wafted out of the chimney like a warm hug. As she knocked on the door, Urmas answered, his eyes twinkling with curiosity.

Lida was taken aback by the sight before her - rows upon rows of glassy-eyed animals, each one uniquely posed and expressive. She felt as though she had stumbled into a fantastical dream world, where the creatures of the forest came to life in death. Urmas smiled knowingly, recognizing the wonder that shone within Lida's eyes.

As the storm raged outside, Lida found herself entranced by Urmas' art. She watched, mesmerized, as he carefully restored a wounded sparrow to its former glory, coaxing forth a hint of color from its once-pale feathers. And when the night drew to a close, and the moon had dipped below the horizon, Lida knew that she would never forget this chance encounter with Urmas Altmann - the master taxidermist, guardian of secrets, and weaver of enchantments.

From that day on, whenever the wind rustled through the trees, carrying the whispers of the forest's ancient wisdom, Lida felt a presence watching over her from the shadows. And if she closed her eyes, she could almost swear that Urmas' glassy-eyed companions were smiling at her, their expressions as warm and inviting as the crackling fire in his hearth.
