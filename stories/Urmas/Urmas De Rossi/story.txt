It wasn't until he stumbled upon a local music venue while attending university that Urmas discovered another passion - the art of soundscaping. Entranced by the eclectic mix of genres playing on stage, he found himself experimenting with creating his own electronic beats and melodies.

Urmas's talents soon caught the attention of the Tartu community, who were won over by his unique blend of visual and sonic creativity. He began to showcase his work in local exhibitions, earning critical acclaim for his innovative style.
