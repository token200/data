Urmas Kabylbekova was not your average Baltic fashionista. While her friends spent their summer evenings sipping berries and dancing under the Northern Lights, she had a different passion - extreme ironing.

Urmas, or Uma as she liked to be called, had always been fascinated by the unusual and the unexplored. As a child, she would spend hours poring over travel brochures and dreaming of adventure. And when she landed an internship at the local extreme sports company, she knew that her life was about to take a dramatic turn.

As a member of the extreme ironing team, Uma's job was simple: take high-fashion brands' clothes to remote locations around Europe, set up an ironing board, and press garments while bungee jumping off cliffs or hiking through treacherous mountain ranges. It was a bizarre but exhilarating life, and one that she loved every minute of.

But Uma's true passion project was not extreme ironing itself, but the people who hired her for these jobs. She saw each client as an opportunity to learn something new and unexpected - about their lives, their passions, and their fears.

There was the wealthy entrepreneur who hired Uma for a gig in the Swiss Alps, only to reveal that he was secretly a poet writing his first collection of love sonnets. There was the young musician who asked Uma to iron his band's tour clothes while bungee jumping off a bridge, but turned out to be hiding a secret talent for painting masterpieces.

Uma's clients were just as fascinating as she was, and each new experience left her with a renewed sense of wonder and curiosity. And yet, despite the thrill of it all, Uma knew that there was one place she could never go - home.

The remote island in the Baltic where she grew up held secrets of its own, but Uma had long since lost touch with the past. Her phone and email were her lifeline to the world outside, and extreme ironing was her ticket to experiencing life in all its unpredictable beauty.

As she stood on a windswept mountaintop, iron board set up in front of her, the spray from the Baltic Sea hitting the steam rising off the fabric in time with the wind. Uma smiled - this was where she belonged.
