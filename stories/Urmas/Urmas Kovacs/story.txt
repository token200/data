Urmas Kovacs was a man of mystery, shrouded in secrecy and whispers. A former soldier, he had seen his fair share of battles and bloodshed, but that didn't prepare him for what lay ahead. After leaving the military, Urmas settled in the small town of Rannu, Estonia, where he worked as a handyman and spent his days fixing broken fences and patching up worn-out buildings.

Despite his rugged exterior, Urmas had a soft spot for children and animals. He was particularly fond of his neighbor's stray dog, a scruffy terrier named Luna, who would follow him everywhere he went. At night, Urmas would sit on the porch, watching the stars twinkle above, feeling a sense of peace wash over him.

But Urmas' past wouldn't let him rest. He had seen things that no one should ever have to see â€“ the horrors of war, the tears of the innocent, and the futility of it all. The memories haunted him still, lingering like shadows in his mind. Sometimes, in the dead of night, he would wake up with a start, his heart racing, as if the ghosts of his past were closing in on him.

One day, a young girl named Lenna wandered into Rannu, fleeing a life of violence and abuse. Urmas took her under his wing, teaching her how to fix a bike or bake a pie from scratch. As she grew up, Lenna became like a daughter to Urmas, and he found himself taking on more responsibility as a guardian. But with each passing day, the weight of his secrets threatened to crush him.

Urmas Kovacs knew that he couldn't keep running forever. Eventually, he would have to face the demons head-on, or risk losing the people he cared about most. For now, though, he kept his secrets locked away, protecting Lenna and Luna from the darkness that lurked within.
