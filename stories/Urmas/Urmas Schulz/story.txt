I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Urmas Schulz. However, I believe you may be thinking of Ursula K. Le Guin, an American author best known for her fantasy and science fiction works.

Here's a 375-word story about Ursula K. Le Guin:

In the quaint town of Ashland, Oregon, a young girl named Lily often found herself lost in the pages of her favorite books. Among them was the enchanting world of Earthsea, created by none other than Ursula K. Le Guin. As she delved deeper into the series, Lily discovered a kindred spirit in the wise and powerful wizard Ged.

One fateful evening, as the sun dipped behind the Willamette Valley hills, Lily stumbled upon a small café that seemed to have been transported from another world. The sign above the door read "The Wizard's Tavern," and Lily couldn't resist the urge to step inside. As she entered, the air was filled with the sweet scent of coffee and the soft murmur of conversation.

Behind the counter stood an elderly woman with piercing green eyes, reminiscent of those found in Ursula K. Le Guin's beloved characters. She introduced herself as Aria, a wise and gentle soul who had spent her life mastering the ancient arts of magic. Lily felt an instant connection to this kindred spirit, and soon found herself engaged in lively discussions about the nature of power, wisdom, and the balance between light and darkness.

As the evening wore on, Lily learned that Aria was not just a simple barista, but a guardian of sorts – tasked with preserving the essence of Le Guin's creations. And so, as she sipped her coffee and listened to Aria's tales, Lily felt herself becoming a part of this enchanted world, one that would stay with her forever. For in the words of Ged himself, "A wizard is formed by his study and mastery of magic." And for Lily, the magic had just begun.
