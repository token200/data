Urmas Dan was a former Estonian special forces operative who had seen his fair share of battles. He had fought in the Soviet-Afghan War, the Baltic States' independence wars, and even participated in a few covert operations for the CIA.

After retiring from the military, Urmas returned to Tallinn, where he struggled to find work due to his troubled past. His skills as a sniper and hand-to-hand combatant were still unmatched, but no one was willing to take a chance on someone with his reputation.

One day, while drinking at a local bar, Urmas overheard a group of men talking about a high-stakes heist planned for the following night. They were going to rob a highly secure facility deep in the Estonian countryside, and the pay was too good to pass up.

Urmas knew that this was an opportunity too good to resist. He approached the leader of the group, a burly man named Sergei, and offered his services. At first, Sergei refused, but Urmas's persistence eventually won him over.

As the night of the heist approached, Urmas trained with the rest of the team, honing their skills and studying the facility's security systems. They knew that this was going to be a tough job, but they were confident in their abilities.

The next night, under the cover of darkness, the team set out for the facility. Urmas took point, using his knowledge of the area and his combat training to navigate them through the woods undetected. As they approached the building, he signaled for the others to take position, readying himself for any potential threats.

The team breached the facility, moving swiftly and silently through the corridors. They made their way to the vault, where they worked together to crack the combination lock. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the door swung open, revealing a treasure trove of gold, jewels, and other valuable items.

Urmas couldn't help but feel a sense of pride as he gazed upon the loot. This was what he had been training for all these years â€“ the thrill of victory, the rush of adrenaline. But as they began to load up their bags with cash and treasures, Urmas knew that this wasn't just about personal gain.

This was about revenge. Revenge against the system that had rejected him time and time again. Revenge against the world that didn't value his skills or experience.
