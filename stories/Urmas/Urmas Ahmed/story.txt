Urmas Ahmed stepped off the train and onto the platform, gazing out at the bustling streets of London. The cold winter air hit him like a slap in the face, but he didn't flinch. A man from Glasgow, Scotland, he was no stranger to the chill.

As a former soldier turned private investigator, Urmas had seen his fair share of battles and bureaucratic red tape. But nothing could have prepared him for the mysterious phone call that brought him to this city.

A woman's voice on the other end, breathy and desperate, spoke only one name: "Urmas." He knew at once it was Aisha, a former colleague from the military. They had worked together in Bosnia during a particularly brutal conflict, and she had always been reliable - until she vanished six months ago.

The message had been cryptic: "Meet me at the station if you want to know what happened." Urmas had arrived early, expecting an empty platform and maybe even a prank call. But here he was, surrounded by strangers hurrying to catch their trains or grab a quick coffee before work.

A faint hum caught his attention - a small, silver phone on the ground, partially hidden beneath a trash can. Urmas picked it up, examining the screen for any signs of fingerprints or clues. Nothing out of the ordinary - just an old photo and a message from Aisha: "Look at the pictures."

He tucked the phone into his pocket, feeling an itch to get moving. Where was she now? And what did these pictures have to do with anything?

The streets were alive with people rushing about their daily business. Urmas spotted a small caf√© nearby and ducked inside for a cup of strong coffee. The aroma and warmth enveloped him as he scanned the room, searching for someone - anyone - who could provide some answers.

A young woman, scribbling in a notebook at a corner table, caught his eye. She looked up, startled, and smiled wistfully when their gazes met. "Lost something?" she asked, gesturing to the empty chair across from her.

Urmas took a sip of coffee before pulling out the photo on the silver phone. The image depicted Aisha standing next to two figures in uniform - one he recognized as a NATO officer, and another... someone else entirely. Someone with eyes that sent shivers down his spine.

The woman's smile turned sympathetic. "You're looking for answers, I take it?"
