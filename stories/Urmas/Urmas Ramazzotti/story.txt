As he entered adulthood, Urmas' fascination with the intersection of art and social commentary only deepened. He began creating murals on the walls of Tallinn's neglected buildings, using bold colors and provocative messages to challenge the status quo. His work quickly gained attention from locals and tourists alike, and soon, his tagline – "Raising Eyebrows in Estonia" – became synonymous with Urmas Ramazzotti.

One fateful evening, as Urmas was preparing for a new installation, he received an unexpected phone call from a prominent local gallery owner. She offered him a solo exhibition at her esteemed space, which would debut on the eve of Tallinn's annual art festival. Overwhelmed with excitement and nerves, Urmas accepted the offer.
