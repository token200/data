Harry Põld was a peculiar individual, known for his love of obscure folk tales and traditional Estonian music. As a child, he would spend hours listening to his grandmother's stories about the ancient legends of Estonia, and it was no surprise that Harry grew up to be fascinated by the supernatural.

As an adult, Harry became a folklorist, traveling throughout the country to collect rare tales and songs. He spent most of his days in dusty archives and cramped libraries, poring over yellowed manuscripts and searching for clues to unravel the mysteries of Estonia's rich cultural heritage.

Despite his scholarly demeanor, Harry had a quirky side that often surfaced at social gatherings. His friends would describe him as "ecstatic" when discussing the latest folklore he'd discovered, and they wouldn't be surprised if he burst into an impromptu rendition of traditional Estonian music at any moment.

One evening, while sipping coffee with fellow folklorists in a quaint café, Harry Põld regaled his companions with tales of the ancient "Vabakalik," a mystical forest creature said to roam the forests of northern Estonia. The room fell silent as Harry's eyes took on an otherworldly intensity, and he spoke of the Vabakalik as if it were a real entity that walked among them.

After finishing his tale, Harry's friends applauded, and one of them playfully accused him of having "a little too much Põld in his blood." The phrase stuck with Harry for years to come, and he often found himself chuckling at the notion of his Estonian heritage imbuing him with such an eccentric personality.

Years went by, and Harry continued to explore Estonia's rich cultural tapestry. He traveled to remote villages and danced to traditional folk tunes under the stars, always carrying a sense of wonder and curiosity about the world around him. His work as a folklorist earned him recognition throughout the academic community, but it was his infectious passion for Estonian folklore that had truly made Harry Põld a beloved figure in Estonia's cultural scene.

In later years, when asked to reflect on his life's work, Harry Põld would often smile wistfully and say, "I'm just glad I got to share the stories of my grandmother with the world. And besides, it's hard not to be a little bit like her, with all this folklore in your blood." His eyes would sparkle as he gazed into the distance, lost in thought about the mystical creatures that had captured his heart for so long.
