Harry Kortajarena stepped off the bus and onto the worn asphalt of the small town's main street. The fluorescent lights above the diner flickered to life as she pushed open the door, a bell above it letting out a tired clang. She slid into a booth in the back, her eyes scanning the diner with a practiced air.

It had been years since Harry Kortajarena left the city behind, trading in the bright lights and endless possibilities for the quiet rhythms of small-town life. Her parents had always been here, and after her parents' divorce, she'd come to live with them, seeking refuge from the chaos of her own life.

As she perused the menu, a young waitress with a messy bob and paint-stained apron approached her table. "What can I get for you?" she asked, eyeing Harry Kortajarena's worn leather jacket.

"Just coffee," Harry replied, her voice low and smooth. The waitress nodded and wandered off to take orders from the other patrons.

Harry sipped her coffee, watching as the diner came alive with the bustle of lunchtime. She'd always been a people watcher, fascinated by the stories that lay just beneath the surface of every face. It was a skill she'd honed in the city, where everyone seemed to be in such a rush they forgot to look.

As she waited for her coffee to arrive again, Harry Kortajarena's thoughts turned to her own story. She'd left behind a life full of promise and potential, chasing dreams that had ultimately led her down a dead-end road. It was a painful lesson, one she still carried with her, but it had also given her the strength to start anew.

The waitress returned with Harry Kortajarena's coffee, this time setting a plate in front of her â€“ a humble meal of eggs and toast, just as she'd ordered. As Harry took her first bite, a sense of peace settled over her, like the quiet contentment that came from knowing exactly where you belonged.
