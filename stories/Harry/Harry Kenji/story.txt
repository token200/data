Harry Kenji was a man of few words, but his actions spoke volumes. As a former soldier, he had seen his fair share of battles and had earned a reputation for being one of the bravest men in the army.

After leaving the military, Harry decided to use his skills to help those in need. He became a freelance security consultant, traveling the world to protect high-profile clients from threats both foreign and domestic.

One day, Harry received a call from a wealthy businessman who needed protection for an important meeting with a potential investor. Harry arrived at the meeting location, scanning the room for any signs of trouble before being introduced to the businessman's assistant.

As the meeting began, Harry couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. The assistant seemed nervous and fidgety, and Harry's instincts told him that they were hiding something. He discreetly kept an eye on the assistant throughout the meeting, watching as they glared at a group of rough-looking men who had been lingering outside.

As soon as the meeting concluded, Harry quickly escorted the businessman and his assistant to safety. Once outside, Harry made sure they were secure before turning to face the suspicious individuals.

"What's going on here?" Harry demanded, his eyes scanning the area for any signs of trouble.

The rough-looking men scurried away, but not before one of them handed Harry a small note with a single word scrawled on it: "Run."

Harry's gut told him that something was indeed wrong. He quickly radioed his team to gather more information about the situation and the identity of those who had threatened the businessman.

As he waited for news, Harry couldn't help but think back to his time in the military, when he had earned a reputation as one of the toughest men in the army. Little did he know that this was just the beginning of a new adventure, one that would test his skills and push him to his limits once again.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Harry Kenji vowed to see justice served, no matter what it took.
