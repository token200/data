Harry Muller was a man with a past shrouded in mystery. Born to a family of nomads, he had spent his early years traveling from place to place, never staying in one spot for too long. As he grew older, Harry began to feel the weight of his wanderlust, and he knew that it was time to settle down.

He found himself drawn to the bustling streets of New Orleans, where he met a young woman named Lena. She was kind-hearted and beautiful, with piercing green eyes that seemed to see right through him. Harry was smitten, but he struggled to open up to her. His past experiences had taught him to keep people at arm's length.

As they grew closer, Harry found himself falling deeper in love with Lena. He began to share his stories with her, telling her of the places he had been and the people he had met along the way. She listened with rapt attention, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.

One day, as they sat on a bench overlooking the Mississippi River, Harry pulled out an old map from his pocket. It was worn and creased, but it held a special place in his heart. He unfolded it, revealing the paths he had taken on his travels. Lena's eyes widened as she saw the places he had been.

"I've never been so far from home," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Harry smiled, feeling a sense of vulnerability wash over him. "I know what you mean," he replied. "But sometimes, it's okay to stay in one place for a while."

As they sat there, watching the sun set over the river, Harry knew that he had found something special with Lena. He was willing to put his past behind him and start anew, as long as she would be by his side.

"I'm glad I met you," Harry Muller said finally, turning to Lena with a smile.

She smiled back at him, her eyes shining with love. "I'm glad too, Harry."
