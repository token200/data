Harry Schafer sat alone in his small café, nursing a cup of cold coffee. It had been three days since the accident, and he was still trying to come to terms with what had happened. As he stared out the window, he couldn't help but think about his best friend, Emily, who had died alongside him.

Harry Schafer's mind wandered back to their college days, when they were inseparable. They had met in their freshman year and quickly became each other's rock. Harry Schafer remembered the time they pulled off an all-nighter to finish a group project, or the countless sleepovers they had shared in Harry Schafer's dorm room.

But now, everything felt different. The world seemed brighter without Emily by his side, yet darker at the same time. Harry Schafer couldn't shake off the feeling of guilt that lingered within him. Why hadn't he been more careful? What if he could have done something to prevent it?

As the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the café, Harry Schafer felt a sense of peace wash over him. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, letting go of the emotions that had been holding him back. He thought about all the good times he had shared with Emily, all the laughter they had exchanged, and all the memories they had created together.

Harry Schafer knew that he would never forget Emily, but he also knew that he couldn't let her death define him. He had to keep moving forward, for both his own sake and hers. With a newfound determination, Harry Schafer set his cup down and stood up, ready to face whatever the future held. As he walked out of the café, he felt a sense of hope that he hadn't felt in weeks – hope that he would find a way to heal, and to make Emily proud.

Harry Schafer took one last look at the café before turning to walk away, feeling a sense of peace and resolve wash over him. He knew that Emily was always with him, in spirit, guiding him through the tough times ahead.
