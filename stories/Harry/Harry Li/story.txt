Harry Li trudged through the rain-soaked streets, his eyes scanning the crowded sidewalks for any sign of life. It had been three years since he'd lost his best friend, Emma, in that fateful fire at the nightclub. The memories still lingered, like a bad omen, haunting him every step of the way.

As a private investigator, Harry's work was always tough, but lately, it seemed like the world was conspiring against him. Clients were scarce, and those he did get were often just another way to scrape together a meager living. But one case had caught his eye – a missing person's report from a young woman named Sarah.

Sarah's family was frantic with worry, and her social media profile was flooded with desperate messages from friends and acquaintances who'd all seemed to know her. Harry knew he had to take the case, not just for the money but because something about Sarah's story resonated with him.

As he arrived at Sarah's apartment complex, a sense of unease settled over him. The building looked dingy, like it hadn't been cleaned in months. He flashed his PI badge and asked to speak with the manager. A harried-looking woman emerged from her office, eyes red-rimmed from lack of sleep.

"Miss Li?" she said hesitantly. "I think I know who you're looking for. Sarah...she's been here before. She had a bit of trouble with some guys, and we had to ask her to leave."

Harry's gut tightened. Trouble with what kind of guys? He tucked his badge back into his pocket and followed the manager down to the laundry room. That's where he found a security camera that caught a glimpse of Sarah arguing with two rough-looking men.

One face looked eerily familiar – it was Marcus, a notorious local gang leader who'd been involved in several high-profile cases. Harry made a mental note to pay him a visit.

For now, though, his thoughts were on Sarah's family, whom he promised to keep informed every step of the way. He knew that this case could be just as tough, if not tougher, than Emma's – but with determination burning in his chest, he was ready to face whatever lay ahead.
