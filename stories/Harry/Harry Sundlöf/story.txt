Harry Sundlöf stepped off the train and onto the platform, the crisp morning air filling his lungs as he gazed out at the small town of Åttna in front of him. It was a place he had left behind many years ago, but had returned to now that he had received news of his mother's passing.

As Harry made his way through the quiet streets, he couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. This was where he had grown up, played with his friends, and explored the woods surrounding Åttna. He had thought he would never set foot in this place again, but here he was.

Harry's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of someone approaching behind him. He turned to see an elderly woman with a kind face walking towards him, a warm smile spreading across her features.

"Harry Sundlöf?" she asked, her voice gentle and curious. "I've been expecting you."

Harry nodded, feeling a sense of trepidation wash over him. Who was this woman, and how did she know his name?

"I'm Helga Svensson," she said, extending a hand for Harry to shake. "Your mother's friend. I've known her since we were children growing up in Åttna."

As they walked together through the streets, Helga told Harry about his mother's passing and the arrangements that had been made for her burial. Harry listened, numb and detached, unable to process the news.

Eventually, they arrived at the cemetery where Harry's mother would be laid to rest. He watched as Helga helped the mourners gather around the gravesite, saying a few words in Swedish about his mother's life and legacy. Harry listened intently, feeling a sense of peace wash over him for the first time since he had received the news.

As they stood together at the cemetery, Helga turned to Harry and placed a gentle hand on his shoulder. "I'm so sorry for your loss," she said softly. "But I know that your mother would want you to be here, surrounded by our community and the love of those who cared for her."
