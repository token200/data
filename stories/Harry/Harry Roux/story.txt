Harry Roux stood in front of the old, dusty mirror in his small studio apartment, smoothing out his faded denim jacket. He took a deep breath, preparing himself for another long night of searching for clues that might lead him closer to solving the mystery of his brother's disappearance.

As he began to rummage through his notes and research papers, Harry's mind wandered back to when it all started. His full name was Harrison Reginald Roux, but only a handful of people called him that anymore. Most had shortened it to Harry, and he'd grown accustomed to the simplicity.

Harrison's brother, Lucas, had vanished three years ago, leaving behind a trail of unanswered questions and a shattered family. The police had given up on the case, labeling it a cold one, but Harrison was determined to find out what happened to him.

He poured himself a glass of whiskey from the bottle on his desk and began to read through Lucas's last known journal entries. The handwriting was messy and emotional, revealing a man struggling with anxiety and paranoia.

As he delved deeper into the pages, Harry noticed something peculiar – a mention of an anonymous source claiming to have information about Lucas's disappearance. A spark of hope ignited within him; this could be the break they needed.

With newfound energy, Harry leapt out of his chair and began frantically searching through old contacts and phone numbers. His mind was racing with possibilities as he finally found the number of a former acquaintance who might know something.

As the night wore on, Harry's exhaustion began to take its toll. The whiskey had taken its effect, and his thoughts grew cloudy. He slumped back into his chair, staring blankly at the mirror, where Harrison's reflection stared back – weathered, worn, but still hopeful.

The morning sunlight streaming through the window slowly illuminated Harry's determination, illuminating a renewed commitment to finding answers. And so, with a weary smile, he raised a glass in a silent toast to his brother, Lucas, and the promise of another day closer to uncovering the truth.
