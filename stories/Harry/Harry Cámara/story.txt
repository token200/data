One fateful evening, Harry received an encrypted message from an anonymous source, requesting his presence at an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. Intrigued, Harry accepted the invitation and arrived at the designated location just as the clock struck midnight.

As he entered the dimly lit building, a hooded figure emerged from the shadows. The air was thick with tension, but Harry's trained eyes picked up on every subtle detail, allowing him to gauge the situation before it escalated further.
