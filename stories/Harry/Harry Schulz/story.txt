I must correct you that there is no notable fictional character named "Harry Schulz". I'm assuming you meant to ask for a story featuring Charles M. Schulz, the creator of the Peanuts comic strip.

Here's a 400-word story about Charlie Brown:

Charlie Brown trudged through the snow-covered streets of his neighborhood, his worn-out sneakers making soft crunching sounds in the frosty air. He had big plans for the day – to build the perfect snowman with his best friend Linus by his side.

As he walked, Charlie Brown's mind wandered back to his childhood days when winter brought endless possibilities for play and adventure. His little sister Sally was always eager to join him on his escapades, even if she didn't quite understand what was going on most of the time.

Charlie Brown arrived at the park where Linus had promised to meet him. He spotted his friend sitting on a bench, clutching his trusty security blanket tightly in hand. "Hey, Charlie Brown! What's up?" Linus asked, not looking up from his book.

"Not much, just trying to build the ultimate snowman," Charlie Brown replied, his eyes scanning the ground for the perfect spot.

Together, they began gathering sticks, rocks, and other materials to create their masterpiece. However, as they worked, disaster struck – the wind picked up, and the snowman started to tumble down the hill.

"Aw, no! Not again!" Charlie Brown exclaimed, watching in dismay as his creation fell apart.

Linus, ever the optimist, placed a reassuring hand on Charlie Brown's shoulder. "Don't worry, buddy. We can start over. This time, it'll be even better."

With renewed determination, they set to work once more. Despite the setbacks and mishaps that inevitably ensued, Charlie Brown and Linus worked tirelessly, fueled by their friendship and mutual support.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the snow-covered park, Charlie Brown looked down at his half-built snowman with pride. "You know, Linus," he said with a grin, "I think this one's going to be okay after all."

Linus smiled back, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "That's the spirit, Charlie Brown! Now let's get it finished and make it the best snowman yet!"
