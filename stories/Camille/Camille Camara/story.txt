Born and raised in the vibrant city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Cami grew up surrounded by the rich cultural heritage of her native land. Her full name, Camille Maria Camara, reflected the blend of Portuguese, African, and indigenous influences that made up her identity.

As a child, Cami spent hours exploring the colorful streets of Copacabana and Ipanema, sketchbook in hand, observing the intricate patterns and textures of the city's architecture.
