Camille Laine stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the cool mist of the Atlantic air enveloping her like a shroud. She had been away for years, but the familiar sights and smells brought it all back - the salt-sprayed walls, the smell of diesel fuel from the trains that chugged along the coast, the sound of seagulls wheeling overhead.

Camille's eyes scanned the station, taking in the mix of old and new. The faded signs creaked in the breeze, while modern advertisements plastered on the windows seemed to shout for attention. She spotted her friend, Jacques, standing by the ticket counter, his worn denim jacket a testament to years of hard work.

"Camille!" he exclaimed, sweeping her into a bear hug. "It's been ages!"

They spent the afternoon catching up over coffee and reminiscing about old times. Camille had come back to the coastal town where she grew up, seeking solace from the chaos of city life. She'd always felt a deep connection to this place, where the sea air seemed to clear her mind and soothe her soul.

As they walked along the beach, the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the waves. Camille closed her eyes, feeling the salty spray on her face and listening to the rhythmic pulse of the ocean. It was like she'd never left.

But life had other plans. A job at a local gallery beckoned, one that required her to confront the painful memories she'd been trying to outrun. As she gazed out at the waves, she saw the reflection of her own fractured self - broken and battered, yet still strong enough to weather the storm.

Camille took a deep breath, feeling the familiar ache in her chest begin to ease. She knew it wouldn't be easy, but this place had always held a power over her, one that could heal and transform even the most broken of hearts. As the stars began to twinkle overhead, she smiled to herself, knowing that this was where she belonged.

"You know," Jacques said, as they sat on a bench watching the world go by, "some people come back to places, but others just return."

Camille nodded, her eyes fixed on the sea. "I think I've always been one of those who returns."
