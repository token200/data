One stormy night, Camille received a cryptic message from an anonymous source claiming to have information on a high-stakes corruption scandal involving some of the city's most influential politicians. Intrigued, she set out to meet with her informant, who agreed to meet at a dingy alleyway pub on the outskirts of town.

As Camille entered the dimly lit pub, she spotted her source huddled in the corner, nursing a whiskey. She approached cautiously, her journalist's instincts on high alert.
