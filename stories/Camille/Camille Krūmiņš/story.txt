Camille Krūmiņš stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of familiarity. She had been traveling for days, trying to escape the memories that haunted her, but so far, she'd found nothing but a endless stretch of unfamiliar faces and places.

As she made her way through the crowd, Camille's thoughts turned to her family back in Riga, Latvia. Her parents, Janis and Laima Krūmiņš, had always been supportive of her wanderlust, encouraging her to explore the world beyond their small town. But now, with her grandmother's passing, Camille felt lost and alone.

She made her way through the station, finally spotting a familiar face - her friend, Anna. "Camille!" Anna exclaimed, embracing her tightly. "I was starting to think you'd forgotten about me!"

Camille smiled, feeling a small sense of comfort wash over her. She had been living in Berlin for several months now, trying to build a new life for herself after the devastating loss of her grandmother. But it wasn't easy. The memories of her grandmother's warm smile and gentle touch still lingered, and Camille often found herself wandering the streets, searching for solace.

Anna led Camille out of the station and onto the vibrant streets of Kreuzberg. They spent the afternoon browsing art galleries and sampling street food, laughing and chatting like old times. For a few hours, Camille forgot about her troubles and allowed herself to simply enjoy the moment.

As the sun began to set, Anna suggested they grab dinner at a local restaurant. Over plates of hearty German meat dishes, Camille found herself opening up to Anna about her grandmother's passing. Anna listened attentively, offering words of comfort and support that Camille desperately needed.

As they finished their meal and prepared to part ways, Anna turned to Camille and said, "You know, you're not alone in this, Camille Krūmiņš. We're all here for you." Camille smiled, feeling a sense of gratitude towards her friend. Maybe, just maybe, she was starting to find her way again.
