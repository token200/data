One day, Inka received a tip about a mysterious art gallery hidden deep in the heart of the city. The rumor was that the gallery's owner, a reclusive artist named Marcel, possessed a collection of rare and priceless works. Intrigued, Inka set out to investigate further.

As she arrived at the gallery, Inka noticed an air of secrecy surrounding the building. The walls were shrouded in darkness, and only a single flickering light illuminated the entrance. Without hesitation, Inka pushed open the door and stepped inside.

The interior of the gallery was just as enigmatic as its exterior. Towering sculptures seemed to defy gravity, while strange symbols etched into the walls pulsed with an otherworldly energy.
