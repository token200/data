Inka López Rodríguez was known for her fierce determination and unwavering passion. As a young girl, she had grown up in a small town surrounded by the vibrant colors and sounds of the Latin American festival scene. Her abuela, Abuela Rosa, would often take her to the streets, where they'd dance to the rhythm of salsa music and taste the sweet flavors of traditional treats.
