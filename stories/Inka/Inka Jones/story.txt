Her bandmates nodded in agreement, and they spent the rest of the night brainstorming ideas for their next project. As they talked, Inka couldn't help but think about how far she'd come since her early days playing small gigs at her parents' record store. It was a long way from where she started, but she knew it was only the beginning.
