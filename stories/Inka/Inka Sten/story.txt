Inka Sten was a woman on a mission. Her long, dark hair was tied back in a tight ponytail, and her piercing green eyes seemed to bore into those she met. She was a private investigator with a reputation for being one of the best in the business.

As she stepped out of the rain-soaked streets of Stockholm, Inka lit a cigarette and leaned against the wall of her office building. It was going to be a long night.

The phone on her desk jolted her awake from her reverie. "Inka Sten Investigations," she answered curtly.

"Miss Sten, I need your help," said the voice on the other end of the line. Inka recognized the tone as that of her old colleague and friend, Henrik.

"What's going on?" she asked, flicking her cigarette into the gutter.

"My sister has gone missing," Henrik replied, his voice trembling. "She was working a case for a wealthy client, and now she's vanished."

Inka sighed inwardly. She had always said no to cases involving the high-rollers, but something about this sounded off. "Tell me more," she said, grabbing her coat.

The details were sketchy at first – the missing woman's name was Lena, and she'd been last seen at a luxurious mansion on the outskirts of town. But as Inka listened, Henrik began to fill in the gaps. The wealthy client had connections to some very shady characters.

Inka made up her mind. She was going to take this case. As she stepped into the rain-soaked night, she knew that she was in for a fight.

The mansion loomed before her, its stone façade seeming to whisper secrets on the wind. Inka flashed her ID and strode past the security guards. She had a feeling that she wasn't going to be welcomed with open arms.

Stepping inside, she found herself in a world of opulence – crystal chandeliers, velvet drapes, and enough gold to make her eyes water. But beneath the glitz and glamour, Inka sensed something darker – something that threatened to consume them all.

She began to dig, following a trail of cryptic clues that led her deeper into the heart of the mansion. It was going to be a long night indeed, but Inka Sten was ready for whatever lay ahead.
