Growing up in a small town surrounded by corruption and deceit, Inka had always been driven to shine a light on the darker corners of society.

As she began her career as a reporter, Inka's determination only grew stronger. She spent countless hours researching and investigating, pouring over documents and conducting interviews until she had pieced together a puzzle that few others could see.
