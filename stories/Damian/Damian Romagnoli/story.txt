Damian Romagnoli adjusted his tie for what felt like the hundredth time, his eyes scanning the crowded room with a mix of disdain and calculation. He was used to being in control, always knowing exactly where he stood in any given situation.

As he sipped his scotch, he watched his business partner, Alex, make small talk with a group of potential clients. Damian's mind wandered back to their last meeting, the one where they'd landed the Johnson account. It was a big deal, and Damian knew that Alex had played it cool, letting him do most of the talking.

He felt a pang of annoyance at the thought, but pushed it aside. After all, someone had to be the face of the company, and it might as well be Alex's charismatic, people-person personality.

As the night wore on, Damian began to feel restless. He excused himself and stepped outside into the cool night air, taking a deep breath before returning to the party. The sounds of laughter and music seemed to fade away, replaced by the hum of the city.

He walked down a side street, his heels clicking on the pavement. He was known for his ruthless tactics in business, but few people knew that he was just as cunning when it came to personal relationships. Damian's eyes scanned the crowds, searching for someone – anyone – who could match wits with him.

That's when he saw her: a striking woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She stood out in the sea of suits and ties, exuding an air of confidence that caught Damian's attention.

For a moment, they locked gazes, and Damian felt a spark of recognition. It was as if she could see right through him, to the layers beneath his polished exterior.

Without hesitation, Damian approached her, his charm and charisma on high alert. "Mind if I join you?" he asked, flashing a disarming smile.

The woman smiled back, her eyes never leaving his face. "Not at all," she said, her voice husky and confident.

As they talked, Damian felt himself drawn in, like a moth to a flame. He was intrigued by this enigmatic stranger, who seemed to be just as intelligent and calculating as he was.

For the first time in years, Damian felt like he was being truly seen – and it both thrilled and unsettled him.
