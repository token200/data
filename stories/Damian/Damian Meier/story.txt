Damian Meier stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. The small town of Ravenswood was never bustling with life, but that suited him just fine. He preferred the quiet, the solitude.

As a private investigator, Damian had seen his fair share of desperation and despair. But in Ravenswood, people came to him out of habit, not necessity. It was a place where everyone knew each other's business, and Damian was content with being an outsider.

He checked his watch; he had an hour before his meeting with the client. The old diner on Main Street was where they would meet, over a cup of coffee and a plate of hash browns.

Inside, the diner was dimly lit, the air thick with the smell of grease and stale coffee. Damian spotted his client, Mrs. Jenkins, sitting in the corner, her eyes fixed on him as he slid into the booth across from her.

"You're late," she said, her voice crisp and unforgiving.

Damian flashed a smile. "Sorry, ma'am. Traffic."

Mrs. Jenkins raised an eyebrow. "I see. Well, let's get down to business. My daughter has gone missing, and I need you to find her."

Damian nodded, taking out his notebook. He scribbled some notes, then asked the questions that needed answering: where had Mrs. Jenkins' daughter last been seen, what was her relationship like with her family, and any other details that might be relevant.

As he listened to Mrs. Jenkins' story, Damian's mind began to weave together the threads of a puzzle. There were inconsistencies in her alibis, a lack of witnesses who could vouch for her whereabouts on the night her daughter disappeared. It was going to take some digging, but Damian was confident he could unravel the truth.

As they finished their coffee, Mrs. Jenkins leaned forward, her eyes locked on his. "I'll pay top dollar if you can find my daughter."

Damian smiled again, this time with a hint of determination. "I'll get started right away, ma'am. Don't worry â€“ I'll leave no stone unturned."
