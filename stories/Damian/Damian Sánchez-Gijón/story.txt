Damian Sánchez-Gijón, or "El Ingeniero" as he was affectionately known among his friends and acquaintances, sat at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of blueprints in front of him. As a brilliant engineer, he had always been fascinated by the intricacies of machine design and construction. But tonight, he was struggling to make sense of the complex system in front of him.

El Ingeniero's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of his wife, María, calling out from the kitchen. "Damian, dinner is ready! Come and eat!" The aroma of slow-cooked paella wafted through the air, tantalizing his senses and making his stomach growl with hunger.

After a quick wash and changing into clean clothes, El Ingeniero made his way to the kitchen. María greeted him with a warm smile and a plate piled high with steaming hot paella. He sat down at the table, taking a moment to appreciate the beauty of the dish before him. As he began to eat, he couldn't help but think about how much María had changed his life.

They had met five years ago, when El Ingeniero was working on a project in Madrid. She was a freelance writer, researching her novel about the history of Gijón, a small coastal town in Asturias where El Ingeniero's family had grown up. The two had hit it off immediately, bonding over their shared love of food, music, and engineering.

Since then, María had been El Ingeniero's rock, supporting him through thick and thin as he worked on his projects. She was the one who kept him grounded, reminding him that there was more to life than just machines and blueprints.

As they finished dinner and began to clear the table, El Ingeniero reached out and took María's hand in his own. "Gracias por ser mi vida, María," he said, his voice filled with emotion. "Without you, I wouldn't know how to be a better engineer or a better person."

María smiled, her eyes shining with tears. "I couldn't agree more, Damian. You're not only my husband, but my best friend and partner in every sense of the word." The two sat together for a moment, hands entwined, lost in thought as they gazed out at the stars twinkling above.

In that moment, El Ingeniero knew he had found his true purpose – to build machines that made people's lives better, but more importantly, to build a life with María by his side.
