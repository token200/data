Damian Schneider stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station. He was a man on a mission, and that mission was to find answers.

A former detective, Damian had left the force five years ago after a particularly brutal case had left him shaken. The memory of the victims' faces haunted him still. But it was a phone call from an old acquaintance, a cryptic message that had set him on this journey.

"Meet me at the old warehouse on 5th and Main," the voice had said. "I have information about your past."

Damian's instincts told him to ignore it, but something about the tone of the voice lingered in his mind. He couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to this message than met the eye.

He made his way through the crowded station, weaving past pedestrians and briefcases. The sun beat down on him, casting long shadows across the pavement.

The warehouse loomed before him, a crumbling structure with boarded-up windows. Damian's heart quickened as he approached the entrance. Who was behind this message? What did they want?

He pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside. A figure emerged from the shadows, its features obscured by a hoodie.

"Damian Schneider," the voice said, low and gravelly. "I've been expecting you."

The man pulled back his hood, revealing a face Damian recognized - a former partner, one who had walked away from the force just as suddenly as he had.

"What do you know?" Damian asked, his eyes narrowing.

"We both know that night," the man replied, his voice dripping with venom. "We both know what really happened to those kids."

Damian's mind reeled as the memories came flooding back. The case he thought he'd closed still lingered in his mind, a festering wound. But this...this was different.

The partner handed him a folder filled with documents and photographs. Damian opened it, scanning the pages with growing urgency.

It was all there - the truth about the night, about the real perpetrators, and about his own role in it all.

He looked up at his former partner, anger simmering beneath the surface. "Why now?" he asked.

The man just smiled, a cold, calculated smile. "Because I think you're ready to face the truth, Damian. And because someone else needs your help."

With that, the man turned and walked away, leaving Damian standing alone in the warehouse, the folder clutched tightly in his hand. The answers were finally within reach - but at what cost?
