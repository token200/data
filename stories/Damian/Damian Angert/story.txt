Damian Angert stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his piercing green eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a skilled mercenary, he had seen his fair share of battles and narrow escapes, but this particular mission had him on edge.

He spotted a hooded figure sitting in the corner, sipping a mug of ale. Damian recognized the symbol embroidered on their cloak as belonging to the infamous Black Vipers gang. He approached cautiously, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword.

"Can I help you?" the figure asked, voice low and gravelly.

"I'm looking for information," Damian replied, taking a seat across from them. "Rumors say the Black Vipers are involved in a lucrative smuggling operation."

The hooded figure raised an eyebrow. "What business do you have with us?"

Damian smiled wryly. "Let's just say I'm looking to expand my... services. And your organization seems like a viable option."

The figure nodded, signaling one of their own to bring over a smaller ale. "I am Arachne, by the way," they said.

"Damian Angert," he replied, extending a hand.

Arachne's grip was firm. "We've heard a lot about you, Damian Angert. Your... reputation precedes you."

The air in the tavern seemed to thicken as the two negotiated. Damian knew that getting involved with the Black Vipers would put him at risk, but the promise of wealth and power was too enticing to resist.

After several tense moments, Arachne leaned forward. "We'll give you a choice: join us, or walk out now while we're still generous."

Damian hesitated, weighing his options. He knew that joining the Black Vipers would require him to abandon many of his former alliances and values. But the potential reward was too great to ignore.

"I'll take your offer," he said finally, extending his hand in a gesture of solidarity.

Arachne smiled, her face still hidden behind the hood. "Welcome to the family, Damian Angert."
