Māris Karlsson stepped out of his small flat in the outskirts of Tallinn, Estonia. He took a deep breath of the crisp morning air and gazed out at the frozen lake where he spent most of his days ice fishing with his grandfather.

Māris was a young boy with messy brown hair and bright blue eyes that sparkled like the stars on a clear night. His grandfather, Jaan, had taught him everything he knew about fishing – from how to cast a line without a splash to how to clean a pike's scales for the perfect tartare.

But Māris' life was not just about fishing. As one of the few children in his village who could read and write, he was always eager to learn more. He devoured books by Estonian authors like Andrus Kivirähk and Kristjan Ellits. His favorite subject was history, which made sense given their small nation's complicated past.

Jaan, a veteran of World War II, had stories to tell that left Māris' eyes wide with wonder. Of the brave men who fought for Estonia's independence, of the war-torn years when bombs rained from the skies and food was scarce – all these tales sparked something within him. He dreamed one day of becoming a historian himself, uncovering the secrets of his nation's past.

Today was no exception. As he made his way to the frozen lake, Māris had a sense that today would be special. He set up his rod and baited his line, then sat down beside Jaan on their favorite bench. Together they sat in silence, waiting for a bite.

After what felt like hours, Jaan finally spoke up, his voice full of excitement. "Māris, look!" he pointed to the ice. A large pike had broken through the surface, its scales glinting in the morning sun. Māris whooped with joy and quickly reeled it in.

As they prepared the fish for lunch, Jaan smiled at his grandson. "You're getting good, just like me," he said proudly. Māris beamed with pride. He knew that one day he would continue to explore Estonia's history and share its stories with the world.
