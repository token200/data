Māris Patel stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. The dim fluorescent lights overhead cast an unforgiving glare on the rows of empty benches, each one telling a story of its own. As he made his way through the silence, Māris felt like a ghost haunting his own past.

He had left India two years ago, fleeing the memories that lingered in every corner of Mumbai. The smell of street food wafting from vendor stalls, the sound of horns honking on chaotic roads, and the vibrant colors of the city's eclectic markets – it all overwhelmed him, making it hard to breathe. Māris needed a change.

The station master, an old man with a kind face, greeted him warmly. "Welcome back, Māris! It's been too long."

Māris smiled wistfully and replied, "It's not goodbye, is it?"

The old man chuckled knowingly. "Never say never, my friend."

As he collected his luggage from the storage room, Māris couldn't help but think of the life he left behind. His parents had passed away during a trip to India when he was a teenager; after their death, he'd felt lost and without direction.

The memories came flooding back as he walked towards his old family home in the suburbs. The same gate swung open with a creaky sigh, just like it did all those years ago. He stepped inside, calling out to the ghosts of his past: "I'm home."

Māris had come back to rediscover himself and the India that once captivated him. But as he entered the familiar rooms of his childhood home, now painted with a softer glow by age, Māris realized that some scars remained unhealed.

As he wandered through the silent halls, memories crept into focus: his grandfather's tales of Indian mythology, the night his mother sang for him in front of the moonlit window... The room began to warm up under his touch, like old wooden floors polished by years of love and care.

For a moment, Māris forgot about his doubts and anxieties. He was back in Mumbai, not just with his eyes but with his heart as well. This time, though, he wasn't running away; this time, he'd found the courage to face what had been hiding beneath the surface all along.

The memories of home swirled around him like a gentle breeze on a summer day, and Māris smiled once more. "I'm back," he said aloud, almost whispering it into existence.
