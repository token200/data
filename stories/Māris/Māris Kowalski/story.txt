Māris Kowalski was a former professional boxer from Riga, Latvia. Growing up in a working-class family, he learned to fight at a young age on the streets of the old town. His parents owned a small bakery, but Māris's talent and tenacity earned him more recognition than his family ever could.

As a teenager, Māris won local amateur championships, eventually earning himself a spot in the national team. After serving two years in the Latvian military, he decided to pursue a professional career. In 2008, at the age of 22, Māris signed with Top Rank Promotions and began his journey into the world of boxing.

Māris's early career was marked by gritty victories over tough opponents. He earned the nickname "The Baltic Brawler" for his relentless pressure and uncanny ability to wear down his foes. In 2012, he won the IBF Inter-Continental heavyweight title, taking on the best of Europe in front of sold-out crowds at the Riga Sports Hall.

Over the next few years, Māris continued to build momentum, defeating top contenders like Alexei Oleinik and Mariusz Michalak. In 2016, he faced off against Ukraine's Vasyl Lomachenko for the WBO world title. Although he ultimately lost by a narrow decision, Māris earned widespread respect from fans and pundits alike.

Despite his success in the ring, Māris struggled with the physical toll of boxing. He suffered multiple concussions and wore down due to the constant punishment he took on his body. In 2019, at the age of 35, he announced his retirement from professional boxing, citing concerns for his long-term health.

After retiring, Māris returned to Riga, where he now runs a successful bakery with his parents. The shop, "Kowalski's Krumpe," has become a beloved institution in the city, serving up traditional Latvian pastries and sandwiches alongside memories of Māris's illustrious boxing career.

When asked about his life after boxing, Māris smiled wistfully, saying, "I may not be able to throw punches anymore, but I can still feed people. That's what truly matters." The nickname "Baltic Brawler" now hangs proudly on the wall of his bakery, a reminder of the tough, unyielding fighter he once was – and the new chapter in his life that has brought him even more joy and fulfillment.
