One fateful day, a powerful sorcerer named Kōwa threatened to destroy the village of Kūkai with his dark magic. The villagers were paralyzed with fear, but not Māris Shu-fen. Summoning all her strength and courage, she rallied the bravest warriors of the land and led the charge against the sorcerer's army.
