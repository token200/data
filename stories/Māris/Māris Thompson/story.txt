Māris Thompson was an enigmatic figure, known only by his razor-sharp wit and his uncanny ability to unravel even the most complex puzzles. As a renowned detective in the city of New Haven, he had earned a reputation for being unflappable under pressure, always managing to uncover the truth behind the most baffling crimes.

One fateful evening, Māris received an urgent call from the police department, requesting his expertise on a particularly gruesome murder that had taken place in one of the city's upscale neighborhoods. As he arrived at the crime scene, he was greeted by a sea of police tape and anxious officers, all vying for his attention.

Māris surveyed the area, taking in every detail – the torn fabric caught in the broken glass, the smudged fingerprints on the wall, and the cryptic message scrawled on the victim's body. He lit a cigarette, puffing thoughtfully as he began to formulate his theory.

The killer, it seemed, was not just any ordinary murderer – but someone with an intimate connection to the victim. A closer examination of the crime scene revealed a small, almost imperceptible thread caught in the glass shards. It was a thread that Māris knew all too well – one he had seen before, in his own family's fabric.

Suddenly, memories began to flood back: his sister's wedding dress, with its delicate embroidery and minuscule threads that seemed to shimmer in the sunlight. It was then that Māris pieced together the evidence – his own sister had been missing for years, presumed dead by the police department. But what if she wasn't? What if she had faked her own disappearance?

Māris's eyes locked onto the officer standing guard beside the crime scene tape. He flashed a hint of recognition, before responding with a straightforward, matter-of-fact tone: "I think I can help you find your sister."

In that moment, the entire room seemed to lean in, as if the very fate of Māris Thompson's investigation – and perhaps his own life – hung precariously in the balance. With an unyielding determination etched on his face, he walked out into the night, ready to follow every thread to unravel the tangled web of truth that had ensnared him and his sister.
