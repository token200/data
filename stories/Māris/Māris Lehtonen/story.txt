Māris Lehtonen stepped out of the crowded pub, squinting into the Baltic night air. He took a deep breath, feeling the salty sea breeze fill his lungs as he gazed out at the docked ferries and cargo ships bobbing in the harbor.

A native son of Tartu, Estonia's second-largest city, Māris had spent years drifting between ports and shipping lanes, working on the cargo holds of cargo vessels. He'd seen it all - from grain shipments bound for Ukraine to oil tankers chugging through the North Sea.

But tonight was different. Tonight, he'd received a cryptic message from an old friend, beckoning him to join a secret expedition to the remote island of Hiiumaa. The promise was too enticing to resist: a treasure trove of rare minerals and valuable artifacts hidden deep within the island's limestone caverns.

Māris lit a cigarette and set off into the darkness, his eyes scanning the streets for any sign of trouble. Tartu wasn't exactly known for its warm hospitality, but Māris knew better than to take anything at face value. He'd learned to trust his instincts over the years, honed from years spent navigating treacherous waters and dodgy characters.

As he walked, the city gave way to open countryside, the outlines of ancient forests looming like sentinels in the darkness. The air was alive with the rustle of leaves and the hooting of owls, and Māris felt his pulse quicken with excitement.

Finally, after what felt like hours of walking, he spotted a glint of light through the trees. A small wooden cabin, partially hidden by the undergrowth, beckoned him forward. He knocked three times on the doorframe - a signal only an initiated friend would know - and was greeted by a pair of piercing blue eyes.

"Welcome, Māris," his friend growled. "I see you took my message seriously."

Māris smiled, a thrill coursing through his veins as he stepped into the cabin's warm, smoke-filled interior. This was going to be an adventure he'd never forget - or perhaps even survive.
