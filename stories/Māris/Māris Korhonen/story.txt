Māris Korhonen was a quiet and reserved individual who kept to himself in his small café on the outskirts of town. He had always been fascinated by the world of science fiction and spent most of his free time reading books and watching movies based on classic novels.

One day, as he was wiping down the counter, Māris Korhonen noticed a young girl sitting at a table by the window, staring intently at him. At first, he thought she was just another customer looking for a place to study, but as he glanced over at her again, he realized that she was actually watching him with an intense curiosity.

Māris Korhonen tried to ignore her, focusing on the coffee beans he needed to grind, but the girl's gaze kept drawing him in. He eventually found himself wondering what had caught her attention about him. Was it his passion for science fiction? His quiet demeanor?

Just as Māris Korhonen was starting to feel uncomfortable, the girl finally looked away and began to read a book on her phone. He let out a sigh of relief, thinking that he could go back to his usual routine.

But then, the girl looked up again and caught his eye. This time, she smiled slightly and said, "Hi, I'm Maja." Māris Korhonen was taken aback by her boldness, but he smiled back at her and introduced himself as Māris Korhonen.

As they chatted, Māris Korhonen discovered that Maja was a huge fan of science fiction novels. They spent the next hour talking about their favorite books and authors, and Māris Korhonen found himself opening up to her in ways he never thought possible.

For the first time in his life, Māris Korhonen felt like he had found someone who truly understood him. And as they parted ways, he couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement for what the future might hold. Maybe, just maybe, he would finally find the courage to share his love of science fiction with others.

As he locked up the café and headed home, Māris Korhonen couldn't help but smile at the thought of his new friend Maja. He knew that their friendship was still in its early stages, but he had a feeling that it would be one for the ages.
