---

In a world where memories could be transferred from one person to another, Māris Jing was a gifted memory thief. With his unique ability, he could extract and manipulate memories with precision.

Māris lived in the city of New Eden, where memories were currency. People traded them on the black market for wealth, power, and status. But Māris didn't want to be part of that world. He was driven by a sense of justice and wanted to use his skills to uncover hidden truths.

One night, Māris received an offer from a mysterious client who requested his services. The client claimed that they had information about a high-ranking official's corruption and offered to trade the memories for Māris' help. Intrigued, Māris accepted the job.

As he delved deeper into the memories, Māris discovered a web of deceit and corruption that went all the way to the top. He uncovered evidence of embezzlement, bribery, and even murder. The official's memories were filled with lies and half-truths, but Māris was able to peel back the layers and expose the truth.

With his newfound knowledge, Māris confronted the official and revealed the evidence he had gathered. The official was arrested, and the city of New Eden began to heal from its corruption.

Māris' reputation as a memory thief spread quickly, but this time it wasn't for stealing secrets. He was hailed as a hero who brought truth to light. From that day on, Māris used his powers for good, working with law enforcement agencies to uncover hidden truths and bring justice to those who had been wronged.

As he looked out over the city, Māris knew that he had found his true calling in life. He was no longer just a memory thief; he was a guardian of truth.
