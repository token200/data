Māris Moore had always been a bit of an outsider in his small town on the outskirts of Rotorua. Growing up, he was often mistaken for another kid from a nearby suburb, and he learned to carry himself with a quiet confidence that set him apart.

Despite this, Māris was a beloved member of the community. He had a way of making everyone feel seen and heard, and his kind heart earned him many friends over the years. After finishing school, Māris decided to pursue a career in social work, driven by a desire to make a positive impact on his community.

As he worked with at-risk youth, Māris discovered a natural talent for mediation and conflict resolution. His patience, empathy, and listening skills allowed him to connect with even the most troubled young people, helping them find their voice and navigate the challenges of growing up.

One day, a particularly difficult case landed on Māris' desk: 17-year-old Te Kahu, who had been expelled from school for fighting. Māris saw an opportunity to make a difference here – to show Te Kahu that there was another way forward than one marked by anger and aggression.

Over the next few weeks, Māris worked tirelessly with Te Kahu, helping him identify his strengths and passions, and finding ways to channel those into positive outlets. It wasn't easy – there were plenty of setbacks along the way – but slowly, incrementally, Te Kahu began to shift towards a brighter path.

As Māris watched Te Kahu transform before his eyes, he couldn't help but feel a sense of pride in his own work. He knew that this was what social work was all about: not just helping individuals, but also being part of the broader fabric of a community.

Years went by and Māris continued to make a name for himself in Rotorua as a dedicated and compassionate social worker. People began to look up to him with respect and admiration – not because he wore a suit or held some high title, but simply because he had the gift of listening and caring.

And when you asked him about his work, Māris Moore wouldn't hesitate to share stories of his triumphs, like that difficult case with Te Kahu. "You see," he'd say with a warm smile, "some days are harder than others, but when it all comes together...that's what makes it all worth it."
