One of Māris' most notable projects was a glass-roofed greenhouse in the heart of Riga, designed to provide a serene oasis for locals and tourists alike. The building's unique structure was crafted from locally-sourced materials, with large windows that allowed natural light to pour in, creating a lush atmosphere inside.
