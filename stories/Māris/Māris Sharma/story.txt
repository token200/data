Māris Sharma was an Indian poet and freedom fighter who lived in the early 20th century. Born on November 25, 1875, in the small town of Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh, India, he grew up surrounded by the rich cultural heritage of his region.

As a young man, Māris became increasingly involved in the Indian independence movement, inspired by the likes of Mahatma Gandhi and Bhagat Singh. He attended secret meetings, participated in underground protests, and wrote poetry that reflected his passion for freedom.

Māris's poetry was characterized by its raw emotion, vivid imagery, and unflinching critique of social injustices. His works often dealt with themes of love, loss, and the struggle against oppression. His most famous poem, "Saudagar Ki Kahani" (The Story of the Shopkeeper), told the tale of a shopkeeper who sold his soul to the British colonial powers, highlighting the darker aspects of India's history.

Despite facing persecution and arrest by the British authorities, Māris continued to write and speak out against injustice. In 1917, he was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment for participating in a plot to assassinate a British official. While in prison, Māris penned some of his most powerful works, including "Martyr ki Raag" (The Martyr's Melody), which became an anthem for the Indian independence movement.

After serving over two decades in prison, Māris was released and went on to become a prominent figure in India's literary scene. He published several collections of poetry and was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, India's second-highest civilian honor, for his contributions to literature.

Māris Sharma passed away on October 16, 1947, but his legacy lives on through his poetry and the countless lives he touched with his words. His work continues to inspire new generations of writers, activists, and freedom fighters, serving as a reminder of the power of art to shape history and spark social change.

Today, Māris is remembered as a hero of India's struggle for independence and a poet who used his voice to speak truth to power. His poetry remains a testament to the human spirit's capacity for resilience, hope, and resistance in the face of adversity.
