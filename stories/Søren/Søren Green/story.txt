Søren Green was a man with an impossible past. His eyes were a piercing blue, and his hair was as black as the night sky. He had grown up on the streets of Copenhagen, surviving by his wits and his fists. As a child, he had been forced to flee his home country after being wrongly accused of a crime he didn't commit.

Years went by, and Søren's reputation as a skilled fighter spread throughout the city. People whispered about the mysterious figure in black, who could take down anyone with ease. He worked as a bouncer at a local bar, where he spent his evenings patrolling the crowds and keeping the peace.

Despite his tough exterior, Søren had a soft spot for lost causes. He took on the job of protecting a young artist named Lily, who was being stalked by her ex-boyfriend. The man had become increasingly unstable, and Søren knew he couldn't let anything happen to Lily.

One stormy night, Søren received a call from his phone, alerting him that Lily's ex-boyfriend had breached the bar's security. With seconds to spare, Søren rushed outside to find himself face-to-face with the enraged man.

The fight was intense. Søren held off his opponent long enough for Lily to slip away unnoticed. When it was all over, he stood victorious but shaken. The stranger who had been chasing Lily finally fled, leaving her safe and sound in Søren's care.

Over a warm cup of coffee at the bar, Søren revealed himself to be no hero. He told Lily that his own life was shrouded in darkness, that he knew nothing about his parents or his true identity. His world had been torn apart by secrets and lies, leaving him with only one thing to hold onto: his fists.

As the night wore on, Søren found himself caught up in a web of trust. For the first time, someone was willing to take a chance on him, despite everything he'd put them through.
