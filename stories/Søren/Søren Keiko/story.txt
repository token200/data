One drizzly evening, Søren Keiko received a visit from his trusted informant, Yumi Nakahara. She arrived at his small office, her eyes brimming with concern.

Intrigued, Søren Keiko listened intently as Yumi recounted the details of the disappearance. The victim, Emiko Tanaka, had been last seen leaving a local nightclub in the Shibuya district. Her parents were beside themselves with worry, and the police were stumped.

Søren Keiko's eyes narrowed as he considered the evidence. He had a few contacts on the inside who might be able to shed some light on the case. "I'll look into it," he said finally, his voice low and decisive. "But I need your help, Yumi-san. Can you get me access to the club's security footage?"
