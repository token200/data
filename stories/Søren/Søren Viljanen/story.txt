Søren Viljanen sat alone in his dimly lit apartment, staring at the old photograph on his coffee table. It was a faded picture of himself and his late sister, Lisbet. She had passed away five years ago, and he still felt the weight of her absence.

Søren's eyes wandered to the worn bookshelf behind him, where his favorite authors sat in neat rows. He loved getting lost in their words, but lately, even that solace seemed hollow. The silence was oppressive, a constant reminder of everything he'd lost.

He sighed and rubbed his tired eyes, feeling like a ghost trapped between worlds. His sister had been his confidante, his partner in every sense. After her passing, Søren had withdrawn from the world, unable to bear the thought of living without her by his side.

As he stood up and shuffled over to the kitchen, he noticed the faint scent of cooking wafting through the air. It was a simple meal – leftover rice and boiled potatoes – but it filled him with a sense of comfort. He sat down at the small table and took a bite, savoring the familiar flavors.

The quiet of the evening began to seep into his bones, calming his restless mind. For the first time in weeks, he felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe it was the food, or maybe it was the worn photograph on his coffee table – but something about this moment felt different.

Søren's thoughts drifted back to Lisbet. He remembered the way she used to make him laugh with her silly jokes and impressions. He recalled their late-night conversations about life, love, and everything in between. The memories brought a smile to his face, and for a fleeting instant, he felt her presence around him.

He set down his spoon and took a deep breath, letting the stillness of the apartment settle within him. It was a fragile peace, but it was hers – his connection to Lisbet, to their shared history. Søren's eyes drifted back to the photograph, now filled with a soft light that seemed almost... reassuring.

As the darkness closed in around him once more, he felt a quiet understanding wash over him. The world still hurt without Lisbet, but for tonight, at least, it was not alone. In this moment of fragile peace, Søren Viljanen knew he could face whatever came next – as long as she would stay with him forever in his heart.
