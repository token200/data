Søren Wiśniewska was a talented young artist who had always been fascinated by the world of fantasy and mythology. Growing up in a small village on the outskirts of Warsaw, Poland, Søren spent most of his days exploring the rolling hills and forests that surrounded him, collecting leaves and stones for inspiration.

As he grew older, Søren's passion for art only intensified, and he began to study fine art at the local university. It was there that he met his mentor, Professor Kowalski, who recognized Søren's unique talent and encouraged him to pursue a career in illustration.

After completing his studies, Søren Wiśniewska set out into the world, determined to make a name for himself as an artist. He traveled to cities across Europe, taking in the sights and sounds of each place, and absorbing the history and culture that surrounded him.

Eventually, Søren's big break came when he was approached by a publishing company to illustrate a new book of Polish mythology.
