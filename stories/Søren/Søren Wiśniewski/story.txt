Søren Wiśniewski stood at the edge of the frozen lake, his eyes fixed on the glinting expanse of white before him. The Danish winter had settled over Copenhagen like a shroud, casting a somber mood over the city's inhabitants. Søren, however, felt alive, the cold air invigorating his senses.

As a journalist, he had grown accustomed to the darker corners of human nature. But it was on this lake, where his brother had gone missing five years ago, that the memories came flooding back. The feeling of helplessness, of being unable to protect the people he loved.

Søren's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of ice cracking beneath the skates of a passing figure. He turned to see his colleague, Emilie, lacing up her boots with an air of determination. "Ready for this?" she asked, eyeing Søren with a challenge.

Together, they set out onto the frozen lake, their footsteps echoing through the stillness. As they skated deeper into the woods, the trees seemed to close in around them, casting long shadows that stretched and twisted in the fading light. Søren felt a shiver run down his spine; this was where his brother had vanished.

The air grew colder with every passing moment, until it was almost unbearable. But Søren pushed on, driven by a mix of grief and determination. He knew that finding answers would be difficult – the police had given up long ago – but he couldn't shake the feeling that there was something out here, waiting for him.

As they skated towards the lake's edge, Emilie suddenly stopped, her eyes fixed on a faint trail of footprints in the snow. "Look," she whispered, her voice barely audible over the wind. Søren followed her gaze, and his heart skipped a beat as he saw the unmistakable shape of a ski pole buried in the drift.

With trembling hands, he pulled out his phone and snapped a photo. This was it – this was the moment they had been searching for. As they packed up their gear to head back to civilization, Søren couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched, that something else lurked just beneath the surface of the frozen lake.

He glanced at Emilie, her profile illuminated by the fading light, and felt a surge of gratitude towards this stranger who had joined him on his journey. Together, they would uncover the truth about his brother's disappearance, no matter what lay ahead. The ice creaked ominously beneath their feet, as if warning them to turn back – but Søren knew that he couldn't do that now.
