Marcelle Verdi stepped into the dimly lit studio, her eyes scanning the rows of easels that lined the walls. The air was thick with the scent of turpentine and oil paint, transporting her to a world she knew intimately. As a renowned portrait artist, Marcelle had spent her fair share of time in this very studio, coaxing life from her subjects onto canvas.

Today, however, she wasn't here for work. She'd received an invitation from her estranged sister, Colette, who lived on the other side of Paris. Colette had passed away a year ago, but Marcelle still felt the weight of their complicated past.

As she began to unpack her paints and brushes, a memory flashed before her eyes – Colette's bright smile and infectious laugh, which used to fill their family home with warmth. Their parents had been strict, pushing them toward careers in the art world, fueling a rivalry that only intensified as they grew older.

But now, Marcelle saw the studio for what it truly was – a sanctuary, where she could lose herself in color and light. She mixed a shade of blue on her palette, reminiscent of Colette's eyes, and began to block out the outline of her sister's portrait.

Hours passed, and Marcelle found herself absorbed in the work, the strokes of her brush blending together like the memories they brought to life. When she finally set down her paintbrush, the canvas was transformed – vibrant, full of character. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she stepped back, gazing upon Colette's likeness.

In that moment, Marcelle realized that she'd been carrying a burden for far too long. Her rivalry with Colette had blinded her to the love and connection they shared. She envisioned their mother, standing between them, like a barrier – one that had been lifted now.

Marcelle poured over her own sketches, searching for words to express what she felt. Tears streamed down her face as she scribbled a note, addressed to Colette's memory: "Forgiveness. It starts here."
