Marcelle Horváth stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him in the corner, nursing a cup of coffee and staring intently at his laptop screen. Marcelle Horváth took a seat next to him, trying not to disturb his concentration.

"Hey, Viktor," she said softly, breaking the silence.

Viktor looked up, a hint of surprise on his face. "Marcelle! I didn't know you were coming tonight."

"Just passing through, thought I'd drop by and see how things are going," Marcelle Horváth replied, taking a seat beside him.

The two had been inseparable since college, bonding over their shared love of art and music. Viktor was an aspiring photographer, and Marcelle Horváth was a budding writer, always scribbling away in her journal. Despite their differing passions, they found solace in each other's company.

As they chatted, Marcelle Horváth noticed that Viktor seemed... distant. His eyes were sunken, his skin pale. She reached out and gently touched his hand, trying to gauge the extent of his exhaustion.

"Hey, are you okay?" she asked softly.

Viktor sighed, running a hand through his hair. "Just been working non-stop for weeks. I'm starting to feel like I'll never catch up."

Marcelle Horváth nodded sympathetically. She knew how that felt – the weight of expectations, the pressure to create something worthy. But she also knew that sometimes, it was okay to take a step back and breathe.

"You need to prioritize your own work," she said firmly, her eyes locking onto his. "You can't pour from an empty cup, Viktor."

Viktor looked at her, gratitude etched on his face. For a moment, Marcelle Horváth thought she saw a glimmer of hope – that maybe, just maybe, he'd listen to her advice and take care of himself.

As they parted ways, Marcelle Horváth couldn't help but feel a sense of pride knowing she could still have such a profound impact on Viktor's life. And as she walked out into the chilly night air, she knew that their friendship – like her own creative endeavors – was worth fighting for.
