Marcelle Björkqvist had always been fascinated by the world of art. Growing up in a small town in Sweden, she spent most of her free time exploring the local museums and galleries, absorbing the vibrant colors and eclectic styles on display.

As she grew older, Marcelle's passion for art only intensified. She pursued a degree in fine arts, honing her skills as a painter and sculptor.
