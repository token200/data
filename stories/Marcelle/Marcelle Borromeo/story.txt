Born Marcelle Isabella Borromeo, the daughter of a wealthy industrialist, Marcelle had always been driven by a passion for science and innovation.

Over the next few weeks, Marcelle poured over Alexander's designs, offering suggestions and insights that helped refine the technology. As they worked together, Marcelle found herself drawn to Alexander's infectious enthusiasm and kind heart.
