Nele Nieminen sat alone in her small Helsinki apartment, staring out the window at the grey, rain-soaked streets. She was a poet, and the city's melancholy atmosphere seemed to seep into every word she wrote. Her latest collection, "Rainy Days and Forgotten Dreams", had just been published, but the reviews were lukewarm at best.

As she sipped her lukewarm coffee, Nele's mind wandered back to her childhood in rural Finland. She remembered her grandmother's stories of ancient myths and legends, which had inspired her love for poetry from a young age. But life had taken its toll, and Nele's words had become increasingly introspective and personal.

Her phone rang, breaking the silence. It was her best friend, Mira, calling to check in. "Hey, how's it going?" Mira asked, her voice a warm contrast to the drizzle outside.

Nele sighed, feeling a little deflated. "It's fine, I guess. Just the usual. Trying to make ends meet as a poet, struggling to get noticed." She paused, taking a sip of coffee. "I just feel like nobody gets me."

Mira chuckled on the other end of the line. "Oh Nele, you're always been an outsider. That's what makes your poetry so special. You see things that others don't."

Nele smiled, feeling a small spark of hope. Maybe Mira was right. She did have a unique perspective, one that drew from her experiences as a woman in a rapidly changing world.

Just then, Nele heard the sound of raindrops pattering against her windowpane. It was like the city was trying to tell her something – to keep going, even when things seemed bleak. She stood up, feeling a surge of determination. "Thanks for calling, Mira. I think I need to get out there and write some more."

As she hung up the phone, Nele's eyes landed on a piece of paper on her desk, scribbled with a few tentative lines: "Grey skies weep tears / Forgotten dreams wash away". She smiled, feeling the words begin to flow. Maybe this was just what she needed – a little rain, and a lot of words.
