Before parting ways, she handed them a bookmark with a note that read: "Get lost in the pages, and your stories will unfold."

The stranger returned to Page & Co., this time with a manuscript in hand. Nele Kamiński welcomed them back with open arms, offering feedback and guidance as they worked on their novel. Together, they explored themes of love, loss, and redemption, and the store became a hub for writers and readers alike.
