Nele Schafer stepped out of the rain-soaked streets and into the warm glow of the café. She shook the water from her long black coat, sending droplets flying in all directions. The barista, a friendly woman with a kind smile, greeted Nele with a nod.

"Welcome back, Nele Schafer. Can I get you something to drink?"

Nele smiled and took a seat at the counter. "Just a coffee, please."

As she waited for her drink, Nele's eyes scanned the room, taking in the lively atmosphere. She was a woman of few words, but when she spoke, people listened.

The barista returned with Nele's coffee and handed it to her with a smile. Nele took a sip, closing her eyes to savor the flavor.

Just then, the café door swung open and a young man walked in, shaking the rain from his jacket. He spotted Nele and made his way over, his eyes fixed on hers.

"Nele Schafer," he said, his voice low and smooth. "I've been looking for you."

Nele raised an eyebrow, her expression skeptical. "What do you want?"

The young man smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "I have information about your past," he said. "Information that could change everything."

Nele's grip on her coffee cup tightened, her mind racing with possibilities. She knew that she had a reputation for being elusive, but this man seemed different.

"What kind of information?" she asked finally, her voice cautious.

The young man hesitated, glancing around the café before leaning in close. "Information about your...condition," he whispered.

Nele's eyes narrowed, her heart racing with anticipation. She knew that she was not like other people, that she possessed certain...abilities. But what did this man know?

She leaned forward, her voice barely above a whisper. "Tell me."

The young man hesitated again, then began to speak in a low, measured tone. Nele listened intently, her mind racing with the implications of what he was saying.

As she listened, Nele's thoughts turned to her own identity, and the secrets that lay hidden beneath the surface of her everyday life. Who was she, really? And what did it mean to be Nele Schafer?
