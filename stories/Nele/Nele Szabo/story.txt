Nele Szabo's eyes scanned the crowded room, her long dark hair tied back in a loose ponytail as she sipped her coffee. The Budapest jazz club was alive with the sounds of saxophones and trumpets, but Nele's attention was focused on one person alone at the bar - him.

The man who had captured her heart, the one who made her forget about the world outside these four walls. Her full name, Nele Szabo, felt heavy on her shoulders as she wondered if he'd notice her tonight. Would he smile, or would his eyes wander to someone else?

As she watched, a figure in a navy blue suit made its way towards the bar, flashing a charming smile at the bartender. It was him - Gábor Koller, the journalist with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. Nele's heart skipped a beat as their gazes met, and for an instant, it felt like time stood still.

Gábor slid onto the stool beside her, his elbow brushing against hers. "Nele Szabo," he said softly, using her full name for the first time in weeks. She smiled wistfully, her heart aching with longing. Why did he call her that, only to slip back into 'Nele' like it was nothing?

As they ordered drinks and chatted about everything from politics to literature, Nele's nerves dissipated. For tonight, at least, she could be herself around Gábor Koller. They talked about the city, about art and music, their words flowing effortlessly as if they'd been dancing this conversation for years.

And when the night drew to a close, and Gábor walked her out into the cool Budapest air, Nele felt like the luckiest person alive. She knew that with him by her side, she could conquer anything - even her own doubts and fears. "Nele Szabo," he whispered in her ear, his breath tickling her skin. This time, it was a promise, not just a name.

As they stood under the city lights, arms entwined, Nele felt like she'd found her place in the world - with Gábor by her side, and her full name echoing in her heart.
