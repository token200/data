Nele Salvini walked into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As the renowned mercenary and treasure hunter, she had seen it all before. The hiss of espresso machines, the murmur of hushed conversations, the faint scent of smoke lingering in the air – it was a familiar comfort to Nele Salvini.

She spotted a figure in the corner, hood up and face obscured by shadows. A local contact, no doubt. Nele Salvini made her way over, her boots clicking on the tile floor. As she approached, the figure slowly stood, revealing a young woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair.

"Nele Salvini," the woman said, her voice low and husky. "I've heard a lot about you."

Nele Salvini smiled wryly. "And I've heard nothing about you, but I'm guessing that's about to change."

The woman laughed, a throaty sound that sent a shiver down Nele Salvini's spine. "My name is Elara," she said, extending a hand. "I have information about a lost city deep in the jungle. A city hidden from the world for centuries, with treasures beyond your wildest dreams."

Nele Salvini raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite herself. She had heard stories of such cities before – always shrouded in myth and legend. But Elara's words hinted at something more.

"What makes you think I'm interested?" Nele Salvini asked, her tone neutral.

Elara's eyes sparkled with amusement. "Because, Nele Salvini, I know your reputation. You're a ghost hunter, a treasure seeker with no equal. And I have proof that this lost city exists – proof that you can't ignore."

Nele Salvini raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite herself. She had always been drawn to the unknown, to the unexplained. This could be it, her next big score.

"Tell me more," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Elara nodded, her smile widening. "I'll give you all I have. But in return...you have to help me uncover the truth about my family's past."

Nele Salvini's expression softened, ever so slightly. This could be more than just treasure hunting after all – it could be a chance to make amends for past mistakes.

"I'm listening," she said, her eyes locked on Elara's.
