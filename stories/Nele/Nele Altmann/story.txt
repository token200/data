Nele Altmann trudged through the snow-covered streets of Erfurt, her eyes fixed on the small café ahead. It was late on a Tuesday evening, and she had just finished another long day at the local hospital as an intern. As she pushed open the door, a warm wave of air enveloped her, carrying the scent of freshly brewed coffee.

Inside, the café was quiet, with only a handful of patrons scattered about. Nele made her way to the counter, ordering a strong black coffee and taking a seat at the bar. She pulled out her notebook and began to scribble notes on the day's events, her mind still racing from the endless stream of patients she had seen.

As she wrote, Nele couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The hospital had been short-staffed for weeks, and the workload was becoming increasingly unsustainable. She knew she wasn't alone in her concerns; many of her colleagues were whispering about the possibility of a strike.

Just as she finished writing, the door swung open and a tall, lanky man strode in, his eyes scanning the room until they landed on Nele. "Mind if I join you?" he asked, nodding towards the empty stool beside her.

Nele hesitated for a moment before shrugging and pulling out an extra chair. The man sat down, introducing himself as Jakob, a visiting researcher from Berlin. As they chatted, Nele learned that Jakob was investigating the impact of hospital staffing shortages on patient outcomes.

Their conversation flowed easily, covering everything from medicine to politics. Nele found herself opening up to Jakob in ways she rarely did with colleagues or acquaintances. For the first time in months, she felt like someone truly listened to her concerns and understood what it meant to work in a system that was constantly under siege.

As the hours passed, Nele and Jakob delved deeper into their discussion, exploring potential solutions to the hospital's staffing woes. It wasn't long before they had hatched a plan – one that would require Nele to take a stand and advocate for change at her own institution.

With newfound determination, Nele finished her coffee, tucked away her notebook, and set out into the cold night air. The snow-covered streets seemed less daunting now, and she felt like she was walking towards a brighter future. As she vanished into the darkness, Jakob watched her go with a nod of approval – this young doctor might just be the catalyst for change he had been searching for.
