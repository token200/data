Nele D'Annunzio stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. The air was thick with the scent of saltwater and decay, carrying on its breeze whispers of forgotten stories. She had arrived in Ravenshire, a coastal town shrouded in mystery, seeking answers to questions she dared not ask aloud.

Nele's past was a maze of half-truths and misremembered moments. Her memories were fragmented, as if the very fabric of her mind had been torn apart by unseen hands. She recalled flashes of a life once lived: laughter with loved ones, sun-drenched days at the beach, but these recollections came to her like scattered leaves on an autumn breeze â€“ ephemeral and fleeting.

As she walked through the quiet streets, Nele noticed the locals watching her. They wore expressions that could be interpreted as curiosity or suspicion, their eyes following her every move. She felt like a ghost haunting the fringes of Ravenshire's community, unsure whether they welcomed or feared her presence.

A knock on her shoulder jolted Nele back to reality. A young man with an unyielding gaze and sun-bleached hair stood before her, holding out a small package wrapped in burlap twine. "I saw you get off the train," he said, his voice low and even. "My grandmother used to live here. She told me stories about this place."

Nele took the package from him, her fingers brushing against his as they did so. A spark of electricity ran through her body, making her question everything she thought she knew.

"Who sent it?" Nele asked, trying to sound nonchalant despite her growing unease.

The boy hesitated before answering, "I don't know, but I think it's meant for you."

Nele unwrapped the burlap twine and revealed a small leather journal. The pages were blank, save for one phrase scrawled in an unfamiliar script: 'Your memories are not your own.'
