Nele Szabó sat at her desk, staring blankly at the stack of papers in front of her. She was a journalist, and had been assigned to write a profile on one of Hungary's most prominent artists. As she read through her notes, she couldn't help but feel a sense of dread wash over her.

Nele had always struggled with her own creativity, and as a result, her articles were often sterile and lacking in depth. She had a passion for music, but every time she tried to put pen to paper, it seemed like words failed her. Her colleagues at the newspaper teased her mercilessly about her lack of talent.
