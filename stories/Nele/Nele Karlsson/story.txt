Nele Karlsson stepped off the train and onto the platform, her bright blue eyes scanning the bustling station. A native of Stockholm, she had spent many summers visiting her family in this small coastal town, but it was only now that she found herself returning as a grown woman.

As she made her way through the crowds, Nele's thoughts turned to the reason for her return. Her grandmother, who had taken her under her wing during those childhood summers, lay ill at home. Nele had promised to visit and help with the household chores, if only for a little while.

She hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of her family's old summerhouse, perched on the edge of the fjord. The ride was short but scenic, offering glimpses of the water and surrounding landscape that Nele knew so well from her childhood visits.

As she walked up to the house, Nele noticed that it looked as if no one had been there for a while – the flowers were wilted, the windows were cloudy with grime. But as she stepped inside, the creaking of the wooden floorboards beneath her feet seemed to echo through the empty rooms.

Nele's grandmother lay on the sofa, looking frail but peaceful. Nele sat beside her and took her hand, feeling a sense of nostalgia wash over her. She remembered the countless summers they'd spent together here – swimming in the fjord, picking wildflowers in the hills above town.

Over the next few days, Nele helped her grandmother with household chores, cooked simple meals, and simply sat by her side as she watched the world go by through the window. It was a quiet, comforting routine, one that brought Nele back to her childhood roots.

As she sat on the porch at sunset, watching the stars begin to twinkle over the fjord, Nele felt a deep sense of connection to this place and its people. She knew that soon she would have to leave again, but for now, she was content simply to be here, surrounded by memories and loved ones. And as she wrapped her grandmother's hand tightly in hers, she knew that no matter where life took her next, a part of her heart would always remain in this small coastal town.
