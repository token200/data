Nele Ayumi sat alone on the windswept beach, her long black hair whipping wildly in the sea breeze. She stared out at the endless expanse of ocean, her eyes tracing the curve of the waves as they crashed against the shore.

It had been two years since she'd lost him – her brother, her best friend, and the only person who truly understood her. Kaito's passing had left a gaping hole in Nele's life, one that seemed impossible to fill.

As she sat there, memories flooded back: laughter-filled afternoons spent exploring the coastline, late-night conversations about their dreams and fears, and the countless times they'd promised to always be there for each other. The ache in her chest was a familiar comfort, a reminder of the bond they shared.

Nele's fingers absently drummed against the sand as she watched a seagull wheel overhead. She felt lost without Kaito – like a piece of herself had been torn away. But on days like this, with the sun beating down and the waves crashing in perfect sync with her heartbeat, Nele felt a glimmer of peace.

She closed her eyes and breathed in deeply, letting the salty air fill her lungs. The scent transported her back to their summer vacations spent by the sea – the smell of saltwater, seaweed, and the sweet tang of ripe mangoes from Kaito's favorite fruit stand.

Nele's eyes snapped open as she caught a glimpse of herself in a nearby shell. For a moment, she was taken aback by her own reflection. Her skin looked pale and drawn, her dark hair frizzy from the sea air. But when she smiled softly at herself, something shifted inside.

In that moment, Nele realized she wasn't just missing Kaito – she was also missing their life together. The one they'd built, the stories they'd created, and the dreams they'd shared. It was a hard truth to accept, but it was also liberating.

With newfound resolve, Nele stood up, brushing sand off her jeans. She took a step forward, feeling the waves wash over her ankles. The ocean had always been Kaito's domain – his sanctuary, his solace. But as she looked out at its endless expanse, Nele knew it was hers now too.

For the first time in two years, she felt like she was standing on solid ground, ready to face whatever came next.
