Nele Gauthier sat alone in her dimly lit apartment, surrounded by the remnants of her past. A few scattered photos on the coffee table told the story of a life that was once full of hope and promise. Now, it seemed like just a distant memory.

As a former foster child, Nele had always struggled to find her place in the world. She bounced from one home to another, never quite feeling like she belonged. Her latest attempt at stability had ended abruptly when her most recent placement had fallen through due to some administrative error.

Nele's eyes wandered around the room, taking in the bare walls and worn furniture. It was a reflection of her current state - unfulfilled and uncertain about what the future held. She rubbed the tiredness from her eyes, feeling like she'd been walking this same road for far too long.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. Nele hesitated before getting up to answer it, hoping against hope that it wasn't another foster worker or social worker with yet another ultimatum. But when she opened the door, she saw something entirely different.

It was Kael, an old friend from her most recent placement. They'd lost touch after she'd been shuffled out of their care, but now he was standing on her doorstep with a worn backpack slung over his shoulder and an unwavering smile plastered on his face.

"Hey," Nele said softly, stepping aside to let him in. Kael quickly closed the distance between them, wrapping his arms around her shoulders in a warm hug.

"We talked about this before," he whispered into her ear. "We could do this together."

Nele's eyes welled up as memories flooded back - sleepovers on rainy nights, impromptu hikes through misty forests, silly arguments that always ended with giggles and apologies.

"Let me guess," Kael said with a sly grin, his hand reaching into her hair. "You thought you were all alone."

The two spent the rest of the evening reconnecting - old stories, new dreams, shared fears and anxieties that came with being on their own. And though Nele knew she couldn't erase the past, for now, she chose to let Kael lead the way forward.

They talked about building a life from scratch, together this time. No expectations, no guarantees, just trust - in each other and themselves.

In that moment, standing there in her apartment with the fading light of day outside, Nele finally felt like home.
