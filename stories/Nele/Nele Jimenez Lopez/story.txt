Nele Jimenez Lopez wiped the sweat from her forehead as she surveyed the small, rundown bar she had inherited from her father. The sign creaked in the gentle breeze, reading "El Fuego" in faded letters. Nele's eyes lingered on the old photo of her family, proudly holding up their own El Fuego sign back in the day.

She sighed and turned to face the young bartender, Sofia, who was busily mixing drinks behind the counter. "Hey, can you tell me why the jukebox isn't working again?" Nele asked, her voice firm but weary. She had been running this bar for months now, trying to keep it afloat while dealing with the emotional weight of losing her father.

Sofia looked up from her work and nodded sympathetically. "I've been meaning to get that fixed, Se√±ora Lopez. But I'm on summer break, you know?" Nele forced a smile, knowing Sofia's family couldn't afford to lose their income during the off-season.

As the evening wore on, the door swung open and a group of rough-looking men strode in. They eyed the bar with disdain, clearly looking for trouble. Nele watched warily as they made their way to the back, where they began whispering among themselves. She recognized one of them from the local biker gang that had been causing problems in town.

The tension grew thicker than the smoke wafting from the old cigar humidor on the counter. Nele's hand instinctively went to the small pistol she kept hidden under her apron, a gift from her father before he passed away. Sofia noticed and followed her gaze before discreetly retreating into the kitchen.

Nele stood tall, hands visible but fingers tucked into her sleeves, as the bikers continued their discussion. She knew they were looking for a fight, and she was determined to keep her bar safe and peaceful. Just like her father would have wanted. With a quiet resolve, Nele took a deep breath and waited, knowing that sometimes, staying calm was the best defense.

The men finally gave up and left, muttering threats under their breath as they departed into the night. The door swung shut behind them, leaving El Fuego quiet once more. Nele let out a sigh of relief, feeling her shoulders relax ever so slightly. Maybe tomorrow would be better, she thought, smiling faintly to herself as she surveyed the darkening bar and its familiar, comforting smell.
