Nele Ahmed, a talented young musician, had always been drawn to the world of jazz. Growing up in the vibrant city of Cairo, she would often sneak into the local jazz clubs, mesmerized by the soulful melodies and improvisational skills of the musicians on stage.

As a child, Nele's parents encouraged her love of music, enrolling her in piano lessons and later introducing her to the works of Egyptian jazz legends like Mohamed Abdel Wahab. She quickly fell under their spell, practicing for hours each day to perfect her technique.
