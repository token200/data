Nele Bergstrom stepped into the dimly lit café, the soft hum of conversation and clinking cups enveloping her like a warm hug. As she waited for her friend to arrive, Nele's eyes scanned the room, taking in the eclectic mix of patrons. A young artist sipped on a latte, lost in thought; an elderly couple shared a tender moment over a plate of pastries.

Nele's gaze lingered on a lone figure sitting by the window – a striking woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. There was something about her presence that commanded Nele's attention. The woman, whom Nele later learned was named Elara, seemed out of place among the cozy atmosphere.

As Nele's friend, Astrid, entered the café, she spotted Nele's fascination with Elara and raised an eyebrow in curiosity. "What's got you staring at her?" Astrid asked, nodding toward the mysterious woman. Nele shrugged, unsure herself. She had always been drawn to enigmatic people, and there was something about Elara that sparked her interest.

Elara noticed their gaze and smiled wryly before returning to her book. Nele watched as she effortlessly devoured a few pages, her eyes scanning the text with an intensity that bordered on obsession. Astrid leaned in closer, whispering, "She looks like she's trying to escape or something." Nele nodded, sensing there was more to Elara than met the eye.

As they sipped their coffee and chatted with Astrid, Nele found herself drawn into a conversation about literature and philosophy. It became clear that Elara was an avid reader, devouring books on every subject imaginable. Their discussion spanned from Camus to Kafka, the topics flowing effortlessly as if they'd known each other for years.

As the afternoon wore on, Astrid excused herself, leaving Nele alone with Elara once more. The two struck up a conversation about art and music, their words weaving together like a tapestry of shared experiences. As Nele prepared to leave, she felt an inexplicable connection to this stranger-turned-friend. For the first time in a long while, she felt seen – not just by herself, but by someone else who seemed to understand her intricacies.

"Thank you for talking with me, Elara," Nele said softly as they parted ways outside the café. Elara smiled and replied, "The pleasure's mine, Nele Bergstrom."
