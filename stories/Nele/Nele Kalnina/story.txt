Her latest case was a particularly puzzling one - a wealthy businessman had gone missing, leaving behind only a cryptic note with a single sentence: "The answer lies in the shadows." Nele's curiosity was piqued, and she set out to unravel the mystery.

As she delved deeper into the investigation, Nele discovered that the missing businessman had been involved in some shady dealings. He had been embezzling funds from his company and had many enemies who would love to see him go down. But what did this have to do with the cryptic message?

Nele's keen mind was racing with possibilities as she sat at her desk, pouring over stacks of files and surveillance footage.
