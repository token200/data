Hannes Sánchez Pérez stepped off the bus and onto the worn pavement of the small town's central square. The smell of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the sound of lively chatter and clinking cups. It was a scene Hannes had grown all too familiar with during his summers spent working at the local café.

As he made his way to the familiar red-and-white striped awning, a burst of energy exploded from behind him. His younger cousin, Mateo, careened around the corner, grinning mischievously as he tried to evade Hannes' gentle but firm grasp. "Mateo, por favor!" Hannes chuckled, shaking his head good-naturedly.

The sun was high overhead by the time Hannes settled behind the counter, wiping down the surface with a clean rag. The café's owner, Doña Elena, handed him a steaming cup of strong espresso and whispered, "Hannes Sánchez Pérez, te amo. Don't you go forgetting to take your lunch break today, sí?"

Hannes smiled knowingly, aware that his aunt had been drilling this point into his head all morning. After years working at the café alongside Doña Elena, Hannes had mastered the art of multitasking – serving coffee, tending bar, and maintaining a warm smile – but he couldn't shake the feeling of restlessness growing inside him.

It was an itch that had been nagging him for months now, ever since his last visit home. A desire to explore beyond the familiar borders of their small town and see what lay beyond the horizon. Doña Elena, with her kind eyes and quick wit, had always been a source of encouragement and guidance. She urged Hannes to pursue his dreams, even if they meant taking a leap of faith.

As he poured steaming cups for customers, Hannes' mind wandered back to those words of wisdom. His parents had encouraged him to stay put, secure their future – but did security really equal happiness? The questions swirled in his head like the steam rising from the café's cups.
