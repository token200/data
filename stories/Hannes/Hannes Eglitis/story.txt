Hannes Eglitis stepped into the crowded caf√©, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. He spotted her sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee and staring intently at her phone. It was Elara Vex, an old acquaintance from their time at university.

As he made his way over to her table, Hannes couldn't help but notice the changes in Elara's appearance. Her hair was shorter, and her eyes seemed more tired than before. He had often wondered what had become of her after they parted ways.

"Hannes Eglitis," she said, looking up from her phone as he approached. "It's been a while."

"Not long enough," Hannes replied with a smile, taking a seat across from her. Elara looked surprised by his warmth and candor.

They spent the next hour catching up on each other's lives. Elara had gone on to pursue a successful career in journalism, while Hannes had taken a different path. He worked as a freelance writer, traveling the world and writing about the people he met along the way.

As they talked, Hannes couldn't help but notice the way Elara seemed to be searching for something in her eyes. She would often pause mid-sentence, lost in thought, and then return to their conversation with a newfound focus.

"What's on your mind, Elara Vex?" Hannes asked, his curiosity getting the better of him.

Elara looked up at him, a hint of sadness in her voice. "I've been feeling lost lately," she said. "Like I'm just going through the motions of life without any real purpose."

Hannes listened attentively as Elara poured out her heart to him. He offered words of encouragement and support, drawing from his own experiences as a writer.

As they parted ways, Hannes couldn't help but feel a sense of responsibility towards Elara Vex. He knew that he had the power to help her find her way again, and he was determined to be there for her whenever she needed it.
