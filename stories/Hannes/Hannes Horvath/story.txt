Hannes Horvath stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the misty air enveloping him like a damp shroud. He had been away for months, chasing the ghosts of his past, and now he was back in his hometown of Budapest, Hungary.

As he made his way through the deserted station, Hannes couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. The old train station, with its crumbling stone walls and faded signs, seemed to whisper secrets in the wind. It was a place where time stood still, where the past and present blurred like the colors of the Hungarian sunset.

Hannes had always been drawn to this city, to the Danube River that wound its way through the heart of Budapest. There was something about the water's edge, with its smooth stones and reflected sky, that seemed to call to him. He had grown up playing on those same stones, watching the fishermen cast their nets and listening to the stories of his grandfather, a sailor who had spent his life on the river.

As he walked through the city streets, Hannes felt a sense of disorientation wash over him. The world seemed smaller than he remembered, yet somehow more complicated. People rushed past him, their faces a blur of worry and concern, as they hurried to meet their destinations. It was as if the very fabric of society had been torn apart, leaving only fragments of what once was.

Hannes stopped in front of a small café, one that his grandfather used to take him to when he was a boy. The sign creaked in the breeze, reading "Székely Mihály" – a name that brought a smile to Hannes' face. He pushed open the door and stepped inside, surrounded by the familiar scent of coffee and pastries.

For a moment, Hannes felt at home, like he had never left. But as he looked around the café, he saw only strangers, people who didn't know him or his story. And with that realization, he knew it was time to leave again, to continue his journey into the unknown.
