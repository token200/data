Hannes Abdirova stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station. It had been months since she'd set foot in this town, and yet it felt like no time at all. The familiar smell of damp earth and baking bread wafted through the air, transporting her back to a simpler time.

Hannes was a woman on a mission. She had left her life in Moscow behind, fleeing the chaos and uncertainty that seemed to follow her everywhere she went. But as much as she'd tried to escape, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was running from something – or someone.

As she made her way through the station, Hannes spotted a figure waiting for her by the exit. It was Viktor, her old friend and confidant. His dark eyes crinkled at the corners as he smiled, and Hannes felt a flutter in her chest that she'd thought was long dead.

"What brings you back to Tbilisi?" Viktor asked, falling into step beside her.

Hannes hesitated, unsure of how much to reveal. "I needed to get away," she said finally. "From everything."

Viktor nodded knowingly. "You've always been one for running, Hanne. But sometimes that's not the answer you're looking for."

They walked in silence for a few blocks, the only sound the patter of rain on the pavement above them. Finally, Viktor spoke up.

"I know what you're running from," he said softly. "I know about your past, about the people who are hunting you."

Hannes felt a jolt of surprise, but also gratitude. It was a risk to trust Viktor with such a heavy burden, but she knew she could rely on him.

As they reached her old apartment building, Hannes took a deep breath and let herself in. It was just as she remembered it – small and cramped, but full of warmth and character. She smiled wryly to herself as she realized that some things never changed.

For now, at least, she had found a place to hide. But she knew it wouldn't be for long. The past was always lurking, waiting to pounce. And Hannes Abdirova was no exception.

As she settled onto the couch, feeling the weight of her secrets bearing down on her, Hannes knew that she couldn't stay hidden forever. She would have to face whatever came next head-on, with courage and determination guiding her through the darkness.
