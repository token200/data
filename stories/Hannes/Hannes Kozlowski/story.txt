Hannes Kozlowski stepped into the small café on the outskirts of town, his eyes scanning the dimly lit room with a mixture of curiosity and wariness. As a private investigator, he had grown accustomed to the quiet, unassuming nature of these establishments, where locals came to discuss their troubles in hushed tones.

A middle-aged woman with a worn face and weary eyes slid into the booth across from him, her hands clasped tightly around a cup of lukewarm coffee. "Hannes Kozlowski," she said, her voice barely above a whisper, "I've been looking for you."

He nodded curtly, his gaze lingering on the faint scars above her eyebrows before returning to hers. "What can I do for you, ma'am?"

She hesitated, her eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape route. "My sister's gone missing," she said finally, her voice cracking. "The police say she was last seen at a party three days ago, but...I think something's happened to her."

Hannes Kozlowski nodded sympathetically, his mind already racing with possibilities. He pulled out a notebook and flipped through the pages, his eyes lingering on the cryptic notes scrawled in the margins. "Tell me more about your sister," he said, his voice low and measured.

The woman began to speak, her words spilling forth like a dam breaking. Hannes listened attentively, taking mental note of the details: her sister's name, her occupation, her last known whereabouts. As she spoke, he couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration – this case was already starting to unravel in ways he hadn't anticipated.

When she finished speaking, he leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers together as he digested the information. "I'll do what I can," he said finally, his voice firm and reassuring. "But I need your cooperation, ma'am."

The woman nodded, a glimmer of hope flickering to life in her eyes. Hannes smiled wryly – this case was far from over, but with a solid plan and a keen mind, he was confident that he could uncover the truth behind his client's sister's disappearance.
