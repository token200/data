Elias Wei sat alone at his desk, staring blankly at the computer screen in front of him. As a renowned software engineer, he had spent countless hours coding and debugging, but tonight was different. Tonight, he felt lost.

Born in China to a family of modest means, Elias had always been driven by his intellect and ambition. He earned top grades in school, went on to study computer science at a prestigious university, and landed a coveted job at a cutting-edge tech firm straight out of college.

But success came with its own set of pressures. Elias's colleagues looked up to him as a leader, expecting him to deliver innovative solutions and handle complex problems with ease. His parents expected him to bring home a high-paying job and provide for their family. And Elias himself expected it all – he was the one who was supposed to prove that hard work and intelligence could take him anywhere.

Now, at 35, Elias felt like he was drowning under the weight of expectation. The latest project had been derailed by a series of setbacks, and his team's morale was sagging. He knew he needed to come up with something revolutionary, but his mind was a blank slate.

Just as he was about to give up for the night, Elias's phone buzzed with an incoming message from his sister, Mei. She was in China, taking care of their aging mother after their father had passed away. Mei's words brought him back down to earth – she told him that he didn't have to be perfect all the time, that sometimes it was okay to admit when you didn't know something.

Elias took a deep breath and let his shoulders relax. He realized that he couldn't pour from an empty cup. Taking care of himself, nurturing his own passions and interests outside of work, was crucial for creating something truly groundbreaking.

He closed the laptop and stood up, stretching his tired muscles. Elias made his way to the living room, where a collection of his late father's old records sat on a shelf. He carefully removed one from its sleeve – Miles Davis' "Kind of Blue" – and placed it in his player. The smooth jazz filled the room as he walked over to the window.

As the music drifted through the air, Elias felt a sense of calm wash over him. For the first time all day, he didn't feel like he was suffocating under the weight of expectations. He saw himself not as a product of his hard work and intelligence, but as an artist – an individual with passions and interests that mattered.

And in that moment, Elias knew exactly where to start.
