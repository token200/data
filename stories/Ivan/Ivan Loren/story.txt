Ivan Loren stepped out of the rain-soaked streets and into his small, cluttered office. The neon signs outside cast a gaudy glow over the cramped space, a stark contrast to the brooding intensity that surrounded him. A former hitman turned private investigator, Ivan had seen it all – the blood, the tears, the endless cycle of violence.

As he poured himself a whiskey from the flask on his desk, his eyes scanned the room, lingering on the various mementos and trinkets that seemed to hold memories for him. There was the gold watch given to him by his sister before she died, the baseball cap he'd found in a trash can outside a Chicago bar where he'd worked, and the framed photograph of a young couple taken on their honeymoon – a cruel reminder of the life he'd left behind.

A knock at the door broke the silence. Ivan turned to see a woman, probably mid-twenties, with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She looked out of place in this world, but her presence commanded attention nonetheless.

"Ivan Loren," she said, her voice husky. "I've been looking for you."

Loren raised an eyebrow. "Who sent you?"

The woman hesitated before pulling out a small notebook from her purse. "Someone who wants to know about your past. About the jobs you did, the people you...killed."

A flicker of unease danced across Ivan's face, but he kept his expression neutral. "You're referring to my work with the organization? I'm afraid that's off-limits."

The woman smiled wryly. "I've heard stories about your skills, Ivan. Stories about how you can find anyone, anywhere. I believe those stories are true."

Loren leaned back in his chair, whiskey-stained lips curling into a thin smile. "Maybe you should tell me who sent you, then. That might help us get started."

The woman's gaze held his for an uncomfortable beat before she nodded and pulled out her phone. After a few rapid-fire taps on the screen, she said, "He wants to meet with you tonight. At the old clock tower downtown."

As Ivan watched her leave, he couldn't shake off the feeling that this was more than just some curiosity-driven individual poking around his past. There were whispers in the wind about an organization seeking to exploit people like him – people who'd been trained to do its dirty work.

A shiver ran down Ivan's spine as he lit another cigarette and exhaled, smoke curling into the evening air like a challenge. This wasn't going away anytime soon.
