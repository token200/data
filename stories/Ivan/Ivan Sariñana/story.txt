Ivan Sariñana stepped into the bustling streets of Madrid, his eyes scanning the crowded sidewalks with a mix of curiosity and caution. As a foreigner in a city steeped in history and culture, he felt like an outsider, yet drawn to the vibrant energy that pulsed through its veins.

A native of Mexico City, Ivan had always been fascinated by the art and architecture of Spain, spending countless hours studying the works of Goya and Dalí. He had saved up enough money from his day job as a graphic designer to spend several months exploring the country, immersing himself in the local customs and way of life.

As he walked through the famous Puerta del Sol, Ivan felt a sense of wonder at the grandeur of the city's landmarks. He stopped to admire the intricate stone carvings on the nearby Palace of King Charles III, his mind whirling with ideas for a new design project inspired by the ornate details.

Ivan had always been a creative soul, and his love of art and architecture had led him to pursue a career in graphic design. But it was his desire to explore the world beyond Mexico City that had driven him to take a leap of faith and leave behind the familiar comforts of home.

As he navigated the winding streets of the Old Town, Ivan stumbled upon a small café tucked away in a quiet alleyway. He pushed open the door, and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee enveloped him, transporting him to a state of relaxation. The owner, a kind-eyed woman named Sofía, welcomed him with a warm smile, and Ivan felt an instant sense of belonging.

For the next few hours, Ivan sat at Sofía's table, sipping espresso and chatting about everything from art to literature to life itself. As he prepared to leave, Sofía pressed a small piece of paper into his hand – a sketch of a beautiful Spanish tile work, created by her own hands. "For you, Ivan Sariñana," she said with a smile, "a little piece of Madrid to carry back home."
