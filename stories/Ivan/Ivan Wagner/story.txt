Ivan Wagner was a man with a reputation for being untouchable. A former hitman and mercenary, he had earned his living on both sides of the law, taking out targets and collecting hefty paychecks. But after a fateful job went sour, Ivan found himself in hiding, desperate to escape the ghosts of his past.

He'd been forced to leave the only life he'd ever known behind, abandoning his apartment and most of his possessions for a dingy, rundown motel on the outskirts of town. The once-sleek bulletproof jacket hung limp in the closet, a reminder of his former occupation. Ivan's eyes still carried the weight of countless gunfights and close calls.

Despite the odds against him, Ivan adapted. He learned to cook simple meals over an electric stove, something he never thought he'd master. The silence was almost deafening at times, but it suited him just fine. A phone rang a few days ago; Ivan answered cautiously, expecting a collection agent or perhaps a fellow operative trying to collect the debt.

The voice on the other end claimed to be an old acquaintance from his mercenary days – 'Vlad', as he'd called himself back then. It seemed that Vlad had changed his mind about Ivan's betrayal and wanted to make amends. A proposal was put forward: work for a wealthy client, handling personal security without the need for guns or heavy firepower.

As Ivan weighed the offer, an unexpected pang of nostalgia struck him. The world wasn't his playground anymore; it felt cold and unforgiving, with threats lurking around every corner. Yet there was something about this new proposal that drew him in – a chance to reconnect with people he'd hurt and potentially make amends.

He agreed, feeling the weight of responsibility settle onto his shoulders once more. Ivan knew that no amount of money or promise of redemption could erase what he'd done; only time would tell if this path was one worth taking.
