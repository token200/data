Ivan Korolev trudged through the Moscow streets, his worn boots echoing off the buildings. It was a chilly winter morning, and the snowflakes danced around him like tiny ballerinas. As he walked, he couldn't help but think about the meeting he had with the KGB earlier that day.

Ivan, or Korolev as most people knew him, was an undercover operative for the Soviet Union's top-secret intelligence agency. His work took him from the corridors of power to the dingy bars and seedy clubs on the outskirts of town, always staying one step ahead of his enemies.

He arrived at the café where he was supposed to meet a high-ranking official from the West German government. Ivan recognized the suit and tie from across the room – it was Dr. Klaus Müller, known for his cunning diplomatic skills.

As they sat down, Korolev sipped on his tea, observing Dr. Müller's nervous gestures. The old man seemed out of place in this crowded café, surrounded by rowdy businessmen and dissatisfied wives. Ivan knew better than to underestimate the motives of those who came to Moscow with secrets in their hearts.

"So, Korolev," Dr. Müller began, his voice a calculated blend of warmth and wariness, "we have reason to believe that certain... documents may be missing from our archives."

Ivan leaned back in his chair, eyes locked onto the doctor's profile. He'd heard whispers of missing files before, but this was different – it sounded like an excuse for a larger scheme.

"What makes you think I'm involved?" Korolev asked calmly, trying to keep his tone neutral. The question hung in the air like a challenge.

Dr. Müller's eyes darted around the room as if searching for an escape route, before returning to Ivan with an unsettling intensity.

"We know your past, Korolev," he said quietly, voice dripping with menace. "We know about Dresden."

Ivan felt his grip on his chair tighten, as memories flooded back from that fateful night in 1945 – the screams of those he'd sworn to protect, the desperation etched on their faces.

A shiver ran down Korolev's spine. Dr. Müller had pulled up a long-dead thread, one Ivan had carefully woven into his past. What did they truly want from him? Revenge, or something more?

As the café grew quieter, and the snow continued its gentle fall outside, Ivan realized that he was caught in a game where allegiances blurred, and loyalty was measured in ounces.

He pushed back his chair, a slow smile creeping onto his face – one that left Dr. Müller visibly unsettled. The dance had just begun, and Ivan Korolev was ready to lead the steps.
