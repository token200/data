Ivan Morel stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station with a mix of nostalgia and unease. It had been years since he'd set foot in this place, but the familiar scent of coal smoke and damp earth still lingered in his memory.

As he made his way through the crowded streets, Ivan couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He quickened his pace, dodging pedestrians on the sidewalk as he searched for the small café where he'd spent countless hours as a teenager. The owner, Madame Dupont, had been like a mother to him, and she still knew him by name.

"Ah, Ivan Morel! Mon enfant!" she exclaimed, her eyes shining with warmth as she enveloped him in a tight hug.

Ivan smiled, feeling a sense of belonging he'd not experienced in years. He took a seat at the small table by the window, ordering a cup of black coffee as he settled into the comfortable silence of the café.

As he sipped his drink, Ivan's mind began to wander back to his past. Growing up on the outskirts of town, he'd always felt like an outsider, observing life from afar before finally finding the courage to step into it. He'd been drawn to art, pouring his emotions onto canvas in vivid, expressive strokes that seemed to capture the very essence of the human experience.

Madame Dupont had encouraged him, offering critiques and guidance as he honed his skills. Years later, Ivan's work was being exhibited in galleries across the country, his name on everyone's lips. But despite his success, he couldn't shake the feeling that a part of him remained stuck in this small station, watching trains rumble by like a ghost from another life.

As the afternoon wore on, Ivan pushed the thoughts aside and focused on the present, savoring the taste of Madame Dupont's cooking and the gentle hum of conversation that filled the café. For now, he was content to be Ivan Morel, an artist with a story worth telling – and no need to hide from his past.
