Mads Walker stepped out of his small apartment, the dim morning light illuminating the wisps of sleep still clinging to his eyes. He took a deep breath, savoring the crisp air that carried the scent of wet earth and decaying leaves. It was autumn in Copenhagen, and with it came the melancholy that Mads knew all too well.

As he walked through the quiet streets, Mads's mind wandered to the latest news from his brother, who had left Denmark for Sweden a few months ago. Their parents were still grieving over his departure, and Mads felt the weight of responsibility settling onto his shoulders like a shroud.

He arrived at the bakery, where Mads worked as a pastry chef. The owner, Mrs. Jensen, greeted him with a warm smile and handed him a steaming cup of coffee. "You look like you could use this," she said, nodding toward the worn expression on his face.

Mads nodded silently, taking a sip of the rich brew. He had always found solace in the simple act of creating something beautiful, but lately, even that felt hollow. His brother's departure had shaken him to his core, and Mads struggled to find meaning in the everyday tasks he performed.

As the morning wore on, Mads worked with a listless efficiency, his hands moving through the motions as his mind wandered. He thought of all the things he used to do with his brother – exploring the city, sharing secrets, laughing until their sides hurt. The memories stung like an open wound, but Mads knew he couldn't let them consume him.

Just then, a young girl with a messy bun and a wide smile walked into the bakery, clutching a drawing book in her hand. "Mads, can I ask you something?" she said, looking up at him with sparkling eyes.

"Of course," Mads replied, setting aside his doubts for a moment.

"What's it like when someone leaves?" the girl asked, her voice full of curiosity.

Mads hesitated, unsure how to respond. But as he looked into the girl's wide eyes, something shifted inside him. He remembered his brother's smile, his laughter, and his unwavering optimism. Mads took a deep breath and began to tell the girl about his brother, about the lessons he had learned from their shared experiences.

As he spoke, something miraculous happened – the melancholy lifted, replaced by a sense of hope and renewal. The world outside seemed brighter, the leaves no longer wilted and dying but vibrant with life.
