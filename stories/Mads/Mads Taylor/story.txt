As he made his way through the crowded station, Mads Taylor's thoughts turned to his family's old bakery on Main Street.

He hadn't been back in ages, but a letter from his mother had piqued his interest. His father had passed away, leaving the bakery in the care of his sister and her husband. Mads Taylor had promised himself that he'd return to help them get back on their feet.

 Inside the bakery, Mads Taylor was greeted by the familiar sights and smells of his childhood.

As they chatted, Mads Taylor learned that his sister and brother-in-law were struggling to keep up with the demands of running the bakery.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm glow over Ravenswood, Mads Taylor felt a sense of peace wash over him.
