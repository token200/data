Mads Kovalenko stepped into the dimly lit café, scanning the room for his contact. He had been searching for weeks, following every lead, every hint that might bring him closer to unraveling the mystery of his sister's disappearance.

As he waited, sipping on a lukewarm coffee, Mads' mind wandered back to the events that led up to this moment. He was just 25 years old when his sister, Sofia Kovalenko, vanished without a trace. The police had given up, and the family had been left with nothing but unanswered questions.

The door swung open, and a figure slipped in, taking a seat across from Mads. It was Viktor, an old acquaintance who had promised to provide him with information about Sofia's last days. Mads' eyes locked onto Viktor's, and he could see the tension emanating from the older man.

"So, what do you know?" Mads asked, his voice low and even.

Viktor hesitated before speaking, "I...I saw her arguing with someone," he said finally. "A man. He was tall, dark hair, and a scar above his left eyebrow."

Mads' grip on his coffee cup tightened. This was the first real lead he had in months. "Do you remember where it happened?" he pressed.

Viktor nodded, producing a crumpled map from his pocket. Mads studied it, committing every detail to memory.

As they talked, Mads couldn't shake the feeling that Viktor was holding back. He pushed for more information, but Viktor refused to budge. It was clear that he knew more than he was letting on.

Mads thanked Viktor and stood up, tucking the map into his pocket. He left the café with a newfound sense of purpose, determined to follow every lead no matter how small. He would find Sofia Kovalenko's killer, even if it took years.

With a resolute stride, Mads vanished into the night, driven by an unyielding desire for justice for his sister, Sofia Kovalenko.
