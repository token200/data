Mads Saldaña stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the crowded station. He was here on business, but not the kind he usually did. Tonight was for old friends, and old memories.

As a former CIA operative turned private security consultant, Mads had seen his fair share of danger and intrigue. But there was something about this assignment that felt different. Maybe it was the fact that he'd been asked to come alone, or maybe it was the whispered rumors of what lay at the heart of the mission.

Mads made his way through the throngs of people, his trained eyes taking in every detail. He spotted a familiar face across the room - Maria, an old colleague from the Agency days. She caught sight of him and smiled, a small crease forming between her eyebrows as she hurried over.

"Mads," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "What are you doing here?"

"Not what I'm supposed to be doing," Mads replied, his eyes darting around the room. They were at an upscale restaurant in downtown Mexico City, surrounded by the city's elite and wealthy patrons.

Maria raised an eyebrow. "Then what?"

Mads hesitated, unsure how much he could trust her. But something about Maria's steady gaze put him at ease. "I've been tracking a lead on some rogue agents who have stolen sensitive information from the Agency."

Maria's expression turned serious. "What kind of information?"

Mads leaned in close, his voice dropping to a whisper. "We think it involves an advanced biotechnology project. If those agents sell it to the highest bidder, who knows what could happen?"

The implications sent a shiver down Mads' spine. This was bigger than just personal revenge; this was about national security.

As they made their way back to their table, Maria leaned in close once more. "Mads, I've been thinking. I think we need to take this to someone who can help us."

Mads raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "Who?"

Maria smiled mischievously. "Someone with a lot of connections and resources. Maybe someone who owes me a favor or two..."

The game was on. And Mads Saldaña was ready for whatever came next.
