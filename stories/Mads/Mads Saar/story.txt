Mads Saar sat at his desk, staring blankly at the computer screen in front of him. As the lead designer at Saar & Co., the prestigious architecture firm he co-founded with his partner, Kjetil, Mads was no stranger to pressure.

The latest project, a sleek and modern skyscraper for the city's new financial district, was proving to be a challenge. The client wanted something revolutionary, but Mads wasn't convinced it was feasible. He rubbed his tired eyes and leaned back in his chair, his mind racing with design ideas that just weren't coming together.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was Kjetil, carrying a cup of steaming coffee and looking more relaxed than Mads had seen him all week. "Morning," he said, setting the cup down on Mads' desk. "I brought you some caffeine."

Mads took a sip gratefully, feeling the bitter taste wake him up. "Thanks," he said, turning to Kjetil. "I'm having trouble with this design. I feel like we're going in circles."

Kjetil nodded sympathetically. "Sometimes we just need to take a step back and look at it from a different angle." He leaned against the doorframe, his eyes scanning Mads' workspace. "What's bothering you specifically?"

Mads hesitated, unsure how to articulate his doubts about the design. But Kjetil was an expert at reading people, and he knew exactly where to push him.

"It's just...I don't know if we're pushing the boundaries enough," Mads said finally, his voice low. "The client wants something groundbreaking, but I think it's going to be a mess."

Kjetil nodded thoughtfully. "Sometimes you have to take risks and try new things. That's where the real innovation happens." He smiled wryly. "And sometimes that means making mistakes and learning from them."

Mads felt a surge of frustration, but Kjetil just kept going. "I know it's hard, but trust me when I say we've come up with some ideas that will blow your mind." And with that, he pulled out a folder from his bag and began to unfold a set of blueprints.

As Mads' eyes scanned the plans, his doubts began to fade away. This was it â€“ this was what they had been waiting for. The design began to take shape in his mind, and for the first time all week, he felt like himself again: excited, creative, and ready to tackle whatever came next.

"Thanks," Mads said finally, smiling at Kjetil. "I think I get it now."
