Mads Palmas stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. As the only passenger on this late-night train, he felt a sense of solitude wash over him. His full name, Mads Palmas, echoed in his mind as he thought about why he was here - to escape.

A former detective from Copenhagen, Mads had grown disillusioned with the corruption and bureaucracy that seemed to plague every level of Danish society. He had made a name for himself solving high-profile cases, but the more he delved into the world of crime, the more he realized that the system was rigged against him.

As he walked through the deserted streets, Mads couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. His instincts had always been strong, and now they seemed to be screaming at him to get out while he still could. He thought about his family back home - his wife, Sophia, and their two young children - and wondered if he would ever see them again.

Mads' thoughts were interrupted by a soft knock on the door of the small caf√© where he had stopped for a cup of coffee. He turned to see a young woman with piercing green eyes and long, curly brown hair. She smiled at him, and Mads felt a spark of curiosity ignite within him.

"Mind if I join you?" she asked, nodding towards the empty chair across from him.

"Not at all," Mads replied, his Danish accent thick and rich.

The woman introduced herself as Lena, and they struck up a conversation that flowed effortlessly. As they talked, Mads found himself opening up to her in ways he never had with anyone before. For the first time in years, he felt like he was being seen.

As the night wore on, Mads knew that his life would never be the same again. He still had no idea what lay ahead, but he felt a sense of hope that he hadn't felt in a long time. And as he stood up to leave, Lena's hand touched his arm, and Mads Palmas knew that he was ready to face whatever came next.
