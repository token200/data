Mads Errani stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the cityscape. The sounds of the bustling metropolis drifted up to him, a cacophony of car horns, chatter, and sirens. He lit a cigarette, feeling the nicotine coursing through his veins as he watched the sun set behind the skyscrapers.

Mads was a private man, but there was something about this rooftop that made him feel like he could be himself. Maybe it was the solitude, or maybe it was the sense of freedom that came with being so high above the world below. Whatever it was, Mads felt alive when he stood here, surrounded by nothing but the wind and his own thoughts.

He thought back to how he'd ended up here. Born in Copenhagen, Mads had grown up on the streets, always a bit of an outsider. He'd found solace in music – guitar, drums, and singing – and formed a band with some like-minded mates. But after a chance encounter with a record label exec, they'd landed a deal and gone platinum.

The fame had been fleeting, though. Mads had never been one for the limelight, and as soon as the novelty wore off, he'd retreated from the spotlight. He'd started playing small gigs around town, just him on guitar or drums, trying to recapture the magic of those early days when music was about something more than just selling records.

Now, Mads wandered the streets at night, searching for inspiration. He'd been working on a new solo project, something darker and more introspective than anything he'd ever done before. But it wasn't coming easily – or fast enough to satisfy his restlessness.

As the stars began to twinkle in the sky above him, Mads made up his mind. He was going back down to the streets, where it was real, not some sanitized version of reality. Where music was about people and places, not just records on a shelf. With that thought, he flicked his cigarette into the void and turned away from the view.

For Mads Errani, sometimes it took being lost in the city to find what you were looking for – but sometimes, even that wasn't enough.
