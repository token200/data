Mads Singh stepped off the plane in Mumbai, his eyes scanning the crowded airport for any sign of life. A native son, he had returned to India after years spent working abroad as an engineer. The memories came flooding back as he hailed a taxi and headed towards the city's iconic Marine Drive.

As he settled into the back seat, Mads couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. He had grown up in this very city, playing cricket on the streets with his friends and watching Bollywood films at the cinema. But life had taken him elsewhere - New York, London, Singapore - until he felt the call to return home.

The taxi pulled up outside Mads' family home in Malad, a quiet suburb of Mumbai. His mother greeted him warmly, wiping away tears as she handed him a glass of lukewarm lassi. "Beta, it's so good to have you back," she said, using the affectionate term for 'child'.

Mads smiled, feeling a pang of guilt for leaving his family behind. He had missed out on so much - his mother's cooking, his father's stories about their ancestral village, the smell of cardamom and cumin wafting from the kitchen.

As he unpacked his bags, Mads' thoughts turned to his career. He was a senior engineer at a top firm in Mumbai, but he had grown tired of the corporate grind. He wanted to start his own business - a sustainable energy company that would bring power to those who needed it most.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Mads set out to explore the city's startup scene. He spent long hours meeting with entrepreneurs and investors, pitching his idea and gathering support. Slowly but surely, his vision began to take shape.

One evening, as he watched the sun set over the Arabian Sea, Mads knew that he was home. This was where his heart belonged - in Mumbai, among people who cared about making a difference. The city's vibrant energy coursed through him like the sea breeze on a summer day.

As the stars began to twinkle above, Mads smiled, feeling a sense of belonging wash over him. He knew that this time around, he would be staying for good - and nothing would ever make him leave again.
