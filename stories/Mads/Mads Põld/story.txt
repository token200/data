Mads Põld stepped off the train and onto the platform, taking in the quaint Estonian town of Põlva. The small station was quiet, with only a handful of people milling about. As he waited for his suitcase to be collected from the luggage rack, Mads couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. This trip was a chance for him to reconnect with his roots, and visit the ancestral home of his Estonian father.

Born Mads Põld, the middle child of three siblings, had spent most of his childhood in Sweden, where his family had relocated when he was just a toddler. As a result, he had never quite felt like a true "Estonian" – until now. He longed to immerse himself in the language and culture that had shaped his father's identity.

With his suitcase in hand, Mads made his way through the cobblestone streets of Põlva town, taking in the sights and sounds of a bygone era. The old wooden houses seemed to lean in, as if sharing secrets, and the air was thick with the scent of baking bread and fresh-cut grass.

As he walked, Mads couldn't help but think about his childhood vacations, spent listening to tales of his father's homeland from the lips of a proud and fiery Estonian grandmother. Her stories had sparked something within him – a curiosity about his heritage that only now was beginning to feel like home.

Eventually, Mads arrived at the small wooden cottage where he would be staying for the duration of his visit. The owner, an elderly woman named Maria, greeted him warmly and showed him to his cozy bedroom. As he settled in, Mads felt a sense of contentment wash over him. This was where he belonged – among the rolling hills and quiet villages of Põlva.

Over the next few days, Mads immersed himself in Estonian language classes, cooking lessons, and long walks through the forest. He met fellow expats and locals alike, all eager to share their stories and traditions with this curious stranger. And as he listened, his ears pricked up – not just to the sounds of the language, but to the rhythms of a culture that was slowly coming alive within him.

For the first time in his life, Mads Põld felt like a true Estonian.
