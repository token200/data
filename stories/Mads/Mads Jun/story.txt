Mads Jun stepped out of the rain and into the cozy cafe, shaking the droplets off his jacket. He was a man of few words, but when he did speak, people listened. As the lead detective in Copenhagen's North District, Mads had earned a reputation for being one of the best in the business.

As he waited for his coffee to be made, Mads' mind wandered back to the case that had been plaguing him for weeks. A string of high-end jewelry store robberies, all with the same MO - no signs of forced entry or exit, no surveillance footage. It was as if the thief vanished into thin air.

Just then, a harried-looking young woman slipped onto the stool next to Mads. "Mind if I join you?" she asked, eyeing his jacket. Mads shook his head, and the woman sat down, introducing herself as Sophie, a journalist working on a story about organized crime in Copenhagen.

Mads ordered a black coffee and listened intently as Sophie filled him in on her research. She had been following a lead on an old acquaintance of hers - a former thief who had recently resurfaced in the city. The more she talked, the more Mads' ears perked up. This could be the break he needed to crack the case.

As they sipped their coffee, Sophie asked Mads about his personal life. She had heard rumors that he was having trouble with his new partner, a hotshot young detective named Emma. "Is it true you two don't get along?" she asked, raising an eyebrow.

Mads raised an eyebrow himself - how did she know? "Let's just say we have... differing opinions," he said dryly. Sophie laughed and leaned in, her voice taking on a conspiratorial tone. "I heard Emma's been pushing for a new protocol for handling evidence. Something about 'streamlining' the process."

Mads' eyes narrowed - he knew exactly what Sophie was getting at. His old partner had retired with a bad case of PTSD, thanks to Mads' own mishandling of evidence back in his day. And now, Emma wanted to change things? He wasn't sure if that was a good thing or not.

As the rain continued to pour outside, Mads and Sophie chatted for another hour, discussing everything from the latest developments on the jewelry case to their personal favorite Scandinavian films. It was clear that Sophie had done her research - she knew just how to push Mads' buttons without offending him.

When it was time for Mads to leave, he smiled at Sophie and said, "You know, for a journalist, you're not too bad." Sophie grinned back, and as Mads walked out into the rain, he felt a spark of hope. Maybe this case wouldn't be so hard to crack after all.
