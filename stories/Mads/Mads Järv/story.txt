Mads Järv was a man shrouded in mystery, with a past that seemed as dark as the Swedish forest he called home. A former mercenary, Mads had spent years taking on high-risk missions for top dollar, but after a close call went horribly wrong, he hung up his gun and set out to start anew.

As he walked through the quiet streets of Stockholm, Mads Järv couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He had always been a private person, content to keep to himself, but lately, it seemed like someone was lurking just out of sight, waiting for him to let his guard down.

Mads stopped at a small café on the corner, ordering a black coffee and taking a seat at the bar. The bartender, a gruff but kind-hearted man named Johan, nodded in recognition as Mads slid onto the stool.

"You're back," Johan said, eyeing Mads Järv warily. "I thought you were done with this life."

Mads shrugged, his eyes scanning the café as he sipped his coffee. "I needed a break," he said finally. "But I'm not sure how long it'll last. There are still people out there who want me dead."

Johan's expression turned grim. "You're not safe here either, Mads Järv. You're a ghost from the past. People forget that eventually."

Mads nodded, feeling a familiar sense of unease creeping over him. He knew Johan was right – he couldn't stay hidden forever. Eventually, someone would find him, and when they did, it wouldn't be pretty.

As he finished his coffee and prepared to leave, Mads caught sight of a figure watching him from across the room. It was a woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair, her gaze locked on Mads Järv like a magnet.

For a moment, Mads felt a spark of recognition, but it was quickly extinguished as he realized that this woman wasn't someone from his past – at least, not yet. Yet, he couldn't shake the feeling that their paths were about to cross in a very unexpected way.
