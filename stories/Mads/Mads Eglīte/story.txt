Mads Eglīte sat in his small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and flickering candles. The dim light cast eerie shadows on the walls as he stared at the letter in front of him.

It was from his estranged father, a man Mads had never known anything about until he received this mysterious message. His mother had passed away when he was just a child, leaving behind only cryptic clues and unanswered questions.

The letter revealed that Mads' father, a renowned physicist, had been working on a groundbreaking project when he vanished into thin air. The note hinted at a dark secret, one that could change the course of history forever.

Mads felt an overwhelming sense of curiosity and trepidation. He knew that his life would never be the same if this revelation was true. He spent the next few days pouring over his father's research, trying to unravel the tangled threads of the project.

As he delved deeper into the mystery, Mads began to notice strange occurrences around him. Equipment malfunctioned, and whispers echoed in the night. It was as if something – or someone – was watching him, guiding him toward a truth that could be both exhilarating and terrifying.

One fateful evening, as the moon hung low in the sky, Mads decided to venture into the abandoned laboratory where his father had worked. The air was thick with dust, and cobwebs clung to his face like sticky fingers. As he explored the dimly lit corridors, a cold breeze carried the faint scent of disinfectant and something else – a hint of smoke.

In the heart of the lab, Mads stumbled upon an ancient computer, its screen glowing with an otherworldly light. The login prompt read: "Project Erebus." Without hesitation, Mads typed in his father's password and waited.

The screen flickered to life, revealing an endless stream of code that seemed to dance like a madman's rhythm. Suddenly, the room plunged into darkness, and Mads felt himself being pulled toward the screen, as if drawn by an unseen force.

When the lights returned, Mads sat amidst the wreckage of his father's research, the computer still crackling with energy. He knew that he had uncovered something incredible – a secret that would change his life forever.
