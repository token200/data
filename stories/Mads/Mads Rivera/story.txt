Mads Rivera stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the smell of saltwater and seaweed filling their lungs as they gazed out at the small coastal town of Ravenswood. It had been years since they'd set foot in this place, but Mads Rivera knew every nook and cranny like the back of their hand.

As a child, Mads Rivera had spent summers exploring the tide pools and watching the fishermen bring in their daily catch. But after a falling out with their parents, they'd left Ravenswood behind, determined to make a name for themselves on the other side of the country.

Now, at 25, Mads Rivera was back, seeking refuge from the chaos of city life. They had inherited a small cottage from a great-aunt they'd never known, and it was here that they hoped to lay low and focus on their art.

Mads Rivera made their way through the quiet streets, pausing to admire the intricate stone carvings that adorned the old buildings. The town still had that same rugged beauty that drew them in all those years ago.

As they walked, Mads Rivera's eyes landed on a small studio tucked away behind a bustling cafe. It was the space where their great-aunt had painted some of her most beautiful works, and it was here that Mads Rivera had spent countless hours as a teenager, practicing their own craft.

With a sense of excitement and trepidation, Mads Rivera pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside. The studio was just as they remembered it – dusty, cluttered, and full of the faint scent of turpentine. But it was also home now, a place where they could lose themselves in their art and find some sense of peace.

As the sun began to set over Ravenswood, casting a golden glow over the town, Mads Rivera smiled to themselves. This was where they belonged – small, quiet, and surrounded by the beauty of the sea. For the first time in years, Mads Rivera felt like they were finally coming home.
