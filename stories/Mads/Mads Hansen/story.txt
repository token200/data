Mads Hansen stepped into the dimly lit pub, his eyes scanning the crowded room for any sign of familiarity. He had been in Copenhagen for only a week, and already he felt like an outsider. A Dane with a troubled past, Mads had fled to the city in search of a fresh start.

As he made his way to the bar, a warm hand clapped him on the back. "Mads Hansen!" boomed the voice. Mads turned to face a ruggedly handsome man with a thick beard and piercing blue eyes.

"Kjell?" Mads asked warily, unsure of what to make of this sudden encounter.

Their childhood friend had always been the loud one – confident and fearless – but also fiercely loyal. Kjell was the first person Mads had confided in when he left town five years ago, fleeing the mistakes of his past.

"Long time no see," Kjell said, sliding onto the stool beside Mads. "What brings you back to Copenhagen?"

Mads shook his head, taking a sip of his beer as he collected his thoughts. "Just needed to get away, I guess."

Kjell's expression turned serious. "You're running from something, Hans – that much is clear. What's going on this time?"

For the first time in months, Mads felt a weight lift off his shoulders. He couldn't bear the thought of pretending to be someone he wasn't around Kjell.

"A few bad decisions," he admitted, taking another sip. "Thought I could outrun my problems."

Kjell laughed, a deep rumble that put Mads at ease. "You can never outrun your demons, Hans. But maybe you can find them again, and work through the mess this time."

As they talked into the night, the pub emptied out and the conversation flowed easily. For the first time since leaving, Mads felt like himself – not just a shell of a person trying to hide.

In that moment, Mads knew he still had a long way to go. But with Kjell by his side, he was ready to face whatever came next.
