Mads Junko stepped out of his small cabin, breathing in the crisp morning air of the Swedish forest. He lived off the grid, relying on his wits and hunting skills to survive. As a former SAS operative turned recluse, Mads had grown tired of the world's chaos and had retreated to this remote haven.

His eyes scanned the surrounding trees, searching for signs of life. A doe stepped out from behind a trunk, her large brown eyes watching Mads warily before bounding away. He smiled wryly; he was used to being hunted, not hunting.

Mads made his way back to the cabin, his boots crunching on the snow-covered forest floor. Inside, he found his trusty rifle leaning against the wall, a constant companion in this wilderness. As he loaded the shotgun, his thoughts turned to the strange package he had received earlier that day â€“ an old-school payphone with a note attached.

Intrigued, Mads dialed the number, listening intently as it rang through the forest. The line crackled, and a low voice spoke on the other end. "Mads Junko?" The man's tone was gravelly, familiar.

"Mikael," Mads replied, his heart rate increasing. Mikael was an old comrade from his SAS days, now rumored to be working for MI6. They had lost touch after the mission went sour in Afghanistan, and Mads thought he'd never hear from him again.

"What do you want, Mads?" Mikael's voice cut through the silence like a knife. "I've got information about your sister's disappearance."

Mads' grip on the shotgun tightened. His sister had vanished under mysterious circumstances five years ago, and he had given up hope of ever finding her. He listened intently as Mikael spoke in hushed tones about encrypted files and shadowy organizations.

The details painted a picture of corruption that went all the way to the top. Mads Junko's eyes narrowed; this was bigger than he'd initially thought. "Tell me more," he growled, a plan already forming in his mind.

For now, he could hear only silence on the other end of the line. The forest seemed quieter, the trees holding their breath as if waiting for Mads' next move.
