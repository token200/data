Mads Pérez Sánchez stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the drizzly streets of Madrid. He had been on the move for weeks, always staying one step ahead of those who sought to catch up with him. As a former hacker, he had made enemies in the dark corners of the net, but he knew that his skills were not something to be taken lightly.

Mads hailed a taxi and gave the driver an address – a small café on the outskirts of town, where he had arranged to meet an old acquaintance named Carlos. The cab driver eyed him warily, but Mads flashed a disarming smile and handed over a few euros for his trouble.

As the taxi pulled away, Mads watched it disappear into the foggy evening. He lit a cigarette and began to pace back and forth in front of the café, checking his watch every few seconds. It was almost midnight when he spotted Carlos – a scruffy little man with a penchant for plaid shirts and an air of quiet confidence.

"Ah, Mads," Carlos said, as if the name had been telegraphed to him. "I've been looking for you."

Mads raised an eyebrow. "You've got something I need?"

Carlos pulled out a small folder from his pocket and handed it over. Inside, Mads saw a stack of carefully crafted credit cards – each one bearing a different identity, but all linked to the same account.

"Welcome to the world of high-stakes espionage," Carlos said, with a hint of mischief in his voice. "I've got connections who can help you take on the big players."

Mads took the folder, his eyes scanning the contents. He had always known that he was good at this – but he also knew that it would take more than just technical skill to survive.

As they sat down to a plate of tapas and coffee, Mads leaned in close. "Tell me," he whispered, "what's the play?"

Carlos smiled. "Let's just say that we're going to be playing the long game – one card at a time."

And with that, Mads Pérez Sánchez disappeared into the night, ready to take on whatever lay ahead, armed with nothing but his wits and a burning desire for revenge.
