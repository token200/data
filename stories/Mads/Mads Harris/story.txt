Mads Harris was known for his unorthodox approach to problem-solving. As the lead detective of the Homicide Division, he had a reputation for being one step ahead of the game. His colleagues often joked that he had a sixth sense for sniffing out clues that others missed.

One day, Mads received a call from the chief of police, requesting his assistance in solving a particularly gruesome murder case. The victim was found with multiple stab wounds, and the only clue was a small piece of torn fabric caught in the window lock.

Mads Harris arrived at the scene, his eyes scanning the area for any signs of evidence. He noticed that the fabric seemed out of place, almost as if it had been deliberately left there. He carefully plucked it from the lock and examined it more closely.

After a few minutes of study, Mads made an educated guess about the color of the fabric - it was a rare shade of blue that he had seen before in an old coat from the 1950s. He quickly called his team to get them to scour local vintage stores for any matching coats.

Within hours, they found exactly what they were looking for: an old blue coat with the exact same torn piece of fabric caught in the window lock. It turned out that the victim had been wearing this very coat when he was murdered.

Mads Harris was ecstatic about his breakthrough and immediately began piecing together the events leading up to the murder. He discovered that the killer had left a small piece of paper with a cryptic message - "You'll never find me." But Mads knew better than to believe the words of an enemy. This time, he had used evidence to outsmart them.

After weeks of meticulous work, Mads Harris finally unraveled the web of deceit that led him to the killer's doorstep. It was none other than a former cop with a grudge against the police department, who had meticulously planned his crime scene to look like a random attack.

The suspect, still in shock over being caught, looked up at Mads and said "How did you do it, Harris?" Mads smiled wryly - it's all about paying attention to the smallest details, he thought. And with that, another case was closed, solidifying Mads Harris' reputation as one of the top detectives in the business.
