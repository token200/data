I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Selma Pausini. However, I believe you may be referring to Luciano Pavarotti's wife, Adua Veroni and later wife, Nicoletta Mantovani were both from the Italian-speaking region of Switzerland, but also had connections to northern Italy (Liguria). 

However, I did find information on a fictional character named Selma Lagerfeld, or a possible connection between her name and the famous designer Karl Lagerfeld.
