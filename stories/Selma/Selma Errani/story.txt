Her wit and cunning were her greatest assets, allowing her to talk her way out of sticky situations and negotiate deals with shady merchants.

One day, while traversing the ancient city of Petra, Selma stumbled upon a hidden chamber deep within the rocks, containing a treasure trove of artifacts and relics from a bygone era.
