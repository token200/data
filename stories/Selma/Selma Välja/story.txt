Selma Välja was a master weaver of Estonian folk tales. Born and raised in the small village of Puhja, Estonia, she had spent her entire life collecting stories from the villagers, listening to their whispers, and watching as the moon dipped below the horizon.

As a child, Selma would sit by the fireplace with her grandmother, who taught her the ancient art of spinning tales. Her grandmother's eyes sparkled like the Northern Lights as she spun yarns of mythical creatures and forgotten gods. Those stories had become Selma's foundation, the threads that wove together the fabric of Estonian folklore.

Years went by, and Selma grew into a skilled weaver of her own. She traveled to distant villages, sharing tales and collecting new ones. Her words were like honey – sweet and intoxicating. People would gather around her, mesmerized by the colors of her imagination.

One day, as Selma sat on the banks of the Pihava River, she received a mysterious message from an unknown sender. It read: "Weave the tale of the Moon Woman." Intrigued, Selma began to spin a story about a mystical being who roamed the Estonian woods under the light of the full moon.

As she wove her words into a tapestry, Selma felt the magic emanating from her loom. The villagers, drawn by the siren's call, gathered around her once again. This time, however, they brought gifts: silver threads, starlight-infused wool, and tales of their own. Together, they created a magnificent fabric that shimmered with stardust.

The Moon Woman tale became a part of Estonian folklore, passed down from generation to generation. Selma's legacy lived on through the stories she shared, her words weaving a tapestry of enchantment across the land. As the years went by, people began to call her the Moon Weaver – a title that suited her perfectly.

One evening, as the moon dipped below the horizon, Selma gazed out at the forest, her eyes shining like the stars above. She knew that she had become one with the night itself, her words infusing the world with magic and wonder. The villagers, now mere whispers in her ear, smiled knowingly – for they were all woven into Selma's enchanted fabric, each thread a testament to the timeless power of Estonian folklore.
