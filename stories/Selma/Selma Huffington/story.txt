I must correct you that the actual founder of Thrive Global was Arianna Huffington, not Selma Huffington.

However, I can write a short story about a fictional character named Selma Huffington, inspired by the real-life entrepreneur Arianna Huffington:

Selma Huffington was a successful businesswoman and philanthropist who had it all - a thriving company, a loving family, and a reputation for being one of the most influential women in her industry. Despite her many accomplishments, Selma couldn't shake off the feeling that something was missing. She felt burnt out from constantly working long hours and neglecting her own well-being.

One day, while on a solo retreat to recharge, Selma stumbled upon a book by Arianna Huffington, who had also struggled with burnout in her younger years. The book's message resonated deeply with Selma, and she began to realize that prioritizing self-care was not only necessary but essential for achieving success.

Inspired by what she had read, Selma made a vow to herself to take control of her own well-being. She started small, taking short breaks throughout the day to meditate and practice yoga. As she continued on this path, Selma noticed a significant shift in her energy levels and productivity. Her business flourished, and she found joy in every aspect of her life.

As news of Selma's transformation spread, people began to seek her advice on how to achieve balance in their own lives. She became known as a thought leader in the wellness space, and her company thrived under her newfound focus. Selma's journey was not an easy one, but it taught her that taking care of oneself is not only possible but necessary for living a happy, healthy life.

Years later, when people asked Selma about her secret to success, she would smile knowingly and say, "It all started with Arianna Huffington's book. She helped me realize that self-care was the key to unlocking my true potential." And with that, Selma Huffington would take a deep breath, savoring the fruits of her labor, and inspire others to do the same.
