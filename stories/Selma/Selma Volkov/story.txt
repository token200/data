Selma Volkov was known for her sharp wit and even sharper tongue. As a high-powered businesswoman in the cutthroat world of international finance, she had learned to rely on herself above all else. Her colleagues whispered about her ruthless tactics behind closed doors, but few dared to cross her.

Despite her formidable reputation, Selma was not without her vulnerabilities. She had a soft spot for stray animals and had amassed a menagerie of rescue pets in her high-rise Manhattan penthouse. Her loyal assistant, Natalia, had grown accustomed to the sounds of meowing cats and chirping birds that filled the apartment.

One fateful evening, Selma received an unexpected visit from her estranged father, Viktor Volkov. A former KGB agent turned rogue businessman, Viktor had a penchant for drama and manipulation. He had been absent from Selma's life since she was a teenager, but now he sought to make amends – or so he claimed.

As the two sat down in the penthouse living room, surrounded by the comforting chaos of her pets, Viktor began to spin a web of deceit. He promised to help Selma expand her business empire into Eastern Europe, where his old connections and influence could prove invaluable.

Selma listened warily, her mind racing with doubts about her father's true intentions. She knew better than to trust him – after all, he had abandoned her family when she was just a child. Yet, a part of her still held onto the hope that Viktor might be telling the truth this time around.

As the evening drew to a close, Selma made a decision. She would accept Viktor's offer, but only if he agreed to keep his promises and not betray her trust again. The terms were binding, and she knew exactly how to enforce them – by holding him accountable with every ounce of cunning and intelligence at her disposal.

As the night wore on, Selma watched her father depart, a calculating glint in her eye. She returned to her penthouse, where Natalia looked up from her desk with concern etched on her face.

"All is well, Natalia," Selma said with a reassuring smile. "Daddy's back in town – and I'm ready to take him down."
