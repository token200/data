Selma Boulanger was known for her enigmatic smile and uncanny ability to read people. As a renowned psychologist, she had spent years studying the human mind, but it wasn't until she stumbled upon an obscure text on ancient mythology that she discovered her true calling.

While pouring over dusty tomes in the university library, Selma came across a mysterious tale of the Greek goddess of fate, Clotho. According to legend, Clotho was responsible for weaving the fabric of destiny, thread by thread. Intrigued, Selma became obsessed with understanding the symbolism behind this mythological figure.

As she delved deeper into her research, Selma's clients began to notice a change in her demeanor. Her eyes seemed to see right through them, and her words were laced with an unnerving level of insight. People would find themselves opening up to her in ways they never had with anyone before, as if the threads of their own destinies were being gently pulled apart by Selma's probing questions.

One client, a young man struggling with anxiety, was particularly drawn to Selma's unique approach. He confided in her about his fears and doubts, and Selma listened intently, her expression unreadable. When he finished speaking, she nodded thoughtfully and began to weave a tale of her own – one that wove together fragments of myth and medicine, revealing hidden patterns beneath the surface.

As the sessions continued, Selma's reputation grew. People came from all over to sit in her chair, hoping to unravel the tangled threads of their own lives. And though she never revealed her own secrets, those who sought her out felt a strange sense of peace – as if they had finally found someone who understood the intricate tapestry that was their destiny.

Selma Boulanger's reputation as a master weaver of fates spread far and wide, earning her the nickname "the Goddess of Insight." And though she remained humble about her accomplishments, those who knew her couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the threads she had so skillfully woven into their lives.
