Selma Kalmurzaeva's eyes sparkled like diamonds in the dimly lit room, her sharp jawline accentuated by the faint glow of the lanterns that lit up the small, cluttered space. She sat cross-legged on a worn wooden mat, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and scraps of parchment. The air was thick with the scent of old paper and smoke from the small fire crackling in the corner.

Selma was no ordinary woman. She was a Kizilbash warrior-mage, hailing from the distant lands of Azerbaijan, where the sun dipped into the Caspian Sea and painted the sky with hues of crimson and gold. Born into a family of revered mages, Selma had inherited her people's unique gift – the ability to wield the elements themselves.

As she pored over ancient texts, Selma's fingers danced across the pages, as if conjuring words from thin air. Her eyes gleamed with an inner light, as if the secrets she unlocked were woven into the very fabric of reality itself. The fire crackled in response, spitting tiny sparks that Selma deftly snuffed out with a gentle flick of her wrist.

Outside, the night air was alive with the whispers of the wind, and Selma's ears perked up as if tuning into a hidden frequency. She sensed it – a presence stirring, like the awakening of a sleeping giant. A faint hum vibrated through the space, growing stronger by the second.

Selma rose to her feet, her eyes locked onto the lanterns that cast flickering shadows on the walls. With a quiet smile, she raised her hands, and the flames within the lanterns began to dance in rhythmic response to her magic. The air seemed to thicken, as if reality itself was bending to her will.

As one, Selma's body began to glow with an ethereal light, like the stars shining through a gap in the clouds. Her form dissolved into the shadows, leaving behind only a whispered promise: "The balance shifts, and the storm approaches."
