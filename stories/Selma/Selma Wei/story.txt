Selma Wei was a force to be reckoned with in the cutthroat world of high-stakes poker. With her razor-sharp mind and quick wit, she had built a reputation as one of the most feared opponents at the tables.

As the daughter of a wealthy businessman, Selma had grown up with every opportunity handed to her on a silver platter. But it was her own drive and determination that had set her apart from the rest. She had spent countless hours studying strategy and psychology, honing her skills until she was almost unbeatable.

Despite her polished exterior, however, Selma had a secret: she was haunted by a tragic event in her past. Her younger brother had died in a poker game when she was just a teenager, and the guilt still lingered. She had vowed to never make that same mistake again, but the weight of her emotions often threatened to cloud her judgment.

One night, Selma received an invitation to join an exclusive high-stakes tournament in Las Vegas. The prize was a cool million dollars, and she knew it would be a chance to prove herself as the best player in the game. But she also sensed that there was more at stake – a rival player had been making threatening comments about her past, hinting that he knew her deepest secrets.

Selma arrived at the tournament with her trademark confidence, but as the night wore on and the stakes grew higher, she began to feel a growing sense of unease. Her opponent, a smooth-talking player named Victor, seemed to be pushing all her buttons – whispering cruel taunts in her ear, making veiled references to her brother's tragic fate.

As the final hand approached, Selma felt her emotions boiling over. She knew that one wrong move could cost her everything. But with a fierce determination, she gathered herself and made the bold bet that would decide the outcome of the game. Victor hesitated for a fraction of a second too long, and then his eyes went wide as he realized what had happened.

Selma had won. The crowd erupted in cheers as she raked in the prize money, but more importantly, she had silenced her tormentor once and for all. For one fleeting moment, she felt free from the weight of her past, and she knew that no matter what lay ahead, she would always be in control.
