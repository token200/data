Selma Muti stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. As the sole passenger on this late-night journey, she felt a sense of solitude wash over her. Her name was Selma Muti, and she had always been drawn to places where few people dared to venture.

As she made her way through the deserted streets, the flickering streetlights casting eerie shadows on the ground, Selma couldn't help but feel a thrill of excitement. She had heard whispers of an abandoned lighthouse on the outskirts of town, its beacon now silenced and still. The allure was too great to resist, and Selma Muti found herself walking towards it with purpose.

The air grew thick with salt as she approached the coast, the sound of the waves crashing against the shore a soothing balm for her weary soul. As she climbed the crumbling steps of the lighthouse, Selma felt a sense of trepidation building within her. What secrets lay hidden in this abandoned tower?

She pushed open the creaking door and stepped inside, her eyes adjusting to the dim light within. The air was heavy with dust and decay, but Selma's curiosity drove her forward. She climbed the winding staircase, her footsteps echoing off the walls as she ascended higher and higher.

Finally, she reached the top, where a rusty lantern hung from the ceiling, casting a faint glow over the room. Selma Muti felt a shiver run down her spine as she gazed out to sea, the waves stretching out before her like an endless expanse of possibility. In this moment, she felt truly alone, yet at the same time, connected to something greater than herself.

As she stood there, the wind whipping her hair into a frenzy, Selma knew that she had found what she was searching for. The silence was broken only by the sound of the waves and the beating of her own heart. It was as if the lighthouse itself was whispering secrets in her ear, drawing her closer to the mysteries that lay within.

Selma Muti stood there for a long time, drinking in the beauty of the abandoned lighthouse, feeling the weight of solitude lift from her shoulders. And when she finally emerged into the bright sunlight, she knew that nothing would ever be the same again.
