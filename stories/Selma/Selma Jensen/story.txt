Selma Jensen stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of life. As the owner of the local bakery, she was used to being on her feet all day, but there was something about this particular morning that felt off. Maybe it was the way the sunlight streaming through the windows highlighted every crack in the worn floorboards, or maybe it was the sense of unease that had been following her since the night before.

Selma Jensen took a deep breath and began to make her way through the crowded station, weaving past commuters and vendors alike as she made her way towards the bakery. She had already prepared for the day's customers, laying out trays of fresh pastries and arranging bouquets of flowers on the counter. But despite her best efforts, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.

As she pushed open the door to the bakery, a bell above it rang out, announcing her arrival to the handful of early risers who had already gathered there. Selma Jensen smiled warmly at each of them in turn, exchanging greetings and small talk as they ordered their morning treats. But even as she worked to put on a cheerful face, she couldn't help but feel a growing sense of unease.

It wasn't until one of her regular customers, an elderly woman named Mrs. Thompson, approached her with a concerned look on her face that Selma Jensen began to get a handle on what was going on. "Selma Jensen," Mrs. Thompson said, her voice low and serious, "have you heard anything about the new business that's opening across town? I've been hearing rumors that it's going to put us out of business."

Selma Jensen's heart sank as she listened to Mrs. Thompson's words. She had indeed heard whispers about a new rival bakery opening in the area, and she had tried to brush them off as mere gossip. But now, as she looked around at her customers and her carefully curated displays, she couldn't help but wonder if she was being naive.

With a newfound sense of determination, Selma Jensen set to work, whipping up batch after batch of her famous pastries and plotting a strategy to take on the new competition head-on. As the day wore on and the bakery began to fill with more customers, she felt a spark of hope ignite within her. She would not go down without a fight, no matter what challenges lay ahead.
