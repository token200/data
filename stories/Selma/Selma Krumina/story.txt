Selma Krumina was a woman with an extraordinary gift - she could communicate with animals. Her unique ability had been passed down through generations of her family, and it only grew stronger with each passing year. As a young girl, Selma would spend hours in the woods behind her house, chatting with the creatures that lived there.

As she grew older, Selma's talent became more refined. She could understand even the most subtle language that animals used to communicate. Her friends would often take their pets to visit Selma, and watch in amazement as she effortlessly conversed with them.

One day, a young boy named Timmy came to visit Selma's family farm. His family had recently adopted him from foster care, and he was struggling to adjust to his new life. As they sat on the porch, Selma noticed that Timmy seemed particularly upset. She asked him what was wrong, and he began to cry.

Without hesitation, Selma rose from her chair and walked towards a nearby barn. She opened the door and called out softly, "Misty? Are you there?" A gentle voice replied, "Yes, I'm here." Selma smiled and stepped inside, where she found a beautiful horse with a calm demeanor.

Selma began to talk to Misty, asking her about Timmy's emotional state. The horse listened attentively before responding, "He's scared and lonely, but he wants to feel safe and loved again." Selma nodded thoughtfully and turned back to Timmy, saying, "It's okay, Timmy. You're not alone. We'll get through this together."

Timmy looked up at Selma in awe, his eyes shining with tears. From that moment on, Selma Krumina became an integral part of Timmy's life, using her gift to help him heal and feel more connected to the world around him.

As the years passed, Selma continued to use her extraordinary ability to make a positive impact on those around her. Her love for animals and people alike only grew stronger, inspiring others to do the same. And though she remained humble about her talents, those who knew her could never help but feel grateful for the gift of Selma Krumina's presence in their lives.
