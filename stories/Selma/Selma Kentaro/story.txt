Selma Kentaro, a 30-year-old Tokyo native with a sharp wit and quick tongue, navigated the crowded streets of Shinjuku with ease. Her long, curly brown hair bounced behind her as she weaved through the throngs of pedestrians on their way to the evening's festivities.

As a journalist at the popular online publication, The Tokyo Times, Selma had made a name for herself as a tenacious and fearless reporter. She was always on the lookout for the next big story, never backing down from a challenge or a confrontation.

Tonight was no exception. Selma had received an anonymous tip about a high-stakes poker game being held in an exclusive underground club in the city's seedier district. The rumors spoke of large sums of money changing hands and powerful players vying for control.

With her journalist's instincts on high alert, Selma set out to uncover the truth behind the mysterious poker game. She had no idea what she was getting herself into.

As she entered the club, a hush fell over the room. The air was thick with anticipation and the scent of expensive whiskey. Selma scanned the room, her eyes adjusting to the dim lighting as she searched for her contact.

She spotted him in the corner, a hooded figure sipping on a drink. He beckoned her over, his hand raised in a gesture of caution. As she approached, he pushed back his hood, revealing a young man with piercing green eyes.

"I'm Max," he said, his voice low and urgent. "I've been watching you for weeks. I know what you're looking for."

Selma's journalist's radar picked up on the hint of something more behind Max's words. She leaned in closer, her curiosity piqued.

"What do you want to tell me?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Max hesitated before speaking, his eyes darting around the room as if searching for hidden listeners. "I'll give you a story that will shake the very foundations of this city," he said finally. "But are you ready for what comes next?"

Selma's heart skipped a beat as she nodded, her mind racing with possibilities. She was always up for a challenge, and tonight was shaping up to be one for the books.
