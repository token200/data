Selma Romagnoli sat alone at her kitchen table, sipping a cup of strong espresso and staring out the window. Her eyes, a deep brown that seemed to hold a world of stories within them, gazed out at the grey Parisian sky.

As a young woman, Selma had left Italy with big dreams and an even bigger heart. She had traveled the world, working as a nurse in war-torn Bosnia, volunteering in refugee camps in Sudan, and even tending to wounded animals on a remote Australian farm. But despite all the adventures she'd had, Selma couldn't shake the feeling that she was meant for something more.

Over the years, she'd built a quiet life in Paris, working as an English teacher at a local lycée and living in a cozy apartment above her friend's boutique shop. But on her 35th birthday, Selma received an unexpected phone call from an old flame, Alessandro – the man who had broken her heart all those years ago.

Alessandro was now a renowned artist, exhibiting his works at galleries around the world. He wanted Selma to be his muse for his next project: a series of paintings inspired by their time together in Italy. Selma was torn between her desire to reconnect with Alessandro and her fear that getting hurt again would mean sacrificing her own dreams.

As she sipped her coffee, Selma's mind wandered back to the summers spent wandering the Tuscan countryside, laughing with Alessandro as they explored ancient ruins and shared pasta dishes at family gatherings. She remembered the way he used to look at her – with a deep affection that made her feel like she was home.

But life had moved on, and Selma knew that if she returned to Italy now, it wouldn't be just for Alessandro's sake. She'd have to confront the doubts that had been gnawing at her heart since leaving: what did she want from life? Was it enough to simply help others, or was there something more waiting for her?

Selma took another sip of her espresso and let her eyes wander back to the window. The grey Parisian sky seemed to be shifting – slowly, but surely, light crept in at the edges. Maybe, just maybe, this moment was the one where she could finally begin to find what she'd been searching for all along.

With a newfound sense of determination, Selma reached for her sketchbook and began to draw the outline of Alessandro's face – soft, gentle lines that captured the love they shared, and the dreams yet to come.
