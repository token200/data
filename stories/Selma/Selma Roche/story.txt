Selma Roche stepped off the last train of the night and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the dimly lit station. It had been twenty years since she'd set foot in Ravenswood, the small town where she grew up. The memories came flooding back as she made her way through the deserted streets.

As a child, Selma had been fascinated by the abandoned factory on the outskirts of town. Her parents had warned her to stay away, but Selma's curiosity had gotten the better of her. She'd snuck out one night and explored every nook and cranny, discovering hidden rooms and secret passages.

Years later, as a journalist, Selma had returned to Ravenswood to investigate rumors of supernatural activity at the factory. The locals whispered about strange noises and ghostly apparitions, but Selma was determined to get to the bottom of it.

As she walked through the station, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was her old friend, Jasper, who'd grown up with Selma in Ravenswood. He greeted her warmly and invited her to his family's diner for a late-night breakfast.

Over plates of bacon and eggs, Jasper filled Selma in on the latest rumors about the factory. There were whispers of an unknown figure seen lurking around the abandoned building at night, and some even claimed to have heard disembodied whispers coming from within.

Selma listened intently, her mind racing with possibilities. She knew that Ravenswood was a place where nothing ever changed, but she couldn't shake the feeling that something had shifted in recent years.

As the sun began to rise over the small town, Selma and Jasper set out for the factory. They approached cautiously, their flashlights casting eerie shadows on the walls. Suddenly, a faint whisper seemed to echo through the air, sending shivers down Selma's spine.

She felt a presence behind her and turned to see Jasper standing stock-still, his eyes fixed on something in the distance. Selma followed his gaze, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Yet, she couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched.

With a thrill of excitement, Selma knew that she'd found what she was looking for – proof that Ravenswood still held secrets, and that sometimes, the past is never truly buried. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the town in darkness, Selma smiled to herself – she had only just begun to scratch the surface of this old town's mysteries.
