Selma Nowak stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the crowded room. She spotted a familiar figure huddled in the corner, nursing a cup of coffee. It was Max, an old flame from her past who had never quite let go.

As she made her way over, Selma's mind replayed their complicated history. They had met while studying abroad, bonding over late-night conversations and stolen moments of intimacy. But like many relationships, theirs had imploded in a mess of passion and pain.

Selma slid into the booth across from Max, his piercing blue eyes locking onto hers. For a moment, they simply stared at each other, the air thick with tension.

"So," Selma said finally, breaking the silence. "What brings you here?"

Max's gaze drifted to the rim of his coffee cup. "Just passing through. I needed a break from the city."

Selma raised an eyebrow. "You're always running away, aren't you?" she teased, her voice laced with a mix of humor and hurt.

Max's eyes flashed up to meet hers, a hint of defensiveness creeping into his expression. "Maybe I just need some space," he said softly.

As they chatted, Selma found herself drawn back in. She remembered the way Max used to make her laugh, the way his hands cradled her face. It was as if no time had passed at all.

But beneath the surface, Selma's thoughts swirled with caution. She had thought she'd left Max behind, that their tumultuous relationship was forever in the past. And yet, here they were, sitting across from each other like two old friends.

As the conversation flowed, Selma began to see things through fresh eyes. Max wasn't the same person he'd been all those years ago. He'd grown, evolved – and so had she.

As the night drew to a close, Selma stood up, her heart pounding in her chest. She looked down at Max, who was watching her with an almost hopeful gaze.

"Want to walk with me?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Max nodded, his eyes never leaving hers. Together, they stepped out into the cool night air, their footsteps weaving an uncertain path forward.
