Selma Mäkinen, a Finnish woman from Helsinki, lived a life that was as unpredictable as the Northern Lights dancing across her city's sky. Born in 1935 to a family of modest means, Selma grew up with a fierce determination to create something of herself. As a young girl, she spent hours sketching and dreaming of far-off places, fueled by her love for mythology and folklore.

Selma's early years were marked by struggle, as she battled poverty and sexism in a society where women's roles were strictly defined. Yet, with unwavering resolve, she pursued her passion for art, studying at the local Academy of Fine Arts despite initial disapproval from her family.

After graduating, Selma traveled to Paris, immersing herself in the city's vibrant artistic scene and befriending some of its most influential figures. It was there that she found inspiration for her own unique style, a fusion of folk motifs with modernist techniques. Her work quickly gained recognition, and by the 1960s, Selma was one of Finland's most celebrated artists.

However, it wasn't until the 1970s that Selma truly broke free from conventions. Inspired by her motherland's rich mythology, she began creating large-scale public installations that merged art, nature, and storytelling. Her magnum opus, "Kalevala", was a 10-meter-tall sculpture of a mythical hero, created for the Helsinki City Museum.

The installation sparked controversy and debate, but also ignited a national conversation about identity, tradition, and progress. Selma's art became an integral part of Finland's cultural heritage, celebrated by people from all walks of life. As she grew older, her legacy continued to inspire generations of Finnish artists, designers, and writers.

Selma Mäkinen passed away in 2010, but her impact on Finnish culture remains undeniable. Her story is a testament to the power of creativity and determination in the face of adversity, reminding us that even the most unlikely paths can lead to greatness. As she once said, "The Northern Lights may be unpredictable, but my art will never falter."
