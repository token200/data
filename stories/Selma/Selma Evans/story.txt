Selma Mae Evans had always been a free spirit, never content to stay in one place for too long. As a child, she would spend hours gazing out the window, dreaming of far-off lands and exotic adventures. Her parents, though loving and supportive, couldn't help but worry about their restless daughter.

As she grew older, Selma's wanderlust only intensified. She dropped out of college to travel the world, backpacking through Europe and Asia with nothing but a small suitcase and a passion for photography. It was on one of these trips that she met her future partner, a charming traveler named Alex.

Despite their whirlwind romance, Selma knew she couldn't stay in one place forever. She returned home after a few years, but the itch to explore never fully went away. In fact, it only grew stronger. After a stint as a freelance photographer, Selma decided to take the plunge and buy a one-way ticket to New Zealand.

For the next five years, Selma roamed the country, capturing breathtaking landscapes and portraits of its resilient people. Her camera became an extension of herself, allowing her to express the beauty and wonder she saw in the world. People began to take notice of her work, and soon, Selma Mae Evans was a sought-after photographer.

Though she'd built a successful career, Selma knew that restlessness still lingered within her. She made the bold decision to sell her studio and embark on one final adventure – a solo journey around the world. With a fresh start and an open heart, Selma set off into the unknown, camera slung over her shoulder.

As she traveled, Selma reflected on the twists and turns of her life. Her parents might have worried about their daughter's wandering ways, but they'd also instilled in her a sense of wonder and curiosity. And now, as she gazed out at the endless horizon, Selma Mae Evans knew that no matter where her journey took her next, she was exactly where she was meant to be – free, wild, and full of life.
