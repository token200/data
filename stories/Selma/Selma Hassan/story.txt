Selma Hassan sat in her small café, sipping on a cup of steaming hot coffee as she stared out the window. It was a typical Monday morning, with the sun peeking through the foggy streets of her neighborhood. As she gazed out at the bustling streets, Selma Hassan's mind began to wander.

She had always been drawn to the arts, and after completing her degree in fine art, she had pursued her passion for photography. Her black-and-white portraits had gained a following online, and soon she was receiving commissions from all over the world. Selma Hassan's work was a reflection of her own unique perspective on life – dark, moody, and full of depth.

As the morning rush subsided, a young woman walked into the café, looking lost and alone. Selma Hassan noticed the girl's troubled expression and immediately felt a pang of recognition. She had been there before, in a moment of desperation and uncertainty. Without hesitation, she got up from her seat and approached the girl.

"Hey, what's wrong?" Selma Hassan asked, concern etched on her face.

The girl explained that she was feeling overwhelmed with school and relationships, and didn't know how to cope. Selma Hassan listened attentively, nodding her head in understanding. She had been there herself, many years ago. As they talked, the café began to fill up with more customers, but Selma Hassan's focus remained on the young woman.

After a while, the girl's tears dried up, and she looked at Selma Hassan with newfound determination. "Thank you," she said, smiling slightly. "Just talking to you made me feel better."

Selma Hassan smiled back, feeling a sense of satisfaction wash over her. It was moments like these that reminded her why she loved being an artist – not just for the creative expression, but for the human connection it allowed her to make.

As the girl left the café, Selma Hassan returned to her seat, lost in thought. She pulled out her camera and began snapping pictures of the city outside, capturing the beauty in the chaos. Her latest project was coming along nicely, and she couldn't wait to share it with the world.

With a renewed sense of purpose, Selma Hassan picked up her coffee cup and took a sip, feeling grateful for this moment of connection. As the sun continued to peek through the fog, Selma Hassan's heart swelled with joy – knowing that even in the darkest moments, there was always the possibility of beauty and connection waiting just around the corner.
