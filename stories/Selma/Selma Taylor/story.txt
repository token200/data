Selma Taylor's latest case was particularly intriguing - a family mansion rumored to be inhabited by the malevolent spirit of its former owner, a wealthy industrialist named Malcolm. The family had been experiencing strange occurrences and sightings, from disembodied whispers to full-blown apparitions. Desperate for answers, they had turned to Selma Taylor, hoping she could uncover the truth behind the haunting.

As Selma Taylor arrived at the mansion, she felt a shiver run down her spine. Something about this place didn't feel right. She began by conducting interviews with the family members and reviewing the history of the estate.

Selma Taylor set up her equipment, including cameras, audio recorders, and EMF meters, to capture evidence of any paranormal activity. As night fell, she settled in for a long night of observation. Suddenly, the lights flickered, and a loud bang echoed through the hallways. Selma Taylor's heart skipped a beat as she realized that she was not alone.

Without hesitation, Selma Taylor grabbed her equipment and began to investigate further. She discovered that the source of the disturbance was an old safe hidden deep within the mansion's basement. As she opened the safe, a dark figure emerged from the shadows - it was Malcolm himself. But to Selma Taylor's surprise, he spoke to her in a low, raspy voice, revealing a shocking truth about his own death and the reason behind the haunting.
