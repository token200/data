Selma Ozoliņš stepped onto the stage, adjusting her glasses and taking a deep breath. As a renowned mathematician, she had spent years studying the works of great minds like Euclid and Gauss, but tonight she was here to talk about something entirely different: love.

The audience chuckled at the unexpected topic, but Selma Ozoliņš was undeterred. She began to speak with passion, weaving together stories of her own experiences as a young woman in love, of the joys and heartaches that came with it. Her words wove a spell over the crowd, and soon they were all entranced by the mathematician's unique perspective on romance.

Selma Ozoliņš had always been fascinated by patterns and equations, but she had never expected to find herself studying the rhythms of the human heart. And yet, as she delved deeper into her research, she discovered that love was a complex system of variables and constants, just like any mathematical formula.

She spoke of how couples interacted like particles in a quantum field, attracted and repelled by unseen forces. She talked about the graphs of attachment styles, like fractals repeating themselves across generations. And she explored the algorithms of flirtation, the decision trees that governed the likelihood of getting a second date.

As Selma Ozoliņš spoke, her audience was transfixed. They saw their own experiences reflected in her words, and they began to see love as a mathematical problem to be solved. The physicist in the front row scribbled notes on her napkin, while the poet in the back row nodded along with the rhythm of Selma Ozoliņš's argument.

In the end, Selma Ozoliņš was met with thunderous applause. She smiled humbly, knowing that she had found a new way to express herself – one that combined her love of math with her passion for human connection. As she left the stage, she felt a sense of excitement and possibility, like the thrill of solving a difficult equation on a rainy day.

And though she was known primarily as Selma Ozoliņš, mathematician, tonight she was also known as someone who had discovered that love could be understood in terms of variables and constants – just like any good mathematical problem.
