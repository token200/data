Selma Yu sat in her small apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty old books and scattered notes. As a renowned astrophysicist, she spent most of her time studying the mysteries of the universe, but tonight was different. Tonight, she had a date.

Her friend, Rachel, had set her up with a handsome stranger named Alex, who shared her passion for science and exploration. Selma Yu couldn't help but feel a little nervous as she waited for Alex to arrive. She took a deep breath, smoothing out her hair and adjusting her glasses.

The doorbell rang, and Selma Yu's heart skipped a beat. She got up to answer it, revealing a tall, dark-haired man with piercing blue eyes. "Hi," he said, smiling. "I'm Alex."

Selma Yu felt a flutter in her chest as she extended her hand. "I'm Selma Yu," she replied, trying to sound calm.

As they sat down on the couch, Selma Yu couldn't help but notice the way Alex's eyes lit up when she mentioned her latest research project. They talked for hours, discussing everything from black holes to their favorite science fiction novels. Selma Yu found herself laughing and feeling more at ease than she had in weeks.

As the night wore on, Selma Yu realized that she was having the time of her life. She couldn't remember the last time she'd felt such a strong connection with someone. Alex seemed to share her curiosity about the world, and his passion for discovery was infectious.

As they said their goodbyes, Alex turned to Selma Yu and asked if he could see her again soon. "I'd love to," she replied, smiling up at him. And as she watched him walk out of her apartment, Selma Yu knew that this might be the start of something special. She felt a sense of excitement and possibility that she hadn't felt in a long time.

As she drifted off to sleep that night, Selma Yu couldn't help but wonder what the future held for her and Alex. Would they continue to explore the mysteries of the universe together? Only time would tell, but one thing was certain: she was eager to find out.
