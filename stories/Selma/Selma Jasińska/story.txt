I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Selma Jasińska. Could you provide more context or details about who Selma Jasińska is? If not, I can create a story for a generic character with that name.

If you would like me to generate a new story based on my understanding of common characteristics associated with the Polish surname "Jasińska," please let me know.
