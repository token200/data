Selma Petrovich was a mysterious figure, shrouded in whispers and speculation. Few people knew much about her, but those who did spoke with reverence and awe.

Born to a family of nomadic performers, Selma had grown up on the streets of Moscow, learning acrobatics and contortionism from her parents. As she grew older, she began to develop her own unique style, blending traditional Russian folk dances with elements of modern circus arts.

But it was her ability to "disappear" that set Selma apart. She could seemingly vanish into thin air, leaving her audience stunned and bewildered. Some said it was magic, while others claimed she had mastered the art of hypnotism.

Selma's talent had caught the attention of a wealthy patron, who offered her a lucrative contract to perform at his exclusive masquerade ball. The event was a spectacular affair, with lavish costumes and extravagant decorations. Selma arrived dressed as a white swan, her feathers glowing in the candlelight.

As the night wore on, guests began to notice that one of Selma's "disappearances" seemed different from the others. She had vanished into the crowd, but then reappeared behind a tall, dark figure in a mask. The masked man was imposing, with piercing eyes and an air of quiet confidence.

Rumors swirled about his identity, with some claiming he was a Russian tsar, while others said he was a wealthy collector of rare artifacts. Selma never revealed the truth, but her performances became even more enigmatic and captivating.

As the ball drew to a close, Selma took her final bow, disappearing into the night as she had done countless times before. But this time, she didn't reappear alone. The masked man stood beside her, his presence a stark contrast to the whimsical atmosphere of the ball.

Together, they vanished into the darkness, leaving behind only the faintest whisper: "Until next time, my dear...".
