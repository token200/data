Selma Majewski stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for the familiar figure of Zofia. It was a chilly autumn evening in Krakow, and the air was alive with the whispers of history. As a journalist, Selma had grown accustomed to digging up secrets and unraveling mysteries.

She spotted Zofia huddled in a corner, sipping a cup of black coffee. A petite woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair, Zofia exuded an air of quiet confidence. Their friendship had been forged over countless late nights spent discussing the intricacies of Polish history and politics.

As Selma slid into the booth opposite Zofia, the younger woman raised an eyebrow. "What's the story this time, Selma?" she asked, her voice laced with amusement.

Selma leaned in, her eyes locked on Zofia's. "I've received a cryptic message from a source claiming to have information about the Jedwabne massacre," she said, her words tumbling out in a rush. "It seems someone is willing to come forward and share their story – but only with me."

Zofia's expression turned serious. The Jedwabne massacre was one of Poland's darkest chapters – the infamous killing of over 40 Jewish residents by local peasants in 1941. It had long been shrouded in controversy, with many questions left unanswered.

"What makes you think this source is credible?" Zofia asked, her brow furrowed with concern.

Selma hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. "Let's just say I have a feeling about this one," she replied, her eyes sparkling with determination. "I've been digging into some unusual connections – it all points to someone close to the massacre wanting to make amends."

As they delved deeper into the conversation, Selma's journalist instincts began to take hold. She sensed that there was more to this story than met the eye, and she was determined to uncover the truth.

With Zofia by her side, Selma embarked on a journey through the complexities of Polish history, navigating webs of intrigue and deception. As they dug deeper, they uncovered secrets that had lain hidden for decades – secrets that would challenge everything Selma thought she knew about her country's past.

As the night wore on, Selma's resolve grew stronger. She was no longer just a journalist; she was a seeker of truth. And with Zofia by her side, she was ready to face whatever lay ahead, armed with nothing but her curiosity and a fierce determination to uncover the truth.
