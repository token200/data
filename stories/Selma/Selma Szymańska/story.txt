Selma Szymańska was known for her fearless spirit and quick wit, earning her a reputation as one of the most feared and respected bounty hunters in the city of Ashwood. Born to a family of modest means, Selma had always been driven by a desire to prove herself, to make a name for herself outside of her humble beginnings.

As a child, Selma would often sneak into the local market, watching the vendors with wide eyes as they haggled over prices and traded goods. She was especially fascinated by the art of negotiation, and she spent hours practicing her own bartering skills on her parents' vegetable stand.

But as she grew older, Selma realized that her true calling was in the world of bounty hunting. She enrolled in the prestigious Ashwood Bounty Hunters Guild, where she honed her skills under the guidance of veteran hunters like Jack "The Bull" Murphy.

Selma proved to be a natural, quickly earning a reputation for her lightning-fast reflexes and razor-sharp instincts. She worked tirelessly, tracking down fugitives and collecting bounties with ease. Her confidence grew with each success, and soon she was making a name for herself as one of the top bounty hunters in the city.

Despite her tough exterior, Selma had a soft spot for those in need. She often took on cases that no one else would touch, working tirelessly to bring justice to those who had been wronged. Her commitment to her craft earned her the respect and admiration of her peers, and she became known as a true force to be reckoned with.

As Selma sat in her office, pouring over maps and tracking data, she couldn't help but think back to her childhood days at the market. Who would have thought that the same girl who had once bartered for vegetables would one day become a legendary bounty hunter? Only Selma Szymańska knew the answer, and she was content in the knowledge that she had found her true calling.
