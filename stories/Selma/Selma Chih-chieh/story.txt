Selma Chih-chieh was a free-spirited artist who lived in the vibrant city of Taipei. Her full name, which meant "little beauty" in Mandarin, suited her perfectly, for she had an infectious smile and an eye for the world's hidden charms.

As a child, Selma had always been fascinated by the way light danced through the streets of Taipei's old town, casting intricate shadows on the worn stone walls. As she grew older, this fascination only deepened, inspiring her to become an artist who captured the city's essence in her work.

Selma's studio was a cozy, cluttered space filled with half-finished canvases, paint-splattered easels, and scraps of paper covered in scribbled notes and sketches. Here, she spent most of her days lost in her art, experimenting with colors and textures to evoke the city's unique energy.

One day, as Selma was working on a new piece, she received an unexpected visit from her grandmother, Nai-nai. The elder woman had come to Taipei from rural Taiwan, where she had grown up amidst lush green mountains and rolling hills. Her eyes sparkled with nostalgia as she gazed at the vibrant cityscape outside the studio window.

Selma's full name echoed in her mind as she watched Nai-nai wander through her studio, running her fingers over the textures of her artwork. "Little beauty," she whispered to herself, remembering how her grandmother had once described her own childhood fascination with light and shadow.

As they sat together on a worn couch, sipping tea and discussing art and life, Selma realized that Nai-nai's wisdom was just what she needed. Her full name seemed to take on new meaning as she listened to the elder woman's stories of traditional Taiwanese culture, of ancestral mountains and temples, and of the people who had come before her.

Inspired by Nai-nai's words, Selma began a new series of paintings, one that blended her love of light and shadow with the rich traditions of her heritage. As she worked, the studio grew quiet once more, but now it was filled with a sense of purpose and belonging. And when she signed her latest piece, "Selma Chih-chieh," she felt a deep connection to her own story, one that would continue to unfold as long as she painted.
