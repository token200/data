Selma Nielsen stepped out of her small apartment and into the crisp morning air, taking a deep breath as she gazed out at the city. A retired librarian, she had always been drawn to books and knowledge, but after a painful divorce, she found herself feeling lost and alone.

As she walked through the quiet streets, Selma noticed the way people hurried past her, each with their own destination in mind. She felt like a ghost drifting through their lives, invisible and insignificant. But then, as she turned a corner, she saw him - a young man sitting on a bench, staring intently at his phone.

Something about the way he sat, with his shoulders slumped and his eyes fixed on the screen, struck a chord within Selma. She remembered times when she had felt that way, trapped in her own world of worry and doubt. Without thinking, she walked towards him, her feet carrying her towards this stranger as if drawn by an unseen force.

As she approached, the young man looked up, startled, and their eyes met for a brief moment. Selma was taken aback by his intense gaze, but also by the softness in his eyes. She saw something there that gave her hope - a sense of longing, of searching for connection in a world that seemed to be moving too fast.

Without saying a word, Selma sat down beside him on the bench. They sat together in silence, watching as people bustled past them, each with their own story to tell. The young man finally broke the silence, his voice barely above a whisper. "I'm so lost," he said, looking at her with tears welling up in his eyes.

Selma's heart went out to him. She knew what it was like to feel that way - alone and adrift in a world that seemed too big and too overwhelming. But as she looked into his eyes, she saw something there that gave her hope. Maybe, just maybe, this stranger needed someone to talk to, someone who would listen without judgment.

And so Selma did what she had always done when she felt lost - she shared her own story with him. She told him about her painful divorce, about the struggle to find purpose and meaning in a world that seemed to have moved on without her. The young man listened intently, his eyes never leaving hers, and as they spoke, Selma felt a weight lifting off her shoulders.

In that moment, something shifted within her. She realized that she was not alone, that there were others out there who understood her pain and her struggles. And as the two of them sat on the bench, watching the world go by, Selma knew that she had found something new - a connection to someone else, a sense of belonging in a world that seemed too big and too complex.
