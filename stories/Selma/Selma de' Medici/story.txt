In the sweltering summer of 1475, Florence was abuzz with the news of Lorenzo de' Medici's recent exile from the city he once ruled with an iron fist. Among those who had gained a measure of power and influence during his absence was Selma de' Medici, a young and ambitious noblewoman.

Selma, also known as Selma de' Medici, had always been the black sheep of the Medici family. Her unconventional beauty, sharp wit, and fierce determination often put her at odds with her more traditional relatives. Despite this, she had managed to carve out a niche for herself in the city's high society.

As Lorenzo de' Medici navigated the treacherous waters of exile, Selma de' Medici saw an opportunity to further her own ambitions. She began to secretly forge alliances with rival families and wealthy merchants, using her cunning and charm to build a network of supporters.

One such supporter was a young artist named Sandro Botticelli, who had recently arrived in Florence from the countryside. Impressed by Selma's intelligence and passion, he found himself drawn to her presence and began to paint portraits of her that showcased her remarkable beauty.

Selma de' Medici saw the potential value in having an artist like Botticelli on her side. She offered him a small but significant sum of money for his work, and in return, she requested that he create a series of paintings depicting her as a powerful and wise leader.

As the months passed, Selma's influence grew. She became known throughout Florence as a shrewd businesswoman and a patron of the arts. Her portraits by Botticelli were admired by all who saw them, and her reputation as a Medici was cemented.

But with power comes danger, and Selma de' Medici knew that not everyone would be pleased with her rise to prominence. She remained vigilant, using her wit and cunning to stay one step ahead of those who sought to bring her down. And as she looked out over the city she had come to rule, Selma de' Medici smiled to herself, knowing that she was truly the master of her own destiny.

Years would pass before Lorenzo de' Medici's exile ended, and when it did, he would return to Florence with a newfound sense of respect for his sister. But by then, Selma de' Medici had already become an unstoppable force in her own right, leaving behind a legacy that would be remembered for generations to come.
