As she grew older, Selma's talent became evident, and she began to receive recognition from local galleries and collectors. Her unique style, which blended traditional Mexican techniques with modern abstract expressionism, quickly gained popularity. People were drawn to the emotional depth and raw energy that pulsed through her paintings.
