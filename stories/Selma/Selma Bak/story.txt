Selma Bak was known for her unorthodox approach to art, often incorporating found objects and everyday materials into her sculptures. Born to a family of modest means in rural Sweden, Selma's fascination with art began as a child, rummaging through her parents' attic in search of discarded treasures.

As she grew older, Selma's passion for art only intensified, leading her to study sculpture at the prestigious Royal College of Art in Stockholm. It was there that she honed her skills, experimenting with various techniques and mediums, from clay to steel.

Selma's unique style quickly gained attention, earning her a coveted spot in the Swedish avant-garde scene. Her sculptures, often poignant and thought-provoking, explored themes of identity, community, and social justice. She drew inspiration from her family's history, incorporating elements of Swedish folk culture into her work.

One of Selma Bak's most celebrated pieces was "The Weaver," a large-scale installation composed of old machinery and textiles. The sculpture depicted a young woman weaving a tapestry, symbolizing the struggles and triumphs of women in rural Sweden. Visitors to the gallery were often moved to tears by the sheer power and emotion of the piece.

Despite her success, Selma remained committed to using her art as a tool for social commentary. She traveled extensively, exhibiting her work in galleries and museums around the world. In Brazil, she created "The Bridge," a massive steel structure inspired by the Afro-Brazilian tradition of bridge-building.
