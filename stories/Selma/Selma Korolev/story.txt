Selma Korolev was a force to be reckoned with in the high-stakes world of international espionage. A former KGB agent turned freelance operative, she had built a reputation for being one of the most resourceful and ruthless individuals in the business.

Her latest mission took her to the streets of Tokyo, where she had been hired by a wealthy businessman to retrieve a valuable data disk from a rival corporation's headquarters. The disk contained top-secret information about a cutting-edge technology that could give its owner a stranglehold on the global market.

Selma arrived at the building under the cover of night, her eyes scanning the rooftop for any signs of security cameras or guards. She spotted a ventilation shaft and quickly scaled up to it, hoisting herself into the narrow opening with ease. The air was thick with dust, but Selma's trained nose picked out the faint scent of surveillance equipment.

She dropped down onto the ductwork, her fingers moving deftly as she navigated the maze-like system. She knew every inch of this building, having spent months casing it before finally getting her hands on the disk. But tonight was different - tonight, she wasn't just after a valuable asset; she had a personal stake to play.

A rival agent, known only by his codename 'Nightshade', had also been hired to retrieve the disk. Selma had heard rumors of Nightshade's true intentions: to use the technology for nefarious purposes. She knew she couldn't let that happen.

As she crawled through the ductwork, Selma's earpiece crackled with static. "Selma, this is Phoenix. Nightshade has breached the server room."

Selma's eyes narrowed. Time was running out. She dropped down into the server room, her gun drawn as she scanned the area for any signs of danger.

Nightshade emerged from the shadows, a sly smile spreading across his face. "Looks like we're not the only ones after this disk," he sneered.

Selma's gaze locked onto Nightshade, her expression cold and deadly. This was personal now.
