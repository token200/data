In the scorching deserts of ancient Rome, there lived a man named Selma Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus - a man with a reputation for being one of the most cunning and ruthless generals in the empire. His parents had been modest senators, but their son's ambition knew no bounds.

Eventually, he received an invitation to meet with Emperor Septimius Severus - the man who would ultimately recognize Selma's genius and make him one of the most powerful men in Rome.

As Selma entered the emperor's court, he knew that this was his moment. He would not be denied. With a calculating gaze, he began to weave his web of intrigue, manipulating the emperor's advisors and generals with ease.
