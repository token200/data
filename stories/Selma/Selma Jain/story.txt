Selma Jain trudged through the crowded streets, her feet aching in her worn-out sneakers. She had just finished a long shift at her part-time job and was looking forward to a quiet night at home with a good book. As she walked, she couldn't help but feel overwhelmed by the world around her. The sounds of car horns, chatter, and wailing sirens were all too much for her sensitive ears.

Selma Jain, a freelance writer, had always been a introverted person. She found solace in the quiet, solitary moments where she could let her mind wander and create. But lately, it seemed like the world was conspiring against her. Every time she tried to focus on her writing, there was a noise, a distraction, or a crisis that required her attention.

As she turned the corner onto her street, Selma Jain's eyes landed on the small café across from her apartment building. She knew they had a live music night scheduled for tonight and her stomach twisted with anxiety. The last time she had tried to attend one of these events, it had been too loud and chaotic for her taste.

But something caught her eye as she approached the café – a flyer on the community board advertising a poetry reading by a local artist. Selma Jain's heart skipped a beat as she read through the list of participants. One name stood out in particular: Rohan Patel, a poet known for his powerful and emotive works.

Selma Jain felt a spark of curiosity ignite within her. She had always admired Patel's writing style and would love to meet him. As she pushed open the door to the café, the sounds of music and laughter washed over her, but this time they seemed almost soothing. She made her way to the bar, ordered a cup of tea, and sat down at an empty table.

As the poetry reading began, Selma Jain found herself completely absorbed in the words on stage. Patel's voice was hauntingly beautiful, and she felt her own heart swell with emotion. For the first time all week, she felt like she could breathe again. And as she watched him take his final bow, Selma Jain knew that sometimes, it took a little courage to find solace in the noise.
