Selma Xia's eyes sparkled like polished obsidian as she surveyed her domain. The dimly lit, smoke-filled room pulsed with an otherworldly energy, the air thick with the scent of incense and possibility. As a renowned fortune teller and spiritualist, Selma was no stranger to the mysteries that lay beyond the veil.

A petite woman with skin like golden silk and hair as black as the night sky, Selma moved through her space with an aura of quiet confidence. Her hands were always busy, weaving intricate patterns in the air as she listened for the whispers of the universe. It was a gift, one she had honed over years of study and practice.

Tonight's clients were two young souls, their eyes wide with worry and expectation. They had come seeking answers to questions they dared not ask aloud, fearing the truth might shatter their fragile lives. Selma listened attentively, her gaze piercing as she absorbed every word, every nuance of tone and body language.

As the readings progressed, Selma's expressions shifted like a chameleon's. Her eyes gleamed with intensity when interpreting omens, softened when offering words of comfort, and raised an eyebrow in skepticism when confronted by contradictions. The young ones watched, mesmerized, as she conjured visions of their futures on wisps of smoke and threads of fate.

But Selma was not a mere reader of tarot cards or crystal balls. She was a weaver of destinies, a conductor orchestrating the symphony of lives that intersected hers. Her words were laced with an undercurrent of truth, one she wove with care to protect her clients' fragile psyches.

One young woman, Rachel, spoke of desperation and loss, her voice cracking as she revealed the weight of grief still clinging to her heart. Selma's expression remained compassionate, but her eyes sparkled like stars when she murmured a single phrase: "Your heart is heavy, but it holds within it the light that will set you free."

Rachel's gaze locked onto Selma's, and in that instant, something shifted within her. A glimmer of hope emerged from the shadows, refusing to be extinguished by the darkness. As the reading concluded and the clients rose to leave, Selma smiled knowingly, her lips curved like a crescent moon.

For in this realm, she was not just a reader or a guide but a guardian of possibilities â€“ an ambassador between the realms of past, present, and future. Her wisdom might come at a steep price, but its costs were worth paying for those willing to confront the unknown. As the door closed behind Rachel and her companion, Selma's eyes settled back into their familiar stillness, awaiting the next whispers from beyond, ready to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos once more.
