I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Selma Corberó. It's possible that you may be thinking of Penélope Cruz, who has a Spanish surname (Cruz). 

However, if you would like I can create a new story about a character with the name Selma Corberó.

Here is a story:

In a small town nestled in the rolling hills of Catalonia, there lived a young woman named Selma Corberó. She was known throughout the town for her striking beauty and her talent for traditional Catalan dance. Every night, Selma would take to the streets, her skirt swirling around her ankles as she twirled and leaped with abandon.

Selma's passion for dance had been nurtured by her abuela, a wise and fierce woman who had taught her everything she knew. From the intricate footwork of the sardana to the dramatic poses of the baillota, Selma was a master of it all.

But Selma's life wasn't without its challenges. She lived in poverty with her mother, who struggled to make ends meet working long hours at the local market. Despite their hardships, Selma's family was proud of her talent and encouraged her to pursue her dreams.

One night, a representative from Barcelona arrived in town, seeking talented dancers to perform at the annual Festival de la Ballada. Selma saw this as her chance to shine and begged her abuela to let her audition.

The day of the audition arrived, and Selma's nerves were on edge. She danced with all her heart, pouring every ounce of emotion into each step. When she finished, the representative was taken aback by her skill and passion.

Selma was offered a spot in the festival, and over the next few weeks, she rehearsed tirelessly to prepare for the big night. On the evening of the performance, Selma's excitement was palpable as she took to the stage alongside some of the best dancers from all over Catalonia.

The crowd erupted into cheers as Selma danced with wild abandon, her movements weaving together in a joyful celebration of Catalan culture. She had found her place in the world and made her abuela proud.

From that day forward, Selma Corberó was hailed as a star of traditional Catalan dance, and her name became synonymous with beauty, passion, and dedication to her craft.
