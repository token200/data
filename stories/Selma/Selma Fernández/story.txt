Selma Fernández was a force to be reckoned with in the small town of San Miguel. As a young girl, she had always been fascinated by the old, abandoned mill on the outskirts of town. Rumors swirled that it was cursed, but Selma wasn't one to believe in superstitions.

As she grew older, Selma's curiosity only intensified. She spent countless hours exploring the mill's crumbling walls and imagining what life must have been like for the workers who once toiled within its stone confines. Her friends would often tease her about being a "mill girl," but Selma didn't care – she felt a deep connection to the place.

One fateful day, while wandering through the overgrown fields surrounding the mill, Selma stumbled upon an old key hidden amongst the weeds. It was a small, rusty thing, but something about it drew her in. Without hesitation, she inserted the key into the dusty lock on the mill's front door and turned it.

As the door creaked open, Selma Fernández stepped inside, feeling a thrill of excitement course through her veins. The air within the mill was musty and stale, but she breathed it in deeply, taking in the scent of decay and neglect. She wandered deeper into the building, her footsteps echoing off the walls as she explored room after room.

Selma discovered old machinery, covered in dust and cobwebs, and a small, hidden room tucked away behind a tattered curtain. It was there that she found an old journal belonging to one of the mill's former workers – a young girl named Sofia, who had died under mysterious circumstances decades ago.

As Selma Fernández read through Sofia's journal, she felt a sense of connection to this stranger that she couldn't explain. She began to unravel the secrets hidden within the mill's walls, and in doing so, discovered a piece of her own history that had been hidden for years. From that day forward, Selma Fernández was no longer just a curious girl – she was a guardian of the mill's past, determined to uncover its secrets and keep its stories alive.
