Selma Victoria Schneider was a force to be reckoned with in the small town of Willow Creek. As the owner of the local bakery, "Sweet Delights," Selma spent her days whipping up batches of flaky croissants and sugary pastries that drew in customers from all over.

Despite her success, Selma's life wasn't without its challenges. She had recently gone through a breakup with her long-term boyfriend, and the pain was still fresh. Her friends and family tried to be supportive, but Selma found herself withdrawing into her work, using the familiar rhythms of the bakery to soothe her frayed nerves.

One day, as Selma was prepping for the lunch rush, she received a surprise visit from her best friend, Rachel. Rachel had stopped by on her way home from a conference in the city and was eager to catch up. As they chatted over a cup of coffee and a warm pastry, Rachel probed Selma about her love life.

Selma hesitated, unsure of how much she wanted to share. But Rachel's kind eyes put her at ease, and soon she found herself opening up about her recent breakup. Rachel listened attentively, offering words of encouragement and support. As they talked, the bakery's door swung open, admitting a wave of hungry customers.

As Selma expertly juggled taking orders and serving food, Rachel chatted quietly beside her. The banter was like old times, and Selma felt her tension ease. For a few blissful hours, she forgot about her heartache and focused on making others happy with her baking.

By the end of the lunch rush, Selma's doubts had started to fade. She realized that Rachel was right – life was too short to spend it pining for someone who wasn't good enough. As the sun began to set over Willow Creek, Selma locked up the bakery and stepped outside into the crisp evening air.

Rachel walked beside her, chatting about plans for a future dinner date at the local winery. Selma smiled, feeling a spark of excitement. Maybe it was time to focus on herself, rather than waiting around for someone else to make her happy.

Selma Victoria Schneider took a deep breath, letting the cool breeze fill her lungs. She knew that with Rachel by her side, and the quiet comfort of her bakery, she could face whatever came next with confidence. And as they walked off into the sunset together, Selma felt a sense of peace wash over her – it was going to be an okay night after all.
