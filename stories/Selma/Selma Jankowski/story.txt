Selma Jankowski, a middle-aged woman with a wild mane of curly brown hair and a quick wit, sat at her kitchen table, sipping a cup of bitter coffee. She stared out the window, watching as the snowflakes gently fell onto the quiet suburban street below.

It had been ten years since Selma's husband, Jan, passed away. Ten years since their little house felt empty and still. But despite the ache in her heart, Selma had found a new sense of purpose. She had taken up painting, using her vibrant colors to bring joy to those around her.

As she mixed a new shade of blue on her palette, the doorbell rang. It was her neighbor, Mrs. Jenkins, who always brought over freshly baked cookies and a warm smile. Selma invited Mrs. Jenkins in, where they spent the next hour chatting about everything from gardening to grandkids' antics.

Selma's own granddaughter, Sophia, was coming to visit that weekend. She couldn't wait to show her the latest painting she had created – a stunning portrait of Jan, with his bright smile and twinkling eyes. Selma felt a lump form in her throat as she thought about sharing this art with the child who had grown up without knowing her grandfather.

Mrs. Jenkins noticed the wistful look on Selma's face and handed her another cookie. "You're still getting over him, aren't you?" she asked softly. Selma smiled weakly and shook her head.

"I'm just happy to see Sophia smile when she sees Jan," she said instead. Mrs. Jenkins nodded understandingly, knowing that for Selma, it wasn't about losing Jan but about keeping his memory alive through their daughter's eyes.

As the afternoon wore on, Selma worked on her latest masterpiece, using bold brushstrokes and vivid colors to capture the essence of her late husband. The painting began to take shape, a beautiful tribute to a man who had left an indelible mark on her life.

When Sophia arrived that weekend, Selma's heart swelled with pride as she handed over her finished art piece. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as the little girl gazed at Jan's portrait, and for a moment, time stood still. The pain of losing Jan still lingered, but in this moment, it was overshadowed by the joy of sharing their love with the next generation.

As the three of them hugged, Selma knew that even though life would never be the same without Jan, she had found a way to move forward – through art, love, and the memories they made together.
