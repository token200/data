Over the years, Selma Bonnet had built a loyal customer base and was revered for her creative flavor combinations.

Despite her success, Selma Bonnet faced numerous challenges. The town's health inspector, Mr. Johnson, seemed determined to shut down her bakery at any cost.

Panicked, she watched as her customers and employees fled the building. But instead of giving up, Selma Bonnet sprang into action.

With a sense of pride and accomplishment, Selma Bonnet smiled, knowing that her bakery was back, better than ever.
