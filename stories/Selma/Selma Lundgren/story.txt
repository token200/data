Selma Lundgren was a force to be reckoned with. A petite, spiky-haired woman in her mid-30s, she had a presence that belied her small stature. As a retired CIA operative turned private investigator, she had seen her fair share of danger and deception.

Selma's latest case began with a cryptic phone call from an old acquaintance - a former colleague who claimed to have stumbled upon a web of corruption that went all the way to the top of the FBI. The acquaintance had managed to gather some incriminating evidence, but he was too scared to come forward. That's where Selma came in.

As she sat at her desk, sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee, Selma's mind began to wander back to her own troubled past. She had left the CIA after a botched mission went sideways, and she'd never looked back. But the itch was always there - the feeling that she'd been played, that someone had manipulated her for their own gain.

Selma's eyes narrowed as she studied the evidence on her desk. The documents were thin on details, but they pointed to a trail of money laundering and bribery that snaked its way through the highest echelons of law enforcement. She knew it wouldn't be easy to take down the big fish - but she was nothing if not persistent.

As the sun began to set outside her office window, Selma's phone rang again. This time, it was a low, gravelly voice on the other end. "Selma Lundgren," he growled. "I see you're sniffing around."

"Who is this?" Selma demanded, her grip on the receiver tightening.

"You know exactly who I am," the voice sneered. "You used to work for me. And now, it seems like you're trying to take me down."

Selma's eyes flashed with anger. She knew she was in over her head - but she wouldn't back down. Not yet, at least.

"Tell me what you want," Selma spat, her voice cold as ice.

There was a pause on the other end of the line, and for a moment, Selma wondered if they'd lost connection. But then, the voice spoke again. "I want you to know that I'm watching you, Lundgren. And when it's time to pay the price...you'll be the one who's in trouble."

The line went dead, leaving Selma to ponder the sinister message. She knew she had just scratched the surface of a much larger conspiracy - and she was more determined than ever to see it through. The game was on, and Selma Lundgren was ready to play.
