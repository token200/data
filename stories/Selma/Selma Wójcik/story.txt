Selma Wójcik was a force to be reckoned with in her small Polish town. Born and raised in the quaint village of Strzelce, she had always been known for her fiery spirit and sharp tongue. As a young girl, Selma would often get into mischief with her friends, causing trouble wherever they went.

But as she grew older, Selma's antics became less frequent and more calculated. She began to use her wit and charm to manipulate those around her, getting what she wanted without breaking a sweat. Her friends and family were both fascinated and intimidated by her, often unsure of how to react when Selma was in the room.

One day, the village council announced that they would be hosting a grand festival in honor of their patron saint, Saint Casimir. The villagers were excited, but also a bit skeptical - after all, the last festival had ended in disaster when the bouncy castle collapsed on top of the mayor's head.

Selma saw an opportunity to shine and threw herself into the preparations, taking charge of the festival's entertainment committee with her usual flair. She spent hours planning the perfect schedule of events, from traditional folk dancing to a modern DJ set that would surely get the crowd moving.

As the big day approached, Selma's reputation as the festival's chief organizer spread far and wide. People came from all over to see the woman who was rumored to be able to make even the most mundane event into a spectacle. And when the night of the festival finally arrived, Selma Wójcik was ready.

With her quick wit, infectious energy, and expertly curated playlist, she kept the crowd entertained from dawn till dusk. The festival was a huge success, with even the mayor admitting that he had never laughed so hard in his life. And as for Selma? She lapped up all the attention like a cat in cream, basking in her own glory as the undisputed queen of Strzelce's annual Saint Casimir Festival.
