Selma Maria Wisniewski was a quiet, unassuming woman with a passion for taxidermy. She spent most of her days in her cluttered workshop, surrounded by the remnants of her latest projects: stuffed rabbits, mounted squirrels, and even a few deceased hummingbirds.

Despite her love for the macabre, Selma was never mean-spirited or gruesome. In fact, she found solace in the art of preserving life's fleeting moments, freezing time for creatures that would otherwise be nothing more than memories.

One day, as Selma was busy preparing a new specimen for display, there was a knock at the door. It was her best friend, Sophie, who had just moved into the apartment above Selma's workshop. Sophie was immediately drawn to the peculiar collection of creatures on display and asked if she could help Selma with her latest project.

Selma, hesitant at first, soon found herself opening up to Sophie about her life as a taxidermist. As they worked together, Sophie discovered that there was more to Selma than met the eye. The two women chatted long into the night, sharing stories and laughter, their bond growing stronger with each passing hour.

As the days turned into weeks, Sophie found herself becoming an integral part of Selma's life. She'd help her with her work, assist in the cleaning and preparation of specimens, and even offer her own advice on matters beyond taxidermy.

Selma Wisniewski had never felt so seen or understood before. For the first time in years, she felt like she could be herself without apology or pretension. And Sophie was always there to support her, offering a listening ear and a comforting presence whenever Selma needed it most.

As they sat amidst the stuffed animals and hummingbirds, surrounded by the quiet of the workshop, Selma turned to Sophie with a smile and said, "Thank you for being here, my dear friend. You've brought light into my life when I thought it was lost forever."
