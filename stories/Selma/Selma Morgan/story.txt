Selma Morgan was known for her razor-sharp wit and quick tongue, but few people knew that beneath her tough exterior lay a heart of gold. As a renowned detective in the city of New Haven, Selma had solved some of the most baffling cases in recent memory.

One evening, as she was pouring over a stack of files in her office, Selma received an urgent call from the mayor's office. A priceless artifact had been stolen from the city museum, and the police department needed her expertise to track it down. Without hesitation, Selma packed her bags and set out for the museum, determined to crack the case.

As she surveyed the crime scene, Selma's eyes narrowed behind her signature cat-eye glasses. She noticed a faint smudge of powder on the windowsill, which she recognized as a rare type of silica found only in a few locations around the world. This was no ordinary theft; someone had deliberately left a trail for her to follow.

Selma spent the next several hours poring over the evidence, connecting the dots between seemingly unrelated pieces of information. Her remarkable mind worked tirelessly, making connections and eliminating theories with ease. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Selma had a breakthrough - a small inscription on the artifact's pedestal that read "For the eyes of the collector alone."

With newfound excitement, Selma set out to track down the elusive thief. She followed a series of cryptic clues, each one leading her deeper into the world of high-stakes art dealing and black market collectors. It wasn't until she received an anonymous tip that led her straight to the doorstep of a luxurious mansion on the outskirts of town that Selma finally pieced together the puzzle.

With her keen instincts guiding her, Selma Morgan infiltrated the mansion and apprehended the thief - none other than a wealthy collector who had been hiding in plain sight. The artifact was recovered, and Selma's reputation as one of the best detectives in the city was solidified once again.
