Julia Rosén stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of her friend, Lena. It had been weeks since they'd last spoken, and Julia was starting to get worried. She spotted a familiar figure sitting by the window, sipping on a cup of coffee.

As she approached, Lena looked up, a hint of surprise crossing her face. "Julia! I wasn't expecting you," she said, setting down her cup.

Julia took a seat across from Lena and ordered a drink. They chatted idly at first, catching up on each other's lives. Julia filled Lena in on her latest art project, which had been consuming most of her time. Lena listened intently, asking thoughtful questions that showed she was genuinely interested.

As the conversation flowed, Julia couldn't help but notice the way the afternoon light filtering through the window highlighted Lena's features. She had always admired her friend's striking cheekbones and sharp jawline. Suddenly, a pang of jealousy struck her. Why did Lena get to be so effortlessly confident and put-together?

Lena seemed to sense Julia's distraction and leaned in, her voice taking on a more serious tone. "Hey, Julia? Is everything okay? You seem a bit...off."

Julia hesitated, unsure how much to share. But something about Lena's kind eyes made her open up. She confessed her insecurities about her art, feeling like she was never good enough. Lena listened attentively, nodding along and making supportive noises.

As they talked, Julia felt a weight lifting off her shoulders. For the first time in weeks, she felt seen and understood. When Lena finally spoke up, her words were like balm to Julia's soul: "You're an incredible artist, Julia Rosén. Your talent is undeniable."

Julia smiled, feeling a sense of gratitude wash over her. She knew that Lena was trying to make her feel better, but it was more than just the words themselves – it was the way Lena believed in her. It was the unwavering support and encouragement that made Julia feel like she could conquer anything.

As they parted ways, Julia felt a renewed sense of purpose. She realized that it wasn't about being perfect; it was about creating something from scratch, with all its imperfections and quirks. And with Lena by her side, she knew she could face whatever challenges came her way.
