Julia Dubois was a free-spirited artist who had always followed her heart, even if it meant taking a few unconventional paths in life. Growing up, she had been fascinated by the world of art and music, spending hours sketching and playing her guitar. As she grew older, Julia's passion for creativity only intensified, leading her to attend art school and study fine arts.

She lived in Paris for a time, where she was exposed to the works of Monet and Renoir, and later, in New Orleans, where jazz music filled the air.
