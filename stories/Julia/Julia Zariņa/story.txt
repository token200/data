With a small backpack slung over her shoulder, Julia made her way through the station, weaving past tourists and locals alike. She had booked a room at a small hostel on the outskirts of town, where she could focus on her research without distractions.

As she walked, Julia's mind wandered back to her childhood conversations with Jelena. Her grandmother had spoken fondly of their ancestors' bravery during the war, but also hinted at a darker history that Julia was determined to uncover.

As the night wore on, Julia felt a sense of excitement building within her. She was one step closer to uncovering the truth about her family's history. With renewed energy, she dove back into her research, determined to bring her ancestors' stories to life.

In the morning, Julia set out to explore the city, searching for any landmarks or museums that might hold a connection to her family's past. As she wandered through the streets of Riga, she felt a sense of pride and connection to her Latvian heritage. Julia Zariņa was one step closer to understanding her family's complex history, and she couldn't wait to see what other secrets lay hidden in the city's ancient stones.
