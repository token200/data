Julia Fern치ndez Gonz치lez stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. She had been waiting for this moment for months, and finally, she was here. The small town of San Juan was where her family had moved when she was a child, seeking a fresh start after her parents' messy divorce.

As she made her way through the crowds, Julia's thoughts turned to her past. Growing up, she had always felt like an outsider in her own family. Her mother had remarried soon after the divorce, and Julia's new stepfather had been cold and distant towards her. She had often found solace in books, escaping into the worlds of her favorite authors.

Now, at 25, Julia was back in San Juan to sort out some unfinished business. Her father, who had moved away years ago, had recently passed away, leaving her his old workshop and a note with a single instruction: "Come home and finish what we started."

Julia's heart swelled as she thought about the projects her father had been working on before he died. She had always loved watching him work, mesmerized by the way his hands moved deftly over the wood and metal. He had taught her everything he knew, from carpentry to mechanics.

As she walked through the streets of San Juan, Julia felt a sense of nostalgia wash over her. The town was still small and quiet, but it had changed in ways she couldn't quite put her finger on. She stopped in front of the old workshop, now empty and for sale. Julia Fern치ndez Gonz치lez took a deep breath, feeling a sense of purpose settle within her.

She knew that this was just the beginning of a new chapter in her life. Julia pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside, ready to face whatever lay ahead. The tools and materials were still there, waiting for her. It was time to finish what she and her father had started all those years ago.
