Julia Maria had always been a free spirit, never content to be tied down by convention or tradition. Growing up in a small town in the Pacific Northwest, she felt suffocated by the expectations of her family and community. So, as soon as she turned 18, Julia Maria set out on her own, determined to make a name for herself.

She traveled to Europe, where she spent several years studying art and photography.

Her work caught the attention of galleries in Paris and Berlin, and soon she was hailed as one of the most exciting young artists of her generation.

But despite her success, Julia Maria couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. She longed for a sense of belonging, a place where she could call home. So, after several years on the road, she made the decision to settle in Los Angeles, a city that offered her both inspiration and opportunity.
