Julia Karlsson stepped into the quiet caf√©, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee and staring out the window at the rain-soaked streets of Stockholm.

As she approached, he looked up, catching her gaze with a warm smile. "Julia," he said, setting his cup down on the table.

Their friend, Alexei Petrov, nodded in greeting as Julia took a seat across from him. The three had been inseparable since college, sharing late-night laughter and early-morning breakfasts over endless cups of coffee.

"What brings you out today?" Julia asked, trying to gauge the reason behind his solemn demeanor. "You're not exactly the rain-and-coffee type."

Alexei sighed, running a hand through his dark hair. "I've been going through some stuff lately," he admitted, his voice low and serious. "My family's business is in trouble. I don't know if we'll be able to keep it afloat."

Julia's eyes widened with concern as she reached out and placed a reassuring hand on Alexei's arm. "What does that mean exactly?" she asked, leaning in closer.

"It means my parents are going to have to lay off most of the staff," he explained, his voice heavy with worry. "And I'm not sure if we can stay afloat without them."

Julia's face fell as she processed the news. She had always known that Alexei came from a prominent family in Moscow, but she had no idea it was this bad.

Without thinking, Julia reached into her bag and pulled out a worn notebook and pen. "Tell me everything," she said, her eyes locked on his as they began to pour their hearts out over steaming cups of coffee.

For the next hour, they discussed financials and business strategies, brainstorming ideas for saving the family's struggling empire. Julia listened attentively, offering words of encouragement and advice when needed.

As the rain continued to fall outside, the three friends worked together, fueled by caffeine and determination, determined to find a solution to Alexei's troubles.

When they finally wrapped up their conversation, Julia leaned back in her chair, feeling drained but also strangely energized. "We'll figure it out," she said, smiling at Alexei with newfound confidence.
