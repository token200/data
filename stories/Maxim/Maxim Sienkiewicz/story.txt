Maxim Sienkiewicz stepped out of the rain-soaked streets and into the dimly lit caf√©. He had been waiting for what felt like an eternity, nursing his whiskey on the rocks as he watched the crowd shift through the door. A small-time underworld figure with a penchant for high-stakes poker and higher risks, Maxim was known to those in the know as "The Shadow King."

As he waited, a sleek-haired woman slid into the booth across from him. Her eyes sparkled like diamonds in the low light, and her smile could charm the devil himself. She was Lena Lashnov, the daughter of a Russian mafia kingpin with connections that went all the way to Moscow.

"Max," she said, her voice husky as a snake's whisper, "I have something for you."

Lena pulled out a folder from her bag and slid it across the table. Maxim opened it, his eyes scanning the contents before his gaze narrowed.

"What is it?" he asked, his tone dripping with curiosity.

"A little business proposition," she replied, a hint of mischief dancing in her eyes. "My father wants to invest in something new. A venture that requires... discretion."

Maxim raised an eyebrow as Lena began to explain the details. He listened intently, calculating the risks and potential rewards as he sipped his whiskey.

"You think I'm crazy enough for this," she said, a smile playing on her lips.

"I think you're just smart enough to realize when someone else is crazy too," Maxim replied, pushing the folder back across the table. "Tell your father I'll take it."

Lena laughed, a throaty sound that sent shivers down Maxim's spine. She leaned in close, her breath warm against his ear.

"I thought you'd say that."
