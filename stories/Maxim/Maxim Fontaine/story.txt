Maxim Fontaine stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the dimly lit station. He had been gone for years, but the familiar scent of damp earth and decaying wood still brought him back to this place. As he made his way through the deserted streets, the cold breeze whipping his dark hair into a frenzy, Maxim felt a sense of restlessness settle over him.

He had come back to Ashwood, the small town where he grew up, for one reason: to find out what had happened to Emilia. They had been inseparable as children, exploring the woods and sharing secrets that only they understood. But on their tenth birthday, Emilia vanished without a word, leaving Maxim with more questions than answers.

As he walked, the buildings seemed to loom over him, casting long shadows in the fading light. Maxim's thoughts turned to the letter he had received just days before, hinting at Emilia's presence in Ashwood once more. The words danced on the page, taunting him with possibilities and doubts.

He stopped outside the old Fontaine estate, its facade weathered and worn, a testament to the passing of time. Maxim felt a pang of nostalgia as he gazed up at the crumbling stones. His family had lived here for generations, but now the house stood as a relic of a bygone era, a reminder of what was lost.

As night began to fall, Maxim made his way into town, seeking out any leads on Emilia's whereabouts. At the local pub, he struck up a conversation with an old man named Jack, who claimed to have seen her walking in these very streets years ago.

Over a mug of ale, Jack revealed that Emilia had been involved with a group of artists and misfits, living on the fringes of society. They called themselves the Wanderers, and their aim was to capture the essence of Ashwood's forgotten places. Maxim felt a spark ignite within him as he listened to the old man's words.

As the night wore on, Maxim knew that his journey had only just begun. He would have to follow Emilia's trail, tracking down the Wanderers and unraveling the mysteries that had haunted him for so long. With a newfound sense of purpose, Maxim stepped back into the darkness, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
