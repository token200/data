Maximilian "Max" Alsbach was a man with a reputation for being fearless and unpredictable. As a former thief and con artist, he had earned his share of enemies on the streets of Berlin. But after a stint in prison, Max had tried to leave his past life behind him.

He now ran a small antique shop in the city's trendy Kreuzberg neighborhood, where he spent his days restoring old clocks and selling them to wealthy collectors. It was a far cry from his days of swiping diamonds and selling forged art, but it suited Max just fine.

One day, a mysterious woman walked into his shop, her eyes scanning the shelves with an air of curiosity. She introduced herself as Sophia, and Max could tell she was trouble from the start. She asked to see some of his rarest pieces, and Max obliged, showing her a beautiful golden locket and a vintage pocket watch.

As they haggled over the price, Max couldn't help but notice that Sophia seemed...off. Her hands were always wet, even when it was dry outside, and her eyes kept darting to the door as if she expected someone to burst in at any moment.

Despite his reservations, Max found himself growing more and more drawn to Sophia. Maybe it was because he sensed a kindred spirit in her - someone who understood the thrill of living on the edge. Whatever it was, Max knew he had to keep up with Sophia, even if it meant putting himself in danger.

As they left the shop, Max called out after her, "Sophia, wait! We're not done yet." She turned back, a sly smile spreading across her face, and said, "Oh, I think we are, Maximilian Alsbach. But don't worry - I'll be seeing you soon."

Max watched as Sophia disappeared into the crowded streets, feeling a shiver run down his spine. He had no idea what she was capable of, but he knew one thing for sure: with Sophia on the scene, life was never going to be dull again.
