Maxim Jhih-hao was a master thief known for his cunning and agility. He had spent years honing his skills on the streets of Taipei, earning him a reputation as one of the most elusive figures in the underworld. His full name, Maxim Jhih-hao, was whispered in fear by those who knew of his exploits.

One night, Maxim received a message from an old acquaintance, requesting a meeting at the ancient Wisteria Temple on the outskirts of the city. The note read: "Meet me under the blooming wisterias at midnight. Come alone." Intrigued, Maxim decided to take on the challenge.

As he approached the temple, he noticed a figure cloaked in shadows waiting for him by the entrance. The air was thick with anticipation as Maxim revealed his face, and to his surprise, it was none other than his former partner-in-crime, Lily Lee.

Lily had gone rogue years ago, stealing from the very same organizations that had once employed Maxim. He had thought he'd never see her again, but here she was, asking for a truce. Over tea and pastries, Lily revealed that she had discovered a valuable artifact hidden within the temple walls – an ancient scroll with secrets of the gods.

As they pored over the scroll's intricate script, Maxim realized that this discovery could be his ticket to the big leagues. With Lily's expertise and his own cunning, they could sell this artifact for a fortune, leaving them both set for life.

But as they delved deeper into the scroll, they began to suspect that they weren't alone in the temple. Footsteps echoed through the halls, growing louder with each passing moment. It seemed that they had an audience – and not just any audience, but one of the most ruthless collectors in Taipei.

With their hearts racing, Maxim turned to Lily and whispered: "We need to get out of here, now." Together, they fled into the night, leaving behind a trail of whispers about the infamous duo's next move. The name Maxim Jhih-hao would continue to be whispered in awe – but for how much longer?
