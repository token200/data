I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Alain Bērziņš. It is possible that you may have provided incorrect or incomplete information.

However, I can suggest some famous Latvian historical and cultural figures:

1. Alfrēds Berziņš - A Latvian painter who was active in the early 20th century.
2. Edvīns Bērziņš - A Latvian politician and lawyer who served as a Minister of Education and Culture.

If you would like, I can create a fictional character profile for one of these individuals or suggest alternative characters. Please let me know.
