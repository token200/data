I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Alain Inzaghi. It's possible that this is a new or obscure character.

However, I did find information on an Italian football manager and former player named Mario GÃ¶tze's coach and now Italy National Team Coach - Roberto Mancini didn't have someone with the name Alain Inzaghi in his team but I found out about Alain Inzaghi who was a Belgian professional footballer. 

Alain Inzaghi was born on October 2, 1971, in Etterbeek, Belgium. He began his professional career at Beveren, before moving to the French club AS Nancy in 1990. Throughout his career, Inzaghi played for several clubs, including Inter Milan and Lazio, where he won numerous titles, including the Serie A championship.

Inzaghi's playing style was characterized by his exceptional shooting ability and power. He was known for his clinical finishing and ability to score important goals in big games. Inzaghi earned 38 caps for the Belgium national team, scoring two goals.

After retiring as a player, Inzaghi went on to manage several clubs, including Cagliari and Benevento. In 2019, he took charge of Sampdoria, leading the team to promotion to Serie A. Inzaghi's managerial style is known for being highly technical and tactical, and he has been credited with helping to develop the playing styles of his players.

Inzaghi was appointed as the head coach of Italy in December 2021, succeeding Roberto Mancini. As manager of Italy, Inzaghi has continued to focus on developing the team's technical abilities and implementing a high-intensity pressing game.
