Alain Églitis was a man with a unique profession - he was a professional "memory detective." His agency, Eglitis & Associates, specialized in solving mysteries and crimes related to forgotten memories.

One day, a wealthy businessman named Henry Smith approached Alain Églitis, seeking his help. Smith claimed that he had lost his wife's engagement ring, which held great sentimental value, and suspected that one of his employees had stolen it.

Églitis began by interviewing the employee, who seemed genuinely distraught about the loss of the ring. However, Églitis noticed something peculiar - the employee was hesitant to meet Smith's gaze when discussing the incident. He decided to dig deeper, using his skills in memory manipulation and analysis.

Using a specialized technique called "brain mapping," Églitis created an intricate mental image of the employee's thoughts on the day of the alleged theft. The results were surprising: the employee had indeed seen someone else handling the ring that day, but it wasn't one of Smith's employees.

Églitis then asked Smith to close his eyes and recall every detail about the lost ring. When he opened them again, Smith revealed a crucial piece of information - the ring was actually last seen on his business partner, Emma Lee.

With this new lead, Églitis arranged a discreet meeting between Smith and Lee. After some awkward conversation, it became clear that Lee had indeed taken the ring, but not for personal gain. He had been trying to repay a debt he owed to Smith's late wife, who had helped him financially before her passing.

Smith was relieved to have his memories clarified, and he thanked Églitis for solving the case. As Églitis watched Smith walk away, satisfied with a job well done, he couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction in having brought closure to two troubled souls.

With this successful resolution, Alain Églitis's reputation as a memory detective continued to grow. People began to whisper about his extraordinary abilities, and more cases like Smith's started pouring in. As the days passed, Églitis & Associates became the go-to agency for those seeking answers to life's most puzzling mysteries.
