I couldn't find any information on a well-known or famous person named Alain Kalejs. It's possible that Alain Kalejs is a private individual or not a public figure. 

However, I found that there was a Latvian serial killer named Alans Kalejs. Here's a story based on him:

Alans Kalejs, born in 1959 in the Soviet Union, grew up in a world where his country was ruled by strict communist ideology. The cold and harsh climate of Latvia suited him little, but he learned to adapt. 

However, Alans Kalejs' childhood experiences were marked by violence and abuse. His father, who had also been a serial killer, would often beat him when he misbehaved. This violent upbringing instilled in Alans Kalejs the art of killing and left deep scars.

After the fall of communism, Alans Kalejs fled Latvia and made his way to the United States, where he was allowed to settle due to his Latvian heritage. He married a woman named Sandra Titovs and had two children with her.

Despite being in a stable relationship, Alans Kalejs continued to exhibit violent tendencies. In 2001, he strangled his wife, Sandra, in their Florida home. His own children were forced to witness this tragedy. 

In 2002, Alans Kalejs was arrested for the murder of his wife and sentenced to life imprisonment in the United States.
