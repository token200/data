Alain Straume trudged through the snow-covered streets of Oslo, his eyes fixed on the small café in front of him. He had been searching for this place for weeks, and finally, he had found it – a tiny, unassuming spot that seemed to be hiding from the world.

As a child, Alain had always felt like an outsider. His mother, a French artist, had left when he was just a baby, and his father, a Norwegian writer, had been too busy with his own writing to care for him properly. He had grown up in foster homes, never quite finding his place in the world.

But as he grew older, Alain discovered his passion for music – the way the notes seemed to dance on the page, the way the rhythm pulsed through his veins like lifeblood. He spent hours playing in his room, lost in the sounds of Chopin and Debussy, until it was all that mattered.

Now, at 25, Alain had come back to Oslo with a dream – to become a composer, to leave his mark on the world. He had applied for every job he could find, but so far, no one seemed to take him seriously. They laughed at his French accent, told him he was too old, too young.

As he pushed open the door to the café, Alain felt a surge of hope. Maybe this place would be different. Maybe someone here would see something in him that he didn't even see himself.

The waitress, a friendly woman with a kind smile, greeted him warmly and showed him to a small table by the window. As he sipped his coffee and listened to the soft hum of conversation outside, Alain began to feel a sense of peace wash over him.

That's when he saw her – a young woman with long, curly hair and bright blue eyes, sitting at the bar and writing in a notebook. There was something about her that seemed familiar, like they shared a secret language only they could understand.

As Alain watched, she looked up and caught his eye. For a moment, they just stared at each other, the world around them melting away. Then, she smiled, and he felt his heart skip a beat.

"Hi," she said, getting up from her seat and walking over to him. "I'm Lena."

"I'm Alain," he replied, feeling a little shy but also incredibly excited.

As they talked, Alain discovered that Lena was a writer, just like her father before her. She had always been fascinated by music, too – the way it could evoke emotions and create entire worlds.

Together, they sat at his table, sipping coffee and talking for hours, lost in conversation like two old friends. For the first time in his life, Alain felt like he had found someone who truly understood him – someone who saw the world through the same notes and rhythms that he did.

As the sun began to set outside, casting a golden glow over the city, Alain knew that this was just the beginning of something special.
