Alain Mastroianni was a man of mystery, with an air of confidence that commanded attention. His full name, Alain Francoise Mastroianni, echoed through the halls of his family's Italian restaurant, where he had grown up learning the art of cooking from his father.

As a young boy, Alain would spend hours in the kitchen, watching his father expertly chop vegetables and stir sauces.
