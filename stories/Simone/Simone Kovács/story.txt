Simone Kovács stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. She had arrived in Budapest after weeks of traveling through Eastern Europe, and the once-familiar streets now seemed foreign. As she made her way to the baggage claim, Simone couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

A figure emerged from the shadows, dressed in a worn leather jacket and sporting a scruffy beard. "Simone Kovács?" he asked, his voice low and gravelly.

She nodded warily, unsure of what to expect.

The man handed her a small package wrapped in brown paper. "From your... associates," he said, before turning and disappearing into the crowd.

Simone watched him go, confusion swirling inside her. Who were these people, and how did they know her name?

As she made her way through the station, Simone couldn't shake the feeling that someone was following her. She quickened her pace, weaving through the crowds of tourists and locals alike. Eventually, she emerged onto the streets of Pest, where the sounds and smells of the city hit her like a slap in the face.

She hailed a taxi and gave the driver an address on the outskirts of town. The ride was short, but the silence was oppressive, and Simone found herself wondering what she had gotten herself into.

When they arrived at the address, Simone Kovács stepped out of the taxi and onto the crumbling pavement. A small, weathered building stood before her, its windows boarded up and its door covered in vines. She took a deep breath, steeling herself for what was to come.

As she pushed open the creaky door, a faint light spilled out, illuminating the darkness. Simone stepped inside, her eyes adjusting slowly to the dimness. The air was thick with dust and the scent of decay.

A figure emerged from the shadows, its features indistinct. "Welcome, Simone Kovács," it said, its voice dripping with an unnerving familiarity.

Simone's heart skipped a beat as she realized that this person knew her name, too. She took a step back, her mind racing with questions and fears. Who was this person? And what did they want from her?

As the figure drew closer, Simone Kovács felt a sense of trepidation wash over her. She had traveled far and wide to escape the shadows of her past, but it seemed that she was still very much a part of them.
