Simone Salonen was a force to be reckoned with. A former professional snowboarder, she had spent her entire life chasing the rush of speeding down a mountain, the wind whipping through her hair as she soared through the powdery white landscape.

But after a near-fatal wipeout left her with a severely injured knee, Simone was forced to reevaluate her priorities. She spent months recovering, watching as others took up the sport that had once defined her life. When she finally emerged from her rehabilitation, Simone felt lost and uncertain about what to do next.

It wasn't until she stumbled upon an old photograph of herself, taken on a family ski trip when she was just a child, that the seed of an idea began to take root. In the photo, Simone's bright smile and infectious laugh seemed to capture something fundamental to her being - a love of adventure, a need for freedom.

Emboldened by this newfound clarity, Simone set about transforming her home studio into a workshop, where she could channel her creativity and passion into something entirely new. With the help of a friend who was a skilled craftsman, Simone began experimenting with woodworking and design.

As she worked tirelessly on projects ranging from intricately carved wooden spoons to hand-crafted leather jackets, Simone discovered that the same thrill of creation she had once felt on the slopes could now be found in the quiet satisfaction of bringing a beautiful piece into being. The world may have changed her sport, but it hadn't changed her spirit.

Years went by and Simone became famous for her bespoke wooden furniture pieces, which were highly sought after by interior designers and homeowners who wanted to add unique touches to their homes. Simone's passion project turned out to be an incredible success and she found herself living a life filled with beauty, adventure and purpose.

And although the snowboard still lingered in her past, Simone knew that there was always more than one way to find your thrill.
