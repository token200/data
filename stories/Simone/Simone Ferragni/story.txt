Simone Keanu Ferragni was known for her sharp wit and infectious laugh in the fashion world. As the daughter of Italian billionaire Massimo Ferragni, she had grown up surrounded by luxury brands and high-society events.

Despite her privileged upbringing, Simone had carved out a name for herself as a respected fashion influencer and entrepreneur. Her passion for sustainable fashion and social justice was evident in everything she did, from her Instagram feed to her e-commerce platform, 99% of which went towards supporting local designers and charities.

One sunny morning, Simone strolled through the streets of SoHo, taking in the vibrant colors and eclectic mix of boutiques. She had a meeting with a potential investor for her latest project – a line of eco-friendly clothing that would not only reduce waste but also provide jobs for underprivileged communities.

As she walked into the boutique, Simone's eyes scanned the room, searching for her contact. Suddenly, a friendly face emerged from behind the counter, and they exchanged warm hugs. It was Rachel, an old friend who shared Simone's love for sustainable fashion.

The two women sat down to discuss the intricacies of the project, brainstorming ideas and strategizing ways to make it a success. Simone was impressed by Rachel's expertise in marketing and her passion for social responsibility.

With a clear plan in place, Simone and Rachel set out to bring their vision to life. They spent the rest of the day meeting with suppliers, discussing fabrics, and finalizing the designs. As the sun began to set, Simone knew that this was just the beginning of something special – a fashion line that would not only make a profit but also leave a lasting impact on the world.

Back in her Manhattan apartment, Simone smiled as she looked at her laptop screen, where the words "99% Fashion" shone brightly. She felt proud to be a part of a movement that was changing the way people thought about fashion and sustainability. With a sense of determination, Simone leaned forward, ready to take on the world – one outfit at a time.
