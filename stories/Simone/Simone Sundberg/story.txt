Simone Sundberg stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her bright blue eyes scanning the small town of Ravenswood as if searching for something – or someone. She had been away for years, chasing dreams and making mistakes, but now she was back, determined to reconnect with the past.

As a child, Simone Sundberg had spent countless summers in this very town, exploring the woods and playing in the creek that ran through its heart. Her parents had settled here after college, and Simone's mother had grown up playing the same piano tunes on their old upright at home as her own mother had done before her.

Simone pulled out her phone to check for messages, but there was only silence. She sighed and began to make her way down Main Street, passing by the same old shops and restaurants that had been a part of her childhood. The smell of freshly baked bread wafted from the bakery, transporting her back to afternoons spent helping Mrs. Larson with errands.

As she turned onto Elm Street, Simone noticed an old, dusty storefront with a faded sign creaking in the breeze – Sundberg's Music Emporium. A shiver ran down her spine as she pushed open the door, stepping into the store that had once been the center of her world.

The store was dimly lit, but Simone's eyes adjusted quickly to the faint sunlight filtering through the grimy windows. She spotted Mrs. Sundberg – or rather, her mother – sitting behind the counter, surrounded by stacks of old records and sheet music. Her hair was grayer now, but her smile was still warm as she looked up from behind a pair of reading glasses perched on the end of her nose.

"Simone!" she exclaimed, rushing to hug her daughter tightly. "I've missed you so much!"

Over coffee and freshly baked cookies, Simone Sundberg filled her mother in on her travels and misadventures – stories that had changed little since their childhood days of exploring the woods and writing poetry by the creek.

As they chatted, Simone noticed an old piano sitting quietly against one wall. She walked over to examine it more closely, feeling a connection to this instrument as if she were home again.

"I think we should start playing together again," Simone said softly, running her fingers over the keys.

Her mother smiled knowingly – and took her hand.
