As the issue of her magazine hit the stands, Simone Jiménez López received an outpouring of support from readers who were inspired by Maria's courage and resilience. The article sparked a national conversation about homelessness and poverty, and Simone was hailed as a hero for her tireless work on behalf of those in need.
