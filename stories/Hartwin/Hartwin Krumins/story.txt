Hartwin Krumins stepped into the crowded tavern, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As the self-appointed leader of the local watch, he had seen it all - from petty theft to outright violence. But tonight was different. Tonight, he sensed a malevolent presence lurking in the shadows.

As he made his way to the bar, a familiar face caught his eye. It was old Tom, the village baker's son, who had always been a bit of a troublemaker. Hartwin Krumins watched with interest as Tom huddled in the corner, whispering to a hooded figure.

Hartwin Krumins made his way over, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword. "What seems to be the problem, Tom?" he asked, his voice firm but friendly.

Tom looked up, a sly grin spreading across his face. "Just discussing the finer points of mischief with our new friend here," he said, nodding towards the hooded figure.

Hartwin Krumins's eyes narrowed. He didn't like this one bit. "I think you'll find that your friend isn't welcome in these parts," he said, his hand tightening on the hilt of his sword.

The hooded figure slowly stood up, revealing a lean, agile young woman with piercing green eyes. She smiled at Hartwin Krumins, and for a moment, he felt a spark of curiosity rather than hostility.

"I'm not here to cause trouble," she said, her voice husky and confident. "I'm just looking for information. About the village."

Hartwin Krumins raised an eyebrow. This was no ordinary villager. He studied her face, searching for any hint of deception. But all he saw was a quiet determination.

"Very well," he said finally, sheathing his sword. "I'll give you access to our records. But be warned, Hartwin Krumins has eyes and ears everywhere. If I sense even a whiff of trouble..."

The young woman smiled again, her eyes glinting in the firelight. And for a moment, Hartwin Krumins wondered if he was making a mistake.
