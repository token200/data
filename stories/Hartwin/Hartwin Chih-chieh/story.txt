Hartwin Chih-chieh sat at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of papers in front of him. As the director of research for the prestigious Waltham Institute, he was no stranger to stress and pressure. But nothing could have prepared him for the latest development.

Just as he was about to call it a day, one of his assistants burst into the room, looking frazzled. "Dr. Chih-chieh, we've received word from the university," she said, out of breath. "The esteemed Dr. Reginald Pembroke has been awarded the Golden Apple Award for outstanding contributions to science."

Hartwin's eyes narrowed. He and Pembroke had a long-standing feud, with each accusing the other of intellectual dishonesty and methodological malpractice. The very thought that Pembroke was being honored in such a way made his blood boil.

As he listened to the assistant continue her report, Hartwin couldn't help but feel a twinge of jealousy. He had always known that he was on the cusp of a major breakthrough – one that would change the face of their field forever. But it seemed as though Pembroke's luck had finally caught up with him.

Determined to put an end to this travesty, Hartwin made his way to the university's headquarters, where the Golden Apple Award ceremony was being held. He arrived just in time for the main event, and as he scanned the room, his eyes locked onto Pembroke, resplendent in a gleaming gold suit.

The rest of the evening was a blur of awkward small talk and forced smiles. Hartwin's frustration boiled over when Pembroke took the stage to accept his award, speaking glowingly about the "collaboration" that had led to his success. Collaboration? The man had plagiarized every paper in sight!

Just as Hartwin was about to confront him directly, a young woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair slipped onto the stage beside him. She smiled sweetly at Pembroke, who mistook it for admiration.

"Hartwin Chih-chieh," she said, turning to face him. "I see you're enjoying yourself."

Hartwin's jaw dropped as he realized that this was Dr. Mei-Ling Liu – a brilliant physicist and his latest research partner. For the first time in months, he felt a sense of hope.

As they exchanged whispered words about Pembroke's deceitful nature, Hartwin couldn't help but wonder: had he finally found an ally?
