One day, while excavating a recently discovered site in Peru, Hartwin stumbled upon an intricate stone carving depicting a mythical creature with wings. The artifact was unlike anything he had ever seen before, and his curiosity was piqued. As he carefully transported the relic to his makeshift laboratory, he couldn't shake off the feeling that this discovery was only the beginning of something much bigger.

With shaking hands, he transcribed the ancient language etched into the stone figure, and the world around him came alive with new meaning. The mythical creature depicted in the carving was not just a random design – it was a gateway to an entire forgotten realm.

As Hartwin's discovery sent shockwaves through the academic community, he couldn't help but smile at his own success. He had spent years searching for this moment, and now, finally, he had found it. For Hartwin Sánchez-Gijón, there was no greater reward than uncovering the secrets of the past.
