One fateful night, Hartwin received an invitation from a wealthy patron, requesting his presence at a masquerade ball in the countryside. The patron promised riches and rewards beyond Hartwin's wildest dreams, but there was something unsettling about the invitation, as if it came from someone who knew more about him than he cared to admit.

Hartwin arrived at the ball, his black domino mask glinting in the candlelight.

But as he danced and laughed with the patrons, a hint of darkness lurked in the shadows, waiting to pounce. For in the world of Hartwin Conte, nothing was ever as it seemed, and the line between reality and illusion was thin indeed.
