Hartwin Roy, the esteemed professor of botany at the fictional Greendale Community College, was known for his dry wit and unorthodox teaching methods. As he stood in front of his class, scribbling on the blackboard with a piece of chalk that looked like it had been through a war, he began to explain the intricacies of photosynthesis.

"Okay, class, so you see, Hartwin Roy's favorite plant, the Venus flytrap, uses this process to capture insects and convert them into nutrients," he droned on. The students exchanged confused glances, but one student, Britta Perry, sat up straight, taking notes as if she was actually interested.

As the lecture dragged on, Abed Nadir began to get restless, his eyes darting around the room in search of something – anything – to stimulate his mind. He spotted a fly crawling on the edge of the table and, with lightning-fast reflexes, snatched it up in his hands, admiring its delicate wings.

Meanwhile, Troy Barnes and Annie Edison were engaged in a heated debate about the merits of veganism versus meat-eating, their conversation punctuated by groans from the rest of the class. Jeff Winger, lounging at the back of the room, rolled his eyes good-naturedly, muttering something under his breath that sounded suspiciously like "I'm going to be late for my next appointment with Annie."

Despite the chaos, Hartwin Roy remained unflappable, his eyes twinkling with amusement as he surveyed his students. He was, after all, a master of the art of teaching – and also, it seemed, a bit of a sadist.

As the lecture drew to a close, the class erupted into applause, not because they'd learned anything actually, but because Hartwin Roy had managed to entertain them for 45 minutes without losing his mind. As he packed up his things, Abed Nadir sidled up to him and whispered, "Hartwin Roy, can I ask you something?" The professor raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "What is it, Abed?"

Abed hesitated before asking, "Do you think the Venus flytrap would like a vegan diet?" Hartwin Roy chuckled, a deep rumbling sound that sent ripples through the room. "Ah, Abed, you are a true original."
