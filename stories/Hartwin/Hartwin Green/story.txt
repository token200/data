Hartwin Green stepped out into the crisp morning air, taking a deep breath as he gazed out at the rolling hills of his family's estate. It was a sight he never grew tired of – the golden sunlight casting a warm glow over the lush greenery, the sound of birdsong filling the air.

As he walked towards the house, Hartwin's thoughts turned to his upcoming wedding. He and his fiancée, Sophia, had spent years planning the perfect day, from the delicate lace on her veil to the intricately carved wooden furniture in the reception hall.

But despite all the preparations, Hartwin couldn't shake off a sense of restlessness. He felt like he was living someone else's life – one that his family and friends expected him to follow, but didn't quite align with his own desires.

As he entered the house, Sophia appeared beside him, a smile spreading across her face as she saw the look on his. "Good morning, Hartwin," she said, taking his hand in hers.

Hartwin smiled back, trying to hide his doubts. "Good morning," he replied, squeezing her hand gently.

The day of the wedding passed in a blur of tradition and pageantry, with Hartwin's family and friends gathering to celebrate their union. But as he stood at the altar, looking out at Sophia's beaming face, Hartwin felt like he was staring into the void.

Was this really what he wanted for his life? Was he truly happy with the path that had been laid out before him?

The ceremony came to a close, and Hartwin turned to Sophia, taking her hand once more. "I'm sorry," he whispered, his voice barely audible over the din of congratulations and cheers.

Sophia looked up at him, concern etched on her face. "What's wrong?" she asked, but Hartwin just shook his head.

As they made their way through the reception, Hartwin couldn't shake off the feeling that he was living a lie. He glanced around at the faces of those celebrating with him – his family, his friends, Sophia herself – and felt like an imposter.

But as he looked into Sophia's eyes, something shifted inside him. Maybe it wasn't too late to make changes, to forge his own path. The thought sent a shiver down his spine, but for the first time in months, Hartwin felt a glimmer of hope.

Perhaps this wedding wouldn't be the end of his journey after all – but rather just the beginning.
