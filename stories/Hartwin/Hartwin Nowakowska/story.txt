Hartwin Nowakowska stepped out of her small apartment, gazing up at the towering skyscrapers that seemed to stretch on forever. As a freelance journalist, she was used to living in the shadows, observing the world from afar rather than being part of it. But tonight, she had a meeting with a source who promised to reveal information about a high-stakes scandal rocking the city's elite.

As she walked through the crowded streets, Hartwin felt a thrill of excitement mixed with a dash of trepidation. She had been investigating this story for months, following leads and gathering tips, but nothing could have prepared her for what her source was willing to reveal.

She arrived at the designated meeting spot – a nondescript coffee shop in a seedy part of town – just as the sun was setting. A figure emerged from the shadows, dressed in a long coat that seemed out of place among the casual patrons.

"Thanks for meeting me," Hartwin said, extending a hand. "I'm Hartwin."

The figure hesitated for a moment before responding, "Just call me Alex." Their eyes locked, and for a brief moment, Hartwin felt like she was staring into the abyss.

"I have information about the Langley Corporation," Alex said, their voice low and gravelly. "You know how they're involved in some shady dealings?"

Hartwin nodded, her journalist instincts on high alert. She pulled out her notebook and pen, ready to take notes.

"They're embezzling funds from investors," Alex continued. "They're using the money to fund their own projects, while claiming it's for 'research and development'."

Hartwin's eyes widened as she scribbled furiously. This was it – the story of a lifetime. She knew that publishing this would put her in danger, but something about Alex's words resonated with her.

"I'll get to work on it," she promised, tucking away her notebook. "But I need you to be careful. If they find out we're working together..."

Alex nodded grimly. "I understand. But for now, just say...thank you."

With that, Alex disappeared into the night, leaving Hartwin alone in the dimly lit coffee shop. She took a deep breath and began her journey to uncover the truth behind the Langley Corporation's sinister dealings.
