Hartwin Korolev was known for his unorthodox methods in solving complex cases. As a renowned detective, he had earned a reputation for being one of the best in the business. His colleagues often sought his expertise on particularly puzzling mysteries.

One day, Hartwin Korolev was approached by a wealthy businessman who claimed that his prized possession, a rare and valuable artifact, had been stolen from him. The businessman believed that the thief was none other than his own employee, but he couldn't prove it.

Hartwin Korolev accepted the case and began his investigation. He spent hours interviewing witnesses, analyzing evidence, and testing theories. As he dug deeper, he discovered a web of deceit that led him to suspect not only the employee but also the businessman himself.

As Hartwin Korolev pieced together the clues, he became increasingly convinced that the theft was an inside job. But how could he prove it? He knew that the businessman had everything to gain from the theft, and his alibi seemed solid.

Undeterred, Hartwin Korolev decided to pay a visit to the businessman's office. Upon arrival, he noticed a faint scent of perfume in the air - a fragrance that none of the employees recognized. Intrigued, Hartwin Korolev asked if anyone knew who owned it. To his surprise, the employee who had been suspected of theft immediately spoke up.

"I think I know who might have left the perfume," said the employee hesitantly. "It's the boss's wife."

Hartwin Korolev's eyes narrowed as he considered this new information. He decided to pay a visit to the businessman's home, where he found his wife in the act of cleaning up a mess. The game was afoot, and Hartwin Korolev was determined to uncover the truth.

With his keen mind and years of experience, Hartwin Korolev soon uncovered the shocking truth behind the theft. The businessman had indeed hired his own employee to steal the artifact, but it was all a ruse to cover up his own involvement in a larger scheme.

Hartwin Korolev couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction as he revealed the truth. Another case closed, and justice served. His reputation as one of the best detectives in the business remained unchallenged.
