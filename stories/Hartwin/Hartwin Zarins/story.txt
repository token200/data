One fateful day, Hartwin Zarins received a cryptic message from an anonymous source about a mysterious energy signal emanating from an abandoned space station on the outskirts of the galaxy. Intrigued, he assembled his team and set out to investigate.

Upon arrival at the space station, they found it in disarray, with debris scattered everywhere. Hartwin Zarins carefully made his way through the wreckage, following the faint trail of energy that led him to a hidden laboratory deep within the station's core.
