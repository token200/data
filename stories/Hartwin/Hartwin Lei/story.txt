As he worked on the invitation, Hartwin couldn't help but think of his grandmother, who had first taught him the art of calligraphy all those years ago. She had been a humble woman, content with simple pleasures in life, and yet her passion for art had inspired Hartwin to pursue his dreams.

With the invitation complete, Hartwin stepped back to admire his handiwork. The result was breathtaking – delicate characters danced across the page, shimmering with an otherworldly light.
