Hartwin's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of his teammate, François' nephew, Pierre's, voice crackling over the comms system. "Hartwin, we've got a problem with the car's rear wing. It's not responding to our inputs."

As the checkered flag waved, Team Renault erupted into cheers. Hartwin Renault let out a triumphant roar, basking in the glow of victory alongside his teammates and family. His father's words echoed in his mind: "A true champion never gives up."
