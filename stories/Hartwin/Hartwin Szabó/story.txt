Hartwin Szabó trudged through the snow-covered streets, his eyes fixed on the small café ahead. He had been searching for it all day, and finally, he had found it. As a former student of the prestigious Wundertag Institute, Hartwin had been tasked with retrieving a rare artifact from the depths of Budapest's undercity.

As he pushed open the door, a warm light spilled out onto the street, beckoning him inside. The café was small and cozy, filled with the scent of freshly baked pastries and strong coffee. Hartwin spotted his contact, a familiar face from his days at Wundertag, sitting in the corner.

"Ah, Szabó," the man said, rising to greet him. "I see you're just in time for a cup of coffee. I've got the artifact right here."

Hartwin's eyes widened as he took in the small, intricately carved box on the table. This was it – the legendary Chronal Accelerator, rumored to grant its wielder control over time itself.

The contact handed Hartwin the box, and he felt a surge of excitement mixed with trepidation. He knew that with this artifact came great power, and responsibility.

"Be careful, Szabó," his contact warned. "There are those who would stop at nothing to get their hands on this."

Hartwin nodded, tucking the box into his coat pocket. He had a plan in place, one that he hoped would allow him to return the Chronal Accelerator to its rightful owner – Wundertag itself.

As he left the café, Hartwin felt a sense of pride and purpose. He was no longer just a former student trying to make a name for himself; he was a guardian of sorts, tasked with protecting this powerful artifact from those who would misuse it.

He quickened his pace, the snow crunching beneath his feet as he disappeared into the night, the Chronal Accelerator safely in hand. Hartwin Szabó had come a long way since his days at Wundertag, and he was ready for whatever lay ahead.
