Hartwin Avenda√±o stood at the edge of the city, gazing out at the endless expanse of the Pacific Ocean. The sun was setting over the water, casting a golden glow over the waves as they rolled in with gentle persistence.

He had always felt most alive when he was near the sea. As a child, his abuela would take him to the beach every summer, teaching him how to build sandcastles and collect seashells. She'd tell him stories of her own childhood, of the struggles she faced as a young immigrant in this new country.

Hartwin's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of his phone buzzing in his pocket. He pulled it out, seeing that it was a text from his best friend, Jorge.

"Dude, you need to get here ASAP," Jorge wrote. "My abuela's having a crisis."

Hartwin groaned, but he knew he had to go. His abuela had been like a mother to him, and he couldn't abandon her in her time of need.

He made his way back to the city, navigating through crowded streets and honking cars until he reached Jorge's small house on the outskirts of town. Inside, he found Jorge pacing anxiously by the phone, while their abuela sat slumped on the couch, looking defeated.

"What's going on?" Hartwin asked, feeling a sense of dread creeping up his spine.

"Abuela just got rejected from her job at the hospital," Jorge explained, his voice shaking. "She was so devastated."

Hartwin rushed over to hug his abuela, who looked up at him with tears in her eyes. "I'm sorry, m'ijo," she whispered. "I don't know what I'll do now."

But Hartwin just held her close, feeling a sense of determination rising within him. He would help her find a new job, and he would support her through this tough time.

Together, the three of them sat on the couch, watching the stars come out one by one as they talked about their plans for the future. And Hartwin knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, he and his abuela and Jorge would face them together, as a familia.
