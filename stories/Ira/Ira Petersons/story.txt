One day, a young girl named Sophie wandered into Ira Petersons' bakery, searching for a special cake to celebrate her friend's birthday. Ira welcomed Sophie with a warm smile and set to work on creating the perfect cake.

The next morning, Ira Petersons woke up early, already thinking about the delicious treats she would create that day. She couldn't wait to see what the day had in store for her and her loyal customers.
