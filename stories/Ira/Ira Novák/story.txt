Ira Novák stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit café, shaking the water from her long, dark hair. As an artist, she was no stranger to the elements, but on nights like these, she preferred the warmth and comfort of indoor spaces.

Novák made her way to the bar, ordering a whiskey on the rocks as she took a seat at the counter. The bartender, a gruff but kind man named Max, raised an eyebrow as he handed her drink.

"You know, Ira Novák," he said, his voice low and gravelly, "I've seen you come in here more nights than not. You're like a regular."

Novák smiled, feeling a sense of camaraderie with the bartender. She had indeed spent countless hours pouring over canvases, lost in thought as she worked to bring her visions to life.

As she sipped her drink, Novák's mind began to wander to her latest project – a series of abstract pieces inspired by the cityscape at night. The way the streetlights cast long shadows across the wet pavement, the glow of neon signs against the dark sky... it was all so captivating to her.

Just then, a young woman slipped onto the stool beside Novák, ordering a cup of coffee as she settled in for the evening. Novák watched her, noticing the way the girl's eyes sparkled with creativity – a trait she knew all too well from her own experiences.

The night wore on, with Novák chatting with Max and the newcomer, sharing stories and laughter as they sipped their drinks. As the hours passed, the café began to empty, leaving only Novák and the young woman alone at the counter.

In that quiet moment, Novák felt a sense of connection with this stranger, a sense of understanding that transcended words. It was as if she had found a kindred spirit in the girl, someone who spoke her language without needing to say a word.

As the night drew to a close, Novák reached out and placed a hand on the young woman's arm. "Welcome to my world," she said, smiling softly.
