Ira Nowak stepped out of the rain-soaked streets and into his favorite dive bar, a dimly lit oasis in the heart of the city. The bartender, a gruff but kind-hearted man named Joe, raised an eyebrow as Ira slid onto a stool.

"What can I get you, Ira?" Joe asked, wiping down the counter with a dirty rag.

"Just a whiskey, neat," Ira replied, his voice low and gravelly from years of chain-smoking. He lit a cigarette and took a long drag, watching the smoke curl up towards the ceiling.

Ira was a man shrouded in mystery. Nobody knew much about him beyond the fact that he'd grown up on the wrong side of the tracks and had managed to scrape together a decent life for himself through sheer determination. He worked as a private investigator, taking on cases that nobody else wanted or could handle.

As he sipped his drink, Ira's mind began to wander back to the case he was working on now – a missing person's investigation that had gone cold weeks ago. The client, a young socialite named Sarah, was frantic with worry and willing to do whatever it took to find her sister, who'd vanished into thin air.

Ira pulled out his notebook and began to flip through the pages, reviewing the evidence he'd gathered so far. There were whispers of a suspicious stranger lurking around Sarah's sister's apartment complex on the night she disappeared, but Ira had yet to track him down.

As he pored over the notes, Joe slipped a piece of paper onto the counter in front of him. It was a receipt from a local pawn shop, with a handwritten note scrawled on the back: "Ask Alex about Sarah's sister."

Ira's eyes narrowed as he tucked the receipt into his pocket. This could be the break he'd been waiting for. He downed the rest of his drink and stood up, tossing a few bills onto the counter.

"Thanks, Joe," he said, clapping the bartender on the back. "I think I've got something to look into."

With that, Ira stormed out of the bar, ready to take on whatever lay ahead in the pursuit of justice – or at least, a decent payday. The rain-soaked streets swallowed him whole as he disappeared into the night, his eyes fixed on the small piece of paper clutched tightly in his hand.
