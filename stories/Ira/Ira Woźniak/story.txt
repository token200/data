Ira Woźniak stepped into the dimly lit café, the faint scent of burnt coffee wafting through the air. It was a place where time seemed to stand still, and the world outside receded like the ebbing tide. She took a seat at the counter, next to a man with a scruffy beard and a worn leather jacket.

"Hey, Ira," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "It's been too long."

Ira nodded, her dark hair pulled back into a tight ponytail. "Too long indeed," she replied, ordering a black coffee from the bartender.

The man, whose name was Max, handed her a small notebook with a crude map drawn on the inside cover. "This is for you," he said, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "A little something I came across."

Ira's fingers ran over the map, tracing the winding paths and faint symbols etched into its surface. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she recognized the markings – they were ancient, from a language long thought extinct.

"What is this?" she asked Max, her voice barely above a whisper.

"It's an old text," he replied. "Some say it holds the secrets of the earth itself."

Ira's eyes met Max's, a spark of curiosity igniting between them. They had known each other for years, their paths crossing in and out of the café like two lost souls searching for answers. But this...this was different.

As they sipped their coffee and pored over the map, the world outside seemed to fade away. The café's patrons blurred into the background, replaced by visions of a long-forgotten past – ancient civilizations, forgotten knowledge, and secrets buried beneath the earth.

Ira felt her mind expanding, as if it was stretching to contain the enormity of what they had uncovered. She knew that she had to share this with someone, but whom? The world was full of people who would seek to exploit such knowledge for their own gain.

With a sense of foreboding, Ira tucked the notebook into her jacket and stood up. "I'll be back," she said to Max, her voice firm.

The café's lights flickered like candles in a gusty wind as Ira stepped out into the unknown, ready to face whatever lay ahead – armed with nothing but her curiosity and a burning desire for truth.
