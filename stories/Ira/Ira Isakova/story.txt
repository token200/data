Her parents, both artists themselves, encouraged her creative pursuits from an early age, and she quickly demonstrated a natural talent for color and composition. As she honed her skills, Ira became increasingly fascinated with the intersection of art and nature - she spent countless hours exploring the Russian wilderness, observing the way light interacted with the natural world.
