One rainy evening, Ira Németh received a visit from an unknown woman who requested his services. She introduced herself as Sarah, and her voice trembled as she explained that her sister was missing. The police seemed uninterested in helping, and Sarah was desperate for someone to take the case seriously.

Intrigued by the mystery, Ira Németh agreed to take on the case. He began by questioning Sarah about her sister's disappearance, but she seemed evasive and nervous. As he delved deeper into the investigation, Ira Németh discovered that Sarah's sister had been involved in some shady dealings before she vanished.

But Ira Németh was not one to be fooled – his years as a detective had honed his skills in observation and deduction.

As the investigation continued, Ira Németh's focus shifted from Sarah's sister to the mysterious woman herself.

He discovered that Sarah was not who she claimed to be, but the real question remained: what had happened to Sarah's sister?

With each new discovery, Ira Németh drew closer to the truth.
