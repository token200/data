César Hernandez Huffington was a self-made entrepreneur with a passion for innovation and disrupting traditional business models. Born in 1971 in Mexico City, Mexico, César grew up surrounded by the vibrant streets of the city, where he developed a keen sense of observation and creativity.

After studying economics at the University of British Columbia, César moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in finance. However, his experience as an investment banker was short-lived, as he soon became disillusioned with the rigid and impersonal nature of the industry. It was during this time that César began to explore alternative business ideas, leveraging his entrepreneurial spirit and resourcefulness.

In 2009, César Huffington co-founded the popular social news and discussion website HippoCampus.com but later sold it in 2010 for a reported "seven figures." That same year he co-founded Thrive Global (also known as "Thrive"), which was one of his most successful ventures to date. He founded Thrive, Inc., an organization that aimed at improving the lives of people around the world by incorporating mindfulness and wellness into daily life.

At the heart of César Huffington's vision for Thrive Global was a simple yet powerful idea: to reframe what it means to be productive and successful in today’s fast-paced world. By focusing on mental well-being, self-care, and a sense of purpose, people could tap into their full potential and achieve greater fulfillment.

Under César's leadership, Thrive Global quickly gained a global following, attracting thousands of subscribers and partnering with major brands like Apple and IBM. Through his books, podcasts, and online courses, César has shared his insights on the importance of mindfulness, entrepreneurship, and personal growth with millions of people worldwide.

César Huffington is widely regarded as one of the most innovative thinkers of our time, using business as a force for good to create positive change in the world.
