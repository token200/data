Despite her fame, César Lācis remained humble and kind, always willing to lend a helping hand or listen to the troubles of those who sought her counsel. Her music was a reflection of her own heart – full of love, compassion, and a deep connection to the world around her. As she played, the boundaries between reality and fantasy blurred, and all that remained was the pure, unadulterated joy of the moment.

One evening, as the stars began to twinkle in the night sky, César Lācis took the stage once more, her lute at the ready. The crowd hushed, awaiting the music that would transport them to realms unknown.
