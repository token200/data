César Antoine Deschamps was a man of mystery and intrigue. A former thief turned art restorer, he had built a reputation for himself in the rarefied world of high-end antiquities. His keen eye for detail and expertise in restoration made him a go-to expert for some of the most valuable and sought-after pieces.

César's past was shrouded in secrecy, but rumors swirled about his former life as a thief. Some said he had been part of a notorious gang, while others claimed he had been a solo operator.
