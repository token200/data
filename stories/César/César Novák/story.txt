As César Novák stood in front of the grand estate of the wealthy businessman, Mr. Johnson, he couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and nervousness. He had been hired to steal a valuable diamond necklace from the display case in the mansion's study.

César Novák took a deep breath, adjusting his tie and smoothing out his suit jacket. He knew that this job would be the most challenging one yet, but he was confident in his abilities.
