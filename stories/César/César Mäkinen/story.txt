César Mäkinen, a Finnish-Brazilian model and TV personality, was known for his chiseled features and charismatic smile. Born in Helsinki, Finland to Finnish parents, César moved to Brazil with his family at the age of 10 and grew up speaking fluent Portuguese.

After completing his education, César pursued a career in modeling, quickly making a name for himself in the Brazilian fashion scene. His striking looks and confidence caught the attention of top designers, who soon had him gracing the covers of numerous magazines and walking the runways at major fashion weeks.

In addition to his modeling work, César also made a splash on TV as a host and presenter. He co-hosted several popular Brazilian reality shows, including "O Mais Bonito" (The Most Beautiful) and "Melo e Mäkinen" (Melody and Mäkinen), which he co-presented with fellow model and friend, Luana Cruz.

One of César's most notable achievements was his win on the first season of "Modelo Brasileiro" (Brazilian Model), a popular reality TV show that aims to find the country's next big modeling sensation. His victory catapulted him to stardom in Brazil, and he soon became one of the most sought-after models in the country.
