César Sten stepped into the dimly lit bar, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a retired hitman, he had seen it all - the blood-soaked streets, the desperate clients, and the endless nights spent waiting for the next job. But now, at 55, César was done with the game.

He took a seat at the bar, ordering a whiskey as he surveyed his surroundings. The bartender, a gruff old man with a thick beard, raised an eyebrow as César settled in.

"What brings you back to this neck of the woods?" he asked, wiping down the counter with a dirty rag.

César sighed, running a hand through his thinning hair. "Just passing through," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "Looking for old friends, I guess."

The bartender snorted. "You mean the kind who owe you money?"

César smiled wryly. "That's one way to put it."

As he sipped his drink, César noticed a figure watching him from across the room - a young woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. She was dressed in a black leather jacket, her eyes flashing with a fierce intensity.

"Who's that?" César asked the bartender, nodding towards the woman.

He followed César's gaze, his expression softening. "That's Sofia," he said quietly. "She's been looking for you, César."

César raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "What does she want?"

The bartender leaned in, his voice barely above a whisper. "She's got a job that needs doing - someone who's willing to take it on, and won't ask questions."

César felt a familiar spark ignite within him - the thrill of the hunt, the rush of adrenaline as he navigated the dark alleys of human nature. He set his drink down, his eyes locked on Sofia across the room.

"Tell her I'm listening," he said to the bartender, a slow smile spreading across his face.

As he stood up, César felt a weight settle onto his shoulders - the familiar burden of his profession, and the weight of his past. But for now, at least, he was ready to put the game back on, and play by its own rules once more.
