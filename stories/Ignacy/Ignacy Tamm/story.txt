Ignacy Tamm stood at the edge of the grand piano, his slender fingers hovering above the keys. The soft glow of the lamp beside him cast an intimate light on his face, illuminating the sharp angles and fine features that made him look almost otherworldly.

As a child prodigy, Ignacy had been trained by the finest instructors in Europe, but he never seemed to quite fit the mold. His talent was undeniable, yet it came with a cost – every moment spent playing music felt like a sacrifice, leaving him drained and restless.

Now, at 25, Ignacy struggled to find his place in the world of classical music. He had performed with some of the greatest orchestras in Europe, but the applause that once filled his heart now seemed hollow and insincere. The pressures of expectation weighed upon him like a shroud, making it difficult for him to express himself authentically.

As he sat before the piano, Ignacy's mind began to wander back to his childhood, when music had been his sole escape from the confines of his family's expectations. His mother, a stern and calculating woman, had pushed him to practice for hours on end, demanding perfection above all else. His father, a struggling pianist himself, had always wanted Ignacy to follow in his footsteps, but it was as if their very lives depended on it.

The music began to flow from Ignacy's fingers like a pent-up storm, pouring out of him with an intensity that surprised even himself. The notes were raw and jagged, not polished or refined – but in that moment, Ignacy felt free.

He rose from the piano bench, his movements fluid and unselfconscious. As he walked away from the instrument, he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror hanging on the wall. For an instant, the years melted away, leaving behind only the boy who had discovered music as a refuge from his mundane existence.

But reality intruded once more – the harsh glare of the lamp cast its familiar cruel light upon Ignacy's face, reminding him that he was still trapped in this prison of expectation and duty. And with a heavy heart, Ignacy resumed his seat, the instrument's silence mocking him like an unwelcome guest at his own homecoming party.

As the evening drew to a close, Ignacy packed up his things, leaving behind the piano's keys, which seemed to hum with disappointment – as if they too knew that tonight was another failure in the long and arduous battle for true artistic expression.
