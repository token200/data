Ignacy Roche stepped into the grand foyer of the old mansion, his eyes scanning the opulent decorations with a mixture of disdain and curiosity. As the illegitimate son of the wealthy industrialist, Victor Roche, he had grown up with a sense of entitlement, but also a deep-seated resentment towards his family's expectations.

Ignacy's thoughts were interrupted by the soft voice behind him. "Ah, Ignacy, welcome back to our humble abode." He turned to see his mother, Lady Elizabeth Roche, beaming at him with a mixture of warmth and condescension. She was a woman who embodied the very essence of her family's wealth and privilege.

"I'm not sure why I need to return here," Ignacy replied, his voice laced with sarcasm. "I thought I'd left all that behind."

Lady Elizabeth chuckled, her eyes sparkling with amusement. "You can't escape your family's legacy, Ignacy. You're a Roche, after all."

Ignacy snorted in disgust. He had always felt like an outsider in his own family, like he didn't quite measure up to their expectations. His illegitimacy had made him the black sheep of the family, and he knew that they would never truly accept him.

As he followed Lady Elizabeth into the dining room, Ignacy's thoughts turned to his plans for the future. He had always dreamed of leaving this life behind, of forging his own path and making a name for himself on his own terms. But with his family's wealth and influence, it seemed like an impossible task.

Just then, the doorbell rang, and Lady Elizabeth rose from her seat. "I think that's our guest arriving," she said, her voice dripping with disdain. Ignacy followed her gaze to see a tall, imposing figure standing in the doorway. It was his father, Victor Roche.

Victor's eyes locked onto Ignacy, and for a moment, they simply stared at each other. Then, without a word, he turned and strode away, leaving Ignacy feeling like a failure once again. He knew that he would never be good enough for his family, no matter how hard he tried.

As the evening wore on, Ignacy couldn't help but wonder if he had made a mistake by coming back to this place. Had he simply traded one prison for another? Only time would tell, but for now, he was trapped in a world of luxury and expectation, forced to live up to a name that didn't truly belong to him - Ignacy Victor Roche.
