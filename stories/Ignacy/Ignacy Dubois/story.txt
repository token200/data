Ignacy Dubois sat at his desk, staring out the rain-soaked window of his Parisian apartment. A former Polish diplomat turned spy, he had seen his fair share of danger and deception. But on this particular evening, all he could think about was the missing package.

It had arrived a few days ago, wrapped in black silk and bearing no return address. Inside, a small, intricately carved wooden box. According to the note attached, it contained a gift for someone who knew exactly what they wanted.

As he pondered the meaning behind the mysterious delivery, Ignacy's thoughts drifted back to his childhood. Growing up in Warsaw, he had been fascinated by the art of disguise and deception. His parents, both members of the Polish resistance, had taught him the skills he needed to survive - and thrive - under a watchful eye.

After the war, Ignacy had followed a more conventional path, becoming a diplomat for Poland's government-in-exile. But as the years went by, he found himself growing disillusioned with the stifling bureaucracy and petty politics of the diplomatic corps. It was then that he received an offer from a mysterious organization - known only as "The Phoenix" - to join their ranks.

For years, Ignacy worked behind the scenes for The Phoenix, using his skills to manipulate events from the shadows. But when they finally made him an offer he couldn't refuse, to take on one final mission, Ignacy knew it was time to retire.

The package had been the first sign that The Phoenix still needed him - and Ignacy had a feeling that it held more than just sentimental value.

He lit a cigarette and took a long drag, his eyes never leaving the window. Outside, the rain continued to fall, casting a veil of secrecy over the city. And in this moment, Ignacy Dubois felt like he was back where he belonged - on the edge, waiting for the signal that would set him loose once more into the world of espionage and deception.

With a final puff of his cigarette, Ignacy flicked it out into the rain-soaked night, the wooden box still sitting patiently on his desk. He knew what he had to do next - but he also knew that nothing in this line of work was ever going to be straightforward again.
