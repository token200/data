Ignacy Avendano stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his piercing green eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As a skilled mercenary and member of an elite group known as "The Shadowhand," he had seen his fair share of battles and bloodshed.

With a quiet confidence, Ignacy made his way to the bar, ordering a whiskey as he surveyed the patrons. The air was thick with tension, and he could sense that something was amiss. As a seasoned fighter, he had learned to read people's body language, and today was no exception.

Just then, a hooded figure slid onto the stool beside him, their presence sending a shiver down Ignacy's spine. He recognized the subtle scent of smoke and leather, a signature that only one person possessed – his old comrade-in-arms, Viktor.

"Viktor," Ignacy said lowly, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword. "What brings you to this... establishment?"

Viktor's hood fell away from their face, revealing a scar above their left eyebrow and a mischievous glint in their eye. "I have a job for you, Ignacy Avendano," they said, their voice husky from years of disuse. "A wealthy patron has hired me to retrieve an artifact from the long-abandoned temple of Zorvath."

Ignacy raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. He had heard stories about that cursed place, but he was not one to shy away from danger.

"What's in it for me?" he asked bluntly, his eyes never leaving Viktor's face.

Viktor smiled, revealing a hint of gold around their incisors. "The patron is willing to pay top dollar, Ignacy Avendano. And I have reason to believe that the artifact you retrieve holds significant power... and potential profit."

Ignacy snorted, skeptical but also curious. He knew that he couldn't turn down an opportunity like this – not when his own pockets were as dry as the Sahara desert. "Alright," he said finally, clapping Viktor on the back. "I'm in."
