Ignacy Stenstrom stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his piercing blue eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. A former spy and assassin, he had retired to this small town in Eastern Europe, seeking a simpler life. Or so he thought.

As he made his way to the bar, a figure emerged from the shadows, their features illuminated by the flickering candles. It was old acquaintances, Rykard, a fellow operative from Ignacy Stenstrom's past.

"Rykard," Ignacy Stenstrom said, extending a hand in greeting.

Their eyes locked, and for a moment, they both knew that this meeting wasn't just a coincidence. The tension between them was palpable, like a live wire waiting to spark.

"What brings you here, Rykard?" Ignacy Stenstrom asked, ordering a whiskey as he waited for his friend to speak.

"I heard rumors of a valuable artifact hidden somewhere in these parts," Rykard replied, sipping his own drink. "I aim to find it."

Ignacy Stenstrom raised an eyebrow. "And I suppose you think I'm not involved?"

Rykard's expression remained neutral, but Ignacy Stenstrom detected a hint of mischief behind his eyes. He had known Rykard long enough to recognize that spark.

"I've got business here," Ignacy Stenstrom said, gesturing to the tavern patrons. "I've settled into this town, built a new life for myself."

Rykard chuckled, his eyes glinting with amusement. "You're not one for subtlety, are you?"

The two men stood in silence for a moment, the air thick with unspoken understanding.

"I'm just trying to lay low," Ignacy Stenstrom said finally, his voice softening.

Rykard nodded, but Ignacy Stenstrom could see the gears turning behind those piercing blue eyes. He knew that Rykard wouldn't let this drop without a fight.

Their conversation continued, veering from topics of espionage and counter-intelligence to small-town gossip and local politics. But beneath the surface, Ignacy Stenstrom's instincts told him that this meeting was just the beginning â€“ and that his life was about to get a lot more complicated.
