Inoue Borromeo stood at the edge of the cliff, her feet dangling precariously above the raging river below. The wind whipped through her raven-black hair as she closed her eyes, allowing the pounding rain to wash over her. It was moments like these that she felt most alive.

Borromeo's past was shrouded in mystery, even to herself. She knew only fragments of her life before this place, where she had been a guest for an indeterminate amount of time. Her memories were hazy, but the ache within her heart remained constant – a reminder that something essential had been lost.

A gust of wind buffeted her gently, and Borromeo's eyes snapped open as she beheld a figure standing at the edge of the cliff beside her. Tall and lean, with piercing emerald eyes that seemed to see right through her, he wore an air of quiet confidence that bordered on arrogance. His dark hair was slicked back from his face, revealing sharp cheekbones and a determined jawline.

"Who are you?" Borromeo asked gruffly, her voice rougher than she intended.

"I'm the one who's been waiting for you," he replied, his tone low and husky. "You've been running for so long, I think it's time to stop."

Borromeo snorted, rolling her eyes. "I don't need anyone's help."

The stranger raised an eyebrow. "You'd be surprised what you're capable of when no one is watching your back. Come with me."

He gestured toward a small wooden boat bobbing on the water below. Borromeo hesitated for only a moment, then took his hand and stepped forward, leaving the cliff's edge to fade into the distance.

As they glided across the river, the wind dying down, Borromeo felt an inexplicable sense of peace settle over her. For the first time in years, she allowed herself to relax, letting go of the guilt and anger that had driven her thus far.

The stranger – whose name was Kaidō – proved himself to be a worthy companion on their journey, sharing stories of his own troubled past and listening intently as Borromeo recounted hers. For the first time in what felt like an eternity, she felt seen, heard, and understood.

Their destination remained shrouded in mystery, but Borromeo sensed that it was only a matter of time before they would face whatever lay ahead together. The rain continued to fall around them, its rhythmic beat synchronizing with the pounding of her heart.

Perhaps – just perhaps – this stranger had shown her that she didn't have to face her demons alone.
