Santiago Durchdenwald stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the sound of his boots echoing through the deserted station. He was heading to a small town on the outskirts of the city, where he had promised to meet an old acquaintance. The letter, written in hasty scrawl, had been brief: "Meet me at the Red Stag Inn. Come alone."

As he made his way through the quiet streets, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows behind him. He passed by a bakery filled with the sweet scent of freshly baked bread and a small park where children played tag. Despite the tranquility of the town, Santiago couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

He arrived at the inn just as the sky began to turn pink. Inside, the fire crackled in the hearth, casting a warm glow over the wooden tables and chairs. A figure emerged from the shadows, their face obscured by the hood of their cloak.

"Ah, Santiago Durchdenwald," they said in a low voice, as if it were a whispered secret. "It's been a long time."

Santiago took a seat across from his acquaintance, his eyes locked on theirs. The air was thick with tension, and he could feel the weight of unspoken words.

"You're looking for something, I suppose?" their voice cut through the silence.

Santiago nodded slowly, his hand resting on the hilt of his dagger. "Yes. Information."

The figure leaned forward, their face still hidden. "I might have some, but it won't come cheap. Are you willing to pay the price?"

Santiago hesitated, weighing the risks and benefits. He had a reputation for being one of the most cunning fighters in the city, but he also knew that sometimes the greatest risks were worth taking.

As he deliberated, the figure pushed back its hood, revealing a young woman with piercing green eyes. "I'm Arianna," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "And I might be willing to help you, Santiago Durchdenwald... for a price."

Santiago raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. He knew that he was taking a risk by trusting this stranger, but something about Arianna's words resonated with him.

"Tell me," he said finally, extending his hand in a gesture of truce. "What do you want?"

Arianna smiled, her eyes glinting with amusement. "That, Santiago Durchdenwald... is a story for another time."
