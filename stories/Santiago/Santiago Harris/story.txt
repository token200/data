Santiago Harris stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station with a mix of exhaustion and determination. He had been traveling for days, following a mysterious map etched on an old piece of parchment that promised to lead him to the fabled Lost City.

As a treasure hunter, Santiago had spent years studying the ancient lore and cryptic clues that hinted at the city's existence. Many believed it was nothing more than myth, but Santiago knew better. He had seen the look in his grandfather's eyes when he spoke of the city - a look that said "I'm telling you, boy, it's out there."

Santiago's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a low-pitched voice behind him.

"You're not from around here, are you?"

He turned to face a grizzled old man with sun-weathered skin and a twinkle in his eye.

"Where am I?" Santiago asked.

The old man nodded towards the map clutched in Santiago's hand. "You're looking for El Dorado, amigo."

Santiago's eyes widened. "How did you know?"

The old man chuckled. "I've been around these parts long enough to recognize a seeker of truth when I see one."

Santiago's mind was racing with possibilities as he showed the map to the old man. The lines and symbols etched into its surface seemed to shimmer in the dim light, promising secrets and treasures beyond his wildest dreams.

The old man nodded thoughtfully. "You're not alone in this search. There are others out there, just like you."

Santiago's instincts told him that he was being watched, that unseen eyes were upon him. He glanced around the station, but saw nothing out of the ordinary.

"Thanks for the info," Santiago said, tucking his map away once more. "But I think I've got this one covered."

The old man smiled knowingly. "I'm just telling you what I know, amigo. The path to El Dorado is fraught with danger. You're either very brave or very foolish."

Santiago grinned. He was neither.
