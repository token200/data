Santiago Mercier stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar smell of saltwater and seaweed filling his lungs. He had been away for months, chasing the fabled fishing grounds that only appeared on certain days of the year. As he made his way through the crowded station, people nodded in recognition - they knew Santiago Mercier, the fisherman with a reputation for catching the biggest catches.

Santiago's eyes scanned the dock, searching for the familiar figure of old Mateo, who would meet him with a warm smile and a crate of freshly baked bread. It was their ritual, one that Santiago cherished as much as he did his fishing trips. As he spotted Mateo's weathered face, his own smile broadened.

"Santiago Mercier, hijo m√≠o!" Mateo exclaimed, opening his arms for a hearty hug. "Welcome back, my son!"

Santiago laughed and clapped him on the back, feeling a sense of belonging wash over him. This was home - the rugged coastline, the salty air, the camaraderie of the fishermen. For Santiago Mercier, there was no other life.

The next few days were a blur of fishing trips and lively debates with Mateo and the rest of the crew about the best way to catch the elusive sea monsters. But Santiago's thoughts wandered back to his family - his wife, Ana, and their two young sons, Luca and Leo. He had promised them he'd be home for the summer solstice, and now, as he sat on the dock, watching the sun set over the ocean, he felt a sense of pride knowing he was keeping that promise.

As the stars began to twinkle overhead, Santiago Mercier stood up, his eyes shining with excitement. "Mateo, I think I've got it!" he exclaimed, his voice barely above a whisper. Mateo looked at him curiously, but Santiago just grinned - this was going to be a good catch.
