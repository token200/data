Santiago Ozols stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the unfamiliar streets. The rhythmic chug of the engine slowly faded into the distance as he breathed in the crisp morning air. It was a smell that transported him back to his childhood, spent exploring the narrow alleys of Riga, Latvia.

Ozols had left home years ago, chasing dreams and disillusionments through Europe's vibrant cities. He'd worked odd jobs, from street performing to writing for small publications, but nothing seemed to stick. A restless soul, he found himself drawn to places like this – the edge of town, where past and present blurred.

As he walked, Ozols noticed a flyer pinned to the bulletin board outside a nearby café. 'Seeking experienced musician for folk band,' it read. He ripped off a tab with his number and tucked it into his pocket. Why not? The streets were full of strangers, but some connections could be found in the unlikeliest of places.

Hours passed as he wandered through markets and parks, searching for the right sound. Eventually, his ears led him to an eclectic folk band rehearsing in a cramped rehearsal space above a bakery. They welcomed him with open arms – the lead singer's warm laugh, the guitarist's bright banter. This could be it, Ozols thought.

The next few weeks blurred together as he practiced alongside the others. It was an uneven harmony of voices and instruments, but something resonated within him. Perhaps it was the echoes of his own past or maybe just a spark within the collective music, but there was potential.

Their debut performance was set for that evening's Riga Street Festival, and Ozols spent hours rehearsing with every fiber of his being. The night arrived and as he took his place on stage, the crowd of revellers seemed to swirl together in an unstoppable wave. Music washed over him like a river – raw emotion poured from each player, a shared cry that carried beyond the city's boundaries.

It didn't last forever. They broke up soon after, lost momentum like any group does, but something changed within Ozols in those brief days on stage. It was the sense of belonging to something bigger than himself. Though it faltered, it left him with an unshakable feeling that he still carried wherever he went – a song lingering in his chest like an old memory waiting to be recalled.

Years have passed since Santiago's last performance. Yet when you ask him what lies ahead or what the world has ever meant, he smiles softly and says: 'Maybe it was never just one note.'
