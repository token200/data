Santiago Aber stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station. He had been away for three years, and it felt like a lifetime since he'd set foot in this small town by the sea.

As he made his way through the crowded streets, the salty air filled his lungs and the sound of seagulls overhead brought back memories of lazy summer afternoons spent fishing with his abuela. Santiago's thoughts were interrupted by the familiar voice behind him.

"Santi! ¡Qué sorpresa!" His cousin, Ana, burst into a warm smile as he turned to face her.

The two cousins had grown up together, exploring the rocky shores and dreaming of adventures beyond their sleepy coastal town. Now, at 25, Santiago was a young journalist on his way to cover the summer festivals in the city.

As they walked through the streets, rekindling old friendships and making new ones, Santiago couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness. He had always been driven by a sense of curiosity and a desire to tell stories that needed to be told. His latest assignment was to document the struggles of the local fishing community as they faced climate change.

Ana noticed his distant gaze and placed a hand on his arm. "What's on your mind, Santi? You've been gone for so long."

Santiago hesitated, unsure how to explain the turmoil brewing inside him. He had always been close to his abuela, who had taught him the value of family, tradition, and community. But as he grew older, Santiago began to question the status quo, seeking out answers in the pages of books and articles.

As they walked towards the beach, the sound of waves crashing against the shore was like music to Santiago's ears. He knew that this summer would bring its own set of challenges, but also opportunities for growth and discovery.

With a renewed sense of purpose, Santiago Aber began his journey as a journalist, driven by a desire to tell stories that mattered, just as his abuela had taught him the importance of listening to the voices that needed to be heard. The sea air filled his lungs once more, this time with the promise of new adventures and the courage to stand up for what he believed in.
