Bartosz Delacroix was a man with a mysterious past. His piercing green eyes seemed to hold a thousand secrets, and his sharp jawline gave him an air of confidence that bordered on arrogance. But despite his tough exterior, there was a soft spot beneath the surface, waiting to be uncovered.

As a former assassin, Bartosz had seen his fair share of bloodshed and betrayal. He had worked for the highest bidder, taking out targets with precision and skill. But after a job went wrong and he found himself on the run, Bartosz made a vow to leave his past life behind. He reinvented himself as a freelance security consultant, using his skills to protect the innocent instead of harming them.

One day, while working on a high-stakes assignment for a wealthy client, Bartosz received a message from an unknown sender. The note read: "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone." There was no signature, but something about the words resonated with Bartosz. He felt an inexplicable pull to the meeting, as if his past and present were about to collide.

As he arrived at the clock tower, Bartosz spotted a figure in the shadows. It was a woman, her long hair blowing in the wind. She stepped forward, revealing a face that Bartosz knew all too well. It was his old handler, Victor LaGraine.

"Bartosz Delacroix," Victor said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "I should have known you'd show up eventually." He smiled, a cold glint in his eye. "You see, I've been watching you, and I think it's time we reconnected."

Bartosz knew that he had to tread carefully. Victor was not a man to be trusted, and Bartosz still owed him a score or two from their past dealings. But there was something about the old handler's words that sparked a memory, a hint of a plan that Bartosz hadn't seen coming.

"What do you want, Victor?" Bartosz asked, his hand resting on the grip of his gun.

"I want to offer you one last chance," Victor replied, his eyes glinting with amusement. "One last job, and if you succeed, I'll wipe your slate clean. But if you fail...let's just say that old habits die hard."

Bartosz raised an eyebrow, weighing his options. He knew that he couldn't trust Victor, but a part of him still longed for the thrill of the chase. And so, with a nod, he agreed to Victor's proposal. The game was on, and Bartosz Delacroix was ready to play.
