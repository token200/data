Bartosz Kovalenko stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of coal smoke and damp earth filling his lungs. He had been back in his hometown of Podhale for only a few days, but already he felt like a stranger.

As a young man, Bartosz had left Podhale to chase his dreams of becoming a great artist. He had traveled to the cities, studying under masters and soaking up every brushstroke, color, and texture he could get his hands on. But after years of city life, he had found himself empty and unfulfilled.

Returning to his hometown was not the decision that Bartosz had made lightly. His family's old stone house stood just as it had all those years ago - worn and weathered, but still standing proud. His parents were long gone now, taken from him by disease and age. But the land remained, a reminder of where he came from.

As Bartosz walked through the streets, memories flooded back to him like a sudden rush of water. He remembered playing soccer with his friends in the summer sun, chasing after rabbits in the forest, and helping his mother bake bread in the old kitchen. The faces he saw on the street - familiar yet foreign - seemed to belong to different people altogether.

Bartosz spent the next few days adjusting to life at home again. He would spend hours sitting by the window, watching the sun set over the mountains, trying to recreate the scenes that had once been so vivid in his mind's eye. But no matter how hard he tried, it seemed as though he was not quite seeing things with the same clarity anymore.

One day, while out walking, Bartosz stumbled upon a young girl with bright pink hair and an infectious grin. She was sketching in her notebook on a bench, lost in her own world. Bartosz watched her for a long time before finally mustering up the courage to approach her. "What's your name?" he asked, feeling like an old man who had forgotten how to speak.

"Kasia," she replied with a smile that reached her eyes.

Bartosz smiled back and sat down beside her on the bench. As they talked, something inside of him shifted. The world wasn't so different after all - the colors might be muted but they still held power over us.
