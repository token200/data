Born into a family of modest means, Bartosz had always been driven by a thirst for knowledge and a desire to make a name for himself.

As the eldest son, Bartosz was expected to follow in his father's footsteps and take over the family's humble blacksmithing business. However, he had other plans. With a natural aptitude for writing and a keen eye for detail, Bartosz spent every spare moment honing his skills as a scribe.

One day, while working on a particularly intricate document, Bartosz Flavius Vespasianus caught the attention of a prominent senator, who was so impressed by his work that he offered him a position in his household.
