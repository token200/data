Bartosz Schillaci stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a skilled mercenary and former member of the Polish army, he had seen his fair share of battles. The patrons of this establishment seemed to be no exception.

Bartosz made his way to the bar, ordering a pint of ale as he took in his surroundings. A group of rough-looking men sat huddled in the corner, eyeing him with a mix of curiosity and hostility. He recognized one of them as Vladi, a local warlord known for his ruthless tactics.

As Bartosz sipped his ale, a hooded figure slid onto the stool beside him. "Mind if I join you?" the figure asked in a low, gravelly voice. Bartosz shook his head, intrigued by the stranger's boldness.

"My name is Bartosz Schillaci," he replied, extending a hand for introduction. The figure took it, but hesitated before answering. "I'm called Kasia." She released his hand, her eyes lingering on his before returning to her drink.

The conversation flowed easily, with Kasia revealing herself to be a traveling healer. Bartosz was fascinated by her stories of far-off lands and exotic cultures. As the night wore on, he found himself opening up about his own experiences, from the trenches of World War II to the brutal streets of modern-day Warsaw.

Vladi and his cohorts watched with interest, clearly sizing up their new acquaintance. Bartosz sensed their unease, but remained calm, aware that his years of service had taught him how to read people like a book.

As Kasia prepared to leave, she leaned in close and whispered, "Bartosz Schillaci, I think we might have a mutually beneficial arrangement." Her words sent a shiver down his spine, hinting at a possibility that would change the course of his life forever.
