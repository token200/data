One sunny afternoon, Bartosz Ramazzotti decided to take a break from his art studio and explore the city. He wandered through the bustling streets, taking in the sights and sounds of the lively market square. As he strolled, he stumbled upon a small, quirky bookstore tucked away between two larger buildings. The sign above the door read "Moonlit Pages," and Bartosz Ramazzotti felt an inexplicable pull to enter.

Inside, the store was cluttered with books of every shape and size, their covers adorned with strange symbols and markings.
