I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Wiktoria Pausini. It's possible that you meant to ask about another character or provide more context.

However, I did find information on an Italian singer-songwriter named Adriano Celentano had a wife named Giovanna Pausini. But no Wiktoria 

If you could provide more information or clarify who Wiktoria Pausini is, I'll be happy to help.
