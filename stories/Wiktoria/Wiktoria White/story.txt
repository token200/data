Wiktoria White was a woman with a reputation for being as elusive as a ghost. She flitted from one high-society gathering to the next, leaving a trail of whispers and speculation in her wake. Some said she was a socialite, always on the lookout for the next big thing. Others claimed she was a spy, using her charm and beauty to gather intel from the shadows.

But Wiktoria knew the truth: she was running.

She had grown up in a world of privilege, but it had never felt like enough. She had seen the cracks in the facade, the desperation beneath the surface, and she couldn't ignore it any longer. So she had left, abandoned the mansion and the title that came with it, and set out to make her own way.

It wasn't easy. Wiktoria had to learn how to survive on her own, how to navigate the streets and avoid the people who were looking for her. She took on odd jobs, worked as a waitress, and even sold art on the street corner. But she never stopped moving, never stayed in one place long enough to get too comfortable.

One night, Wiktoria found herself at a gallery opening in SoHo. The lights were flashing, the music was pulsating, and the crowd was swarming like bees. She watched from the edge of the room, her eyes scanning the sea of faces for something – anything – that would give her a sense of belonging.

And then she saw him: a young artist, his paintings on display like a rebellious cry to the world. Wiktoria felt a spark of recognition, a sense of kinship with this stranger who seemed to be speaking straight to her soul.

She approached him, introducing herself with a smile and a laugh. They talked for hours, exchanging stories and secrets, until the night was long gone and the gallery had emptied out.

As they said their goodbyes, Wiktoria felt a sense of peace wash over her. For the first time in months, she felt like she might finally be able to stop running.

But as she turned to leave, she caught sight of herself in a nearby mirror. The woman staring back at her was different from the one who had walked into that gallery just hours before. Her eyes were darker, her smile more guarded. Wiktoria knew then that she would never be free of her past – but with this young artist by her side, maybe she could find a new way to live.

The question was, how long could she keep running from herself?
