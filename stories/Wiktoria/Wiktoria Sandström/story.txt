Wiktoria Sandström stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar scene before her. The small town of Åre was quiet, even for a winter's evening in February. She had spent countless Christmases here as a child, watching snowflakes dance outside her window like ballerinas.

As she made her way through the deserted streets, Wiktoria's thoughts turned to her parents. They had passed away a year ago, leaving her with a small inheritance that would barely cover her rent for the season. She had always known that this day would come, but it still felt hard to accept.

Wiktoria pushed open the door to the cozy café where she worked part-time as a barista. The owner, Elsa, smiled warmly as she poured Wiktoria's cup of steaming coffee. "You look like you could use a break," she said, handing her a pastry.

As Wiktoria worked on making drinks for the few patrons who had braved the cold, she couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia. This café was where she and her parents would come to celebrate Christmas Eve, their laughter mingling with the scent of baking cookies and hot chocolate.

Wiktoria took a deep breath, letting the familiar scents transport her back to happier times. She thought about all the Christmases she had spent in Åre as a child, building snowmen with her parents and snuggling up by the fire for stories. Her mother used to make her favorite recipe, Swedish pepparkakor cookies, which were still sweet on Wiktoria's taste buds even after all these years.

As the evening wore on, Wiktoria's mind turned to plans for Christmas Eve this year. She had promised to meet up with an old friend from high school who had moved back to Åre. They would spend the night swapping stories and laughing together like they used to when they were teenagers.

Wiktoria smiled to herself as she finished preparing a drink order. Even though things were still tough, and her parents weren't there to share it with her, she knew that Christmas in Åre was always a special time of year. It was a reminder that some traditions, like the ones she shared with Elsa and her old friend, could be kept alive even when life took unexpected turns.
