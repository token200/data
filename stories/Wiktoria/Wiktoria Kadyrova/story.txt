Wiktoria Kadyrova stepped into the grand ballroom, her eyes scanning the crowded room for any sign of her sister. It was a chilly winter evening in St. Petersburg, and the opulence of the palace seemed to match the frosty air outside.

As she made her way through the throng of guests, Wiktoria's thoughts drifted back to her childhood, growing up alongside her sister, Natalia Kadyrova. They had always been inseparable, sharing secrets and dreams beneath the snowflakes that fell gently on their family's small estate in the countryside.

Now, as an adult, Wiktoria found herself at a crossroads. Her parents had arranged for her to marry a wealthy merchant, a union that would secure their family's financial future. But Wiktoria's heart belonged to the world of art, and she longed to follow her passion, even if it meant going against her family's wishes.

As she approached the bar, a glass of wine in hand, Wiktoria spotted Natalia across the room, laughing with a group of friends. She felt a pang of nostalgia wash over her, remembering the countless hours they had spent exploring the woods and fields around their home, creating stories and adventures that would last a lifetime.

Just then, a gentle voice interrupted her reverie. "Wiktoria, my dear, may I have the pleasure?" It was Countess Orlova, an elderly woman who had been a family friend for years. Wiktoria smiled, feeling a sense of comfort in the warm smile and familiar eyes.

"Of course, Your Excellency," she replied, accepting a fan from the countess's hand.

As they chatted, Wiktoria realized that this might be her chance to make amends with her family and forge a new path. With Natalia by her side, she vowed to find a way to balance her duty and her passion, no matter what lay ahead.

For now, though, she let herself get lost in the music and laughter of the ballroom, surrounded by people who knew her as Wiktoria Kadyrova, the daughter of a good family.
