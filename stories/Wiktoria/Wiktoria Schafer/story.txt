Wiktoria Schafer stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. She had been traveling for hours, and the exhaustion was starting to catch up with her. As she made her way through the crowd, Wiktoria's mind began to wander back to the letter she had received earlier that day.

It was from an old acquaintance, one who claimed to have information about her late mother's past. Wiktoria's mother had always been tight-lipped about her family history, and Wiktoria had grown up with more questions than answers. The prospect of finally uncovering some truth had been tantalizing, but she had also been wary – what if the person on the other end was trying to pull a fast one?

Wiktoria made her way through the station, her feet carrying her on autopilot as her mind worked overtime. She had always been a bit of a loner, content to keep to herself and observe the world around her. But there was something about this letter that had sparked a curiosity she hadn't felt in years.

As she emerged into the bright sunlight, Wiktoria took a deep breath and squared her shoulders. She was going to meet this person, whoever they were, and see what they had to say. The prospect made her feel both nervous and exhilarated.

Wiktoria hailed a taxi and gave the driver an address that felt like a detour from the main road. The man looked at her warily as she paid the fare, but Wiktoria just smiled and said "it's okay". She had been on enough journeys to know when it was time to trust her instincts.

The taxi pulled up in front of a small café, where Wiktoria was greeted by a woman with piercing green eyes. "Wiktoria Schafer?" the woman asked, her voice low and husky. Wiktoria nodded, feeling a shiver run down her spine. She knew she had made the right decision.
