Her piercing green eyes sparkled with an otherworldly intensity, as if they held secrets and stories that only she could tell.

Wiktoria Mäkinen was a woman of mystery, with a past shrouded in intrigue. Few knew much about her, except that she had a way of appearing at the most unexpected times, like a ghost from another era. Some said she was a former spy, while others claimed she was a reincarnated sorceress.

One day, Wiktoria Mäkinen walked into a small café in the heart of the city, her long black hair cascading down her back like a waterfall. She ordered a cup of coffee and sat at a table by the window, watching as people bustled about their daily lives.
