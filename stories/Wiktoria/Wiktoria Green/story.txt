Wiktoria Green stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee and staring out the window. It had been months since she'd last seen her old friend, Alex, but their paths had crossed again by chance.

Wiktoria Green made her way over to the table, exchanging a warm smile with Alex as she sat down across from him. The conversation flowed easily, reminiscing about old times and sharing stories of their respective lives. Wiktoria Green couldn't help but feel grateful for the friendship that still held strong despite time and distance.

As they chatted, Wiktoria Green noticed a peculiar look on Alex's face. He seemed distracted, lost in thought. "What's on your mind?" she asked, her voice soft with concern. Alex sighed, running a hand through his hair before launching into a tale of his latest struggles.

Wiktoria listened intently, offering words of encouragement and advice. She remembered when they'd first met in art school, bonding over their shared passion for photography. Wiktoria Green had always been the more outgoing one, while Alex was reserved but creative. Their differing personalities complemented each other perfectly, and their friendship flourished as a result.

As the hours passed, Wiktoria Green realized that she had forgotten what it was like to truly relax with someone. Life had gotten busier, and priorities had shifted. But in this moment, surrounded by Alex's calm energy, she felt at ease once more.

The sun began to set outside, casting a warm glow over the café. Wiktoria Green and Alex sat in comfortable silence, watching as people came and went. It was a fleeting connection, one that might soon be severed by the demands of life. But for now, they savored the moment, enjoying each other's company without pretenses.

As they parted ways, promising to stay in touch, Wiktoria Green couldn't help but feel grateful for the friendship she'd found with Alex. It was a bond forged in art school, strengthened by shared struggles and strengthened still by quiet moments like this one. She smiled to herself as she walked away from the café, feeling revitalized and renewed.
