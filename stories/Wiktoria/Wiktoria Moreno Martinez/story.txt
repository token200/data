Wiktoria Moreno Martinez was a woman with a passion for photography that knew no bounds. Born and raised in the vibrant city of Mexico City, she had grown up surrounded by the colors, textures, and energy of the urban jungle. As a child, she would spend hours exploring the markets, alleys, and plazas with her abuela, learning about the intricate details of every building, flower, and person they met.

As she grew older, Wiktoria's love for photography only intensified. She spent countless hours practicing, experimenting with different lenses, styles, and techniques until she found her unique voice.

Throughout it all, Wiktoria remained true to herself and her roots. She continued to explore the city, always seeking new perspectives and inspirations. For Wiktoria Moreno Martinez, photography was not just a hobby or a career – it was a way of life, a means of connecting with the world around her and sharing its beauty with others.
