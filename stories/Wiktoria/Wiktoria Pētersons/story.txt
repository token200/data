Just then, her phone buzzed with a text from her best friend, Ieva. "Hey, Wiktoria! Meet me at the market tonight? We need to celebrate your one-year anniversary." Wiktoria Pētersons' heart skipped a beat – she had almost forgotten about the milestone. She quickly replied, confirming her attendance and making plans for a night out with friends.

As the evening drew near, Wiktoria Pētersons made her way to the market, feeling a sense of excitement and anticipation. The streets were alive with music and laughter, and she couldn't wait to toast to another year of her café's success and celebrate this special moment with Ieva by her side.
