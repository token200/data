Wiktoria Rossi stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She had received a cryptic message from an old acquaintance, hinting that they might have information about her missing sister. As she waited in line to order, Wiktoria's mind wandered back to her childhood days spent with her sister, Ariana.

Ariana had always been the adventurous one, the free spirit who loved taking risks and pushing boundaries. Wiktoria, on the other hand, had been more cautious, content to spend her time reading and learning new things. But despite their differences, they had always been close, sharing a bond that only sisters could understand.

As Wiktoria waited for her coffee, she noticed a figure sitting in the corner, sipping a cup of black liquid. There was something about them that seemed off, but Wiktoria couldn't quite put her finger on it. She decided to take a chance and approach them.

"Mind if I join you?" Wiktoria asked, nodding towards the empty chair across from them.

The figure looked up, revealing piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into Wiktoria's soul. "Not at all," they replied, their voice low and smooth. "I've been expecting you."

Wiktoria's instincts told her to be wary, but she pushed aside her doubts and sat down. The stranger revealed themselves to be an old friend of Ariana's, someone who had known Wiktoria since childhood.

Over the next hour, the stranger shared stories about Ariana's life after she disappeared. It was a tale of adventure and danger, of secrets and lies. But it also hinted at something deeper, something that Wiktoria couldn't quite grasp.

As she left the café, Wiktoria felt a sense of determination wash over her. She would find out what had happened to her sister, no matter what it took. And as she walked away from the building, she whispered Ariana's name under her breath, feeling a connection to her sister that seemed stronger than ever before.
