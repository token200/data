With her vibrant murals and bold stencil work, she had captured the attention of art enthusiasts and critics alike.

Her murals often featured powerful symbols and imagery, drawing attention to the struggles faced by marginalized communities and the impact of human activity on the natural world.

Her big break came when she was commissioned to create a large-scale mural in the city's main square, where it quickly became a tourist attraction and a symbol of the city's vibrant cultural scene.

Wiktoria Kulbayeva's success had also brought her a new level of recognition, with international exhibitions and awards pouring in. But for Wiktoria, there was no substitute for the thrill of creating art on the streets, where she could connect directly with her community and leave a lasting impact. As she stood before one of her latest murals, a sense of pride and satisfaction washed over her â€“ this was what it meant to be an artist, and to be Wiktoria Kulbayeva.
