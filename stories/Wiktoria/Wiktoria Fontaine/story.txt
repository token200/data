Wiktoria Fontaine stepped into the grand ballroom, her eyes scanning the sea of familiar faces. As the daughter of the wealthy and influential Fontaine family, she had grown accustomed to being the center of attention. But on this particular evening, Wiktoria was determined to let someone else take the spotlight.

As she made her way through the crowds, Wiktoria's gaze landed on a figure standing alone by the fireplace. It was Marcus Thompson, a young and talented artist who had been making waves in the art world with his provocative exhibitions. The two had met briefly at a charity event a few months prior, but Wiktoria had been too caught up in her own social circle to follow up.

As she approached Marcus, he turned to face her, his piercing blue eyes locking onto hers. "Wiktoria Fontaine," he said, his voice low and smooth. "It's been too long."

Wiktoria smiled, feeling a flutter in her chest that she hadn't experienced in years. She had always been told that artists were eccentric and unpredictable, but there was something about Marcus that drew her in.

"Marcus Thompson," she replied, extending her hand. As they shook hands, Wiktoria felt a spark of electricity run through her body. It was as if the entire room had melted away, leaving only the two of them standing alone by the fire.

For the next hour, Wiktoria and Marcus talked about art, politics, and everything in between. They laughed and joked, their conversation flowing effortlessly. As the night wore on, Wiktoria found herself feeling more alive than she had in years.

As the clock struck midnight, Marcus turned to her with a mischievous grin. "I have an idea," he said, his eyes glinting with excitement. "Want to come with me and see my latest exhibition?"

Wiktoria's heart skipped a beat as she nodded eagerly. For the first time in years, she felt like she was being seen, really seen, by someone who didn't care about her family's wealth or status.

As they left the ballroom together, Wiktoria knew that she had found someone special. And for the first time in her life, she wasn't alone.
