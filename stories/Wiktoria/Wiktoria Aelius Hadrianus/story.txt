Wiktoria Aelius Hadrianus stood tall, her piercing emerald eyes scanning the crowded market square with a mix of curiosity and disdain. As a member of the noble class, she was accustomed to being surrounded by adoring crowds, but there was something about this particular gathering that grated on her nerves.

The vendor selling exotic spices caught her eye, and Wiktoria Aelius Hadrianus wandered over to investigate. The vendor, an elderly man with a bushy white beard, greeted her with a warm smile. "Ah, Lady Hadrianus! Welcome to my humble stall. I have just the thing for someone of your refined taste."

Wiktoria's eyes landed on a small pouch containing a rare and precious spice, known as Starlight Salt. The vendor told her it was said to possess magical properties, and Wiktoria Aelius Hadrianus was intrigued. She purchased the salt and took a pinch, inhaling its pungent aroma.

As she walked away from the stall, Wiktoria couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. The crowd seemed too... uniform. Too eager to please. She quickened her pace, her hand instinctively reaching for the dagger at her belt.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows, their eyes fixed intently on Wiktoria Aelius Hadrianus. It was a young woman, with skin as pale as alabaster and hair as black as coal. "You're quite the legend, Lady Hadrianus," she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

Wiktoria's grip on her dagger tightened, but to her surprise, the woman didn't flinch. Instead, she smiled, revealing razor-sharp fangs. "I've been searching for you, Wiktoria Aelius Hadrianus. I have a proposition that might just change your life forever."

For a moment, Wiktoria was taken aback. No one had ever called her by her full name before. It was a unique and intimate gesture, one that made her feel both intrigued and uneasy. She hesitated for a moment before nodding, her mind racing with possibilities.

"Tell me more," she said finally, the sound of her own voice barely above a whisper.
