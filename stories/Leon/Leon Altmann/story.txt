Leon Altmann stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit jazz club, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. He spotted her in the corner, sipping on a whiskey sour, her dark hair curled beneath a vintage fedora.

It had been five years since Leon last set foot in this city, five years since he'd left the chaos of his past behind and started anew. But tonight was different. Tonight, he'd received an invitation from an old friend, one who promised him secrets and redemption.

As he made his way through the crowd, the sounds of a saxophone wafted through the air, mingling with the scent of cigarette smoke and cheap perfume. Leon's heart beat faster with every step, his instincts on high alert.

He spotted his friend, Viktor, standing by the bar, watching him approach. "Leon," he said, his voice low and gravelly, as Leon slid onto the stool beside him. "It's been too long."

"Viktor," Leon replied, ordering a drink from the bartender. "What have you got for me?"

Viktor leaned in, his eyes glinting with mischief. "I've got something that'll make your blood run cold, Leon. Something that'll make you question everything you thought you knew about yourself."

Leon's instincts screamed warning, but he listened as Viktor spun a tale of deceit and betrayal, one that left him reeling. As the night wore on, the rain outside seemed to intensify, drumming against the pavement like a rhythmic countdown.

Suddenly, Leon's phone buzzed in his pocket, shrill and insistent. He pulled it out, scanning the screen before his eyes widened in shock. It was a text from an unknown number, one that sent shivers down his spine: "Meet me at the old warehouse on 5th and Main. Come alone."

Leon's gut told him to walk away, but something about Viktor's words lingered, refusing to let go. He turned back to his friend, who was watching him with an unreadable expression.

"Who sent you?" Leon asked, his voice low.

Viktor shrugged, a hint of a smile playing on his lips. "Someone from your past, Leon. Someone who wants to set the record straight."

Leon's mind reeled as he finished his drink and stood up, the dim lights of the jazz club swirling around him like a vortex. He knew that once he stepped out into the rain-soaked night, there was no turning back.

With a deep breath, he walked away from Viktor's side, leaving behind the only life he'd ever known. The music faded to silence as Leon Altmann vanished into the darkness, his eyes fixed on the looming silhouette of the old warehouse, waiting for him like an open door to the unknown.
