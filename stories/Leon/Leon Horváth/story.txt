Leon Horváth stepped into the dimly lit café, his piercing green eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. A former spy and current private investigator, he had a reputation for being one of the best in the business. His rugged features and chiseled jawline only added to his air of mystery.

As he waited for his contact, Leon took a seat at the bar, ordering a whiskey on the rocks as he watched the patrons. The café was a hub for the city's elite, and Leon had been sent to retrieve information about a high-stakes heist that had gone down just last night.

A slender woman with piercing blue eyes slid onto the stool beside him, her voice barely above a whisper. "Leon Horváth, I presume?" she asked, her hand extended in greeting.

"Vivian," Leon replied, shaking her hand firmly as he took his drink from the bartender. "What can I do for you?"

Vivian handed over a small folder containing photographs and receipts. "I represent one of your clients," she said, her eyes locked on Leon's. "They're willing to pay top dollar for information about the heist. We believe it involved some shady characters from Eastern Europe."

Leon took the folder, his fingers tracing the edges as he scanned the contents. The names and dates matched up with reports he had received earlier that day. This was going to be bigger than he initially thought.

"Who is your client?" Leon asked, his eyes never leaving Vivian's face.

Vivian leaned in close, her voice dropping to a whisper. "A wealthy businessman named Marcus Thompson. He's willing to do whatever it takes to get his hands on that stolen artifact."

Leon raised an eyebrow as he folded the folder and tucked it into his pocket. This was going to be a long night. As he stood up to leave, Vivian called out one final time: "Be careful, Leon Horváth. There are those who would kill for that artifact."
