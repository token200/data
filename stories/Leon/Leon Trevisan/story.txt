Leon Trevisan stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the bustling streets of 1920s New Orleans. As a private investigator, he had seen his fair share of cases, but there was something about this one that didn't sit right with him. A wealthy socialite, Madame Dupre, had hired him to find her missing sister, Colette.

Colette Trevisan, the younger sister of Leon Trevisan, had been last seen leaving a high-society ball at the mansion of their family's longtime benefactor, Monsieur LaFleur. Rumors swirled that Colette had become entangled with the wrong crowd, but as far as Leon knew, she was innocent.

Leon began his investigation by interviewing Madame Dupre and the other guests who had attended the ball. Everyone seemed shaken by Colette's disappearance, but no one had any concrete information about her whereabouts. As he dug deeper, Leon discovered that Monsieur LaFleur had been acting strangely in the days leading up to Colette's disappearance.

Leon's gut told him that there was more to this case than met the eye. He decided to pay a visit to Monsieur LaFleur's estate, where he found himself face to face with the man's enigmatic butler, Jenkins. "I've been expecting you, Mr. Trevisan," Jenkins said, his voice dripping with an air of superiority.

Leon was taken aback by the butler's sudden interest in him, but he pressed on, asking questions about Colette and her disappearance. Jenkins hesitated before speaking, revealing a cryptic message that sent a chill down Leon's spine. As he left Monsieur LaFleur's estate, Leon couldn't shake off the feeling that he was being led deeper into a web of deceit and corruption.

Despite the danger, Leon Trevisan remained resolute in his determination to find Colette Trevisan and uncover the truth behind her disappearance. He knew that time was running out, and he had to act fast if he wanted to save his sister before it was too late.
