Leon Fournier stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the sleepy station for any sign of life. It was late at night, and the only sound was the distant hum of crickets and the occasional hoot of an owl.

He had been traveling for days, ever since he'd received a cryptic letter from his old mentor, Professor Thaddeus. The professor's words were always laced with mystery and urgency, but Leon had never let that deter him before. This time, however, something felt different.

As he walked through the deserted streets of Ravenswood, Leon couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He quickened his pace, his eyes darting between the flickering streetlights and the dark alleyways between them.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was a woman, her long hair tied back in a ponytail, her eyes fixed intently on Leon.

"Leon Fournier," she said, her voice low and husky. "I've been waiting for you."

Leon's hand instinctively went to his pocket, where he kept a small pistol and a worn leather notebook. He had always been a man of habit, and this sudden interruption was unnerving.

"Who are you?" Leon asked, trying to keep his voice steady.

"My name is Sophia," the woman replied, her eyes never leaving Leon's face. "And I'm here to tell you that Professor Thaddeus has gone missing."

Leon's eyes narrowed. He had been expecting a cryptic message, not a straightforward confession of theft or worse.

"Sophia, what do you know?" Leon demanded, his hand tightening around the pistol in his pocket.

Sophia took a deep breath before answering. "I've been working with Professor Thaddeus for months," she said. "And I think he may have stumbled upon something big. Something that could change everything."

Leon's mind was racing. He had always been drawn to the unknown, the unexplained. And now, it seemed, he was about to uncover a mystery that would shake the very foundations of Ravenswood.

Without another word, Leon followed Sophia into the night, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
