Milo Aber stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. He had arrived in Ashwood, a small town on the other side of the continent, with little more than a suitcase and a determination to start anew.

As he made his way through the quiet streets, Milo couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. The townspeople seemed friendly enough, but their smiles felt forced, like they were hiding secrets behind their warm gazes.

Milo had left everything behind – his old life, his family, his friends. He had been running for years, from the memories of a tragedy that still haunted him to this day. Ashwood was supposed to be a fresh start, a chance to leave it all behind and find some semblance of peace.

As he walked, the buildings grew taller and more ornate, until Milo found himself standing in front of an old mansion that seemed to lean precariously to one side. The sign above the door read "Ravenwood Manor".

Milo took a deep breath and pushed open the creaky door, stepping into a foyer filled with dust and fading grandeur. A faint scent of lavender wafted through the air, transporting him back to his childhood summers spent at his grandparents' estate.

He wandered through the empty rooms, feeling a sense of nostalgia wash over him. This was it – this was where he would finally find the peace he had been searching for.

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the floor, Milo settled into a dusty armchair and closed his eyes. He felt the weight of his past bearing down on him, but for the first time in years, he felt like he could breathe.

The sound of footsteps echoed through the hallway, and Milo opened his eyes to find a young woman standing before him, her piercing green eyes sparkling with curiosity. "Welcome to Ravenwood," she said, extending a hand. "I'm Emilia."

As they talked into the night, Milo found himself drawn to Emilia's kind heart and infectious laughter. For the first time in years, he felt like he was home.

Over the next few weeks, Milo settled into a routine that felt almost familiar – long walks through the countryside, dinner conversations with Emilia about everything and nothing, and late nights lost in books and music.

For the first time since his departure from Ashwood, Milo felt like himself again. He had found a place to call home, a friend to share it with, and a sense of purpose that went beyond running from his past.

As he lay on his bed, listening to Emilia's soft snores outside his room, Milo smiled to himself. This was it – this was where he belonged. And for the first time in years, he felt truly at peace.
