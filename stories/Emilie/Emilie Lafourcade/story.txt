Emilie Lafourcade stepped off the crowded train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of her missing sister, Léa. It had been three days since she last heard from her, and Emilie's worry was growing by the minute.

As a freelance journalist, Emilie had always been drawn to the unknown, but this latest assignment had put her in over her head. She had agreed to investigate a series of strange occurrences in the small town of Saint-Pierre, where Léa had gone missing.

Emilie made her way through the station, asking locals if they had seen Léa, but no one seemed to have any information. Frustrated and worried, she pulled out her phone to try and contact her sister's last known contacts.

As she waited for a response, Emilie couldn't help but think back to when she was younger, growing up in the same small town where Léa had now disappeared. They had always been close, sharing secrets and dreams as they navigated the ups and downs of adolescence.

Emilie's phone finally rang, shrill in the quiet station. She answered, her heart racing with hope, but it was only a wrong number. Disappointment washed over her, but she refused to give up. She tried again, dialing Léa's number for what felt like the hundredth time.

Just as she was about to hang up, a familiar voice picked up on the other end of the line. "Emilie, it's me," Léa whispered, her voice trembling with fear. "I'm in trouble, Em. I need your help."

Emilie's heart leapt with excitement and relief as she listened to her sister's words, piecing together a plan to rescue Léa from whatever danger had brought her to this place. She promised Léa that she would be there in no time, and the two sisters shared a vow of protection and loyalty.

With newfound determination, Emilie set off into the unknown, ready to face whatever lay ahead for herself and her sister, Emilie Lafourcade.
