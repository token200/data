I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Emilie Kortajarena. It's possible that this character does not exist in my database or is not a well-known figure.

However, I can create a story about a fictional character with the given name and surname. Here's a 375-word story:

Emilie Kortajarena was a brilliant and resourceful young detective who had a passion for solving mysteries. She worked tirelessly to crack even the toughest cases, often using her quick wit and sharp instincts to outsmart culprits.

As she sat at her desk, pouring over a stack of files and evidence, Emilie's mind began to spin with theories and possibilities. She was on the hunt for a notorious thief who had been evading the police for months, leaving a trail of clues in his wake.

With her eyes scanning the documents, Emilie noticed a small discrepancy in the suspect's alibi. She felt a surge of excitement as she realized that this could be the break she needed to finally catch the thief. She quickly grabbed her phone and dialed the number of her trusted partner, Detective James.

"Jim, I think I've got something," Emilie said, her voice barely containing her enthusiasm. "The suspect's alibi is a lie. He was at the scene of the crime, all right."

Detective James's voice came through the line, calm and collected as always. "What makes you think that, Em?" he asked.

Emilie smiled to herself, knowing she had done her research. "It's just a gut feeling, Jim. And I'm right."

With renewed energy, Emilie dove back into the case, following every lead and tracing every thread of evidence. She was determined to catch the thief and bring him to justice.

As the sun began to set on another long day, Emilie leaned back in her chair, a sense of satisfaction washing over her. She had solved the case, and it felt amazing.
