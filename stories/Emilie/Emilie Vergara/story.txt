Emilie Vergara was known for her fierce determination and unwavering commitment to justice. As a young and ambitious lawyer, she had already made a name for herself in the small town of Oakdale, where she had grown up. Her parents, immigrants from Colombia, had instilled in her a strong sense of duty and responsibility, which drove her to pursue a career in law.

One day, Emilie was approached by a local family whose farm had been threatened by a large corporation seeking to buy out the land. The family, who were small-scale farmers, couldn't afford to fight back against the corporation's offers of buyout. Emilie took on their case, determined to protect the family's way of life.
