Emilie Nieminen stepped into the bustling café, her bright blue eyes scanning the crowded room in search of familiar faces. As the lead singer of the up-and-coming indie rock band, Starlight Riot, she was used to being recognized and mobbed by fans eager to catch a glimpse of their idol.

But Emilie Nieminen wasn't here for the attention; she was here to meet with her guitarist, Max, to discuss the upcoming tour. She spotted him at the corner table, sipping on a cup of black coffee, and made her way over.

"Hey, Max," she said, plopping down in the chair across from him. "What's up?"

"Not much, Em," he replied, his dark hair mussed from sleep. "Just going over the set list one last time before we head out on tour."

Emilie Nieminen nodded thoughtfully, her mind already racing with ideas for their live performances. She loved the way the spotlight highlighted Max's angular features, and the way his fingers moved deftly over the fretboard.

As they delved deeper into the conversation, Emilie Nieminen couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement building inside her. This tour was going to be their biggest one yet, with dates scheduled across Europe and North America. She knew it wouldn't be easy – the constant travel, the grueling rehearsal schedule – but she was ready for it.

Max raised an eyebrow as she began to pace back and forth behind him. "You okay, Em? You seem a little...on edge."

Emilie Nieminen stopped pacing, her eyes locked on his. "I'm fine," she said, her voice low. "Just feeling a lot of pressure, that's all."

Max nodded sympathetically. "We'll get through it together, you know that." He reached out and put a hand on her arm, giving it a gentle squeeze.

Emilie Nieminen felt a surge of gratitude towards her bandmate. She knew she could count on Max to have her back, no matter what the road ahead threw their way.
