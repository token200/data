I couldn't find any information on a public figure named Martins Bocelli. It's possible that you meant to ask about Andrea Bocelli, an Italian tenor.

If that's the case, here's a story about him:

Andrea Bocelli was born in Lajatico, Italy, with a rare condition called congenital glaucoma that left his right eye almost blind. Despite this challenge, he became one of the most renowned opera singers of all time.

As a young boy, Andrea would listen to opera records and imagine himself on stage, singing alongside his idols like Luciano Pavarotti and Pl√°cido Domingo. He began training at the age of 12 and quickly discovered that music was not only his passion but also his escape from the world around him.

Andrea's journey to stardom was far from easy. He faced numerous setbacks, including a car accident in 1993 that left him temporarily blind. However, with the help of his family, friends, and team, he continued to pursue his dreams.

One day, Andrea received an invitation to perform at La Scala in Milan, Italy - a dream come true for any musician. He prepared tirelessly, rehearsing his songs and perfecting his technique. On the night of the performance, he took the stage with confidence and poise, singing with all the passion and emotion that had made him famous.

As the crowd cheered and applauded, Andrea Bocelli knew that he had truly made it to the top. He continued to tour and perform, sharing his music with fans around the world. Despite his fame, he never forgot where he came from and remained humble and kind throughout his career.

Years later, when asked about his journey, Andrea would smile and say, "I am grateful for every step of my life, including the challenges that made me who I am today." His inspiring story has touched hearts and inspired countless people around the globe.
