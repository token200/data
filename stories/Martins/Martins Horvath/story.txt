As a young boy, Martins grew up in a small village surrounded by rolling hills and fields of golden wheat. He was fascinated by the way light danced across the landscape, casting shadows and highlighting textures. His parents, though skeptical at first, soon encouraged his love for photography, providing him with his first camera and teaching him the basics.
