Martins Straume stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the bustling streets of Oslo. As a renowned detective with the Hordaland police department, he was no stranger to the city's underbelly. His sharp eyes scanned the crowded square, taking in the mix of tourists and locals alike.

It had been three days since the mysterious murder, and Martins Straume was still stumped. The victim, a young woman named Lena, had been found with no signs of forced entry or struggle. Her phone, wallet, and all personal belongings were still intact, leaving behind only one clue: a small, silver locket bearing an unfamiliar logo.

As he walked, Martins Straume's mind replayed the events of the previous days. He had interviewed Lena's colleagues, friends, and even her family members, but no one seemed to have any information about the murder. It was as if she had vanished into thin air.

Suddenly, a figure caught his eye - a young woman with striking blue eyes and raven-black hair. She stood at the edge of the square, watching him with an intensity that made Martins Straume's skin prickle.

"Can I help you?" he asked, approaching her cautiously.

"I've been looking for you," she replied, her voice low and husky. "I think I might have some information about Lena's murder."

Martins Straume's eyes narrowed as he pulled out his notebook and pen. "What do you know?"

The woman hesitated before speaking in a barely audible whisper: "I saw someone lurking around the alleyway where Lena was found. It was a man, tall and lean with piercing green eyes. I've seen him before, but I couldn't place him."

Martins Straume's grip on his pen tightened as he committed every detail to memory. This could be the break they needed. "Do you know where I can find this man?"
