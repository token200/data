Martins Nielsen, a 30-year-old graphic novelist, sat hunched over his desk, staring at the blank page in front of him. His latest project, "Echoes of Eternity," was due soon, and he still hadn't finished the final chapter. As he rubbed his tired eyes, Martins couldn't help but feel overwhelmed by the pressure.

He had always been passionate about storytelling, ever since he was a child, spending hours sketching and writing comics in his notebook. But now, as a rising star in the comic book industry, Martins felt like he was carrying the weight of expectations on his shoulders.

Just then, his phone rang. It was his editor, reminding him that the manuscript was due in two days' time. Martins took a deep breath and picked up the phone, trying to sound more confident than he felt.

"Hey, Ed," he said, trying to keep his voice steady. "I'm on it. I just need a bit more time."

There was a pause on the other end of the line before Ed replied, "Martins, we've been over this. You're one of our top writers. We know you can deliver. Get it done, okay?"

Martins felt a surge of guilt and frustration. Why did he have to be so good at his job? Why couldn't he just relax and enjoy the process?

He hung up the phone and took a step back from his desk, trying to clear his head. As he sat there, staring blankly at the wall, Martins suddenly had an idea. He jumped up from his chair and began to sketch furiously on a piece of paper.

The ideas flowed effortlessly onto the page, as if the pressure and anxiety were fueling his creativity. By the time he finished, Martins had written several pages of new material, and the chapter was coming along much better than it had in hours before.

With renewed energy and focus, Martins sat back down at his desk, feeling a sense of determination wash over him. He would finish "Echoes of Eternity," no matter what. For himself, for Ed, and for the fans who were eagerly waiting to read it.
