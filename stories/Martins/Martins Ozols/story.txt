Born in Riga, Latvia, he grew up surrounded by the rich cultural heritage of his homeland, where traditional folk music played a significant role in everyday life.

The day of the performance arrived, and Martins took the stage with a sense of excitement and nerves. As he began to play and sing, his music seemed to transport the audience to another world - one that was filled with the beauty and wonder of Latvian folklore.

The crowd was captivated by Martins' performances, and he received a standing ovation at the end of each show. It was clear that Martins Ozols, full name Martin Oļņo Ēriks Ozols, had truly made it to the top - and his music would be remembered for generations to come.
