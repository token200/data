Martins Esther sat alone in the dimly lit café, sipping on a lukewarm coffee. The rain pattered against the windowpane, casting a melancholic melody that seemed to match the rhythm of her heart. It was a chilly winter evening, and Esther felt like she was drowning in the darkness.

As she gazed out into the rain-soaked streets, memories began to flood her mind. Memories of laughter, of love, of loss. Esther's thoughts drifted back to the past, when Martins was by her side. They had been inseparable, sharing every moment, every secret, and every dream.

But that was before the accident. Before Martins left her. Esther's eyes welled up with tears as she thought about the day she lost him. The pain still lingered, a constant ache that refused to subside. She missed him so much, it hurt. Every breath felt like a farewell, every beat of her heart reminded her of what she had lost.

The café door creaked open, and a stranger walked in. Esther watched as they ordered a hot chocolate and took a seat at the bar. There was something about their smile that seemed familiar, yet Esther couldn't quite place it. She turned back to her coffee, letting the bitter taste wash away some of the emotions that threatened to overwhelm her.

As the night wore on, Esther found herself lost in thought once again. Martins Esther would often wonder what could have been if she had taken a different path, if she had made different choices. But those thoughts were futile now. All she could do was hold onto the memories and let go of the past.

The rain continued to fall outside, casting its rhythmic beat on the pavement. Esther's heart still echoed with it, a reminder that some wounds would never fully heal. As she finished her coffee and prepared to leave, Esther couldn't help but wonder what Martins Esther would do if she were standing there, watching her. Would she offer words of comfort? Or would she simply be lost in thought, too?
