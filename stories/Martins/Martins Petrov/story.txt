Finally, after days of searching, they stumbled upon a hidden entrance to a long-abandoned tomb. Martins Petrov's heart racing with excitement, he led the team into the darkness within. The air was thick with dust and the scent of aged incense, but Martins Petrov's trained eyes adjusted quickly, revealing intricate hieroglyphs etched into the walls.
