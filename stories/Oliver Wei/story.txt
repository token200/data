Oliver Wei was an ordinary man, or so it seemed. By day, he worked as an accountant in a small firm in downtown Manhattan. But by night, he donned a different persona - that of a secret agent working for a top-secret government agency.

It had been ten years since Oliver's recruitment by the agency, and over time, he had become one of its most trusted operatives. His skills were unmatched: he could hack into even the most secure computer systems, and his charm was so effortless that he could talk his way out of any situation.

One night, as Oliver was walking home from a particularly long day at the office, he received a cryptic message on his phone. It read: "Meet me at Club Europa tonight at midnight. Come alone." The message was unsigned, but Oliver knew immediately who it must be from.

He arrived at the club just after midnight and scanned the crowded room for any sign of his contact. That's when he saw her - a stunning woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She spotted him across the room and smiled, beckoning him over.

As Oliver made his way through the throng of partygoers, the woman approached him. "Oliver," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I have information that could change everything."

"What are you talking about?" Oliver asked, his instincts on high alert.

The woman hesitated before pulling out a small USB drive from her purse. "This contains evidence of a major conspiracy involving some of the highest-ranking officials in our government," she said. "They're planning to sell classified information to the highest bidder."

Oliver's eyes widened as he took the drive from her. He knew immediately that this was bigger than anything he had ever encountered before.

Without hesitation, Oliver tucked the USB drive into his jacket pocket and turned to leave. The woman caught up to him outside the club, a look of urgency on her face.

"Be careful, Oliver," she warned. "They'll stop at nothing to silence you."

Oliver smiled grimly. "I've been in tighter spots than this before," he said.

As he disappeared into the night, the woman vanished into the crowd, leaving behind only a whispered phrase: "You're not the only one watching your back, Oliver."
