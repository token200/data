Łukasz Kowalczyk was a man consumed by his past. A former Polish police officer, he had spent years tracking down a notorious serial killer known as "The Shadow." The case had haunted him for over a decade, and despite finally bringing the perpetrator to justice, the memories lingered.

Now in his late 40s, Łukasz lived a quiet life in the countryside. He had retired from the police force, leaving behind the city's noise and chaos for the peace of the rural landscape. But even in this tranquil setting, he couldn't shake the feeling that The Shadow was still watching him.

One day, while out walking his dog, Łukasz stumbled upon a small, abandoned cottage on the edge of the forest. Something about it drew him in, and he felt an overwhelming urge to investigate. As he approached the crumbling structure, he noticed something etched into the door: "The Shadow was here."

A shiver ran down Łukasz's spine as he pushed open the creaking door and stepped inside. The air was thick with dust, and cobwebs clung to his face like skeletal fingers. He moved cautiously, his eyes adjusting to the dim light.

In the center of the room, a single chair sat upright, surrounded by the remnants of a long-abandoned meal. A note lay on the floor, penned in The Shadow's signature handwriting: "You'll never be free."

Łukasz felt a cold sweat break out across his forehead as he read the words. Was this some kind of twisted message from his past, or was someone trying to tell him that The Shadow still lingered? He knew he had to leave, but as he turned to exit, he caught a glimpse of something out of the corner of his eye.

A figure, tall and imposing, stood just beyond the doorway. Łukasz spun around, but there was no one there. The dog, sensing its master's unease, growled softly at his feet.

As the reality of the situation sank in, Łukasz realized that some wounds would never fully heal. He knew then that he had to confront The Shadow once more, to face whatever demons haunted him and put them to rest for good.
