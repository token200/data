Łukasz Jun was a man of mystery. A former Warsaw Ghetto Uprising participant, now living in exile on the outskirts of Krakow, he kept his past tightly locked away, like a treasure chest hidden deep within his soul.

His eyes told a story of their own - weathered and worn, with hints of smoke and ash etched into their corners. His dark hair was thinning, revealing patches of pale skin beneath. The lines on his face spoke of countless nights spent huddled in cellars, waiting for dawn to break. But despite the weariness that clung to him like a shroud, there was an unyielding spark within Łukasz's eyes - a flame that refused to be extinguished.

Every morning, Łukasz would take long walks along the Vistula River, lost in thought as he gazed out at the waters. He'd pause to watch the boats glide effortlessly across its surface, their sails billowing like white wings. The sounds of the city - laughter and chatter - seemed a million miles away, replaced by the gentle lapping of the river against its banks.

As he walked, Łukasz would ponder the what-ifs of his past. What if he'd found them sooner? Who were they, anyway? Whispers of a love, lost in the chaos of war. Memories that threatened to overwhelm him at times - like the scent of smoke and ash - yet never quite reached the surface.

One day, while strolling through a quaint Krakow market, Łukasz caught sight of a young woman with piercing green eyes. Her hair was wild and curly, framing her heart-shaped face like a wreath. As their gazes met, he felt an unfamiliar flutter in his chest - as if the very ground beneath him had shifted.

For weeks, Łukasz found himself wandering back to the market stall where they'd first met. They'd exchange whispered conversations, lost in each other's words like ships passing in the night. The past began to recede, ever so slightly, as they danced around the edges of his true self.

Yet with every step forward, Łukasz sensed a tug on the frayed rope of his soul. Like an undertow, memories tried to reclaim him - echoes from the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising that refused to fade. His breathing quickened; sweat formed on his brow as he wrestled with the beast within.

One evening, under a moonlit sky, Łukasz stood before the young woman, his heart heavy with the weight of his secrets. He opened his mouth to confess it all - the whispers and doubts that plagued him still. But words got caught in the throat of a man no longer sure what was real and what wasn't.

As the night air grew thick with anticipation, Łukasz Jun closed his eyes and whispered: "Maybe someday."
