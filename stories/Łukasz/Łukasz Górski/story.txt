Łukasz Górski, a young and ambitious journalist, had always been drawn to the world of investigative reporting. Growing up in Warsaw, Poland, he was fascinated by the stories of corruption and injustice that seemed to plague his country's politics and economy.

As a fresh graduate from the Journalism Academy, Łukasz landed an internship at a reputable news agency, where he quickly made a name for himself with his tenacious reporting style and sharp instincts. His bosses took notice of his work ethic and soon, he was assigned to cover high-profile cases of embezzlement and money laundering.

One day, while digging through financial records, Łukasz stumbled upon a trail that led him to the city's powerful mayor, Marek Zieliński.
