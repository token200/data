As a Polish historian, he had spent years studying the life and works of his great-great-grandfather, Henryk Sienkiewicz, the renowned author of "Quo Vadis" and "With Fire in His Heart".

Growing up, Łukasz had always felt a deep connection to his family's legacy, and he knew from a young age that he wanted to follow in his great-great-grandfather's footsteps. He pursued a degree in history and journalism, determined to make a name for himself as a writer and storyteller.
