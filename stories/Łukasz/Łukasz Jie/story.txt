Łukasz Jie was a man with a passion for art and music. Born in Warsaw, Poland, he grew up surrounded by the vibrant sounds and colors of his city's underground scene. As Łukasz Jie, he had always been drawn to the creative types, spending hours sketching street performers and attending impromptu concerts in abandoned warehouses.

After completing art school, Łukasz Jie landed a job as a graphic designer at a small publishing house. It was there that he honed his skills, working on book covers and flyers for emerging artists. His unique style quickly earned him a reputation among the city's art crowd, and soon he was receiving commissions from local galleries.

One evening, while sipping vodka with friends in a cramped bar, Łukasz Jie met her – a free-spirited musician named Sofia. Enchanted by her melodies, Łukasz Jie found himself returning to the bar every night, watching Sofia perform on her guitar.

Sofia encouraged Łukasz Jie to pursue his own creative endeavors, and soon he found himself working on his own musical projects in secret. With Sofia's support, Łukasz Jie began to write songs and produce music, experimenting with new sounds and styles.
