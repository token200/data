Łukasz "Luka" Roche was a man with a mysterious past. He had always been tight-lipped about his early life, and even those closest to him couldn't crack the facade of secrets that surrounded him. Some said he was born on the streets, while others whispered that he was the son of a wealthy family.

As a child, Luka was drawn to music, teaching himself to play the guitar in the alleys of his neighborhood. He formed a punk band with local kids and they spent countless nights playing gigs at dingy bars and clubs. It was on one such night that Luka met Julia, a striking artist who would become his partner in every sense of the word.

Together, they roamed Europe, leaving a trail of music and laughter behind them. They had two children, a boy named Mateusz and a girl named Zofia, both with eyes as bright as their parents'. Life was full of ups and downs, but through it all, Luka remained steadfast, always holding onto the rhythm that drove him.

Years went by and Julia passed away due to illness. It broke Luka's heart into pieces but he knew what he had to do – continue making music for his children and their families. The band continued to tour though it was now just a memory of its former self.

Luka spent more time playing at weddings, anniversaries and other family gatherings where Mateusz and Zofia would sing with him. Luka's legacy grew beyond the walls of Europe; his music reached every corner of the world through the many cover bands he started to help create new music inspired by the original work of Roche.
