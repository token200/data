Giovanni María was a man with a passion for music and a voice that could melt the coldest of hearts. He had grown up in a small town in Italy, where traditional folk songs were an integral part of everyday life. From a young age, Giovanni María had been drawn to the stories and emotions that these songs conveyed.
