Giovanni Vergara stepped out of his worn, black sedan and onto the cracked asphalt of the parking lot. The faint scent of exhaust and grease hung in the air, a reminder of the gritty reality that lay beneath the city's polished surface. As he made his way towards the dilapidated office building, the sound of distant sirens pierced the air, echoing off the walls.

Giovanni was a man with a reputation for being untouchable. A former hitman and mercenary, he had built a name for himself as one of the most feared men in the underworld. His clients came from all walks of life – from ruthless crime lords to corrupt politicians – all seeking his unique brand of discretion and efficiency.

As he entered the office building, Giovanni was greeted by the familiar sight of worn furniture and faded photographs on the walls. The receptionist looked up, a mixture of curiosity and wariness etched across her face as she took in Giovanni's imposing figure.

"Ah, Mr. Vergara," she said softly, her voice barely above a whisper. "You have visitors."

Giovanni nodded curtly, his eyes scanning the room as he moved towards the receptionist. A bespectacled man with a receding hairline sat on one of the worn chairs, fidgeting nervously in his seat.

"Ah, yes," the receptionist continued, handing Giovanni a small folder containing the details of the meeting. "They're here to discuss...certain business opportunities."

Giovanni's gaze narrowed as he opened the folder, scanning the contents with practiced efficiency. His eyes lingered on the name 'Raziel', a personage shrouded in mystery and whispered rumors of unparalleled ruthlessness.

As the bespectacled man stood up, Giovanni extended a hand, his grip firm but not unyielding. "So, Mr...?" he said, his voice devoid of warmth or curiosity.

"Kovalchuk," the man replied, shaking Giovanni's hand with an almost imperceptible tremble.

The two men moved to a cramped, windowless office at the back of the building, where a one-way mirror reflected their tense conversation. Kovalchuk outlined his proposal – a lucrative deal involving high-stakes hacking and surveillance services, all carried out under the guise of corporate espionage.

Giovanni listened intently, his expression unreadable as he weighed the risks and potential rewards. Finally, with a curt nod, he handed Kovalchuk a small, embossed business card. "I'm in," he said, the words devoid of inflection or enthusiasm.

As Kovalchuk's face lit up with triumph, Giovanni slipped his hand back into his pocket, disappearing from view behind the one-way mirror like a ghost.
