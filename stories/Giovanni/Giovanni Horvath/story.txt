Giovanni Horvath stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, his eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of trouble. As a private investigator, he had seen his fair share of shady characters and clandestine meetings. But there was something about this particular assignment that had him on edge.

He flashed a flickering candlelight across the walls as he approached the figure waiting in the corner. A hooded figure emerged from the shadows, revealing a familiar face - that of Giovanni Horvath's old friend and rival, Alessandro Moretti.

"Ah, Giovanni," Alessandro said with a sly smile, "I've been expecting you."

Giovanni Horvath narrowed his eyes, his grip on his flashlight tightening. "What do you want, Alessandro?"

"I have information about the missing heiress," Alessandro replied, his voice dripping with malice. "Information that could bring down the entire Morano family."

Giovanni's ears perked up at the mention of the high-profile case. He had been hired by the heiress's parents to find her, but so far, he had hit a dead end. Could this be the break he needed?

Alessandro continued, "I'm willing to share this information with you... for a price."

Giovanni Horvath took a step closer to Alessandro, his eyes locked on the other man's face. He could see the desperation in his friend's eyes, but also something more - a hint of revenge.

"What do you want, Alessandro?" Giovanni asked again, this time softer.

Alessandro hesitated for a moment before responding, "I just want to make sure that justice is served. The Moranos have wronged me, Giovanni Horvath, and I won't rest until they pay."

Giovanni's expression softened. He knew Alessandro's reputation as a ruthless businessman was well-deserved, but he also saw the pain in his friend's eyes.

"Alright," Giovanni said finally, "I'll listen to what you have to say. But you have to promise me one thing: no dirty tricks."

Alessandro nodded, a hint of a smile on his face. "I promise nothing, Giovanni Horvath. Nothing at all."
