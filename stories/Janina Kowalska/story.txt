Janina Kowalska stepped off the crowded train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the dimly lit station with a mixture of unease and determination. As she gazed out at the rows of worn wooden benches, the same worn wooden bench where she had spent countless nights, waiting for someone who never showed up.

The memory still stung like an open wound, but Janina refused to let it consume her. She took a deep breath, shouldering her battered suitcase and pushing her way through the crowds towards the station entrance. The cool spring air enveloped her, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and new beginnings.

Janina had left Poland for reasons she couldn't quite explain – a sense of restlessness that had grown over the years, like a fungus eating away at her very soul. She had come to Paris, seeking solace in the city's winding streets and cafes, where she could lose herself in the anonymity of the crowds.

As she made her way down the Rue de Rivoli, Janina felt an unfamiliar sense of peace settle over her. The buildings seemed taller, more majestic than they had before, their stone facades glowing with a soft, golden light that seemed to emanate from within. She passed by the famous Shakespeare and Company bookstore, its windows filled with the whispered secrets of generations past.

Janina's eyes landed on a small, quaint bakery, its doorway spilling out onto the sidewalk like a warm invitation. She pushed open the door, and was enveloped in the rich scent of freshly baked bread, her stomach growling in response.

The baker, an elderly woman with hands as gnarled as the wood of Janina's suitcase handle, greeted her with a warm smile. "Bonjour, mademoiselle! Welcome to my humble bakery."

Janina hesitated for a moment before taking a seat at a small table by the window. As she ordered a warm croissant and coffee, she noticed a group of students huddled in the corner, their faces aglow with an excitement that seemed almost infectious.

As Janina took her first bite of the flaky pastry, something shifted inside of her. The past began to recede, like sand slipping through the grains of an hourglass, leaving behind only the present – a moment suspended, waiting for its next chapter.
