Édith De Rossi stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the sleepy town as if it held secrets she was determined to uncover. She had arrived in Ravenswood just as the sun was setting, casting a golden glow over the quaint streets and cottages.

As a renowned journalist, Édith had built a reputation for herself on the streets of Paris, where she uncovered scandals and solved mysteries with her razor-sharp mind and quick wit. But it was this small town that had drawn her in - a place shrouded in mystery and rumor, where people whispered about ancient curses and supernatural occurrences.

Édith's eyes landed on a small café across the street, its sign creaking gently in the breeze. She pushed open the door, and the warm scent of coffee enveloped her like an old friend. The proprietor, a gruff but kind-eyed man named Pierre, greeted her with a nod.

"Welcome to Ravenswood," he said, his voice low and conspiratorial. "We've been expecting you."

Édith's ears pricked up. Expecting her? She raised an eyebrow. "I'm not sure what you mean, Monsieur...?"

"LeFleur," Pierre replied, with a slight bow. "My family has lived in Ravenswood for generations. We know all about your kind - the outsiders who come to our town seeking answers."

Édith smiled wryly. She had been warned that people like this didn't take kindly to strangers. But she was not one to back down from a challenge.

"I'm looking for information," she said, her eyes locked on Pierre's. "Rumors of an ancient curse, perhaps? Or whispers about the supernatural?"

Pierre leaned in closer, his voice barely above a whisper. "We've had reports of strange occurrences - doors opening and closing on their own, shadowy figures lurking in the woods... Some say it's the work of the Voodoo Queen, who still roams these hills."

Édith's heart quickened. She was onto something.

"Tell me more," she said, her pen poised over her notebook.

And with that, Édith De Rossi began to unravel the tangled threads of Ravenswood's dark history, following a trail of clues and rumors that would lead her deeper into the heart of mystery itself.
