Édith Korolev stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the city's sprawling landscape. The lights of Moscow twinkled like stars as she took a long drag on her cigarette. It was moments like these that she felt most alive.

As a renowned geologist, Édith had spent years studying the earth's crust, uncovering secrets hidden beneath its surface. Her work had taken her to every corner of the globe, from the scorching deserts of Africa to the frozen tundras of Siberia. But it was Russia that held her heart.

She remembered the day she first arrived in Moscow like it was yesterday. A bright-eyed young scientist with a passion for rocks and minerals, Édith had been awestruck by the sheer scale of the Soviet Union's industrial prowess. Her mentor, the esteemed Dr. Petrov, had taken her under his wing, guiding her through the labyrinthine corridors of academia.

Years of dedication and perseverance had paid off, earning Édith a reputation as one of Russia's leading experts in lithology. She had written papers on everything from coal deposits to rare earth minerals, and had even been approached by international companies seeking her expertise.

Yet, despite her success, Édith felt restless. The Soviet Union was crumbling around her, and she knew that her work would be seen as irrelevant in the coming years. Still, she couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to uncover, something hidden beneath the surface waiting to be discovered.

As the night wore on, Édith's thoughts turned to the mysterious Vostok Mountains, a remote range shrouded in myth and legend. Rumors whispered of ancient civilizations and lost treasures buried deep within their rugged peaks. The allure was intoxicating, and Édith knew that she would have to investigate further.

With a newfound sense of purpose, she stubbed out her cigarette and turned away from the city's twinkling lights. The Vostok Mountains beckoned, their secrets waiting to be unearthed by one brave enough to venture into the unknown. Édith Korolev smiled to herself, knowing that she was ready for whatever lay ahead.
