Édith Nurlanov stepped into the bustling café, her eyes scanning the crowded room for a familiar face. She had been searching for weeks, and finally, she had received a tip that her old friend, Lena, would be in town.

As she waited in line to order, Édith's mind wandered back to their time together in Almaty. She and Lena had met while studying abroad, bonding over their love of art and literature. They spent countless nights exploring the city, attending concerts, and debating politics.

When it was finally her turn to order, Édith asked for a strong coffee and took a seat at the small table by the window. She pulled out her phone and began scrolling through social media, searching for any sign of Lena's presence in town.

Just as she was starting to worry that she had been misled, Lena slid into the empty chair across from her. "Édith! It's so great to see you!" she exclaimed, enveloping Édith in a warm hug.

The two friends spent the next hour catching up on lost time, reminiscing about old times and sharing stories of their lives since leaving Almaty. Lena had moved back to Kazakhstan after completing her graduate studies in Europe, while Édith had stayed on in Moscow to pursue a career in journalism.

As they talked, Édith couldn't help but feel grateful for the connection she shared with Lena. Despite being thousands of miles apart, their friendship remained strong and true. She was glad that she had finally tracked her down, and she knew that this chance encounter would be a highlight of her trip.

Over coffee and dessert, the two friends continued to laugh and chat, lost in the memories of their past adventures together. As they parted ways later that evening, Édith felt rejuvenated, knowing that some friendships truly did last a lifetime.
