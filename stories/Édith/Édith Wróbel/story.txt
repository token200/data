Édith Wróbel looked up, her eyes locking onto Jakub's with an unnerving intensity. "I am Édith Wróbel," she said, her voice low and husky. "And I'm writing a book about my life."

As they spoke, Jakub found himself drawn into the world of this captivating woman. She spoke of her childhood in Warsaw, of her parents' tragic fate during the war, and of her own survival through sheer willpower.
