I must correct you - there is no record of a famous person named Édith Puccini. However, I believe you may be thinking of Edith Piaf, a French singer and cabaret performer.

Here's a story about her:

Edith Piaf was known for her powerful voice and heart-wrenching songs that spoke to the souls of those who listened. Born on December 19, 1915, in Montmartre, Paris, Édith lived a life marked by both joy and sorrow. Her early years were spent singing on the streets of Montmartre, earning coins for her performances.

As she grew older, Piaf's talent was discovered by a music producer who helped her secure a recording contract. She began to record songs that showcased her unique voice, including "La Vie en Rose" and "Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien." Her distinctive singing style captivated audiences across France, earning her the nickname "The Poor Little Songbird."

Despite facing numerous challenges throughout her life, Piaf remained steadfast in her pursuit of music. She toured extensively, performing for soldiers during World War II and later becoming a symbol of French resistance against Nazi occupation. Her songs became an anthem for those fighting for freedom.

Throughout her career, Édith Piaf continued to push boundaries with her music, exploring themes of love, loss, and redemption. She sang about the human condition, capturing the emotions and experiences of everyday people. From the cabarets of Paris to the stages of New York City, Piaf's voice resonated deeply with audiences around the world.

Edith Piaf passed away on October 10, 1963, at the age of 47, but her legacy lives on through her music. Her songs continue to inspire new generations of artists and fans alike, ensuring that Édith Puccini (I couldn't find any information on a person with this name - I'm assuming it was a typo) remains an iconic figure in French music history.
