Édith Novák stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar surroundings. A young artist, she had been traveling for days to reach this small town in the heart of Bohemia, where a mysterious benefactor promised to fund her next project.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Édith's thoughts turned to the enigmatic stranger who had first approached her with the offer. His name was Mr. Kállay, and his words had been laced with an air of mystery that left her both intrigued and wary. Still, the prospect of securing funding for her art had been too enticing to resist.

Édith's fingers itched to hold a brush in her hand, to feel the texture of canvas beneath her fingertips as she brought a new piece to life. She had always been drawn to the darker aspects of human experience – the shadows that lurked just beyond the edges of everyday reality. Her art was a reflection of this fascination, and she couldn't wait to see where Mr. Kállay's support would take her.

As she walked, the buildings seemed to grow taller and more imposing, their facades adorned with intricate carvings that seemed to whisper secrets in the flickering candlelight. Édith felt a shiver run down her spine – this was indeed a place of mystery and wonder.

Finally, she arrived at the address Mr. Kállay had given her, a grand mansion perched atop a hill like a crow's nest. The door was answered by a butler who bowed low as Édith entered, his eyes gleaming with an unspoken intensity that made her feel both welcome and uneasy.

"Good evening, Miss Novák," he said, his voice low and smooth. "Mr. Kállay awaits you in the study."

Édith's heart skipped a beat – she had been wondering what lay ahead, but nothing could have prepared her for the sense of anticipation that washed over her as she followed the butler into the unknown.
