Édith Thomas stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. As a freelance writer and book reviewer, she had grown accustomed to meeting new people, but it was always nice to run into someone who understood her passion for literature.

As she waited in line, sipping on a lukewarm coffee, Édith's thoughts wandered back to her latest assignment – a review of the newest novel from a young and up-and-coming author. She had been impressed by his lyrical prose and nuanced characterization, but was still undecided about assigning him a star rating.

When it was finally her turn to order, she spotted her friend Emily, who was sitting at a small table by the window, typing away on her laptop. The two women exchanged warm smiles as Édith approached, and they quickly fell into conversation about everything from their favorite books to their recent travels.

As they chatted, Édith mentioned her assignment and asked for Emily's opinion on the novel. Her friend listened intently, nodding along as Édith spoke. "I think it's a great debut," she said finally. "The writing is beautiful, but the plot could be stronger. I'd give it 3 out of 5 stars."

Édith nodded thoughtfully, taking mental notes as they ordered their lunch and sat down at a nearby table. As they ate and talked, Édith found herself growing more confident in her decision – she was going to have to agree with Emily's assessment.

As the afternoon wore on, Édith pulled out her laptop and began typing away on her review, drawing inspiration from their conversation. She was just about to finish when her phone rang, interrupting her flow. It was her editor, checking in on the status of her assignment. "How's it going?" he asked, his voice cheerful.

Édith smiled, feeling a sense of satisfaction wash over her. "Almost done," she replied, glancing down at her screen. "I think I'll go with 3 out of 5 stars – Emily agrees with me."

Her editor chuckled on the other end of the line. "Sounds good to me, Édith Thomas. Great job as always." Édith smiled, feeling grateful for the opportunity to share her passion with others through her writing. As she hung up the phone and returned to her laptop, she knew that this review was going to be a great one – thanks in part to her wonderful friend Emily's input.
