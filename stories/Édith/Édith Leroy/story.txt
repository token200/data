Her latest obsession was the mythical creature known only as "Le Fantôme de la Forêt" – The Phantom of the Forest. Rumors of its existence had been circulating for centuries, with whispers of a ghostly figure that stalked the shadows of the ancient woods. Édith Leroy was determined to prove its validity, and she spent countless hours pouring over dusty tomes and conducting rigorous field research.

For a moment, Édith Leroy was paralyzed with fear, but as she gazed into the Phantom's ethereal eyes, she felt a spark of recognition. She realized that this was no monster, but a guardian – a keeper of secrets and a weaver of tales. And in that instant, Édith Leroy knew that her life would never be the same again. The mysteries of Le Fantôme de la Forêt had finally been unraveled, and she had emerged as its unlikely ally.
