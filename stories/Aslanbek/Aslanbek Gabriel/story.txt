Aslanbek Gabriel was a name that commanded respect in the small village of Kyzart, nestled in the heart of the Caucasus Mountains. He was a man of great stature and wisdom, with piercing blue eyes and a wild mane of curly brown hair that framed his strong, angular face.

Aslanbek Gabriel, known affectionately to the villagers as "Khan", had spent most of his life studying the ancient traditions of his people. He was an expert in the art of herbalism, and spent hours each day tending to the gardens where he grew a vast array of medicinal plants.

One sunny afternoon, a young boy named Ahmed stumbled upon Kyzart village while on a journey with his father. The boy's leg had been injured in a fall, and Ahmed begged Kyanbek Gabriel (the son of Aslanbek Gabriel), to help him find some relief from the pain.

Kyanbek Gabriel listened intently as Ahmed described his symptoms, before ushering him into the village healer's hut. There, he began examining the boy's leg with a practiced eye, searching for any signs of infection or other complications. 

After consulting the various remedies stored in his garden, Kyanbek Gabriel chose a special blend of herbs to soothe the boy's pain. He mixed together mint leaves, chamomile flowers, and turmeric powder before kneading them into a warm paste.

He instructed Ahmed to apply the poultice topically, several times each day, as the remedy was expected to take effect only after some time passed. Once again, he expressed his concern for the young boy's safety, reminding him of the various remedies stored in his garden that could be used instead if needed.
