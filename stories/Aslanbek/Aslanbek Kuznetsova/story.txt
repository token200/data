Aslanbek would spend hours dancing through the city streets, twirling and leaping with abandon.

Aslanbek's breakthrough role came when she landed the lead in a production of Swan Lake. Her portrayal of Odette/Odile captivated audiences, who were mesmerized by her ethereal beauty and commanding stage presence.

But Aslanbek's journey was not without its challenges. She struggled with the pressures of fame, feeling like an imposter most of the time. She questioned whether she truly belonged in the world of ballet or if it was just a fleeting dream.
