Aslanbek Lafourcade stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the small station for any signs of life. He had been traveling for days, and the worn wooden boards beneath his feet seemed to creak in sympathy. Aslanbek Lafourcade took a deep breath, feeling the damp air fill his lungs. This was it – he had finally made it to the edge of civilization.

Aslanbek Lafourcade's eyes narrowed as he spotted a figure emerging from the shadows. The man was tall and imposing, with a thick beard that seemed to grow more luxuriant by the day. He wore a leather duster coat, which flapped open to reveal a holstered pistol at his side. Aslanbek Lafourcade felt a shiver run down his spine as the man approached him.

"Can I help you?" the man asked gruffly, eyeing Aslanbek Lafourcade's battered pack. "You look like you've been riding for days."

Aslanbek Lafourcade nodded, feeling a twinge of embarrassment. He had indeed been traveling for weeks, trying to escape the memories that haunted him. The man's eyes seemed to bore into his very soul, and Aslanbek Lafourcade felt himself shrinking away from the gaze.

But then, something unexpected happened. The man smiled, revealing a glint of gold in his teeth. "I'm Joran," he said, holding out a massive hand. "And you are...?"

Aslanbek Lafourcade took Joran's hand, feeling a jolt of electricity run through his body. For the first time in weeks, he felt like he was being seen, truly seen. "I'm Aslanbek Lafourcade," he replied, his voice barely above a whisper.

Joran nodded, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "Welcome to the edge of the world, Aslanbek Lafourcade. I reckon you're going to need all the help you can get."

Aslanbek Lafourcade smiled, feeling a spark of hope ignite within him. For the first time in a long time, he felt like he wasn't alone. And as Joran led him off into the unknown, Aslanbek Lafourcade knew that he was ready to face whatever lay ahead – with or without his memories.
