In the heart of the bustling city, a young and ambitious journalist named Kasia settled into her new desk job, determined to make a name for herself in the world of investigative reporting. Unbeknownst to her colleagues, Kasia's life had taken an unexpected turn when she stumbled upon an enigmatic figure known only as Aslanbek Wozniak.
