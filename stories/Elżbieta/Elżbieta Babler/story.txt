Elżbieta Babler stood at the edge of the city, her eyes scanning the horizon as if searching for something lost. Her raven-black hair was tied back in a tight bun, revealing a face that seemed chiseled from stone. Her skin was pale and smooth, a testament to her Polish heritage.

She wore a long, black coat that billowed behind her like a dark cloud, its fur-lined hood pulled up over her head. Inside, the city pulsed with life – neon lights reflected off wet pavement, the hum of traffic thrummed through the air. But Elżbieta was not a part of this world.

She was a ghost, a specter haunting the streets she had once called home. A Polish aristocrat, forced to flee her family's estate after a tragic accident took the life of her younger brother. The memories still lingered in her mind like a festering wound.

As she walked, Elżbieta felt the weight of her secrets bearing down on her. She was haunted by the guilt of surviving while others did not. Her eyes seemed to hold a deep sadness, a sense of loss that could never be reclaimed.

Despite this, Elżbieta moved with a quiet purpose, as if driven by an unseen force. Her gaze fixed on some distant point, she navigated the city's labyrinthine streets with ease. She knew every alleyway and courtyard, every hidden corner where the shadows were darkest.

Eventually, she arrived at a small café on the outskirts of town, its windows steamed up from the morning brews within. Elżbieta pushed open the door, slipping inside as if by invitation. The proprietor, an old man with wispy white hair, looked up in recognition.

"Elżbieta," he said softly, his eyes crinkling at the corners.

She slid into a booth, her coat rustling against the vinyl. "Kowalski."

The old man poured her a cup of dark coffee without asking, as if they shared some private understanding. Elżbieta sipped the bitter liquid, feeling it seep through her like a lifeline.

For a moment, she was home – or at least, that part of herself she had left behind.
