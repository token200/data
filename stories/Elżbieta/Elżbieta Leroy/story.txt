Elżbieta Leroy stepped out of her small flat in Paris and onto the winding streets of Montmartre. The city was alive with artists, musicians, and poets, all converging on this historic neighborhood to express themselves. As a photographer, Elżbieta felt right at home among these creatives.

She made her way through the crowded alleys, her camera slung over her shoulder, as she searched for inspiration. Her latest project, documenting the lives of marginalized women in Paris, had been ongoing for months. She wanted to capture their stories, their struggles, and their triumphs on film.

As she turned a corner, Elżbieta spotted a young woman with striking features hawking flowers on the street. The girl's bright smile and infectious laughter drew Elżbieta in, and she began to take shots of her from different angles. The girl didn't seem to mind; instead, she posed and even offered Elżbieta a few bouquets.

Over the next hour, Elżbieta returned to the same spot several times, each time capturing a new aspect of the young woman's personality. She noticed how the girl handled rejection with kindness and resilience, how she expertly juggled multiple conversations simultaneously, and how her eyes sparkled when talking about her dreams.

Eventually, Elżbieta decided that this chance encounter had been enough material for one day. As she packed up her camera, the young woman approached her with a shy smile.

"Merci, mademoiselle," the girl said, her voice barely above a whisper. "You have captured me so beautifully."

Elżbieta smiled and introduced herself as Elżbieta Leroy. The girl told her that her name was Anaïs, and she was selling flowers on the street to support her family.

As they chatted, Elżbieta realized that this encounter had given her more than just great photography material – it had connected them both on a human level. Over the next few weeks, Elżbieta returned to Montmartre regularly, always looking for Anaïs and other women like her.
