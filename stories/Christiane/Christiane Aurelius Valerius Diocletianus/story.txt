Christiane Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus, known to his friends as Christiane, was a brilliant and cunning senator from ancient Rome. Her reputation for ruthlessness in politics was whispered about in hushed tones among the city's elite.

One day, while attending a lavish party hosted by one of Rome's wealthiest merchants, Christiane overheard a conversation between two influential senators that revealed a shocking secret: their patron, Emperor Septimius Severus, had grown tired of his wife, Anna Lucilla, and planned to marry her own daughter, Julia Domna, in an attempt to solidify his power.

Determined to protect the interests of Rome's prominent families, Christiane decided to play on the emperor's vanity. She crafted a convincing proposal for a grand procession through the city, showcasing Anna Lucilla's supposed virtues as a future empress.

The plan was to manipulate the emperor into accepting her own proposal: a public declaration that Julia Domna had been chosen as his new bride. Christiane knew that this would not only cement her position among Rome's powerful families but also bolster her father's legacy, Emperor Caracalla's, influence.

That evening, Christiane presented her plan to Emperor Severus and his advisors. She charmed them with her wit and poise, leaving no doubt about the superiority of Julia Domna over Anna Lucilla.

The procession took place a week later, as the city's residents cheered for what they thought was Julia Domna's coronation. Christiane watched from behind a mask of respectability, smiling to herself as she orchestrated her victory.

Anna Lucilla's position at court became increasingly untenable, and soon Severus began an affair with one of his soldiers' wives – another strategic move by Christiane. Meanwhile, Julia Domna waited anxiously in the wings, unsure of what the future held.

With each step, Christiane carefully calculated her next move, ever mindful of Rome's complex web of alliances and rivalries. This was politics as she knew it: where appearances were everything and the only constant was deception.

As the years went by, Christiane continued to dance around the imperial court, always staying one step ahead of her adversaries. Her influence grew quietly but irreversibly, fueled by her own genius for manipulation.

Rumors spread about Christiane's involvement with Emperor Elagabalus, who eventually succeeded his father in the throne – a testament to her skill as a player of the game. Yet few ever saw beyond the facade to grasp the complexity beneath, and Christiane remained the mastermind behind Rome's machinations, always poised on the edge of change.

And so she vanished into history, an elusive shadow whose name whispered through ancient corridors for generations to come – Christiane Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus.
