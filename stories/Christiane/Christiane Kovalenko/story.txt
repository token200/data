Christiane Kovalenko stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It had been years since she'd returned to her hometown of Krasnoyarsk, and yet the familiar sights still felt like a distant memory.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Christiane couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her. She'd grown up in this small Russian town, exploring the woods and rivers that surrounded it with her friends and family. But life had taken her far from here - to Moscow, then Paris, and finally, back to Krasnoyarsk.

Christiane's thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door of the small apartment she'd rented for the summer. She opened it to find her friend, Sergei, grinning at her from the threshold.

"Welcome home, Christiane Kovalenko!" he exclaimed, using her full name with his usual affection.

Christiane rolled her eyes good-naturedly. "Sergei, stop calling me that," she said, laughing. "It's like you're trying to make me feel old."

Sergei chuckled and stepped inside, shaking the snow from his coat. "Sorry, sorry," he said, taking a seat on the couch. "I just can't help it. You're still my favorite Kovalenko in the world."

Christiane smiled, feeling a warmth spread through her chest. It had been good to come home, if only for a little while. She'd been running from some things - people, places, memories - but being back in Krasnoyarsk made her feel like she could finally catch her breath.

As the days passed, Christiane found herself getting caught up in Sergei's schemes and adventures, exploring the old town and reacquainting herself with its rhythms. And though she still had a long way to go - the ghosts of her past would not be so easily exorcised - for now, it was enough to simply be back in Krasnoyarsk, surrounded by friends and familiar sights.

As the sun set over the frozen river, Christiane leaned back on the couch, feeling the weight of her years lifting ever so slightly. She closed her eyes, letting the quiet of the station wash over her once more. Home was a fragile thing, but sometimes it felt just right.
