Christiane Ruiz Garcia was no stranger to hard work and dedication. As a young girl growing up in the small town of Santa Fe, New Mexico, she had always been fascinated by the world of art. She spent hours sketching and painting, using her imagination to bring vibrant colors to life on canvas.

As Christiane Ruiz Garcia entered adulthood, her passion for art only grew stronger. She went on to study fine art at a local college, where she honed her skills and developed her unique style.
