Christiane Jasinski walked into the small caf√©, scanning the room for her friend, Maria. She spotted Maria sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee and typing away on her laptop. Christiane made her way over, sliding into the seat across from her.

"Hey, how's it going?" Maria asked, not looking up from her screen.

"Not bad," Christiane replied, ordering a cappuccino from the barista. "Just got back from a long weekend in Berlin. I needed a break."

Maria looked up, raising an eyebrow. "Ah, you're finally taking some time for yourself? You've been working non-stop for months."

Christiane shrugged. "I know, I know. But it's just so hard to find the time sometimes. I feel like there's always something that needs doing, someone who needs talking to."

Maria nodded sympathetically. "You need to prioritize your own needs, Christiane. You can't pour from an empty cup, after all."

Christiane took a sip of her coffee, feeling a sense of calm wash over her. She had been thinking about this a lot lately, trying to find a better balance in her life.

As they chatted, Christiane couldn't help but think about how much she loved spending time with Maria. They had met in college, bonding over their shared love of literature and music. Since then, they had been inseparable, supporting each other through thick and thin.

"I'm so glad we're friends, Maria," Christiane said, smiling at her friend.

Maria smiled back, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "I feel the same way, Chrissie. We've been through so much together."

Christiane chuckled at the nickname. Only Maria had ever called her that. It was a term of endearment, one that made her feel seen and loved.

As they finished their coffee and prepared to part ways, Christiane felt grateful for her friendship with Maria. She knew she could always count on her friend to be there, no matter what. And with that knowledge, Christiane felt a sense of peace wash over her, knowing that she was exactly where she was meant to be.
