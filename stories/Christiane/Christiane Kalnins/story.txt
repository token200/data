Christiane Kalnins had always been fascinated by the world of architecture. As a child, she would spend hours building intricate structures with her wooden blocks, dreaming up grand designs for cities and buildings that seemed to touch the sky.

As she grew older, Christiane's passion for architecture only deepened, leading her to pursue a degree in the field from one of Germany's top universities.
