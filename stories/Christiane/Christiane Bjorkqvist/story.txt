Christiane Bj√∂rkqvist stepped into the dimly lit room, her eyes scanning the space as she made her way through the crowd. As a renowned detective, she had seen her fair share of cases, but this one had all the makings of a classic whodunit.

The victim was wealthy businessman, Marcus Larson, found dead in his office with no signs of forced entry or struggle. The only clue was a cryptic note left on his desk, reading: "You'll never find me."

Christiane's mind began to whirl as she processed the information. She had worked with Marcus before, and while they hadn't always seen eye-to-eye, he wasn't someone you'd want to kill. She needed to think like a killer, to anticipate their next move.

As she delved deeper into the case, Christiane discovered that Marcus had been involved in some shady dealings, but nothing that would have led to his untimely demise. Or so it seemed.

She interviewed the staff, searching for any inconsistencies in their alibis or motives. But everyone seemed genuinely shaken by the event. Christiane's gut told her there was more to this story than met the eye.

As she pored over the evidence, a name kept popping into her head - Marcus' business partner, Sofia Rodriguez. They had been at odds for months, their partnership on the verge of collapse. Could Sofia have finally snapped?

Christiane decided to pay Sofia a visit. When she arrived, Sofia seemed nervous but cooperative. Christiane sensed an underlying tension, a thread that could be pulled to unravel the entire case.

"Tell me again, Sofia," Christiane said, her eyes locked onto hers. "What was your relationship with Marcus like?"

Sofia's eyes darted around the room before settling back on Christiane. "We were business partners, but we didn't always see eye-to-eye. We had our disagreements."

Christiane nodded thoughtfully. She had a feeling that Sofia wasn't telling her the whole truth.

"Let me make one thing clear," Christiane said, her voice firm. "I'll find out what happened to Marcus Larson, even if it means going through you."
