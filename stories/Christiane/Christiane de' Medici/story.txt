She navigated the complex web of alliances and rivalries with ease, often serving as a mediator between warring factions.

In 1590, Christiana married Alessandro de' Medici, the ruler of Florence at the time. The union was seen as a strategic move to strengthen the House of Medici's grip on power. However, it also brought with it a great deal of tension and jealousy, particularly from Alessandro's brother, Francesco.

Despite these challenges, Christiana proved to be a loyal and devoted wife. She worked tirelessly to support her husband's policies, often serving as his advisor in matters of state. Her counsel was sought by foreign leaders, who valued her insight into the complexities of Italian politics.
