Christiane Põld was known for her sharp wit and piercing gaze, a true asset to any social gathering. As a freelance journalist, she had an uncanny ability to sniff out a good story, no matter how obscure.

Born in Tallinn, Estonia, Christine grew up surrounded by the Baltic Sea's majestic views and whispered tales of Soviet espionage. Her father, a retired KGB agent, would regale her with stories of espionage rings and secret meetings under the cover of night. It was only natural that she'd become fascinated with the world of journalism.

After completing her degree in political science, Christine began her career at a local Estonian newspaper, where she honed her writing skills and built a reputation for being fearless and incisive. Her breaking point came when she landed an exclusive interview with a high-ranking government official who spoke out against corruption within the regime.

The backlash was swift – her editor received threatening phone calls, and Christine's career was left in limbo. Undeterred, she took to the streets, documenting social injustices and rallying support for reform. Her courage didn't go unnoticed; soon, she found herself representing Estonia at international press conferences and human rights gatherings.

As word of her tenacity spread, Christine attracted the attention of a prominent investigative news organization, offering her a coveted spot as a correspondent. Over the next few years, she traveled extensively, delving into cases involving cybercrime, economic espionage, and corruption in governments worldwide.

Despite her many successes, Christine's reputation came with its own set of risks – sources would sometimes 'disappear' or reveal themselves to be impostors. She developed an instinct for reading between the lines and a habit of being prepared for anything.

Tonight was no exception; she sipped whiskey at a small café in Berlin as she pored over her notes for a piece on Russian hacking rings targeting European banks. The room was thick with cigarette smoke, but Christine felt alive – like the city itself hummed with secrets waiting to be unraveled.
