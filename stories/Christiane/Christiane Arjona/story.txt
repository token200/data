She spent countless hours researching, interviewing sources, and gathering evidence, refusing to back down even in the face of threats and intimidation. Her colleagues often marveled at her tenacity, describing her as fearless and unwavering.

One particular story had Christiane's sights set on a powerful government official, accused of embezzlement and cronyism.
