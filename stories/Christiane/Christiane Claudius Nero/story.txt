Christiane Claudius Nero sat alone in her dimly lit study, surrounded by shelves of dusty tomes and flickering candles. She was a woman of mystery, with piercing green eyes that seemed to see right through you. Her raven-black hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall of night, framing her pale skin and pointed chin.

As a former spy and assassin, Christiane had lived a life of shadows and deception. She had been trained from a young age in the art of stealth and manipulation, and had honed her skills on the streets of Berlin. But after a botched mission went wrong, she had found herself forced to flee for her life.

Now, at the ripe age of 30, Christiane had retreated to this isolated estate on the outskirts of the city. She lived alone, surrounded by the trappings of a quiet, unassuming life. Or so it seemed.

As she sat in her study, sipping a cup of black tea and watching the flames dance across the room, Christiane's mind began to wander. She thought back on her past, on the lives she had lived and the secrets she had kept. She thought of the people she had loved and lost, the battles she had fought and won.

Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. Christiane's heart quickened as she set down her cup and rose from her chair. Who could it be? She hadn't had visitors in weeks.

She approached the door slowly, peering through the peephole to reveal a young woman standing on the other side. The girl was pale-skinned and blonde-haired, with piercing blue eyes that seemed to hold a spark of desperation.

"Can I help you?" Christiane asked gruffly, trying to keep her voice steady.

The girl hesitated, glancing around nervously before speaking in a barely audible whisper. "I'm looking for...information," she said. "About my sister."

Christiane's eyes narrowed, her grip on the door handle tightening. She knew that sound â€“ it was the same one she had heard from so many others over the years.

"Come in," she said finally, stepping aside to let the girl pass.
