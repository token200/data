As the years went by, Christiane became an iconic figure in German rock history. She continued to tour and release music with Die Toten Hosen, adapting to changes in the industry while remaining true to their artistic vision. In 2003, she took a hiatus from the band but returned in 2012, solidifying her place as one of the most respected frontwomen in German rock.
