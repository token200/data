Christiane Rothbauer stepped into the grand ballroom, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of her sister. It had been months since their mother's passing, and the family was still reeling from the loss. Christiane, being the eldest, felt it was her duty to take care of her younger sibling.

As she made her way through the crowded room, a figure caught her attention. Her sister, Emma Rothbauer, stood by the refreshments, sipping a glass of wine and chatting with their cousins. Christiane's heart swelled with love as she watched Emma laugh and smile, her carefree spirit a stark contrast to Christiane's more reserved nature.

Christiane made her way over to Emma, enveloping her in a warm hug. "Hey, sis," she whispered, her voice trembling slightly. "I'm so glad you're here."

Emma looked up at her, her eyes shining with tears. "Me too, Chrissie. I miss Mom so much."

Christiane nodded, taking a seat beside Emma on the couch. They sat in comfortable silence for a moment, watching as the other guests began to make their way onto the dance floor.

As the music started, Christiane's cousin grabbed her hand and pulled her onto the dance floor. Christiane felt a pang of anxiety, but Emma came to her side, twirling around with her cousins.

For the first time all night, Christiane felt a sense of joy wash over her. She watched as Emma laughed and spun, feeling grateful for this chance to see her sister happy again. As the music slowed, Christiane stood up, pulling Emma into a tight hug.

"I'm so glad we're in this together, Em," she whispered, her voice barely audible over the music.

Emma smiled up at her, her eyes shining with love. "Me too, Chrissie. Me too."

As the night wore on and the music continued to play, Christiane felt a sense of peace settle over her. She knew that no matter what lay ahead, she would always be there for Emma, just as their mother had been for them both. And with that thought, she smiled, feeling a sense of hope and renewal wash over her.
