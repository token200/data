Christiane Ozola stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small town of Ravenswood. It was a place she had only ever passed through on her way to somewhere else, but something about it drew her in. Maybe it was the quaint Main Street, lined with shops and eateries that seemed frozen in time. Or perhaps it was the sense of isolation that surrounded the town like a shroud.

Christiane Ozola had always been a wanderer at heart, never staying in one place for too long. But after a string of dead-end jobs and failed relationships, she found herself back in Ravenswood, searching for answers. She had inherited a small cabin on the outskirts of town from a great aunt she had never met, and something about it felt like home.

As she made her way through the streets, Christiane Ozola noticed the curious glances she received from the locals. They seemed wary of her, as if they knew some secret that she didn't. She tried to brush it off, attributing their behavior to small-town suspicion. But deep down, she wondered if there was truth to it.

That evening, Christiane Ozola sat by a crackling fire in her cabin, watching the stars twinkle overhead. It was a moment of perfect peace, and for the first time in months, she felt like herself again. She pulled out a book and began to read, the words blurring together as her mind wandered.

As the night wore on, Christiane Ozola heard a knock at the door. She rose to answer it, expecting perhaps some curious neighbor or lost traveler. But instead, she found a young woman with piercing green eyes and a mop of curly brown hair. "I'm Sophia," the girl said, her voice husky and confident. "I've been looking for you." Christiane Ozola raised an eyebrow, intrigued. What did this stranger want from her? And why did she feel like she was being pulled into something much bigger than herself?
