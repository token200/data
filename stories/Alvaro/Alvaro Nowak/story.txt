One day, Alvaro Nowak received a cryptic message from an anonymous source, hinting at a decades-old mystery that had gone cold. The note read: "Look again at the old clock tower." Intrigued, Alvaro Nowak decided to take on the case.

He began by visiting the abandoned clock tower, now a relic of the city's industrial past. As he climbed the creaky stairs, he noticed something peculiar - a small, hidden compartment in the wall. Inside, he found an old journal belonging to a young girl who had gone missing decades ago.
