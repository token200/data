With a deep breath, Alvaro Gauthier shouldered his backpack and set off into the dense underbrush, his machete at the ready. The air was thick with humidity and the sounds of the jungle surrounded him â€“ the chirping of birds, the rustling of leaves, and the distant roar of a waterfall.

As he pushed deeper into the jungle, Alvaro Gauthier stumbled upon a narrow path that wound its way up a steep hill.
