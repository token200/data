His days were spent wandering the vast expanses of the unforgiving wilderness, searching for answers to questions he dare not ask aloud.

As he traversed the arid landscape, Alvaro Jhih-hao's thoughts turned to his troubled past. His memories were fragmented and fleeting, like wisps of smoke carried away by the wind.
