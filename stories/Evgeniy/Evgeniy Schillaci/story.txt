Evgeniy Schillaci stepped out of his small apartment, taking in the crisp morning air of New York City. As an immigrant from Russia, he had built a new life for himself in this concrete jungle. He worked as a freelance journalist, using his sharp wit and keen observations to craft articles that shed light on the city's hidden corners.

Despite his success, Evgeniy couldn't shake the feeling of disconnection that had settled over him since leaving his homeland. His family had stayed behind, their lives frozen in time while he embarked on this new journey. He felt like a ghost haunting the streets he now called home.

As he made his way to the local caf√©, Evgeniy noticed a peculiar flyer tacked to the bulletin board. It was an advertisement for a photography exhibit at an underground gallery, featuring work by a mysterious photographer known only as "The Watchman." Intrigued, Evgeniy tore off a tab from the bottom of the flyer with the address and tucked it into his pocket.

That evening, he arrived at the gallery, the dim lighting casting long shadows across the room. The walls were adorned with haunting images of city streets at night: alleys lined with flickering streetlights, crowded sidewalks filled with people rushing to nowhere, and abandoned buildings looming like sentinels over the urban landscape.

As Evgeniy wandered through the exhibit, he noticed a figure lingering near the back of the room. Their eyes locked for a moment before the stranger swiftly looked away. Evgeniy felt an inexplicable jolt, as if The Watchman was trying to communicate with him without words.

Suddenly, the lights flickered and died, plunging the gallery into darkness. In the sudden silence, Evgeniy heard the sound of footsteps echoing through the space. He followed the noise until he came upon a figure dressed in black, hunched over a camera like a sculptor admiring his work.

The Watchman's eyes met Evgeniy's once more, this time with a hint of recognition. The figure offered him a small notebook filled with photographs and a single sentence scrawled on the first page: "You're not alone in this city."
