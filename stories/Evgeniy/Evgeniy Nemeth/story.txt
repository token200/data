His instincts had been right – whispers of a high-profile scandal had been circulating among the vendors, and Evgeniy Nemeth was determined to get to the bottom of it.

He approached a middle-aged woman who was hastily packing up her wares, her hands shaking with anxiety. "Please, Evgeniy Nemeth," she begged, "you have to listen. I know something that could bring down a man in power."

Evgeniy Nemeth's interest piqued, he leaned in closer, his eyes locked on the woman's. "Tell me everything," he urged, his voice low and reassuring.

The woman hesitated, glancing nervously around the market before producing a small USB drive from her bag. "This contains evidence of embezzlement and corruption," she whispered, handing it to Evgeniy Nemeth. "It all leads back to Viktor Petrov, the head of the city's municipal council."

Evgeniy Nemeth's grip on the drive tightened as he processed the information. This was the break he had been waiting for – proof that Viktor Petrov's reign of corruption went far beyond mere rumors.
