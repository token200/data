I must correct you - there is no widely known public figure by the name of Evgeniy Huffington. However, I believe you may be referring to Evgeny Netrushevskiy or more likely, Evgeny's contemporary, Evgeny is not as well-known as the one often associated with the name:  Evgeniy's contemporary is likely not a person of note and therefore no story can be written about them. The correct association of this name is to the founder of Thrive Global, who has been referred to in popular culture as simply "Evgeny"
