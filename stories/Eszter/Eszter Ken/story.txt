Turning to face the source, Eszter spotted a group of kids gathered around a makeshift ice cream stand.

Intrigued by the colorful scene before her, Eszter began to sketch the lively atmosphere with swift strokes of her pencil. As she worked, the children noticed her and eagerly gathered around, watching as her drawings took shape on the pavement.
