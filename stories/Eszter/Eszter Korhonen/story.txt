Eszter Korhonen was a master of her craft, a virtuoso violinist who had spent years honing her skills to create breathtaking music that captivated audiences worldwide. Born and raised in Helsinki, Finland, Eszter's love affair with the violin began at a young age, when she first laid eyes on the instrument in her father's music room.

As she grew older, Eszter's passion for music only intensified, and she devoted herself to studying the works of the great masters.

One evening, as she was preparing for a performance at the Helsinki Philharmonic, Eszter received an unexpected phone call from her estranged mother, Maria Korhonen. It had been years since they'd last spoken, but Maria's words were like a balm to Eszter's soul – she told of a long-forgotten family tradition that involved playing the violin in traditional Finnish folk music.
