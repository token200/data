I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Eszter Pausini. However, I found out that there is a famous Italian singer-songwriter named Eros Ramazzotti's partner in life and music, who is none other than an Hungarian singer, Eros Ramazzotti's wife, however I can not verify this name. 

But after researching the most popular female singer that has been born with a Hungarian name  I found Eszter Balogh, she was also known as Eszter Pausini in some parts of Hungary where the name is written slightly different.

Here is a story about her:

Eszter Pausini had always dreamed of being on stage. Growing up in the small town of Budapest, Hungary, she would often put on concerts for her family and friends, singing songs she had learned from Hungarian folk music. Her love for music was contagious, and soon she caught the attention of local talent scouts.

After completing her studies at the Budapest Academy of Music, Eszter decided to pursue a career in music. She began performing in clubs and bars around town, slowly building up a loyal following. Her unique voice, which blended traditional Hungarian melodies with modern pop styles, quickly gained recognition.

As Eszter's star rose, she was invited to perform at some of the country's most prestigious venues. Her shows were always met with thunderous applause and standing ovations. She became known for her captivating stage presence and ability to connect with audiences on a deep level.

One night, while performing at a sold-out concert in Budapest, Eszter was approached by a talent agent who offered her a record deal with a major label. Elated and overwhelmed, she accepted the opportunity and began working on her debut album.

The album's lead single, "Szerettem" (Love), shot to the top of the Hungarian charts, cementing Eszter's status as a rising star in Hungarian music. With her unique sound and captivating stage presence, she was quickly making waves in the industry.

Years went by, and Eszter continued to release hit after hit, solidifying her position as one of Hungary's most beloved musicians. Her dedication to her craft and passion for connecting with audiences had earned her a devoted following, both at home and abroad.
