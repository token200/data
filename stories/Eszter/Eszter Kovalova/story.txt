Eszter Kovalova stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. She had been traveling for hours, and the sight of familiar buildings was a welcome relief. As she made her way through the crowds, Eszter's thoughts turned to the reason she had come back to Budapest - her estranged mother.

Their relationship had always been complicated, and Eszter had grown up feeling like an outsider in her own family. But after years of distance and missed opportunities, she had finally tracked down her mother's whereabouts. Now, as she stood on the platform, Eszter felt a mix of emotions swirling inside her - anxiety, hope, and maybe even a little bit of anger.

As she made her way through the station, Eszter spotted a familiar face amidst the crowd. It was János, an old family friend who had always been there for her when things got tough. He approached her with a warm smile, his eyes crinkling at the corners.

"Eszter! It's so good to see you," he said, embracing her in a tight hug.

Eszter felt a lump form in her throat as she hugged him back. "János, I'm so glad you're here."

The two of them walked through the station together, János asking Eszter about her journey and listening intently to her responses. As they walked, Eszter began to feel a sense of calm wash over her. Maybe this was exactly what she needed - a chance to reconnect with her mother, and with herself.

After a few minutes of walking, János led Eszter to the door of his apartment building. "My mother will be waiting for you inside," he said, his voice softening slightly.

Eszter took a deep breath and nodded. She had come too far to turn back now. With János by her side, she pushed open the door and stepped into the unknown.
