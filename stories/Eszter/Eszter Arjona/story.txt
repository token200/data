Eszter Arjona stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of familiar faces. She had received an invitation from her former colleague, László Szabó, and she couldn't help but wonder what brought him to Budapest after all these years.

As she waited in line to order, Eszter's mind wandered back to their time at the University of Economics. They had spent countless hours pouring over financial reports and analyzing market trends together, forging an unspoken bond that went beyond mere professional acquaintanceship.

When it was finally her turn to order, Eszter asked for a strong coffee and sat down by the window, gazing out onto the rain-soaked streets of Pest. A few minutes later, László appeared beside her, his eyes twinkling with warmth as he took a seat across from her.

"Eszter! It's been far too long!" he exclaimed, enveloping her in a warm hug.

As they chatted and laughed, Eszter couldn't help but notice the subtle changes that had taken place in László over the years. His hair was grayer, his eyes less bright, but his spirit remained as vibrant as ever.

Their conversation flowed effortlessly, covering everything from their time at university to their separate careers and personal lives. Eszter listened intently as László shared stories of his adventures in international business, and she found herself drawn back into the world they had created together.

As the hours passed, the café began to fill with more patrons, but Eszter barely noticed. She was too engrossed in her conversation with László, watching as he effortlessly segued from one topic to another like a seasoned debater.

Eventually, as the rain showed no signs of letting up outside, László reached for his coat and stood up, gesturing for Eszter to follow him. Together, they stepped out into the downpour, laughing and splashing through the puddles in a moment of pure joy.

As they walked along the riverbank, the lights of Budapest twinkling like stars above them, Eszter felt a sense of belonging she hadn't experienced in years. It was as if no time had passed at all, and yet, everything had changed.

In that moment, surrounded by the city's pulsating energy and László's infectious laughter, Eszter knew that some friendships were truly timeless, waiting to be rekindled whenever life brought their paths together again.
