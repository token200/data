Despite the attention, Eszter remained true to herself and her art. She continued to work tirelessly, experimenting with new mediums and techniques. Her studio became a haven for like-minded artists, who would gather there to share ideas and offer feedback.

One day, Eszter received an invitation from the Hungarian government to create a mural in the city's central square. This was her chance to give back to her community, to leave a lasting legacy that would be felt for generations to come. Eszter González threw herself into the project, pouring all of her energy and creativity into the piece.
