Eszter Olsson stepped out of the rain and into the cozy pub, shaking the water from her hair. As she made her way to the bar, her eyes scanned the room, searching for a familiar face. That's when she spotted him - János, her old friend and confidant.

"Eszter!" he exclaimed, opening his arms wide. "It's been ages!"

Eszter smiled, feeling a warmth spread through her chest. She dropped onto a stool beside him, running a hand through her damp hair. "János, you look like you've aged five years since I last saw you."

János chuckled, ordering them each a beer. As they sipped their drinks, Eszter couldn't help but think of all the memories she and János had made together - late-night conversations about literature, impromptu road trips to the coast, and lazy summer afternoons spent lounging in the park.

As the night wore on, a group of rowdy locals stumbled into the pub, causing Eszter to feel like she was being transported back to her university days. János seemed to sense her unease, placing a reassuring hand on her arm.

"You're safe with me, Ez," he said softly. "I've got your back."

Eszter's eyes met his, and for a moment, they just looked at each other, the world outside melting away. It was as if no time had passed at all - they were still those carefree, invincible students, chasing dreams and laughter.

As the night drew to a close, János walked Eszter out into the rain-soaked streets, the cool droplets on her skin feeling like a refreshing wash over her soul. "We should do this more often," he said, smiling up at her.

Eszter smiled back, feeling grateful for the friendship that had stood the test of time. "I'd like that," she replied, and together they disappeared into the night, ready to face whatever life had in store for them.
