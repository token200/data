Eszter Novak stepped out of her small apartment and onto the bustling streets of Budapest. As a renowned pastry chef, she was no stranger to the early morning rush. The scent of freshly baked croissants wafted through the air, enticing passersby to stop and sample her creations.

With her wild curls tied back in a ponytail and a smudge of flour on her cheek, Eszter Novak made her way to the city's premier bakery supply store.

They were to tie the knot in just a few weeks' time, and she couldn't wait to share her culinary talents with their friends and family. Her heart swelled with excitement as she imagined the look on László's face when he took his first bite of her signature tart.

The store owner, a stout woman named Szilvia, greeted Eszter Novak warmly and asked about her latest creations. Eszter Novak launched into an enthusiastic description of her new rose-petal macarons, using hand gestures to convey the complexity of flavors she had achieved.

Szilvia nodded approvingly, jotting down notes on a pad. "You truly are a master of your craft, Eszter Novak," she said with a smile. "Your wedding cake is going to be the talk of the town."

Eszter Novak blushed at the praise, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over her. She was determined to make this the most memorable wedding of their friends' lives. As she left the store, Eszter Novak felt invigorated, ready to tackle whatever challenges lay ahead in the lead-up to her special day.

With her arms laden with bags of flour and sugar, Eszter Novak made her way back home, eager to start baking the wedding cake that would seal László's heart forever.
