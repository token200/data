Eszter Yang stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any signs of her connection. As a freelance journalist, she had been tracking a lead on a local environmental scandal for weeks, and finally, she had received a tip that the source would meet with her here.

Eszter made her way through the crowds, her worn leather bag slung over her shoulder, and spotted a figure in the distance who looked like the person she was expecting. It was an older man, dressed in a crumpled suit and clutching a battered briefcase, but Eszter could see the desperation in his eyes that told her this was the real deal.

"Ah, Ms. Yang," he said, rushing towards her with an outstretched hand. "I'm so glad you're here. My name is Dr. László Kovács, and I have information about the pollution in the Danube River."

Eszter took a seat on a nearby bench, and Dr. Kovács began to explain his findings - that a large corporation was secretly dumping toxic waste into the river, putting thousands of people's lives at risk. As Eszter listened, her mind racing with the implications, she knew that this story could be big.

As they spoke, Eszter pulled out her notebook and pen, jotting down notes and asking follow-up questions. Dr. Kovács seemed hesitant to share more, but eventually, he agreed to meet with her again at his office, where he could provide more evidence.

Over the next few hours, Eszter listened intently as Dr. Kovács outlined his case against the corporation, using documents and photographs to illustrate his points. As the meeting drew to a close, Eszter felt a sense of determination wash over her - she was going to get this story out, no matter what.

As she left the office building, Eszter couldn't help but feel a sense of pride in her work. She had spent years honing her skills as a journalist, and stories like this were why she did what she did. And now, with Dr. Kovács' evidence in hand, she was ready to take on the corporation and bring their scandalous actions to light.

The wheels were already turning in Eszter Yang's mind - how would she get the story out? Who would she talk to? And most importantly, what would be the consequences for those responsible? As she disappeared into the crowd, Eszter knew that this was just the beginning of a long and difficult journey, but one that she was ready to undertake.
