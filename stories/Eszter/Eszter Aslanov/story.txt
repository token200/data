Eszter Aslanov stepped out of her worn leather jacket and onto the sun-baked pavement, the bright lights of the city blurring before her eyes. She had been running for what felt like hours, but she knew it was only a fraction of that. The pain in her side throbbed with every step, a constant reminder of the price she had paid to escape.

As a former KGB operative turned freelance journalist, Eszter had seen her fair share of danger and deception. But nothing could have prepared her for the day she stumbled upon a dark conspiracy involving rogue agents within the government. Now, she was on the run, with no one to trust but herself.

The small café on the corner beckoned her in, its faded sign reading 'Kozya Kávéház' creaking gently in the breeze. Eszter slid onto a stool at the bar, ordering a strong black coffee as she scanned the room for any signs of surveillance. It was a habit honed from years of undercover work.

A soft-spoken waitress with kind eyes approached her table, placing a cup of steaming coffee in front of her. 'You look like you've lost your last marble,' she said, eyeing Eszter's bruised cheekbone.

Eszter forced a smile. 'Just a long night.'

The waitress nodded sympathetically, pouring her own coffee as they struck up a conversation. Eszter spun a carefully crafted story about being an artist, while the waitress listened intently with a mixture of curiosity and wariness.

Over the next hour, Eszter and the waitress chatted through the morning crowd, exchanging small talk about everything from art galleries to their shared love of Soviet-era literature. It was as if time had been suspended for both of them, until a group of rough-looking men stumbled into the café, eyes scanning the room with an air of hostility.

The waitress shot Eszter a warning glance before quickly excusing herself and disappearing behind the counter. As the patrons scattered, Eszter sipped her coffee, watching the scene unfold with growing unease. She knew she couldn't stay here forever – but for now, this quiet oasis in the heart of the city was all she had.

With a sense of resolve settling over her, Eszter downed the last drop of her coffee and slipped out into the bustling streets, leaving behind a fragile sense of safety and the tantalizing possibility that maybe, just maybe, she wasn't alone after all.
