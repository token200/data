As a child, Inese would spend hours exploring the forests and fields around her village, collecting leaves and stones for her makeshift collage art. Her parents, both artists themselves, encouraged her creative pursuits, teaching her the fundamentals of drawing and painting. However, it wasn't until she stumbled upon the works of Frida Kahlo that Inese's true passion was ignited.

The resulting album was a masterpiece – a testament to the power of art to transcend borders and languages.
