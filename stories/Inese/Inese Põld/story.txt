Inese Põld was a quiet and introspective young woman who lived in rural Estonia. She spent most of her days tending to her family's small farm, where she grew a variety of fruits and vegetables. Despite the hard work, Inese found solace in nature and often spent hours wandering through the forests and meadows surrounding her home.

Inese Põld was known among the villagers for her exceptional skill in herbalism. She would spend hours gathering wildflowers and herbs to create potions and remedies that would cure ailments from feverish colds to skin irritations. Her grandmother, a wise woman named Kaja, had taught Inese everything she knew about the healing properties of plants.

One day, a young traveler passed through the village seeking shelter for the night. He was wounded and in great pain, and Inese Põld immediately took him under her wing. She tended to his wounds with her herbal remedies and fed him a warm meal made from the fruits of her farm. As he recovered, they talked long into the night about everything from the mysteries of the forest to their dreams for the future.

As Inese listened to the traveler's stories, she felt a sense of restlessness growing within her. She had always been content with her simple life on the farm, but hearing about the world beyond their village made her wonder what lay beyond the horizon. The traveler, noticing her fascination, shared with her his plans to travel to the great cities of Europe and study the ancient arts of medicine.

Inese Põld felt a spark of excitement ignite within her. She had never thought of leaving her family's farm, but hearing the traveler's words made her realize that there was more to life than she had ever imagined. As the young man prepared to leave, Inese Põld walked with him to the edge of the forest and watched as he disappeared into the distance. Though she remained on her farm, Inese knew that a part of her would always be drawn to the wider world beyond their village.
