Intrigued by its potential, she asked for permission to test it in her small town's park. Wladyslaw Nieminen agreed, but only after insisting on observing from a distance, his eyes twinkling with curiosity.

As Wladyslaw Nieminen's reputation grew, so did his sense of unease. He became increasingly reclusive, shutting himself away in his workshop as if protecting a treasured secret.
