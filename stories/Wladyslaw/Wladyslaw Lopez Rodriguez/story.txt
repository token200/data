Born in Poland, Wladyslaw grew up surrounded by stories of his ancestors' bravery and ingenuity. He was especially fascinated by the history of his native country, which had been shaped by centuries of invasion and occupation. As he delved deeper into his studies, Wladyslaw became determined to uncover the truth about the long-lost city of Zerzura, said to hold the secrets of the ancient Poles.
