Alejandro Kovalenko, codename "Nightshade", was a former CIA operative turned rogue agent. His latest mission had gone terribly wrong, and now he found himself on the run from his former employers.

It started with a simple extraction job in Eastern Europe, where Kovalenko was supposed to retrieve a valuable piece of intel from a high-ranking government official. But something didn't feel right. The official seemed nervous and jumpy, and Kovalenko's instincts told him that he was being set up.

As he delved deeper into the official's office, Kovalenko discovered a shocking truth: the official had been working with his own agency to steal the intel for nefarious purposes. Panicked, Kovalenko knew he had to get out of there before things escalated further.

But it was too late. The official's men ambushed him, and Kovalenko barely managed to escape with his life. Or so he thought.

In reality, Kovalenko's extraction device - a custom-made gadget that allowed him to hack into secure systems - had been compromised by the agency. His movements were now being tracked, and it was only a matter of time before they caught up to him.

As he fled across Europe, Kovalenko knew he couldn't trust anyone anymore. The agency's agents were closing in on him from all sides, determined to capture or kill him. He had lost count of the number of safe houses he'd used, each one now suspect and vulnerable to surveillance.

With his skills as a skilled hacker diminished by the compromised device, Kovalenko knew he needed a new plan - fast. That's when he remembered an old acquaintance, a Russian defector who had promised to help him in case of a tight spot.

He made contact with the defector, a resourceful woman named Natalia, who agreed to meet him at an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of Berlin. Kovalenko arrived under the cover of darkness, his gun drawn and ready for anything.

But as he entered the warehouse, he realized that Natalia was hiding something from him. A new adversary had joined the mix: a ruthless mercenary named Victor, who would stop at nothing to claim Kovalenko's valuable intel for himself.

With alliances tested and allegiances strained, Kovalenko steeled himself for the fight of his life. Nightshade was no more; Alejandro Kovalenko was back on the streets, gun in hand, ready to take on whatever the world threw his way.
