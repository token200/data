Alejandro Harris sat in his worn armchair, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and faded photographs. The dim light of the setting sun cast long shadows across the small room, illuminating the tired lines etched on his face. As a retired detective, Alejandro had seen his fair share of darkness and despair.

The phone rang, breaking the silence that had engulfed the space for hours. Alejandro sighed, knowing who it would be – Detective Rodriguez, with another case to pawn off on him. He picked up the receiver, his voice rough from disuse.

"Rodriguez," he said, a hint of wariness creeping into his tone.

"Alejandro, we need you," the other man's voice crackled over the line. "We've got a body. No ID yet."

Alejandro rubbed his temples, feeling the familiar ache that always seemed to accompany these kinds of calls. He'd been out of the game for years, but old habits died hard.

"I'm coming," he said finally, getting up from his chair and making his way to the small office in the back where his few belongings were scattered. A battered leather jacket hung on a hook, a relic from a bygone era when he was part of an elite unit that had kept this city safe.

As Alejandro arrived at the crime scene, his trained eyes scanned the area, taking in every detail – the torn fabric caught on a nearby bush, the faint scent of something chemical lingering in the air. It was all too familiar, like he'd walked into a trap set by an old adversary.

Rodriguez met him outside, his face etched with concern. "Alejandro, we're telling you this is connected to that other case – the one from five years ago."

Alejandro's gut tightened, memories flooding back like a dark tide. He took a deep breath and nodded for Rodriguez to lead him inside.

The room was small and cramped, with walls adorned by faded murals of the city's history. Alejandro wandered over to the body, taking in every detail – the clothes, the jewelry, even the peculiar silver ring on the hand that seemed out of place.

He spotted something – a small piece of paper tucked into the deceased's shirt pocket – and pulled it out. A faint message scrawled across it made his blood run cold: "You're next."

Alejandro felt like he was staring into the abyss again, memories from a long-forgotten past clawing at him with talons sharp enough to shred any hope of closure.

"I'm back," he said finally, voice barely above a whisper.
