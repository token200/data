Alejandro Cannavaro was a man with a mysterious past. He had grown up on the streets of Buenos Aires, surviving by his wits and his fists. As a young boy, he had been a member of a notorious gang that controlled much of the city's underworld.

But Alejandro had always had a sense of restlessness within him, a feeling that there was more to life than just fighting and scheming. One day, while serving time in prison for a minor crime, he met a group of social workers who came to his cell with a proposal: they would pay him to work as a bodyguard for a wealthy businessman traveling through the Argentine countryside.

At first, Alejandro was skeptical - what could this rich guy possibly need protection from? But something about the offer resonated with him. Maybe it was the promise of a steady paycheck and the chance to leave his old life behind. Or maybe it was the thrill of being on the outside of society for just one moment, watching as the world moved smoothly by while he was caught in its gears.

Whatever the reason, Alejandro took the job. He arrived at the businessman's estate in rural Argentina with a sense of pride and purpose that he had never felt before. The man was named Eduardo, a kind-eyed old man who seemed genuinely delighted to have Alejandro on board as his bodyguard.

Over the next few days, Alejandro found himself enjoying the quiet rhythms of country life. He would spend hours sitting on the porch, watching the sun set over the rolling hills as Eduardo told him stories about his travels and the people he had met along the way.

But even as he settled into this new role, Alejandro couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. There were whispers in the village about Eduardo's business dealings - some said he was involved in shady activities, others claimed he was being watched by rival gang members.

As the days passed, Alejandro grew more vigilant, scanning the horizon for any sign of danger. And then, one night, he saw it: a group of rough-looking men lurking just beyond the estate's gates, their eyes fixed on Eduardo with an unmistakable air of hostility.

Alejandro knew exactly what to do. He stood up, his fists clenched and his eyes blazing with anger, as he prepared to defend his employer against whatever danger was coming their way.
