Alejandro Szabó was no stranger to the streets of Buenos Aires. As a child, he had grown up navigating the narrow alleys and bustling markets with his abuela, who had taught him everything from cooking traditional asado to playing the tango on her worn accordion.

Years later, Alejandro Szabó stood outside the small café where he worked as a barista, watching the sun set over the rooftops. He had always been drawn to the art of coffee-making, and his abuela's old recipes still held a special place in his heart.

As he poured steaming cups for the evening crowd, Alejandro Szabó couldn't help but feel a sense of contentment wash over him. He loved watching the regulars gather at the café, swapping stories and laughter as they sipped their coffee and shared plates of empanadas.

But despite the comforts of his routine, Alejandro Szabó felt an itch he couldn't scratch. As a child, he had always dreamed of leaving Buenos Aires behind, to see the world beyond the city's borders. Now, as a young man, he felt that sense of restlessness growing stronger by the day.

Just then, a familiar face appeared in the doorway - his best friend, Julián. The two had grown up together, exploring the city and getting into mischief as kids. As they hugged each other tightly, Alejandro Szabó knew that he wasn't alone in his feelings.

"I've got an idea," Julián said, grinning mischievously. "Let's take a trip to Spain, just the two of us. We can spend our days wandering through markets and our nights drinking sangria."

Alejandro Szabó's heart skipped a beat as he considered the possibility. It was exactly what he needed - a chance to break free from his routine and explore the world beyond Buenos Aires.

"Let's do it," he said, a smile spreading across his face. "But just for a little while. I promise."

As they clinked cups together in celebration, Alejandro Szabó knew that this trip was going to be one for the books - and that his life would never be the same again.
