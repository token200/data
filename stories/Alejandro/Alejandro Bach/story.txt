One day, Alejandro Bach received a call from the chief of police, requesting his assistance in solving a string of high-profile robberies that had been taking place across the city. The thief seemed to be always one step ahead, leaving behind no clues or evidence whatsoever.

Alejandro Bach accepted the challenge and began by reviewing the security footage from each location. As he poured over the tapes, he noticed a peculiar detail - all the victims had one thing in common: they were all art collectors with extensive knowledge of rare paintings.

With this new information, Alejandro Bach set out to interview the art collectors, hoping to find some connection between them and the thief.

The game was afoot! Alejandro Bach tracked down the suspect's IP address and discovered that it belonged to an anonymous online forum. As he scrolled through the conversations, he stumbled upon a cryptic message from the thief claiming responsibility for the robberies.

Intrigued, Alejandro Bach decided to attend the next art auction in town, hoping to catch a glimpse of the thief in action. To his surprise, the culprit turned out to be none other than a renowned art critic who had been vocal about their disdain for certain modern art movements.

With the culprit revealed, Alejandro Bach couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction at having solved another case.
