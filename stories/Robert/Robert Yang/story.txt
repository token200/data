Robert Yang had always been fascinated by the world of spirits. As a young man, he spent countless hours pouring over dusty tomes in the local library, learning about the ancient art of Chinese mysticism. He became particularly enamored with the concept of jiangshi, or reanimated corpses, which were said to roam the countryside in search of flesh to devour.

As a renowned expert on the subject, Robert had spent years studying the legends and folklore surrounding these undead creatures. But despite his extensive knowledge, he couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to the story than met the eye.

One fateful evening, as Robert sat hunched over his desk, pouring over a particularly rare text, he stumbled upon an obscure reference to a jiangshi with a remarkable twist: it was said to be created by a vengeful sorceress who had been wronged in life. According to legend, the sorceress's spirit would remain tied to her former victim for eternity, forcing them to relive their final moments over and over until she finally found peace.

Robert's curiosity was piqued. He spent the next several weeks tracking down leads on the sorceress, following a trail of cryptic clues and whispered rumors that led him deep into the heart of rural China.

Finally, after months of searching, Robert arrived at a small village where he heard whispers of a legendary jiangshi - one said to be bound to a local farmer's wife. As he approached the farmhouse, he could feel an eerie energy emanating from within.

Steeling himself for what lay ahead, Robert entered the house and approached the farmer's wife, who sat motionless in her bed, surrounded by candles and incense sticks. The air was heavy with the scent of rot and decay, and Robert knew that he had finally found what he was looking for.

As he watched, transfixed, the farmer's wife began to stir, her eyes snapping open to reveal a pair of cold, dead stare. And in that moment, Robert knew that he had uncovered something truly remarkable - proof that even in death, some spirits could never rest.
