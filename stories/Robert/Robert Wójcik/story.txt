Robert Wójcik was a man with a mysterious past. Few people knew much about him, except that he had a knack for solving puzzles and uncovering hidden secrets. He lived in a small, cluttered apartment in Warsaw's Old Town, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and scraps of paper covered in cryptic notes.

One day, a wealthy client named Helena approached Robert with an offer she couldn't refuse: find her missing necklace, passed down from her great-grandmother, which was last seen during a family gathering the previous summer. The catch? The necklace had been lost in the chaos of a crowded bar and the only clue was a torn piece of fabric caught on a chair.

Robert accepted the challenge without hesitation, and set out to investigate. He spent hours pouring over old police reports and interviewing witnesses, searching for any shred of information that might lead him to the missing treasure. As he worked, his eyes scanned the streets, taking in every detail: the worn stone walls, the vendors hawking their wares, the sound of laughter and music drifting from the bars.

As the sun began to set on another fruitless day, Robert sat at his desk, staring at a photo of Helena's great-grandmother. Something about the woman's smile seemed familiar, yet he couldn't quite place it. He decided to take a walk along the Vistula River, hoping the fresh air would clear his mind.

As he strolled, Robert noticed a small inscription etched into the stone wall: "Achterkamer". He pulled out his notebook and jotted down the word, wondering if it might be connected to the missing necklace. Suddenly, the connection clicked into place – the After-Kamer of the old Royal Palace was rumored to have a secret room hidden behind a bookshelf.

The next morning, Robert set out for the palace, determined to find that room and uncover the truth about Helena's necklace. With a spring in his step, he navigated the winding corridors until he finally found himself standing before an unassuming door. He pushed it open, revealing a narrow space lined with old books and artifacts.

There, nestled between two ancient tomes, lay the necklace – gleaming golden and sparkling in the dim light. Robert smiled, feeling a sense of satisfaction wash over him. But as he reached for the necklace, he heard a faint noise coming from behind him...
