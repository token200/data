Robert Kovacs sat in his small apartment, staring at the stack of unpaid bills on his coffee table. As an ex-cop turned private investigator, he had seen it all - the good, the bad, and the ugly. But this latest case was starting to get under his skin.

He took a deep breath, pushing aside the familiar feeling of frustration that always seemed to follow him around. He was Robert Kovacs, after all - one of the best detectives in the business. And he wasn't about to let a few setbacks bring him down.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was his best friend and partner-in-crime-solving, Sarah Jenkins. She slipped inside, eyes scanning the room until they landed on the bills. "Well, well, well," she said with a smirk. "Looks like someone's got some financial woes."

Robert groaned good-naturedly. "Hey, it's not my fault I haven't gotten paid in weeks. The agency is still waiting for their check from last quarter."

Sarah plopped down beside him on the couch. "You know, RV," she said with a grin - he was her go-to nickname for Robert Kovacs. "You're starting to look like a character from one of those old film noir movies. 'The gumshoe with no dough' or something like that."

Robert chuckled, despite himself. It wasn't the first time Sarah had called him by that nickname, but it always made him laugh. They sat there in comfortable silence for a moment, watching as the sun set outside.

Then Sarah spoke up again. "Hey RV? I think we've got a new case coming our way. Someone needs help finding their missing sister."

Robert's eyes snapped back into focus. He grabbed his phone and dialed the number of their client - the one whose name he couldn't quite remember offhand, but it was important to get the details right. "Okay, what do we know?" he asked Sarah as she waited patiently on the other end.

And just like that, Robert Kovacs' worries about unpaid bills were forgotten. He had a new case to crack, and his detective instincts were already sharpening up for battle. Bring it on, he thought with a grin - I'm ready for you.
