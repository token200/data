Robert Arias stepped into the dimly lit room, his eyes scanning the space for any sign of movement. As a former hitman, he had spent years honing his skills in the shadows, always staying one step ahead of those who sought to bring him down. Now, at the ripe age of 50, Robert Arias had retired from the business and was trying to leave his past behind.

But it wasn't easy.

As he made his way to the bar, a figure emerged from the corner, their eyes locking in a silent understanding. "Robert Arias," the man said, his voice low and gravelly. "It's been a long time."

Robert Arias smiled wryly, knowing exactly who this was - Victor LaGraine, an old acquaintance with a reputation for ruthlessness. The two men had crossed paths countless times over the years, always maintaining a delicate balance of power.

"What brings you here tonight?" Robert Arias asked, taking a seat at the bar.

Victor LaGraine slid onto the stool beside him, his eyes never leaving Robert Arias' face. "I heard you'd been looking for work," he said, a hint of amusement dancing on his lips. "I thought I'd offer my services."

Robert Arias raised an eyebrow, knowing that Victor LaGraine was not one to be trifled with. He had a reputation for being merciless, and Robert Arias had always avoided him like the plague.

"I think we're done here," Robert Arias said firmly, signaling the bartender for a drink.

Victor LaGraine's smile grew wider, his eyes glinting in the dim light. "We'll see about that," he whispered, his voice dripping with menace.

As Robert Arias watched him leave, he couldn't shake the feeling that Victor LaGraine was just getting started. He had always known that his past would eventually catch up with him, but he had hoped to escape the darkness forever.

Now, it seemed, the shadows were closing in once more.

With a sense of foreboding, Robert Arias tossed back his drink and stood, ready to face whatever lay ahead. He was 50 years old, and his past was finally catching up with him. But Robert Arias was not one to be intimidated - he had spent decades honing his skills in the shadows, and he would stop at nothing to protect himself.

As he walked out into the night air, the city seemed to stretch out before him like a battlefield. He knew that he would have to fight to survive, but Robert Arias was ready for whatever came next.
