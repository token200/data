Robert Balodis sat alone at his kitchen table, staring blankly at the stack of bills in front of him. The fluorescent light overhead cast an unforgiving glare on the pale complexion of his face. His wife, Emma, had left him six months ago, taking their young daughter with her.

As he sorted through the bills, one caught his eye – a notice from the electric company, warning that if he didn't pay up within 14 days, they would shut off the power to their small cabin in the woods. Robert sighed and rubbed his temples. This was just another reminder of how far he'd fallen.

He had always been driven, always striving for more. After Emma left, he found himself lost and adrift. The isolation of the cabin seemed like a cruel joke at first, but as the days turned into weeks, it started to feel like a refuge from the world outside. He spent his days puttering around with woodworking projects, trying to create something beautiful in the solitude.

But even that was starting to lose its appeal. The silence had become oppressive, and Robert found himself craving the gentle hum of conversation that he used to take for granted. He longed to talk to someone about his feelings, but no one seemed willing to listen. His attempts at social media posts were met with indifference, and even phone calls felt forced and awkward.

As the clock ticked closer to midnight, Robert rose from his chair, walked over to the window, and stared out into the darkness. The forest stretched before him like an endless sea of shadows. He could almost hear Emma's voice whispering in the wind – "get out while you still can."

The thought sent a shiver down his spine. Robert had always known that he was running on borrowed time. His dreams, once so vivid and full of promise, now seemed like distant memories. But tonight, as the night wrapped itself around him like a shroud, something inside him stirred.

He took a deep breath and walked over to his woodworking bench, his hands moving with a newfound sense of purpose. The tools lay scattered before him – hammers, saws, chisels. Robert began to work, his movements swift and decisive.

The wood creaked and groaned beneath his tools as he carved out a small wooden bird, its wings spread wide like a message of hope. Tears pricked at the corners of his eyes as he finished the last detail – Emma had always loved birds. He held up the finished piece, admiring it with newfound pride.

For the first time in months, Robert felt a spark of defiance ignite within him. Maybe this was what he needed to do next: start anew, forge a life from the ashes of his old one.
