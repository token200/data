Robert Ming, aka Zhang Ming, was a renowned archaeologist with an insatiable passion for uncovering the secrets of China's ancient past. Born and raised in Beijing, Robert grew up surrounded by the rich history and culture of his homeland. His parents, both historians themselves, instilled in him a love for learning that would shape his future career.

As a young man, Robert pursued higher education at Beijing University, where he earned a degree in archaeology. After completing his studies, he worked tirelessly to build his reputation as a leading expert in the field. His extensive travels took him from the Great Wall of China to the ancient Silk Road cities of Xi'an and Luoyang.

One day, while excavating a recently discovered site in the countryside, Robert stumbled upon an impressive stone statue of a mythical creature. As he carefully cleaned the artifact, he realized that it was unlike anything he had ever seen before. The statue depicted a hybrid creature with the body of a dragon and the head of a lion, which Robert later identified as a unique representation of the ancient Chinese concept of the "Qilin."
