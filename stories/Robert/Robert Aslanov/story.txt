But Robert Aslanov was not just a figurehead; he was a skilled strategist and tactician, always thinking several steps ahead of his enemies. He had spent years building a network of allies and sympathizers, gathering intelligence and resources that would ultimately prove decisive in the final battle for Azalia's freedom.

One night, under the light of a full moon, Robert Aslanov led his troops on a daring raid against a government stronghold.
