Robert Koval, Chief of Police for the city of New Haven, stood outside the police station, gazing out at the rain-soaked streets. It was a typical Monday morning, with the usual suspects gathered on the steps, sipping coffee and exchanging hushed whispers.

As he watched, a sleek black sedan pulled up to the curb, and Robert Koval's gaze narrowed as he recognized the vehicle of his nemesis, corrupt businessman Harrison Grant. The two had been at odds for months, with Robert Koval determined to bring Grant to justice for his role in the city's recent embezzlement scandal.

Grant stepped out of the car, a smug smile spreading across his face as he spotted Robert Koval watching him from afar. "Ah, Chief," he called out, striding towards the police station. "I see you're still stuck in the past. I have news that might interest you."

Robert Koval's eyes flashed with anger as Grant approached him, but he kept his cool, his expression a mask of polite curiosity. "What is it, Mr. Grant?" he asked, his voice even.

Grant chuckled, pulling out a folder from behind his back. "It seems I have evidence that will clear me of all charges," he said, holding up the folder. "A certain witness has come forward, willing to testify on my behalf."

Robert Koval's eyes narrowed further, his mind racing with possibilities. This was a classic tactic - try to turn an innocent bystander against the investigator. He knew Grant was not above using underhanded tactics to get out of trouble.

"I'll take that folder," Robert Koval said finally, taking it from Grant's hand. "And I'll have my team review its contents immediately." As he turned away from Grant, a plan began to form in his mind - one that would put him and his team on the case once again, determined to bring justice to New Haven's corrupt elite.

With a sense of purpose growing within him, Robert Koval turned back to face Grant, a steely glint in his eye. "You may think you've won this round, Mr. Grant," he said, his voice cold and deadly, "but I assure you, we're just getting started."
