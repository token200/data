I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Pēteris Szymański. It is possible that this character does not exist or is not well-known.

However, I can suggest some alternative characters and storylines that might interest you. Please let me know if you have any specific preferences (e.g. fantasy, sci-fi, historical) or if you'd like me to generate a new character concept.

If you're interested in learning more about fictional characters from different cultures or backgrounds, I'd be happy to provide some examples of Eastern European characters that might be similar to the one you described. For instance:

* Pēteris Szymański is not an existing character, but if we were to create a character with this name, it could have Polish origins.
* Some notable fictional characters from Poland or with Polish heritage include Krzysztof Karski (from the novel "Schindler's List"), Marek Edelman (the commander of the Jewish Ghetto in Warsaw during WWII), and Łukasz Nowicki (a Polish author known for his fantasy novels).
