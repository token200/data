I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Yon Kortajarena. It is possible that this character does not exist in popular culture. 

However, I can create a story around a fictional character with the given name and surname. Here's a 400-word story:

In the mystical realm of Aethoria, where the sun dipped into the horizon and painted the sky with hues of crimson and gold, Yon Kortajarena walked among the whispers of the forest. She was a skilled huntress, known for her unwavering dedication to justice and her unrelenting pursuit of truth.

With her raven hair tied in a ponytail and her piercing emerald eyes scanning the terrain, Yon traversed the dense underbrush with ease, her feet moving as silently as a ghost. Her trusty companion, a majestic stallion named Zephyr, followed closely behind, his mane rustling softly in the breeze.

Yon's quest had begun in the small village of Brindlemark, where rumors had spread like wildfire about a notorious poacher terrorizing the local wildlife. As Yon Kortajarena, she was determined to track down the perpetrator and bring them to justice.

After days of tracking, Yon finally received a tip that led her to an abandoned cave on the outskirts of the forest. Her heart racing with anticipation, she dismounted Zephyr and approached the entrance, her hand resting on the hilt of her dagger.

As she stepped inside, the air grew thick with the scent of decay, and Yon Kortajarena felt a shiver run down her spine. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows - a tall, imposing man with eyes that seemed to burn with an inner fire.

"You're the one they call Yon Kortajarena," he sneered, his voice dripping with malice. "I've heard of your skills, huntress. But can you handle the truth?"

Yon's grip on her dagger tightened, and she took a step forward, her eyes locked onto the poacher's. "I'll never back down," she declared, her voice firm and resolute.

The poacher smiled, but Yon Kortajarena could see the faintest glimmer of fear lurking behind his eyes. It was then that she knew she had him right where she wanted him - at the edge of justice, with no escape in sight.
