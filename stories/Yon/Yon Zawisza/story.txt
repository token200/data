Yon Zawisza sat in the dimly lit tavern, nursing a mug of ale as he watched the patrons laugh and chat around him. As a mercenary, he had seen his fair share of battles and bloodshed, but there was something about this particular evening that felt off.

A hooded figure slid onto the stool beside him, their face obscured by the shadows. "Yon Zawisza," they said in a low voice. "I see you're still alive."

Yon raised an eyebrow. "And what business do you have with me?"

The figure pulled back its hood, revealing a woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. "My name is Elara," she said. "I've heard a lot about your... skills."

Yon snorted. "Skills are one thing, but I'm not sure I'd call them 'good'."

Elara smiled, her lips curling upward. "Ah, but that's where you're wrong. You have a reputation for being the most reliable man in the business. And I need your help."

Yon set his mug down, intrigued despite himself. "What kind of job?"

"A noble has gone missing," Elara said. "His son is willing to pay top coin for her safe return."

Yon raised an eyebrow. "Sounds like a job for any number of adventurers, not just me."

Elara's eyes glinted in the firelight. "That's exactly what I'm counting on. You see, Yon Zawisza, this is no ordinary noble. This is a woman with... connections. And I believe she has information that could change the course of our world forever."

Yon's curiosity was piqued. He had always been drawn to the unknown, and the prospect of uncovering secrets and shaping the fate of nations was a tantalizing one. "Tell me more," he said, setting his ale down for good.

Elara leaned in close, her voice barely above a whisper. "Meet us at the old windmill on the outskirts of town at midnight. Come alone."

With that, she turned and vanished into the night, leaving Yon to ponder the mystery of Elara's words. What secrets lay hidden behind those piercing green eyes? And what would be the cost of uncovering them?
