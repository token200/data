Yon Rousseau sat in his cluttered workshop, surrounded by scraps of fabric, half-finished dolls, and an assortment of curious contraptions. His hands moved with a practiced ease as he sewed together a small wooden puppet's limbs.

Rousseau was no ordinary craftsman. A former thief, he had turned to a life of quiet industry after being caught and forced to atone for his past misdeeds. He now made dolls that were said to possess uncanny lifelike qualities – their stitched smiles seemed to hold secrets, their glassy eyes gleamed with an unblinking intensity.

Despite the whispers about his work's mystical properties, Rousseau refused to comment on its authenticity. His focus was on creating something that brought joy to those who held it, rather than exploiting any perceived magic for personal gain.

As he worked, a soft knock at the door interrupted his concentration. He put down his needle and rose from his chair, wiping his hands on a nearby apron. His visitor was a young woman named Elara, a curious customer who had heard tales about Rousseau's enchanted dolls.

Elara entered, her eyes taking in the workshop with wide wonder. Rousseau gestured for her to sit by the small window, where she watched as he carefully assembled the puppet's face.

"So, you're the one they call the Dollmaker," Elara said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Rousseau smiled wryly. "Someone has to keep the rumors alive."

As he finished the doll and handed it to Elara, their fingers touched – a fleeting spark of connection that neither seemed to acknowledge. Yet in that moment, Elara felt an unsettling familiarity with Rousseau, as if she'd known him for years rather than mere minutes.

"Thank you," Elara said softly, cradling the puppet doll in her hands. "This... it's beautiful."

Rousseau returned to his chair, watching as Elara's eyes sparkled with a quiet enchantment. Perhaps, he thought, he had created something more valuable than just a simple toy.

The door creaked shut behind Elara, and Rousseau resumed his work, the silence punctuated only by the soft hum of his needle and the steady beat of his hands on the wooden puppet's limbs.
