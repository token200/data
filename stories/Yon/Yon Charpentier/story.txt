His full name, Yon Étienne Charpentier, reflected his family's French heritage and his own skill with woodworking tools. For as long as anyone could remember, Yon had been fascinated by the art of carving intricate shapes from raw wood.

When Lady Isabella returned to collect her music box, she was overjoyed by its beauty. The wood seemed to shimmer in the sunlight, and the gentle melody that played from within brought a smile to her face. Word of Yon's exceptional craftsmanship spread even further, attracting the attention of the royal court.

King Edward himself requested Yon Étienne Charpentier to create a wooden throne for his palace. The king was enamored with Yon's artistry and wanted to showcase it in the grandest possible setting. Yon worked tirelessly, pouring all his skill and creativity into crafting the majestic throne. When finished, it shone like a beacon of light, its intricate carvings telling stories of the forest and its inhabitants.
