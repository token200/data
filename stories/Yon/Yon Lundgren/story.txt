Yon Lundgren stepped out of his worn leather jacket, revealing a patchwork of scars on his arms and chest. He had earned every one of them in the countless bar brawls and street fights that had defined his youth. But as he stood tall, surveying the dimly lit dive bar, Yon felt a sense of pride wash over him. This was where he belonged – among the roughnecks and outcasts who called this place home.

Yon took a long drag on his cigarette, feeling the familiar burn in his lungs. He had always been a rebel, never content to follow the rules or conform to societal norms. His parents had disowned him when he came out as gay, but Yon had refused to be silenced. Instead, he had found solace among the LGBTQ+ community, where he had discovered his true calling – as a drag performer.

Behind the microphone, Yon transformed into 'Ruby Red', a sassy, firecracker of a queen who could charm the pants off any audience. But when the curtains closed and the spotlights dimmed, Yon was just Yon – tough, gritty, and unapologetic.

As he ordered his whiskey at the bar, Yon's eyes scanned the room, locking onto a familiar face - that of his long-time partner, Viktor. A burly, rough-around-the-edges biker with a heart of gold, Viktor had been Yon's rock through thick and thin. The two had met on the streets, bonding over their shared love of heavy metal music and rebellion against the mainstream.

The bartender slid Yon a shot glass, which he tossed back with a grin. "To Ruby Red, and to our freedom," he toasted, his eyes sparkling with mischief. Viktor raised his own glass in response, and as they clinked them together, Yon knew that no matter what life threw their way, he and Viktor would face it – side by side.

As the night wore on and the music pulsed through the speakers, Yon lost himself in the performance, channeling Ruby Red's raw energy into every note. And when the show finally ended and the crowd dispersed, Yon took one last look at his partner before storming offstage.

Viktor was waiting for him outside, a smile creasing his rugged features as he wrapped an arm around Yon's waist. "You kill it tonight, Ruby," Viktor whispered, nuzzling Yon's ear. Yon chuckled, feeling the warmth of his love – and their freedom – envelop him whole.
