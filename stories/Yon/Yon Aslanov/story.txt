Yon Aslanov stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the sleepy station for any sign of life. She had been traveling for hours, and the monotony of the journey had taken its toll on her patience. As Yon Aslanov, she was no stranger to solitude, but that didn't mean she had to enjoy it.

As she collected her luggage from the baggage cart, a gruff voice called out from behind her. "Lost something, miss?" A weathered old man with a scruffy beard and a twinkle in his eye looked down at her with curiosity.

Yon Aslanov turned, her hand instinctively reaching for the small pouch at her belt. She opened it to reveal a few coins, some dried meat, and a piece of parchment bearing a crude map. The old man's eyes widened as he took in the contents. "Looks like you're a traveler, then," he said.

Yon Aslanov nodded curtly, unsure what else to say. She had no business talking to strangers, especially not ones who looked like they belonged in a museum. But there was something about this old man that put her at ease. Maybe it was the way he smiled, or maybe it was the glint in his eye.

"I'm headed for Krasnoyarsk," she said finally, tucking the map back into its fold.

The old man nodded, a small smile playing on his lips. "Ah, yes. I know that place. It's not far from here, but be warned: it's not all it's cracked up to be." He spat a wad of tobacco juice onto the platform, and Yon Aslanov raised an eyebrow.

"It's not my first stop," she said dryly, shouldering her pack.

The old man chuckled. "I bet not. You've got the look of someone who can take care of themselves, miss." He eyed her piercing blue eyes, which seemed to bore into his very soul. For a moment, Yon Aslanov felt like he could see right through her, and for a fleeting instant, she wondered if there was more to this stranger than met the eye.

But the feeling passed as quickly as it had begun, leaving Yon Aslanov with more questions than answers. She tucked away the old man's words and set off into the unknown, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
