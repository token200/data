Yon Nagy stepped off the crowded train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the bustling streets of Budapest. As he made his way through the throngs of people, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. It had been five years since the accident, and Yon still struggled to come to terms with what had happened.

He was on his way to meet an old acquaintance, a journalist named Zsolt, who had promised to meet him at a small café in the city center. As he waited for Zsolt to arrive, Yon took a seat at the bar and ordered a whiskey. The bartender, a gruff but kind-eyed man named József, nodded in recognition as he handed over the drink.

As Yon sipped his whiskey, he couldn't help but think back on the accident that had brought him to this point. He had been driving home from work when a drunk driver swerved into his lane, sending Yon's car careening off the road and into a nearby river. The impact had been devastating, leaving him with a shattered leg and a deep-seated fear of being behind the wheel again.

But as he sat in the café, watching the world go by outside through the steam-streaked windows, Yon felt a sense of peace wash over him. He was getting better, slowly but surely. The therapists had been helping him work through his PTSD, and with time and patience, Yon was learning to let go of some of that guilt and anxiety.

Just as he was starting to feel at ease, Zsolt appeared at the door, a broad smile on his face. "Yon, sorry I'm late," he said, shaking hands warmly before taking a seat across from him. "What's new?"

Yon ordered another whiskey for himself and Zsolt, and as they chatted through the afternoon, Yon couldn't help but feel grateful for this chance to reconnect with an old friend. It was just what he needed – a reminder that there was more to life than his accident, and that sometimes, the best way to move forward was to let go of the past.

As the sun began to set over the city, casting long shadows across the streets, Yon felt a sense of hope rising up within him. Maybe it wouldn't be easy, but with Zsolt's support and his own determination, he knew he could face whatever came next. And as he stood up to leave, feeling the whiskey-laced haze begin to clear from his eyes, Yon smiled to himself – for the first time in a long while, he felt like he was going to make it through the night.
