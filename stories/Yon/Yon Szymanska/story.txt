Yon Szymanska stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. She had been traveling for days, and the isolation was starting to get to her. As she gathered her belongings, a figure emerged from the shadows - an old man with piercing green eyes.

"Yon Szymanska," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "I've been expecting you."

Yon felt a shiver run down her spine as the man approached her. She had no idea who this person was or why they knew her name, but there was something about him that seemed... familiar.

The old man smiled, and Yon saw a glimmer of kindness in his eyes. "I'm Kael," he said. "And you are...?"

Yon hesitated for a moment before answering. She wasn't used to talking to strangers, especially not ones who knew her name. But there was something about Kael that put her at ease.

"I'm Yon Szymanska," she said, feeling a sense of relief wash over her. "And I'm lost."

Kael chuckled and nodded. "I think I can help you with that," he said. "You're on your way to the old town, aren't you?"

Yon's eyes widened in surprise. How did this man know? But before she could ask any questions, Kael continued.

"The road is treacherous from here. You'll need someone to guide you safely."

And with that, Kael offered Yon his arm and set off down the deserted highway. As they walked, Yon couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder at this strange encounter. Who was this man, and why did he know her name?

But as they approached the old town, Yon began to notice something peculiar. The buildings seemed to lean in, as if listening to their conversation. And Kael's eyes seemed to gleam with an otherworldly intensity.

Yon felt a shiver run down her spine once again. She was starting to realize that there was more to this encounter than met the eye...
