Yon Briedis stood atop the windswept moor, his eyes fixed on the horizon. His long, unkempt hair whipped about his face like a living thing, and his worn leather cloak flapped in the gusts of wind that threatened to sweep him off balance.

It was a bleak day, one that matched the mood within Yon's own chest. He had received word just that morning - a summons from the castle in the south, where the Lord sought the services of his most skilled warrior. But what lay at stake for Yon? The promise of gold and glory, or something more?

As he gazed out into the distance, a sense of unease began to build within him. He had walked these moors since childhood, familiar with every twisting path and hidden glade. Yet now, they seemed shrouded in an aura of foreboding.

Yon's thoughts turned back on his own past - his life as a soldier in the service of the Lord of the North. Years of fighting battles that seemed endless, of friends lost to bloodshed and cold steel. And now...and now, he was called away once more.

His eyes narrowed, focusing on the spot where the moor met the forest beyond. He could see it there - a tiny cluster of buildings, the towers of the castle reaching up towards the sky like skeletal fingers. The castle had seen many men and women come and go, each with their own story to tell.

But Yon's thoughts were far from idle. He knew that when he arrived at the castle, his own tale would be shared - of a young soldier who had once dreamed of honor, only to find it bought and paid for on the battlefield. The memory was one he'd rather not revisit, but could never shake.

With an effort, Yon turned away from the horizon and made his way back down into the darkness of the moor. He set off at a brisk pace, his long strides carrying him swiftly through the wet, peat-soaked earth. The mist swirled around his ankles, hiding him from view as he disappeared into the gloom.

For now, Yon walked alone - driven by an uncertain purpose that might or might not prove worth the effort.
