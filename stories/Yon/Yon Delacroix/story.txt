Yon Delacroix stepped into the dimly lit jazz club, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. The air was thick with the smell of cigar smoke and worn leather. He spotted her across the room, sitting alone at the bar. Yvonne LaRue, her hair a wild tangle of curls, raised an eyebrow as he approached.

"What brings you to this fine establishment, Monsieur Delacroix?" she asked, her voice husky from years of smoke and whiskey.

Yon shrugged, his shoulders barely moving beneath his worn denim jacket. "Just looking for a place to clear my head, Yvonne. The streets have been getting too loud."

She nodded sympathetically, pouring him a glass of red wine without asking. As he sipped the rich liquid, the music swelled around them – saxophones wailing like lost souls in the night.

The club's patrons were an eclectic mix: artists, writers, and musicians all gathered to indulge in the city's underbelly. Yon knew most of them, but there was something about this place that made him feel like an outsider, even among his own kind.

Yvonne seemed to sense his unease, reaching across the table to touch his arm. "You're not here for the music, are you?" she asked, her eyes probing beneath the surface.

Yon sighed, running a hand through his hair. "Just trying to get out of my head, that's all."

They talked long into the night, their words spilling onto the floor like rain. The bartender polished glasses and wiped down the bar with practiced efficiency, the only sound breaking the spell of the evening.

As the night wore on, the music grew louder, the notes blending together in a cacophony of sadness and longing. Yon felt his own heart beating time, a rhythm that synchronized with Yvonne's very own tempo.

For one fleeting moment, he felt at home – surrounded by strangers who understood him better than anyone back in his world. It was then that Yon Delacroix knew he'd found a new haven, hidden beneath the city streets and smoke-filled bars.
