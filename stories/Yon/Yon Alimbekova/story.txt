One fateful evening, Yon Alimbekova received a call from an anonymous source claiming to have information about a string of high-profile burglaries that had been plaguing the city for months. Intrigued, she arrived at the designated meeting spot, her eyes scanning the area with a mixture of caution and curiosity.

As she entered the dimly lit alleyway, Yon Alimbekova spotted a figure cloaked in shadows, their face obscured by a hoodie. With a measured tone, the stranger revealed themselves to be an ex-con with a grudge against the system. They claimed to have information about the burglaries, but only if Yon Alimbekova agreed to listen.
