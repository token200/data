Alicja Zawisza stepped into the grand ballroom, her eyes scanning the crowded room for any sign of her host. The annual masquerade ball was in full swing, and she had been looking forward to this event for weeks. As the daughter of a wealthy merchant family, Alicja knew that this was one night where social status would be put aside, and people would let their true selves shine.

Alicja's own mask, adorned with delicate silver lace, sparkled as she moved through the throng of dancers and chatters. She smiled to herself as she spotted her friend, Katarzyna, waiting for her by the refreshments table. The two girls had grown up together in this very city, exploring its winding streets and dreaming of adventures beyond their small town.

As Alicja approached, a tall figure emerged from the crowd, his eyes fixed intently on hers. It was Janek, the dashing young nobleman who had captured her heart just a few months ago. They danced together for hours, their steps weaving in and out of the music as they laughed and talked of their hopes and dreams.

But amidst all the revelry, Alicja couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. She noticed a group of men lingering on the edge of the ballroom, their faces shadowed by their hoods. They seemed out of place among the laughing guests, and Alicja's instincts told her to steer clear of them.

As the night wore on, Alicja found herself growing more and more restless. She excused herself from Janek, citing a need for fresh air, and stepped out into the cool evening breeze. The mask she wore seemed to slip slightly as she breathed in deeply, and she felt a shiver run down her spine.

It was then that Alicja Zawisza spotted something that made her blood run cold - a small piece of paper pinned to the wall outside, bearing a cryptic message that seemed to be directed specifically at her. She knew that she had to get out of there, and fast, before whatever danger lurked in the shadows caught up with her.
