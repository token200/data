Alicja Björkqvist stepped into the dimly lit café, her bright blue eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. It had been months since she'd last seen her friend, Lena, and Alicja was eager to catch up.

As she waited in line, Alicja's mind wandered back to their college days, when they'd spent countless hours studying together and exploring the city. She remembered how much fun they'd had, laughing and joking around, despite the occasional disagreements over politics and social justice.

When it was finally her turn to order, Alicja smiled at the barista, who looked vaguely familiar but she couldn't quite place them. "Just a cappuccino, please," she said, handing over her card.

As she waited for her drink, Alicja spotted Lena sitting in the corner, typing away on her laptop. She hurried over, plopping down beside her friend with a warm smile. "Lena! It's so great to see you!"

Lena looked up, startled, and then broke into a wide grin. "Alicja! I was starting to think I'd never see you again."

The two friends chatted for hours, catching up on each other's lives and sharing stories of their adventures since college. Alicja told Lena about her new job at a non-profit organization, where she was working to promote environmental sustainability in urban areas. Lena, meanwhile, regaled Alicja with tales of her latest writing projects and her plans to start her own publishing company.

As the evening wore on, they delved deeper into conversations about social justice, activism, and their hopes for the future. It was exactly what Alicja needed – a chance to connect with someone who understood her passions and values.

Eventually, as the café began to close, Alicia Björkqvist stood up, feeling invigorated and refreshed. She hugged Lena tightly, promising to stay in touch and meet up again soon. "It's been too long," she said, smiling at her friend.
