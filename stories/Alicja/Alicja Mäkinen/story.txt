Alicja Mäkinen stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the station for any sign of life. As a freelance journalist, she had grown accustomed to working alone, but sometimes it felt like an isolation that went beyond physical borders.

As she made her way through the bustling station, Alicja's thoughts turned to her latest assignment - a story on the forgotten folk of rural Finland. Her editor at the Helsinki Times had told her that this was going to be big, that this would be the break she needed to make a name for herself in the competitive world of journalism.

Alicja spotted a taxi driver eyeing her with interest and hailed him down. "To Rautjärvi," she said, pulling out her phone to confirm the address. The driver nodded, and as they pulled away from the station, Alicja began to think about what she would say when she finally sat down to write.

She had always been drawn to stories of outsiders - people who didn't fit in with the mainstream society. There was something about their resilience that resonated with her own experiences as a migrant to Finland. Alicja's parents had moved here from Poland when she was just a teenager, and she still remembered the feeling of being an outsider, of not quite belonging.

As they drove through the rolling hills and forests of rural Finland, Alicja felt a sense of wonder wash over her. This was where her story would take place - in a world that seemed frozen in time, where tradition and modernity coexisted in uneasy harmony.

The taxi finally pulled up outside a small wooden cabin, surrounded by fields and forests that stretched as far as the eye could see. Alicja paid the driver and stepped out onto the gravel driveway, feeling a sense of excitement and trepidation. This was it - her chance to tell the stories that needed to be told, to share the voices of those who had been silenced for too long.

Alicja took a deep breath, shouldering her backpack as she made her way towards the cabin. She knew that this would be just the beginning of an incredible journey, one that would take her to the heart of Finland's forgotten folk and give voice to their stories in the world beyond these woods.
