Alicja Durchdenwald was known for her unconventional approach to art. As a sculptor, she often pushed the boundaries of traditional materials and techniques, much to the surprise of her peers in the small art community of New Haven.

Inspired by their creativity, Alicja Durchdenwald decided to take on the project herself.
