Alicja Lehtonen stepped off the train and onto the platform, her bright blue eyes scanning the crowded station. She was a woman on a mission, determined to unravel the mystery that had been plaguing her for months.

As she made her way through the throngs of people, Alicja's mind whirled with theories and suspects. Her best friend, Sofia, had gone missing six weeks ago, leaving behind only a cryptic message that hinted at something sinister. The police were stumped, and Alicja was convinced that she could do better.

Alicja hailed a taxi and gave the driver an address on the outskirts of town. As they sped through the streets, her thoughts turned to Sofia's last days before she vanished. Had she been in trouble? Had someone taken her?

The taxi screeched to a halt outside a run-down apartment building. Alicja leapt out onto the pavement and paid the driver, then pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside.

She had reason to believe that Sofia's disappearance was connected to an old case from Alicja's past - one she had thought was long buried. As a journalist, Alicja had investigated a string of disappearances in this very building ten years ago. The police had never found any leads, but something about the case had stuck with her.

Alicja began to climb the stairs, her footsteps echoing off the walls. She knew every step of the way by heart, and she felt a sense of unease as she approached the third floor. This was where Sofia's apartment had been located all those years ago.

She reached the door at number 314 and pushed it open, her eyes adjusting to the dim light inside. The room was just as Alicja remembered it - dusty and neglected, with a lingering scent of decay. She scanned the space, taking in every detail.

And then she saw it - a small piece of paper on the kitchen table, with a message scrawled across it in Sofia's handwriting: "They're watching you." Alicja's heart skipped a beat as she realized that this was more than just a coincidence. This was proof that Sofia had indeed been in danger.

With a sense of purpose renewed, Alicja set to work searching for any other clues that might lead her to the truth. She knew it wouldn't be easy, but she was determined to uncover the secrets that Sofia's disappearance held.
