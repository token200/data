Alicja Kalniņa stepped into the quiet café, her eyes scanning the dimly lit space for any sign of her friend. She spotted a familiar figure huddled in the corner, nursing a cup of coffee. Alicja Kalniņa took a seat beside them, and the other woman turned to greet her.

"Lisette," Alicja said softly, using the French nickname that only a handful of people called her. "What's wrong?"

Lisette Kalniņa shook her head, running a hand through her short, dark hair. "Just been having some existential crises, that's all."

Alicja listened intently as Lisette poured out her frustrations with the world and her place in it. She understood the feeling of being adrift, of wondering what one was doing on this earth. Alicja had experienced similar doubts when she first moved to New York City from Riga.

As they sipped their coffee, Alicja shared stories of her own struggles to adapt to American culture. The differences between Eastern European and Western attitudes, the struggle to learn new languages – Lisette had been there too, but Alicja's experiences made her realize how lucky she was to have found a sense of belonging in this strange new world.

Lisette looked up at Alicja, eyes sparkling with curiosity. "What do you think is the key to happiness, Alicja?"

Alicja leaned back in her chair, considering the question. "I've learned that it's not about finding some elusive state of bliss; it's about accepting who we are and where we're from. The struggles, the doubts – they're all part of what make us human."

As they parted ways, Alicja felt a sense of resolve settle over her. She knew she would always be Alicja Kalniņa, but today she had reminded herself that it was okay to be in motion, to find her place in this vast and often confusing world.

The café's warm light faded into the background as Alicja stepped out into the cool morning air, feeling a renewed sense of purpose. She knew Lisette would too, eventually; after all, they were two strong women navigating life's ups and downs side by side.
