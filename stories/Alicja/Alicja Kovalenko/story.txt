Alicja Kovalenko had always been fascinated by the world of art history. As a young girl, she spent hours poring over books and documentaries, learning about the masters and their techniques. Her passion eventually led her to pursue a degree in fine arts, where she honed her skills and developed a unique style all her own.

After completing her studies, Alicja Kovalenko landed an internship at a prestigious gallery in Warsaw. It was there that she met the enigmatic owner, Mr. Kwiatkowski, who took her under his wing and introduced her to the world of high-stakes art collecting.
