Alicja Majewski stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It had been years since she'd last set foot in Warsaw, and yet the familiarity of this place still brought a sense of comfort.

She collected her luggage and made her way through the deserted streets, her feet carrying her on autopilot to the address etched into her passport. A small café, tucked away in a quiet alleyway, was all that remained of what once was a thriving business district.

Alicja pushed open the door, and the bell above it let out a tired clang as she stepped inside. The air was thick with dust and memories, but she had no time for nostalgia. She needed to find someone.

The café's owner, an old man named Jan, looked up from behind the counter as she entered. His eyes crinkled at the corners in recognition, and he nodded curtly. "Alicja."

She took a seat at the table by the window, her eyes scanning the crowded streets outside before returning to Jan. "Where is he?"

Jan's expression softened, just for an instant. "The usual place," he said finally, nodding toward the back of the café.

Alicja followed his gaze to a small room in the rear of the building. She stood, and with a quiet thanks to Jan, slipped into the shadows beyond the café's main door.

She pushed aside the curtain and peered inside. A lit cigarette cast flickering shadows on the walls as she recognized her target – Krzysztof, her former lover and confidant from years past. Their complicated history still lingered in her mind like an open wound.

Alicja slid into the room quietly, Krzysztof's head jerking up from his seat as he spotted her. For a moment they just looked at each other – time lost, memories unresolved. Then, with slow deliberation, Krzysztof pushed back from the table and rose to his feet.

Alicja met him halfway across the room, their bodies close but not touching. The air was charged with tension as they exchanged guarded words. Her eyes searched his face, seeking some sign of what she had come for – closure, perhaps, or forgiveness.

It didn't come.

Instead, Krzysztof reached out and took her hand in a gesture both familiar and foreign to Alicja's senses. For one moment, the world outside dissolved, leaving only this small space filled with longing and regret.
