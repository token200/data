Alicja Yan stepped out of her small apartment, gazing up at the towering skyscrapers of New Eden. As a skilled hacker and underground artist, she had grown accustomed to living on the fringes of society. Her latest piece, "Echoes in the Code," was set to debut at an exclusive gallery tonight, but Alicja couldn't shake the feeling that someone – or something – was watching her.

Alicja's fingers danced across her cyberdeck as she navigated the virtual streets, searching for any signs of surveillance. She had been receiving strange messages from an unknown sender, hinting at a hidden agenda behind her art. The messages were always cryptic, but they left Alicja with more questions than answers.

As she turned onto her street, Alicja spotted a figure lurking in the shadows. She hesitated for a moment before pulling out her phone and activating her comms device. "This is Yan to Raven," she whispered into the mic.

"Yan, it's Raven. I've been tracking your digital footprints. You're right – someone is watching you."

Alicja's eyes narrowed as she glanced around the alleyway. "Who?"

Raven's voice was laced with urgency. "I'm not sure. But I have a lead. Meet me at Club Europa tonight, after the gallery opening. We'll discuss this in person."

The line went dead, and Alicja felt a shiver run down her spine. She made her way to the gallery, her mind racing with possibilities. Who was behind these mysterious messages? And what did they want from her art?

As she arrived at Club Europa, Alicja spotted Raven waiting for her by the bar. The bartender nodded discreetly as Alicja took a seat next to her friend.

Raven handed Alicja a small data pad containing a cryptic file. "This was sent to me earlier today. It's a fragment of your latest piece – but it's been altered."

Alicja took the pad, scanning the contents. The changes were subtle, yet disturbingly significant. This was more than just an art piece; it was a message from someone who knew her secrets.

"What does it mean?" Alicja asked Raven, her voice barely above a whisper.

Raven leaned in close. "It means you're not alone, Alicja. And whoever sent this wants your attention."
