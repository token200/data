Alicja Sundlöf stepped into the grand foyer of the museum, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of life amidst the rows of dusty exhibits. As a curator and historian, she had spent countless hours studying the works of the past, but there was something about this particular exhibit that drew her in.

As she approached the display case, a sudden chill ran down her spine. The glass seemed to be reflecting an image that didn't belong to their time. Alicja Sundlöf's heart quickened as she realized that someone - or something - had tampered with the exhibit.

She called out into the empty hallway, her voice echoing off the marble walls. "Hello? Is anyone there?" The silence that followed only added to her unease.

Without hesitation, Alicja Sundlöf reached for the phone on the reception desk and dialed the museum's security number. As she waited for someone to answer, she carefully opened the display case, revealing a collection of artifacts from an ancient civilization.

Alicja Sundlöf's eyes widened as she took in the sight before her. The items seemed...different. They seemed almost...altered. A shiver ran down her spine as she realized that the artifact was not what it appeared to be.

Suddenly, the lights flickered and the air grew colder. Alicja Sundlöf spun around, but there was no one in sight. She took a step back, her heart pounding in her chest.

Just then, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was an old man with piercing eyes, his face twisted into a sly smile.

"Welcome, Alicja Sundlöf," he said, his voice dripping with malice. "I've been waiting for you."

Alicja Sundlöf tried to speak, but her voice caught in her throat. The old man reached out and placed a bony hand on the display case, and suddenly the world around her began to distort.

When the lights flickered back to life, Alicja Sundlöf was alone once more. But as she turned to leave, she noticed something that made her blood run cold: a small note attached to the display case, with a single message scrawled on it in red ink: "You should not have looked, Alicja Sundlöf."
