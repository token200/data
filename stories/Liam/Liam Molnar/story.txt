Liam Molnar stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of familiarity. As the sole survivor of a notorious assassination attempt six months prior, he had grown accustomed to being on edge. His piercing blue eyes locked onto a figure huddled in the corner, nursing a mug of ale.

Liam's gaze narrowed as he approached the stranger. He recognized the distinctive scar above their left eyebrow from his last encounter with them. The memory still lingered, fueling his determination to uncover the truth behind the attempt on his life.

"Liam Molnar," the stranger said, voice low and gravelly, without turning around. "I wasn't expecting you."

Liam's hand instinctively drifted to the knife sheathed at his waist. "You're a hard man to forget," he replied, his tone neutral.

The figure finally turned, revealing a woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. She pushed back her chair, rising from the stool as if drawn to Liam by an unseen force.

"You're quite the legend, Molnar," she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "News of your... survival spread quickly."

Liam raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. Who was this woman, and what did she want?

The lady smiled, a mischievous glint dancing in her eye. "Let's just say I have information about the people who tried to take you out. Information that could put me on your wanted list, of course."

Liam hesitated for a moment before nodding. He had no choice but to trust this enigmatic stranger. For now.

As they exchanged stories and information, Liam found himself drawn to her wit and cunning. Perhaps she was more than just a pawn in the game of cat and mouse he'd been playing for months.

The woman's name, he discovered, was Elara â€“ not an alias, but a genuine moniker. And as they parted ways, Liam couldn't help but wonder if their paths would cross again soon. The game had only just begun, after all.
