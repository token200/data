Liam Dell walked into the dimly lit coffee shop, his eyes scanning the crowded room for a familiar face. He spotted her sitting in the corner, sipping on a latte and typing away on her laptop. Emily Wilson was her best friend since college days.

As he approached the table, Emily looked up and smiled, putting down her pen. "Hey, Liam Dell! Long time no see," she said, using his full name as if to prove a point.

Liam chuckled and dropped into the chair across from her. "Just passing through town for work. How about you?"

Emily closed her laptop and took a sip of her coffee. "Same old same old. Just trying to make it through the day without too much excitement." She smirked mischievously, knowing that was not exactly true.

Liam raised an eyebrow, intrigued by her sudden change in tone. He had known Emily for years, but there were still moments when she surprised him with her wit and sass.

Their conversation flowed easily, jumping from work gossip to their favorite books and movies. Liam Dell found himself lost in the banter, feeling like he'd never been away from his friend for long enough.

As they chatted, a young woman caught Liam's eye across the room. She was sitting by herself at a small table near the window, staring intently into her coffee cup. There was something about her that seemed familiar, yet he couldn't quite place it.

"Liam Dell," Emily whispered, noticing his gaze drift away from their conversation. "You seem lost in thought."

He refocused on Emily, feeling a little embarrassed at being caught staring. "Sorry, I think I saw someone from my past over there. Just making sure it's really her."

Emily raised an eyebrow, curiosity piqued. "Who is she?"

Liam hesitated for a moment before responding, "Just an old acquaintance. Doesn't matter." He quickly added, "Let's not get bogged down in the details."

Their conversation continued, but Liam Dell couldn't shake off the feeling that he had missed something important by dismissing the stranger.
