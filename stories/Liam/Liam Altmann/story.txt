Liam Altmann stepped into the crowded café, scanning the room for his friend Emily. She was running late, as usual, and Liam was starting to get anxious. He spotted her across the room, typing away on her laptop, and made his way over.

As he approached, Emily looked up and flashed him a bright smile. "Hey, sorry I'm late!" she exclaimed, closing her laptop and leaping to her feet.

Liam chuckled and shook his head good-naturedly. "No worries, Em. I know you can't be held to a schedule." He slid into the empty chair across from her, signaling the waitress for their order.

The two friends spent the next hour catching up on each other's lives. Liam filled Emily in on his latest project at work – a new campaign for a sustainable energy company. Emily listened intently, asking thoughtful questions and offering words of encouragement.

As they chatted, Liam couldn't help but notice the way the natural light streaming through the café window highlighted the subtle lines etched into Emily's forehead. It was a small detail that he'd grown accustomed to over the years – details like this that made him love her even more.

When the waitress returned with their food, Liam and Emily dug in, savoring the flavors of their sandwiches and salads. The conversation flowed easily, touching on everything from their favorite books to their plans for the upcoming summer.

As they finished their meal, Emily reached across the table and put a hand on Liam's arm. "Hey, I have an idea," she said, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "Let's plan a road trip for this summer. Just the two of us, exploring new places and having adventures."

Liam grinned, feeling a thrill of excitement run through him. He knew that with Emily by his side, anything was possible. And as they made plans for their future escapades, he couldn't help but feel grateful to have such an amazing friend – one who brought joy and laughter into his life every day.

As the café emptied out and the sun began to set outside, Liam turned to Emily and smiled. "You know, Em," he said, "I'm really glad you're my best friend."
