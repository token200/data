Liam KalÄ“ja stepped off the small propeller plane that had brought him to the remote island of Nauru. The humid air enveloped him like a damp shroud, heavy with the scent of salt and decay. As he looked around at the rusting hulks of ships and crumbling buildings, Liam felt a sense of unease wash over him.

He had left behind his life in Sydney, where he was a successful businessman with a loving wife and two young children. But after a tragic loss, Liam found himself drawn to this forgotten corner of the world. He had inherited a small plot of land from a distant relative, and saw it as an opportunity to escape the weight of his grief.

As he made his way through the dusty streets, Liam was greeted by the island's few inhabitants - a mix of Nauruan and Fijian people who seemed just as lost as he was. They eyed him warily, but nodded in respect when he spoke to them in broken Nauruan.

Liam spent his days exploring the island, learning about its history and culture. He discovered hidden coves and secret waterfalls, and began to rebuild the crumbling buildings on his land. It was hard work, but it gave him a sense of purpose that eluded him back home.

At night, Liam would sit by the fire and watch the stars twinkling over the ocean. He felt small and insignificant in the face of such beauty, and yet, somehow, he felt more alive than he had in years.

One evening, as he was sitting on the beach, a figure emerged from the darkness. It was an old man with a kind face and piercing eyes. He spoke to Liam in Nauruan, but Liam didn't understand. The old man smiled and tried again, this time in broken English.

"I am Kepa," the old man said. "I have been watching you. You are not like other strangers."

Liam looked at him curiously, feeling a sense of connection to this stranger on the island. Kepa nodded as if reading his thoughts.

"You have come to escape, yes?" he asked.

Liam felt a lump form in his throat. "Yes," he said, barely above a whisper.

Kepa smiled again and placed a hand on Liam's shoulder.

"Then you are welcome here," he said.
