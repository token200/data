Liam Zariņa stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the sprawling metropolis. A former thief and street-smart scoundrel, he had made a name for himself on the streets of Riga before finally deciding to leave that life behind.

It hadn't been easy. Liam's past was marked by narrow escapes and close calls, not to mention a string of failed relationships with women who couldn't shake the feeling that he was trouble. But after one particularly hairy encounter with a group of goons from the local underworld, he realized that maybe it was time for a change.

He'd enrolled in culinary school, and the feeling of creating something new and delicious – rather than just swiping someone else's goods – had been a revelation. The classes were tough, but Liam was determined to master every technique, every flavor combination.

As he surveyed his domain, the rooftop garden was in full bloom. A riot of color against the gray concrete, it was a small oasis that brought him peace whenever he needed it most. He thought about all the times he'd hidden out here before – hiding from his creditors, from his own demons.

But this time, there was someone else to think of: Elza, the charming pastry chef who had caught his eye at culinary school. They'd been through a string of misadventures together, and Liam couldn't help but wonder if maybe she felt the same way about him as he did about her.

He took a deep breath and walked out onto the garden path, the scent of blooming herbs enveloping him like a warm hug. Elza was already there, sipping from a cup that looked almost too beautiful to hold in your hands. Liam's heart skipped a beat as she turned and smiled at him.

"Hey," she said, eyes sparkling with amusement.

Liam grinned back, feeling like he'd finally found his place in the world. "Hey."

For a moment, they just stood there, looking out over the city, their feet a little farther apart than necessary but not quite far enough to keep secrets between them. Liam felt Elza's hand brush against his arm – and then, before either of them could do anything about it, she'd leaned in and kissed him, softly as the morning dew on the garden flowers.

He knew that this was just the beginning – that there were still plenty of rooftops to climb and meals to cook, secrets to keep. But for now, with Elza by his side, he felt like he could conquer anything.
