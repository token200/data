Liam Horváth stepped out of his small café, inhaling the damp morning air as he gazed up at the grey sky. He was a man with secrets, and the city seemed to be watching him, its fog-shrouded streets wrapping around him like a damp cloak.

As a former private investigator, Liam had left that life behind, unable to shake the memories of the cases he'd solved – and the ones that had haunted him. But it was on this particular morning, as he sipped his coffee at his café's small counter, that a familiar face caught his eye.

Sarah Jenkins, an old acquaintance from his PI days, strode in, her long blonde hair pulled back into a tight ponytail. She scanned the room, locking eyes with Liam before making her way to the counter.

"Liam," she said softly, sitting down beside him. "It's been years."

He raised an eyebrow, unsure if he was comfortable with this sudden reunion. "Sarah. What brings you here?"

She ordered a coffee and pulled out a small notebook from her bag. "I have information about a case that went cold back in '07. The Blackwood family disappearance."

Liam's eyes narrowed, his mind racing back to the files he'd once stored away. "That one still haunts me," he admitted.

Sarah hesitated before producing a single photograph – an old police ID of Liam himself, taken on the night of the disappearance.

"Liam," she said firmly, "I think you're being watched."

Liam's eyes flicked around the café, taking in the familiar patrons. He was certain no one noticed their conversation, but something about Sarah's tone told him otherwise.

He rose from his seat, notebook at the ready. This case had finally pushed its way back into his life – and he was determined to uncover the truth.

As they left the café together, Liam felt a sense of purpose wash over him once more. The shadows seemed less heavy now, the fog lifted just enough for him to take his first steps towards justice.

Their unlikely partnership forged in this moment would see them confront secrets from the past and unravel mysteries that had long remained shrouded – with only one truth for certain: Liam Horváth was back on the case.
