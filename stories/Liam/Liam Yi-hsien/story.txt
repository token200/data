Liam Yi-hsien was a master thief known for his unparalleled skills in the art of deception. Born in the streets of Hong Kong, he had grown up surrounded by the city's underbelly, learning to rely on his wit and cunning to survive.

As a child, Liam had been fascinated by the stories of his ancestors, who were said to have possessed magical abilities that allowed them to manipulate time itself. His parents, both respected members of their community, had dismissed such tales as mere myth, but Liam's imagination ran wild with the possibilities.

Years later, when Liam Yi-hsien was in his mid-twenties, he set out on a life of thievery, using his inherited charm and charisma to swindle wealthy businesspeople out of their fortunes. He became notorious for his ability to disappear into thin air, leaving behind only a whispered rumor of his presence.

One day, while working on a particularly high-stakes job, Liam Yi-hsien found himself face-to-face with the enigmatic leader of an underground organization that had been tracking him for months. The leader, a cold and calculating woman named Mei, revealed to Liam that she had discovered the truth about his family's supposed magical abilities.

Intrigued, Liam Yi-hsien agreed to meet with Mei once more, hoping to uncover the secrets behind her claims. As they sat in a smoke-filled room deep within the organization's headquarters, Mei revealed an ancient artifact that seemed to hold the key to unlocking Liam's true potential.

Overwhelmed by the revelation, Liam Yi-hsien found himself questioning everything he thought he knew about his life and his family's legacy. For the first time in his life, he felt a sense of uncertainty, as if his carefully constructed world was beginning to crumble beneath him.
