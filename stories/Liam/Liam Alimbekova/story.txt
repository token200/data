Liam Alimbekova was a woman with a passion for art and music. Growing up in a small town, she had always been fascinated by the world beyond her rural home. She spent most of her free time reading books and watching movies, dreaming of one day making it big as an artist.

After high school, Liam decided to pursue a degree in fine arts from a prestigious university in the city.
