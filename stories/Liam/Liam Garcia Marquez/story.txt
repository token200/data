Born in the vibrant streets of Medellín, Colombia, he grew up surrounded by the rhythms of salsa music and the colors of la vida loca.

His art was a reflection of his soul – full of energy, passion, and joy.

One day, while working on a project in a small café in Rio de Janeiro, Liam met a young woman named Sofia. She was a writer, with a quick wit and a sharp tongue, and she was immediately drawn to Liam's infectious enthusiasm.

Sofia introduced Liam to her world of words, and he found himself captivated by the power of language. Together, they began writing stories and poems, their collaboration sparking a creative fire that burned bright.
