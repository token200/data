Liam Roche sat at the small café, nursing a cup of coffee as he stared out the window. The rain pattered against the glass, casting a rhythmic beat that matched the turmoil brewing inside him. It had been three months since his girlfriend, Sophie, left him without explanation. Liam couldn't shake the feeling that he'd done something to drive her away.

As he sat there, lost in thought, the café door swung open and Sophie walked in. She was alone, her eyes fixed on the floor as she made her way to the counter. Liam's heart skipped a beat as he watched her, his mind racing with questions. Why was she back? Was it to make amends, or just to leave again?

Sophie ordered a coffee and took a seat at a table by the window, trying to blend into the background. Liam hesitated for a moment before getting up and joining her. "Hey," he said softly, his voice barely audible over the sound of the rain.

Sophie looked up, her eyes meeting his for a brief moment before dropping back down to the floor. "Liam Roche," she replied quietly, her voice laced with pain.

Liam took a seat across from her, his heart pounding in his chest. "I've been thinking," he said, trying to choose his words carefully. "About what happened between us."

Sophie's eyes flickered up to meet his again, a hint of curiosity dancing in their depths. "What do you want to say?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Liam took a deep breath before speaking. "I know I messed up," he said, the words tumbling out of him in a rush. "But please, Sophie, tell me what I did wrong. Maybe then we can try again."

Sophie's expression softened slightly, and for a moment, Liam thought he saw a glimmer of hope. But it was quickly extinguished as she looked away, her eyes welling up with tears. "I'm sorry, Liam," she said finally, her voice cracking. "I just needed to get away."

Liam nodded slowly, feeling a pang of disappointment. Maybe some wounds were too deep to heal, and their love was one of them. But as he watched Sophie gather her things and leave the café once again, he knew that he'd never give up on her – not completely, at least.
