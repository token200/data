Dante Salemi stepped out of his worn leather satchel, his bright blue eyes scanning the small café. It was one of his favorite haunts in the city, and he knew every regular by name. The owner, Mrs. Bianchi, smiled at him from behind the counter, her silver hair tucked away beneath a floral apron.

"Good morning, Dante," she said, pouring him a steaming cup of espresso without asking. "You look like you could use some fuel for your day."

Dante smiled wryly as he took the cup, his dark hair mussed from sleep. He was a private investigator, and days often started at dawn with a long drive and endless questions to answer.

As he sipped his coffee, Dante's gaze drifted out the window, watching the morning commute shuffle by on the sidewalk below. It was a lonely job, but one he'd grown accustomed to over the years. The quiet hours in the café were his sanctuary – where the world outside receded and all that mattered was the next case.

A young woman slipped into a booth across from him, her eyes fixed on a small notebook clutched tightly in her fist. She introduced herself as Lily, her voice trembling slightly. Dante's instincts kicked in; this was going to be a tough one.

"What's your story, Lily?" he asked, his tone gentle.

Lily hesitated before speaking, her words tumbling out in a rush. Her sister had gone missing three months ago – no signs of foul play, but the police seemed reluctant to investigate further. She'd been searching for answers, scouring every lead, and now she was running out of options.

Dante's eyes narrowed; he knew how this story went. Sometimes, all that mattered was finding the next piece of evidence, even if it meant breaking a few rules along the way.

He nodded at Mrs. Bianchi, who produced another cup from behind her counter, a small plate of biscotti to accompany his espresso. "Let's get started," he said, leaning forward as Lily began to tell him more about her sister and their family's dark past.
