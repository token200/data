Dante Sikora stepped into the dimly lit alley, his eyes scanning the crowded streets for any sign of trouble. As a former hitman, he had seen it all - the bloodstained concrete, the whispered threats, and the desperate lives forever changed by the decisions made in places like this.

A lifetime ago, Dante had been just another faceless enforcer, taking orders from wealthy clients and carrying out their dirty work without question. But after a fateful job went sideways, leaving a young woman dead and himself wounded, Dante realized that he'd lost something far more precious than his life: his innocence.

He took up the mantle of redemption, using his unique set of skills to help those in need rather than harm them. It hadn't been easy - there were still nights when the ghosts of his past came knocking, tempting him back into the darkness - but Dante had learned to quiet their whispers with a steady hand and an unwavering sense of purpose.

Tonight was different, though. Tonight, he'd received a call from an old acquaintance, someone who'd known him long enough to know that when Dante said he'd show up, he meant it. And so, he stood watch in the alleyway, his eyes fixed on the shadows as they danced across the walls.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the darkness. "Dante," a low voice called out, followed by a soft thud against the pavement. The sound was unmistakable - the telltale click of metal striking concrete.

Without hesitation, Dante sprang into action. His hand instinctively went to his gun, and as he drew it, a faint glimmer of light appeared from within the alleyway's mouth. It grew brighter by the second, illuminating two figures: the acquaintance, bound and gagged; and a woman with piercing green eyes, staring up at him with an unsettling familiarity.

"Dante," she whispered again, her voice dripping with urgency. "They've been watching me for months."

The realization hit Dante like a sledgehammer - this was no coincidence. This was someone who knew his name, knew his business... and wanted something from him. As the woman's gaze locked onto his, Dante felt his instincts screaming for action.

With an unseen hand, he steadied her against the ground, drawing a deep breath as he listened to her trembling words: "They're coming for you now."
