Dante Sánchez-Gijón stepped off the bus and onto the dusty main street of San Juan del Río, his worn boots making soft crunching sounds on the gravel. The small town was a far cry from the bustling streets of Mexico City, where he'd spent most of his life as a struggling artist.

As Dante made his way through the quiet streets, he couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness. He'd inherited a small ranch from his great-aunt in this very town, and had come to San Juan del Río with plans to restore it to its former glory. But so far, that plan seemed like just another pipe dream.

Dante's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of his phone buzzing in his pocket. He pulled it out to find a text from an unknown number: "Meet me at the old windmill on the outskirts of town if you want to know what really happened to your great-aunt."

Dante's curiosity was piqued, and he made his way to the windmill as soon as he finished eating lunch. The sun beat down on him as he climbed the creaky stairs to the top, where a figure in a worn denim jacket waited for him.

"Who are you?" Dante demanded, eyeing the stranger warily.

"My name is Lupita," the woman replied, her voice low and mysterious. "And I'm here to tell you that your great-aunt wasn't who you thought she was."

Dante's eyes narrowed. "What do you mean?"

Lupita hesitated before speaking, her words tumbling out in a rush. "She was involved with the resistance, Dante Sánchez-Gijón. She helped them smuggle people and supplies out of the country during the war."

As Lupita spoke, Dante felt his mind reeling. He'd always thought of himself as a straightforward guy, but now he wondered if there was more to his family's history than he'd ever imagined.

Lupita's words sparked a fire within Dante, and he knew that he had to learn more about the woman who'd changed everything for him. He nodded at Lupita, a sense of determination settling in his chest.

"Thank you," he said, tucking his phone back into his pocket. "I have a lot to unpack."

Lupita smiled, a small, knowing smile. "You're welcome, Dante Sánchez-Gijón."
