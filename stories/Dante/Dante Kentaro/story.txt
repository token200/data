Dante Kentaro stood at the edge of the Tokyo rooftop, his eyes scanning the neon-lit city below. The wind whipped through his dark hair as he gazed out at the sea of towering skyscrapers and bustling streets.

A recluse by choice, Dante had long ago abandoned the world beneath his feet. He'd grown tired of its noise, chaos, and expectations. As a former member of an elite special forces unit, he'd been trained to navigate the darkest corners of human nature. But after witnessing the devastation of war firsthand, Dante had retreated into solitude.

Tonight was different, though. Tonight, Dante had received a mysterious message – a cryptic invitation to meet with a wealthy collector who claimed to possess information about his sister's disappearance years ago.

Dante's thoughts were a jumble of emotions as he descended back down to the rooftop bar where he'd agreed to meet the collector. His sister, Akira, had been taken by a mysterious organization known only as "The Order" when Dante was just a teenager. He'd spent years searching for her, following every lead, but to no avail.

As he sipped his whiskey, a figure emerged from the shadows – an impeccably dressed man with piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into Dante's very soul.

"Welcome, Mr. Kentaro," the collector said, his voice dripping with refinement. "I see you're a man of few words."

Dante nodded curtly, his hand resting on the grip of his knife, hidden beneath his jacket.

"I've been expecting you," the collector continued, producing a small USB drive from his pocket. "This contains evidence that might just lead you to your sister's whereabouts."

Dante took the drive, his fingers closing around it like a vice. A spark of hope flared within him, and for an instant, he forgot about the years of solitude, the pain and the anger.

But as he turned to leave, Dante caught sight of a figure watching from across the rooftop – a woman with piercing blue eyes that seemed to hold a deep sadness. For a moment, their gazes locked, and Dante felt an inexplicable jolt of connection.

The woman vanished into the crowd before he could react, leaving Dante with more questions than answers.

As he walked out of the bar, USB drive in hand, Dante knew that this was only the beginning – of a journey that would take him back into the world he'd tried so desperately to escape.
