Dante Esther stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the dimly lit station. The air was thick with the smell of damp earth and decaying leaves. It had been ten years since he'd last set foot in Ashwood, the small town where his family had settled when he was just a child.

As a teenager, Dante had always felt like an outsider in Ashwood. His parents were immigrants from Eastern Europe, and their struggles to adapt to American culture had left them feeling like second-class citizens. But it was not until Dante's mother passed away that he began to realize the true extent of his family's isolation.

The letter, delivered by a knock at his door, had been a stark reminder that his father was gone too. The old man's passing had left Dante with more questions than answers. His parents had always kept their past a secret, and now it seemed those secrets were about to be unearthed.

Dante made his way through the quiet streets of Ashwood, the town seeming smaller than he remembered. He passed by the same old buildings, now bearing faded signs that told tales of long-forgotten businesses. The sound of children's laughter carried on the wind, but there was no one to answer it.

As he walked, Dante noticed a figure standing outside his childhood home. A woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair watched him approach. It was Lena, an old friend from school who had always been a source of comfort for him.

"Dante," she said softly, as if afraid to break the spell that had fallen over them both. "It's been too long."

They walked in silence, their footsteps echoing off the houses, until they reached the small park where Dante used to ride his bike with Lena. The swings creaked and groaned in the wind, a haunting reminder of happier times.

"What brings you back?" Dante asked finally, his voice barely above a whisper.

Lena hesitated before answering. "Your father's letters."

Dante's eyes narrowed. "What do they say?"

She took a deep breath before speaking the words that would change everything: "They say your parents were refugees from Eastern Europe during World War II. They left their homeland in search of safety, but it was a lie. Your father died in a concentration camp, and your mother... she disappeared."

The words hit Dante like a blow to the chest. His whole world crumbled beneath him as he stumbled through the streets, searching for answers that might never come.
