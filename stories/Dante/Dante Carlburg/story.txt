Dante Carlburg was a man shrouded in mystery. A former mercenary, he had spent years traversing the globe, taking on missions and working for whoever would pay him to do so. His past was a tangled web of loyalty, betrayal, and violence – but one thing remained constant: his unwavering commitment to justice.

After a particularly grueling job in Eastern Europe, Dante found himself with enough money to retire from the mercenary life for good. He settled down in a small town in rural Italy, where he took up woodworking as a hobby. His skilled hands created beautiful furniture pieces that quickly gained popularity among the local townspeople.

Despite his newfound peace, whispers of Dante's past followed him everywhere. People would often approach him with stories about his exploits, asking if they were true or just myths. Some even claimed to have seen him in action, and while he never confirmed or denied these tales, there was a hint of pride in his eyes whenever someone spoke of his bravery.

One evening, as the sun dipped into the Adriatic Sea, Dante received an unexpected visit from an old acquaintance – a man named Alessandro, who had once worked with him on a high-stakes mission. Alessandro brought news of a wealthy patron looking for someone to take care of a problem in the city's underworld. The job required stealth and cunning, qualities that Dante was all too familiar with.

At first, Dante was hesitant to get involved, but something about the proposition resonated with him. He agreed to meet with the patron and take on the task, sensing an opportunity to make a difference from afar. As he watched Alessandro disappear into the night, Dante felt a familiar spark ignite within him – one that would propel him back into the world of danger and deception.

Little did Dante know, this new job would set off a chain reaction of events that would force him to confront the demons of his past once more. But for now, he simply smiled to himself as he walked back to his workshop, feeling an unshakeable sense of purpose. For Dante Carlburg, there was no such thing as retirement – only one final adventure waiting in the shadows.
