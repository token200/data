Dante Kovalenko stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the city. As a private investigator, he'd seen his fair share of darkness, but tonight was different. Tonight, he was searching for answers.

The call had come from an old acquaintance, a woman named Sophia who'd been missing for weeks. Dante had taken on the case, driven by a mixture of curiosity and guilt. He'd known Sophia since college, and her disappearance had left him with more questions than answers.

As he scanned the rooftops below, his eyes landed on a figure in the distance. A woman with long, dark hair and a coat that seemed out of place among the city's steel skyscrapers. Dante's instincts told him she was Sophia, but something about her didn't feel right.

He took a deep breath and began to make his way down the fire escape. The wind howled through the alleyways as he descended, his eyes fixed on the woman in question. As he reached the ground floor, he spotted her standing outside a nondescript warehouse.

Without hesitation, Dante approached her, his hands resting on his hips. "Sophia?" he called out, his voice firm but cautious.

The woman turned, her eyes locking onto Dante's. For a moment, they just stared at each other, the city lights twinkling around them like stars.

Then, without a word, Sophia vanished into thin air.

Dante's heart skipped a beat as he rushed towards the warehouse, his mind racing with possibilities. He pushed open the door, and a blast of cold air hit him like a slap in the face.

Inside, he found himself in a dimly lit room filled with old computers and dusty files. Dante's eyes scanned the space, taking in the scattered papers and the lone chair in the center of the room.

Sophia sat in the chair, her eyes fixed on a computer screen as she typed away with a furious intensity. Dante's gaze followed hers, and what he saw made his blood run cold.

On the screen, Sophia's own face stared back at him, alongside a series of cryptic messages and symbols that seemed to dance across the screen like fireflies in the night.

Dante knew then that Sophia was in over her head. She'd stumbled into something much bigger than herself, something that threatened to consume her whole. And Dante had a feeling he was just as trapped as she was.
