Dante Ryota was known for his quick wit and sharp tongue, which he wielded like a sword in the cutthroat world of New Haven's underground fight clubs. By day, he worked as a mechanic at Ryota's Garage, tinkering with engines and trading stories with his boss, old man Yamada. But by night, Dante donned a mask and gloves to compete in the city's most brutal brawls.

Dante had grown up on the streets of New Haven, where gangs ruled with an iron fist. He learned early that only the strongest survived, and he spent years honing his skills in street fights until he landed a spot in one of the city's elite fighting clubs.

Despite his fearsome reputation, Dante was haunted by demons from his past. His brother had died in a brutal gangland killing when they were kids, and the loss had left Dante with a deep-seated anger that simmered just below the surface. In the ring, he could finally channel that rage into something productive, using it to fuel his victories and leave his opponents battered and broken.

But as much as Dante loved the rush of adrenaline that came with fighting, he knew he couldn't keep up this double life forever. The pressure was building, both from within and without. His boss at the garage had started to suspect his nocturnal activities, and rumors were spreading about the "ghost" fighter who seemed invincible in the ring.

One night, after a particularly grueling bout, Dante stumbled into Ryota's Garage exhausted and battered. Yamada looked up at him with concern etched on his face, but when he saw the cuts and bruises, he simply shook his head and handed Dante a warm towel. "You need to watch yourself, kid," he said quietly.

Dante took the towel gratefully, feeling like an old man compared to the fire that still burned within him. Maybe it was time to retire from the fighting life for good. Or maybe – just maybe – he could find a way to merge his two identities and use his strength for something more than just survival.
