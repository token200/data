Karolina Korolev stood atop the worn steps, her eyes scanning the Moscow skyline as the sun dipped behind the Kremlin's imposing walls. A journalist by trade, she had spent years chasing stories, but none as personal as this one.

Her sister, Anastasia, had disappeared five years ago, leaving behind only a cryptic note and a whispered rumor of corruption within the Russian government. The official investigation had yielded nothing but dead ends, and Karolina's family had given up hope.

Tonight, she was here to confront the man she suspected was responsible – Viktor Petrov, Anastasia's boss at the Ministry of Defense. The wind carried the faint scent of snow as she descended into the darkening streets, her heart pounding with a mix of determination and trepidation.

As she entered Petrov's office building, Karolina felt a shiver run down her spine. The guards at the reception desk eyed her warily, but she flashed her press badge and demanded to see Petrov immediately.

The waiting room was cold and sterile, lit only by the faint glow of screens displaying news feeds from around the world. Karolina checked her watch for what felt like the hundredth time – 10:47 PM. Where was Petrov?

Just as she was about to leave, a sleek black car pulled up outside, its tinted windows reflecting the flickering streetlights. The doors slid open, revealing Petrov himself, impeccably dressed and exuding an aura of quiet confidence.

"Karolina Korolev," he said, his voice smooth as silk. "I've been expecting you."

For a moment, they locked eyes, the air thick with unspoken tension. Karolina's journalist instincts told her to push for answers, but something in Petrov's gaze made her hesitate.

"Why did your sister disappear?" he asked finally, his voice low and measured.

Karolina took a deep breath before speaking, the words tumbling out in a rush. "Because she knew about the scandal, didn't she? The one that could bring down an entire government?"

Petrov's expression remained inscrutable, but Karolina detected a flicker of curiosity behind his eyes.

"I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about," he said calmly.

Karolina smiled wryly. She knew the truth – Anastasia had stumbled upon something big, and Petrov was determined to silence her.

As she turned to leave, Petrov called out after her. "Karolina?"

She stopped in the doorway, but didn't look back. "What?"

"Be careful," he said quietly. "You're playing with fire."

The door closed behind her, Karolina's mind racing with possibilities. She knew that this was only the beginning of a long, perilous journey – one that would take her to the very heart of power and corruption in Russia.
