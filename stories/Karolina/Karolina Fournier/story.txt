Karolina Fournier was a force to be reckoned with in the small town of Saint-Pierre. She was a 25-year-old free spirit, with a wild mane of curly hair and a mischievous grin that could charm the birds from the trees.

As a child, Karo had always felt like an outsider in her tight-knit community. Her parents were both artists, and their bohemian lifestyle had rubbed off on her. She loved nothing more than spending hours painting, playing music, or getting lost in the woods with her guitar.

But despite her love of solitude, Karo was never one to be alone for too long. She had a way of drawing people to her, like a magnet. Whether it was at the local café, where she worked as a waitress, or at the town's weekly market, where she sold handmade crafts, Karo always seemed to be at the center of attention.

One summer evening, a stranger arrived in Saint-Pierre. He was tall and dark-haired, with piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through her. Karo was immediately drawn to him, but she tried to resist his charms. After all, she had a reputation for being fiercely independent, and she wasn't about to let some handsome stranger get the best of her.

Despite her better judgment, Karo found herself spending more and more time with the mysterious stranger. They would sit on the beach at sunset, watching the stars come out one by one. They would take long walks through the forest, talking about everything and nothing. And they would dance under the moonlight, their bodies swaying to an invisible rhythm.

As the summer wore on, Karo found herself falling deeper and deeper in love with the stranger. She had no idea who he was, or where he came from, but she knew that he made her feel alive. And when he finally told her his name – Étienne – and revealed that he was a traveling artist, Karo knew that she would never be able to let him go.

For Karo, life had always been about the journey, not the destination. But with Étienne by her side, she realized that sometimes the best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in someone else's eyes.
