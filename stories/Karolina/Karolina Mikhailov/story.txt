She collaborated with other artists, experimented with new sounds, and even composed music for film and television projects. Through it all, she remained true to her artistic vision, refusing to compromise on her unique voice and style.

Despite her success, Karolina never forgot where she came from. She continued to support up-and-coming musicians and artists in Moscow, and used her platform to advocate for social justice causes close to her heart.
