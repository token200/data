Karolina Kalnins stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She had been searching for her old friend, Lietuva, for weeks, and finally, she had received a tip that he would be here tonight.

As she made her way to the bar, Karolina's thoughts drifted back to their childhood days spent exploring the winding streets of Vilnius together. They had shared countless secrets, dreams, and aspirations, and now, as adults, they were far apart, each chasing their own paths in life.

The bartender, a gruff but kind-hearted man named Jonas, nodded at Karolina as she ordered a cup of black coffee. He knew her well, having watched her grow from a curious child into a vibrant young woman. "Lietuva's table," he said, with a discreet nod towards the corner.

Karolina spotted Lietuva across the room, his dark hair mussed, and his eyes fixed intently on some invisible point. She smiled, feeling a rush of nostalgia wash over her. As she approached, he looked up, his gaze locking onto hers. For a moment, they just stared at each other, lost in the memories of their past.

"Lietuva," Karolina said, her voice barely above a whisper. "It's been too long."

Lietuva stood up, his face breaking into a warm smile. "Karolina Kalnins," he replied, using her full name with affection. "I've missed you so much."

They spent the next few hours catching up on each other's lives, sharing stories of love, loss, and success. Karolina learned about Lietuva's struggles as an artist, and how his passion for painting had taken him to new heights. As they talked, the café emptied out, and the sounds of the city drifted in through the open window.

As the night wore on, Karolina realized that some things never changed – her friendship with Lietuva was still strong, unshakeable, and full of life. She knew that no matter where their paths took them, their bond would endure, a testament to the power of true friendship and the memories they had shared over the years.
