Karolina PÃµld stepped off the bus and onto the worn asphalt of the Tartu University campus. The chilly autumn air carried with it the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a familiar aroma that seemed to wrap itself around her like a comforting blanket.

As she made her way through the crowds of students hurrying to their next class, Karolina's eyes scanned the faces, searching for the familiar ones. She was on a mission to find her best friend, Liina, who had been missing since morning.

It wasn't the first time Liina had gone AWOL, but this time Karolina was determined to find out what was behind it. The two friends had been inseparable since childhood, sharing secrets and laughter, and now something seemed to be driving a wedge between them.

Karolina pushed open the door to their favorite coffee shop, "Tartu Tart," and was greeted by the warm smile of their barista, Arvo. "Kari! Where have you been?" he asked, concern etched on his face.

"I'm looking for Liina," Karolina replied, her voice firm but worried. "Have you seen her?"

Arvo's expression turned somber. "I haven't seen her all morning. But I did get a phone call from her just before she disappeared. She said something about needing some space and not wanting to be found."

Karolina felt a pang of worry. Liina was always the one who knew what to say, but in this case, it seemed like she was using that as an excuse for being invisible.

She spent the next hour scouring the campus, asking students if they'd seen Liina, but no one had any information. As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the quad, Karolina finally found herself standing outside their favorite park, where Liina and she used to have picnics on warm summer days.

Karolina sat down on a bench, watching as the stars began to twinkle in the sky above. She knew that her best friend was struggling with something, but she had no idea what it was or how to fix it. All she could do was wait for Liina to come back to her, and hope that their friendship would emerge stronger on the other side.

As the night wore on, Karolina felt a sense of determination rising up within her. She knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, she and Liina would face them together, as they always had.
