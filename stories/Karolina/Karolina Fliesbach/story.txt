Karolina Fliesbach stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar surroundings of her hometown. It had been years since she'd returned to Ravensburg, but the memories still lingered like a whispered secret in her mind.

As she made her way through the station, Karolina Fliesbach's thoughts turned to the reason for her return: a family gathering that threatened to upend the carefully constructed walls of her adult life. Her grandmother was ailing, and Karolina had been persuaded – guiltily, perhaps – to attend the funeral and help with the arrangements.

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the cobblestone streets as Karolina Fliesbach made her way to the old family house on the outskirts of town. The once-grand facade now wore a weathered look, its windows boarded up against the outside world. A faint scent of wood smoke and damp earth clung to the air, carrying with it memories of childhood afternoons spent playing in the garden.

Inside, Karolina Fliesbach was greeted by a flurry of activity: her mother fussing over last-minute preparations, her siblings arguing over who would play the accordion at the funeral, and her cousins – all grown up now – exchanging knowing glances as they whispered to each other about their own lives. The air vibrated with tension, Karolina Fliesbach sensed it even before she heard the words.

At the gravesite itself, a hastily assembled service drew to a close. Karolina's grandmother lay beneath her nameplate – In memoriam Karolina Fliesbach (née Müller) – the weight of which brought tears to her eyes. A somber moment passed as they recited the final prayers and laid the earth over her remains.

The funeral procession wound its way back through Ravensburg, a slow, solemn march that seemed to match the cadence of Karolina Fliesbach's own heartbeat. As night began to fall, the mourners gathered once more at the family house for a candlelit dinner, their conversation stilted but polite. Karolina Fliesbach sat apart from them, lost in her own thoughts.

Eventually, she rose and bid her family adieu, taking one last look around Ravensburg before slipping out into the darkness, where the stars twinkled like constellations waiting to be rediscovered.
