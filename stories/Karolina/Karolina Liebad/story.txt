Karolina Liebad was known for her razor-sharp wit and her ability to think on her feet. As a renowned journalist, she had made a name for herself by asking the tough questions that no one else dared to ask.

Karolina's eyes sparkled with curiosity as she sat in the dimly lit café, sipping her coffee and waiting for her source to arrive. She had been working on a story about corruption in the city's government for weeks, and finally, she had received a tip that the information she needed was going to be revealed.

As she checked her watch for what felt like the hundredth time, a figure emerged from the crowd outside. Karolina's instincts told her that this could be it – the person who would finally give her the scoop she so desperately needed.

The stranger slid into the seat across from her, and Karolina flashed a warm smile. "Welcome to our little chat," she said, pulling out her notebook and pen.

The source, whose name was Ivan, leaned in close, his voice barely above a whisper. "I have information about the mayor's dealings with the construction company," he began.

Karolina's ears perked up, and she scribbled furiously as Ivan told her story. She asked pointed questions, prodding for details and clarification. As the conversation went on, Karolina could feel the tension in the air build, and she knew that this was exactly what she had been working towards.

As Ivan finished speaking, Karolina sat back in her chair, her mind racing with possibilities. This story could be huge – a major scandal that would bring down the mayor's administration and rock the city to its core.

But as she looked at Ivan, she saw something there that gave her pause. A hint of fear in his eyes, perhaps? Something that told her this source was more than just a willing informant?

Karolina's instincts told her to trust her gut. She knew that in this line of work, you had to be able to spot a rat from a mile away. And what she saw didn't look like a rat – it looked like someone who needed help.

With newfound determination, Karolina pulled out her phone and dialed the number of her editor. "We have a story," she said, her voice low and urgent. "But I think we need to get this source out of here first."
