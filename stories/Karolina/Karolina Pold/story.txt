As the winner of the competition, Karolina was awarded a trophy and a cash prize, but more importantly, she had proven to herself that she was capable of achieving her dreams. And as she stood on stage, basking in the adoration of the crowd, Karolina Pold knew that all her hard work and dedication had paid off. She was a true champion, both behind the bakery counter and on the ice, where she shone like a star.
