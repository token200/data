Karolina Askarov stood at the edge of the frozen lake, her eyes scanning the vast expanse of white. As a Siberian trapper and hunter, she knew every inch of this unforgiving terrain like the back of her hand. Her dark hair was pulled back into a tight braid, revealing a smattering of freckles across her nose.

It had been three years since Karolina's family had disappeared on an expedition to hunt for beavers. The authorities had given up searching, assuming they'd perished in the harsh Siberian wilderness. But Karolina knew better. She'd found a fragment of fabric caught in a tree branch, a piece of clothing that didn't belong to her family.

Determined to uncover the truth, Karolina set out on a solo journey across the frozen tundra. Her makeshift sled creaked under the weight of her gear as she trudged through the knee-deep snow. The biting wind howled around her, but she pressed on, fueled by a fierce determination.

As she traversed the lake's surface, Karolina spotted something strange - a small, wooden boat half-hidden in the ice. Her heart quickened with excitement as she realized it might belong to her family. She carefully dug out the boat, brushing away the snow and ice.

Inside, she found a cryptic message scrawled on a piece of parchment: "They took us to the village of Ochota. Be careful." Karolina's grip on her hunting knife tightened as she processed this revelation. Her family had been taken somewhere - but where?

With renewed purpose, Karolina set off towards Ochota, navigating treacherous mountain passes and treacherous rivers. As night began to fall, she spotted a cluster of flickering torches in the distance. The village was nestled deep within a valley, surrounded by towering peaks that seemed to pierce the very sky.

Karolina approached cautiously, her senses on high alert. She knew nothing about this village - but she was determined to find out what had happened to her family. As she pushed open the creaking gate, a figure emerged from the shadows. Their eyes narrowed as they took in Karolina's rugged appearance and Siberian hunting gear.

"Welcome to Ochota," the stranger said, their voice dripping with an air of mystery. "We've been expecting you."
