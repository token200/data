Elīna Jørgensen, or Lena as she was known to her friends, stood at the edge of the frozen lake, her eyes fixed on the mist-shrouded mountains in the distance. She had always felt an inexplicable pull towards these mountains, a sense that there was something waiting for her just beyond the treeline.

As a child, Lena would spend hours gazing out at the landscape, lost in daydreams of adventure and discovery. Her parents had encouraged her fascination, taking her on long hikes through the countryside and teaching her how to identify the different plants and animals that lived there.

But as she grew older, Lena began to feel restless. She felt like there was something missing in her life, something she couldn't quite put her finger on. So she made a decision: she would leave home and explore the world beyond her small village.

It hadn't been easy. Lena had faced rejection and disappointment at every turn, but she refused to give up. Finally, after months of searching, she had found the perfect job as a ranger in a national park in the mountains.

Lena spent hours each day exploring the trails, studying the wildlife, and learning about the unique geology of the area. She felt like she was finally starting to understand the mysterious pull that had drawn her to this place all those years ago.

One evening, as she sat by the campfire watching the stars come out, Lena heard a strange noise in the distance. At first, she thought it might be just the wind or a stray animal, but then she heard it again - a faint rustling sound that seemed to be getting closer and closer.

Lena's heart began to beat faster as she sat up straight, her senses on high alert. What could be making that noise? She fumbled in her pack for her flashlight and turned it on, casting a beam of light into the darkness.

As the light illuminated the surrounding trees, Lena saw a figure emerge from the shadows. It was an old woman, dressed in a long coat and carrying a staff. The woman's eyes locked onto Lena's, and she smiled - a warm, gentle smile that seemed to hold a thousand secrets.

"Welcome, child," the old woman said, her voice low and soothing. "I've been waiting for you."

Lena felt a shiver run down her spine as the old woman approached her. She had no idea what this encounter might mean, but she knew that her life was about to change forever.
