Bohdan Petrovich Ken was a man with a reputation for being able to get out of any situation he found himself in. A skilled thief and con artist, he had made a living on the streets of Moscow by using his charm and wit to swindle even the most unsuspecting mark.

One night, Bohdan's latest scheme went awry when he was caught by a group of heavily armed men. They were working for a wealthy businessman who had hired them to bring in Ken and extract a valuable artifact from him.

Bohdan knew that he couldn't take on the entire gang alone, so he did what any self-respecting thief would do - he used his charm to talk his way out of the situation. He convinced the leader of the group, a burly man named Viktor, that Bohdan was just an innocent bystander and not worth their time.

Viktor wasn't convinced, but Bohdan's words had planted a seed of doubt in his mind. As he searched Bohdan's pockets for any signs of the artifact, Bohdan took advantage of the distraction to slip away unnoticed.

However, as he made his escape, Bohdan couldn't shake off the feeling that he was being watched. He knew that Viktor and his men were on his tail, and he needed to think fast if he wanted to stay one step ahead.

Bohdan quickly changed direction, weaving in and out of alleys and side streets until he lost his pursuers. Panting heavily, he finally reached the safety of his small apartment and locked the door behind him.

As he leaned against the wall, catching his breath, Bohdan couldn't help but think about how close he had come to being caught. He knew that he needed to lay low for a while, at least until he came up with another plan.

Just then, his phone rang. It was an unknown number, and Bohdan's instincts told him that this could be trouble. But he answered anyway, curious about who might be on the other end of the line.

"Bohdan Petrovich Ken," a low voice said, "I think we can do business together."
