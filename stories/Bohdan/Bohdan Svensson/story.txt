Bohdan Svensson stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the cool morning air filling his lungs as he gazed out at the sleepy town. As the son of a Swedish immigrant and an American native, Bohdan had always felt a sense of disconnection from both cultures. He had grown up in the suburbs, speaking both languages but feeling like he didn't quite belong in either.

As he made his way through the quiet streets, Bohdan's mind wandered back to his childhood. His father, a skilled woodworker, would spend hours in their small workshop, creating beautiful pieces of furniture from scraps of wood and scraps of memories. Bohdan had always been fascinated by his father's craft, watching with wide eyes as he coaxed life from the raw materials.

Now, at 25, Bohdan was back in Sweden, visiting his family for the summer. His parents had welcomed him with open arms, eager to catch up on lost time. As they sat down to a simple meal of meatballs and lingonberry jam, Bohdan's father asked about his plans.

"I'm thinking of starting my own business," Bohdan said, hesitating slightly. "I've always loved woodworking, but I want to do something different. Something that combines art and function."

His mother, a petite woman with a quick smile, leaned forward. "That sounds like something our father would have loved," she said softly.

Bohdan's eyes pricked with tears as he thought of his father, who had passed away just a year ago. He knew that Bohdan Svensson the woodworker was long gone, but he couldn't help feeling like he was carrying on the family legacy in some small way.

Over the next few weeks, Bohdan threw himself into his project. He spent hours researching and experimenting, testing different techniques and materials until he finally found what worked for him. As the summer wore on, he began to sell his pieces at local markets, earning a steady income and slowly building up his customer base.

As the days shortened and the nights grew cooler, Bohdan knew it was time to return home. He said goodbye to his parents, who beamed with pride as they handed him a small package containing a beautifully crafted wooden box adorned with intricate patterns.

"It's for you," his mother said, her eyes shining. "A reminder of where you come from and what drives you."

Bohdan smiled, tucking the box into his bag as he set off onto the next stage of his journey. He knew that Bohdan Svensson the woodworker was just beginning to take shape, but he was excited to see where the road would lead him next.
