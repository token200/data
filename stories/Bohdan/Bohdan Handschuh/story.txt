Bohdan Handschuh was a man shrouded in mystery. His eyes seemed to hold a thousand stories, each one etched into the fine lines and creases that mapped his weathered face. Few had ever seen him smile, but those who did spoke of it as if witnessing a celestial event.

As a child, Bohdan lived on a remote farm, where his family raised prize-winning pigs and cattle. He spent his days exploring the rolling hills and forests beyond their small patch of land, collecting berries and watching the stars twinkle to life in the night sky. It was during one such expedition that he stumbled upon an old, leather-bound book hidden away in a hollow log.

The book belonged to a traveling bard who had passed through their village many years ago. As Bohdan flipped through its yellowed pages, he discovered it contained the collective knowledge of his people: ancient songs, forgotten dances, and tales of love and loss. Entranced by its secrets, Bohdan devoted himself to mastering every skill within those pages.

Years went by, and Bohdan's talents grew in prowess. He became a master musician, able to coax melodies from the most unlikely instruments. His voice was like honey – smooth, rich, and hauntingly beautiful. He wove tales of old into songs that captivated audiences across the land.

But with fame came solitude. People whispered about Bohdan's ghostly presence, his ability to vanish into thin air whenever he left a performance unfinished. They called him the "Singer of Shadows," for it seemed as though darkness itself fed off his music.

One evening, an invitation arrived at Bohdan's doorstep from the enigmatic patroness of the opera house in Vienna. She requested that he perform an original composition to commemorate her birthday celebration. Intrigued by the challenge and drawn by the promise of fame, Bohdan accepted the offer.

As the night of the performance approached, whispers spread like wildfire about the mysterious singer who was said to hold his breath during performances, as if holding back something vital – or perhaps even death itself.
