Bohdan Sten stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station as if searching for something â€“ or someone. The faded sign above the ticket counter creaked in the gentle breeze, reading "Rybak's Tavern" in crooked letters.

It was a place Bohdan had avoided for years, yet here he was, drawn by a mix of curiosity and desperation. His full name, Bohdan Sten, had become synonymous with mystery and intrigue in these parts. Rumors swirled about his past, from whispers of espionage to speculation about his true identity.

As Bohdan pushed open the creaky door, a bell above it let out a tired clang. The tavern's patrons turned to regard him, their faces a mix of curiosity and hostility. Bohdan's eyes adjusted to the dim light, taking in the rowdy atmosphere and the faint scent of whiskey wafting through the air.

A barkeep, a gruff man with a thick beard, eyed Bohdan from behind the counter. "What can I get you, stranger?" he growled, his tone as rough as the station's wooden beams.

Bohdan slid onto a stool, his eyes locked on the barkeep. "Just information," he said, his voice low and even. The barkeep raised an eyebrow but poured him a whiskey without comment.

As Bohdan sipped his drink, he noticed a figure in the corner, hunched over a mug of ale. She was a woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair, her presence as enigmatic as Bohdan's own. They locked gazes, a spark of recognition igniting between them.

The barkeep, seemingly oblivious to their exchange, leaned forward. "You're looking for something, Bohdan Sten?" he whispered, his voice barely audible over the din of conversation.

Bohdan nodded, his eyes never leaving the woman's face. The barkeep nodded back, a small smile playing on his lips. "I might have some information. But it'll cost you."
