Bohdan Adelberg stepped out of the train and onto the worn platform, the cold winter air hitting him like a slap in the face. He had been away for months, and it seemed like an eternity since he'd set foot in his hometown of Krakow, Poland.

As he made his way through the station, Bohdan's eyes scanned the familiar surroundings, taking in the faded signs and worn benches. It was as if no time had passed at all, yet everything felt different. The city was bustling with life, but there was a sense of unease that hung in the air like a thick fog.

Bohdan hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of his family's old apartment building. As they drove through the streets, he caught glimpses of the city he had once known: the narrow alleys, the colorful market stalls, and the majestic Wawel Castle looming in the distance.

When they arrived at the apartment building, Bohdan paid the driver and stepped out onto the sidewalk. The building was just as he remembered it – a small, three-story affair with a faded façade and a broken shutters that let in slivers of light.

He took the stairs two at a time, his footsteps echoing off the walls. As he reached the top floor, he noticed something that made his heart skip a beat: a new family had moved into one of the apartments.

Bohdan's eyes narrowed as he watched them move their belongings into the apartment next door to where his family used to live. He couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy and resentment – who were these strangers, and what did they want with the place that was once his?

He turned away from the window and made his way down to the ground floor, where he found his mother waiting for him in the lobby. She smiled weakly as he approached, her eyes red-rimmed from crying.

"Mother," Bohdan said softly, taking her hand in his.

"What's wrong, szek?" she asked, using the old Polish term of endearment for him.

Bohdan hesitated before answering. "I saw them moving into next door."

His mother looked up at him with a hint of sadness in her eyes. "That's good news," she said quietly. "It means you're not forgotten here."

Bohdan didn't respond, but instead turned to leave. As he walked away from the apartment building, he couldn't shake the feeling that his past and present were colliding in ways he wasn't quite ready for.
