Marlon Kulbayeva was a 25-year-old artist with an unquenchable thirst for creativity. Growing up in a small, rural town in Kazakhstan, she felt suffocated by the traditional expectations placed upon her. Her parents wanted her to become a doctor or an accountant, but Marlon's heart belonged to art.

As a child, she spent hours sketching the vast steppes and snow-capped mountains that surrounded her home. She was fascinated by the way light danced across the landscape, casting shadows that seemed to come alive on the page. Her parents encouraged her creativity, and soon Marlon found herself enrolled in an art program at a prestigious university.

However, as she delved deeper into her studies, Marlon began to feel stifled by the strict conventions of traditional Kazakh culture. She longed to break free from the expectations of her family and community, to create something truly unique and original. It was then that she discovered street art â€“ a rebellious form of expression that spoke to her very soul.

Marlon spent countless nights creating murals on the city's walls
