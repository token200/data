Alba Roberts sat alone at her desk, staring blankly at the stack of bills and financial reports in front of her. As the owner of small-town bakery, "Sweet Delights," Alba had always prided herself on being a hard worker, but lately, she'd been struggling to keep up with the demands of running a business.

Her bakery had been a staple in the community for years, famous for its mouthwatering pastries and warm atmosphere. But after a series of setbacks, including a rival bakery opening across town, Alba was finding it harder than ever to compete.

As she sifted through her accounts, Alba's mind began to wander back to why she had started this business in the first place. She remembered the smell of sweet dough and buttery croissants wafting from the kitchen as a child, filling her small bedroom with an irresistible aroma that made her feel like baking was the best thing in the world.

Her mother, Elara, had been a master baker too, passing down recipes and techniques to Alba when she was just a teenager. The two of them would spend hours baking together, laughing and chatting as they worked. It was a memory that brought a smile to Alba's face now, but even it couldn't shake off the feeling of failure.

Just then, her phone buzzed with an incoming call from her best friend, Lila. "Hey, Alba, what's going on?" Lila asked, her voice warm and friendly over the line.

Alba hesitated before answering, not wanting to burden her friend with her problems. But something about Lila's encouraging tone put her at ease, so she spilled out all her worries – the bank was threatening to repossess her bakery, she'd lost customers to the new rival bakery, and just to make matters worse, Elara had fallen ill.

Lila listened attentively, offering words of encouragement and advice. "Why don't you take a break, Alba? Sometimes, stepping back from things helps us see them clearly again." Her voice was full of wisdom earned from years of running her own business.

Alba thought about this for a moment before making a decision. She closed the stack of bills and picked up her phone to text Lila an invitation: "Meet me at the park in 30 minutes? Let's take a walk."

As she stepped outside into the crisp afternoon air, Alba felt a weight lifting off her shoulders. With Lila by her side, they began walking towards the nearby lake, talking about everything except her bakery. For once, it wasn't about money or stress – it was just the two of them, enjoying each other's company.

Over a picnic spread on the grassy hill overlooking the lake, Alba realized that sometimes taking a step back and clearing her mind allowed her to come up with solutions she hadn't seen before.
