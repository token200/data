Xu Avendano stepped out of the misty morning air and into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of life. As a private investigator, she had grown accustomed to the early hours, when the city was still sleepy and the streets were empty.

Avendano's gaze landed on the barista, a quiet young man with a messy beard who looked like he'd rather be anywhere else. "Coffee," she said, her voice low and smooth. "Black."

The barista nodded, his eyes avoiding hers as he poured the steaming liquid into a cup. Xu Avendano took a seat at the counter, sipping her coffee as she surveyed the café. It was one of her favorite places to gather information, where the regulars knew better than to bother her with small talk.

As she waited for the morning rush to die down, Avendano's mind turned to her current case: a wealthy businessman who had gone missing three days ago, leaving behind only a cryptic message on his phone. Xu Avendano had been hired by the family to find him, but so far, every lead had ended in a dead end.

Just as she was starting to get frustrated, a figure emerged from the back room, a tall, imposing man with a shaved head and a piercing gaze. "Xu Avendano," he said, his voice dripping with menace. "I see you're still poking around where you shouldn't be."

Avendano's eyes narrowed, her hand instinctively reaching for the gun hidden in her coat pocket. But she knew better than to reveal her true intentions here. Instead, she smiled, a cold, calculated smile. "Just doing my job," she said.

The man raised an eyebrow, but Avendano could see the calculation there, too. He was searching for something, trying to gauge her reaction. And in that moment, Xu Avendano knew exactly how to play him. She leaned back in her chair, a look of innocence on her face, and waited for his next move.

The game was on, and Xu Avendano was ready to play.
