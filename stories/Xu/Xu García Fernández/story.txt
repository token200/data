Xu García Fernández was known for his striking features and sharp wit. He had an uncanny ability to read people, often using this skill to navigate complex social situations. As a young man, he spent most of his days observing those around him, studying their mannerisms and speech patterns.

One day, while strolling through the park, Xu García Fernández stumbled upon a peculiar old man sitting on a bench. The old man introduced himself as Jorge, a retired accountant with a passion for astronomy. As they began to converse, Xu García Fernández found himself captivated by Jorge's wisdom and insight into the mysteries of the universe.

As their conversation progressed, Xu García Fernández discovered that Jorge had spent years studying the stars and planets, pouring over ancient texts in search of hidden truths. He was particularly fascinated by the concept of black holes and how they could warp space-time.

Intrigued, Xu García Fernández asked Jorge to explain his theories in greater detail. Jorge happily obliged, launching into a lengthy explanation of gravitational forces and their effects on celestial bodies. As the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the park, Xu García Fernández found himself lost in Jorge's words.

Hours passed, and the stars began to twinkle in the night sky. Jorge reluctantly bid farewell to his new friend, leaving Xu García Fernández with a sense of wonder and awe that he had never experienced before. From that day on, Xu García Fernández made it a point to spend more time exploring the world around him, seeking out like-minded individuals who shared his passion for discovery.

As he walked home under the starry night sky, Xu García Fernández couldn't help but think of Jorge and their chance encounter. He smiled to himself, knowing that this was just the beginning of an incredible journey of self-discovery and exploration. And as he disappeared into the darkness, Xu García Fernández felt grateful for the unexpected meeting with Jorge, which had opened his eyes to a whole new world of possibilities.
