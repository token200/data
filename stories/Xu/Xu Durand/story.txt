Here's a 400-word story about Xu Durand:

In the sleepy town of Ashwood, nestled in the heart of the Whispering Woods, a legend had long been whispered about a mysterious figure known as Xu Durand. Few claimed to have seen him, and even fewer knew what he looked like. Some said he was a ghost, while others believed he was a sorcerer.

The truth, however, lay somewhere in between.

Xu Durand was a wandering alchemist who had been traveling the land for years, searching for the perfect blend of herbs and minerals to create his legendary elixirs. He possessed an uncanny ability to sense the rarest of ingredients, often finding them in the most unlikely of places.

One stormy evening, as the winds howled through the Whispering Woods, a young apprentice named Lily stumbled upon Xu Durand huddled by a campfire. She had been searching for him for weeks, ever since her village's prized possession – a rare batch of moonpetal flowers – had gone missing. The thief, it was rumored, had fled to Ashwood, seeking the expertise of the elusive alchemist.

As Lily watched Xu Durand stir the embers of his fire, she noticed something peculiar about him. His eyes seemed to gleam with an otherworldly intensity in the flickering light, and his smile hinted at secrets he kept hidden behind a veil of wispy smoke.

Xu Durand sensed Lily's gaze and turned to face her, revealing piercing blue eyes that sparkled like stars on a clear night. "And who might you be, young one?" he asked, his voice low and soothing as the gentle rustle of leaves.

Lily explained her quest, and Xu Durand nodded thoughtfully. "I may possess the knowledge you seek," he said, "but it comes at a price. Are you willing to pay it?"

As Lily hesitated, Xu Durand vanished into thin air, leaving behind only a wispy trail of smoke and the faintest hint of moonpetal's sweet fragrance.
