Xu Bernard was a master thief known for his unparalleled ability to blend into the shadows. Born Xuanming Chen, he had grown up on the streets of Shanghai, surviving by his wits and cunning. As he grew older, however, Xu Bernard's skills became too great for the city's underworld to ignore.

One night, while attempting to steal a priceless artifact from a high-end auction house, Xu Bernard caught the eye of the enigmatic Mrs. Li, a wealthy collector with an appreciation for rare artifacts. She offered him a deal: join her collection and help her acquire the world's most valuable treasures in exchange for immunity from prosecution.

Xu Bernard accepted, and soon found himself working under Mrs. Li's guidance. Together, they embarked on daring heists across the globe, Xu Bernard's reputation as a master thief spreading far and wide. His skills were unmatched; no security system could keep him out, and no treasure was too hidden for his expertise.

As time passed, however, Xu Bernard began to chafe against Mrs. Li's controlling nature. He longed for independence and the freedom to choose his own targets. But he knew that abandoning her would mean giving up his only means of living on the outside.

One night, when they set out to steal a valuable gemstone from a museum in Paris, Xu Bernard decided to take matters into his own hands. With Mrs. Li's unwitting cooperation, he carefully manipulated their mission to suit his own desires. And so, with the gemstone safely in hand, Xu Bernard made his escape.

As the news of his daring theft spread, Xu Bernard knew that his future was no longer tied to Mrs. Li's whims. He had taken the first step towards freedom and would continue to live by his own rules, always staying one step ahead of those who sought to bring him down. And so, Xu Bernard disappeared into the night, leaving behind a trail of intrigue and wonder.
