I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named "Xu Dupuis". Could you provide more context or details about who this character is and what kind of story you would like me to write? 

If not, I can suggest some possible directions for a story about a character with a similar name. For example, if Xu Dupuis is a French-Canadian character, I could explore the cultural heritage and traditions of Quebec in a fictional tale.

Please let me know how I can assist you further.
