I couldn't find any information on a person named Xu Rodriguez Garcia. Could you provide more context or clarify who this character is? 

However, I can generate a story for you:

Xu Rodriguez Garcia was an enigmatic figure known only to a select few in the small town of Tijuana. A master thief and con artist, he had a reputation for being able to talk his way out of any situation.

One night, Xu Rodriguez Garcia slipped into the mansion of wealthy businessman, Eduardo Moreno, with ease. He had been hired by a rival businessman to steal valuable documents that would give him an upper hand in their corporate struggle.

As Xu Rodriguez Garcia navigated through the maze of rooms and corridors, he found himself face-to-face with more obstacles than expected. He dodged security guards and crept past sleeping servants, all while maintaining his trademark calm demeanor.

Finally, he reached the study where the documents were kept. With lightning-fast speed, he snatched the files from the safe and began to make his escape. But just as he was about to leave, he heard a voice behind him - Eduardo Moreno himself.

"You're not going anywhere," Eduardo sneered, his eyes fixed on Xu Rodriguez Garcia's face.

Undaunted, Xu Rodriguez Garcia smiled sweetly at the wealthy businessman. "I think you'll find that I'm long gone, Mr. Moreno. You see, I have a prior engagement that can't be rescheduled."

With that, Xu Rodriguez Garcia turned and walked away, leaving Eduardo Moreno seething with anger. He knew that he had outsmarted the cunning thief once again.

As Xu Rodriguez Garcia disappeared into the night, his reputation as a master of disguise and deception grew. People whispered about his incredible skills in hushed tones, wondering how someone so elusive could manage to pull off such daring heists.

And yet, despite all the accolades, Xu Rodriguez Garcia remained shrouded in mystery. Few knew the truth behind his mask, and even fewer dared to try and uncover it. He was a ghost, invisible and unstoppable - a force to be reckoned with in the world of espionage and deception.
