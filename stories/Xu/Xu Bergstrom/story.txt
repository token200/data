Xu Bergstrom stepped off the train and onto the platform, her bright blue eyes scanning the bustling station. She had been traveling for hours, and was finally on her way to visit her estranged father in the small town of Willow Creek.

As a child, Xu Bergstrom had always felt like an outsider in her family. Her mother had left when she was just a baby, and her father had raised her on his own. But despite their strained relationship, Xu had always felt a deep connection to him. Now, at 25 years old, she had finally worked up the courage to reach out and invite herself for a visit.

As she made her way through the crowded station, Xu Bergstrom's thoughts turned to her father's latest antics. She had heard rumors that he was in trouble with the law, and was determined to get to the bottom of it. But despite her tough exterior, she couldn't help but feel a flutter in her chest at the thought of seeing him again.

After a short taxi ride, Xu Bergstrom arrived at her father's small cottage on the outskirts of town. The house was cluttered and messy, but there was a sense of warmth and welcome that greeted her as she stepped inside. Her father emerged from the kitchen, a look of surprise and then delight on his face.

"Xu!" he exclaimed, opening his arms for a hug. "It's so great to see you!"

Xu Bergstrom smiled, feeling a sense of relief wash over her. She had been worried that things would be awkward between them, but it seemed like they were going to get along just fine. As they sat down to a meal of homemade soup and bread, Xu's father began to tell her all about his latest escapades. She laughed and listened, feeling like she was finally home.

Over the next few days, Xu Bergstrom settled into her father's routine, learning how to make his famous pierogies and help him with his gardening. It wasn't always easy, but it felt right. And as they sat on the porch together, watching the sun set over the hills, Xu knew that she had found a sense of peace and belonging that she never thought possible.
