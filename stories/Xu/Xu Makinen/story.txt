Makinen Xu was a brilliant and reclusive scientist who had spent her entire career studying the mysteries of the universe. Born as Xu Makinen, she had always been drawn to the unknown, and her curiosity had led her to make groundbreaking discoveries that challenged conventional wisdom.

Years of tireless work had taken their toll on Makinen Xu's physical health, but her mind remained razor-sharp and focused. She was now in her twilight years, but her passion for discovery showed no signs of waning.
