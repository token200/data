Xu Jian was known throughout the streets of old Beijing as a man with a gift. He could listen to someone's troubles and, with just a few subtle changes to their speech patterns, make them forget their worries. It was an uncanny ability that had earned him both fame and suspicion.

As a child, Xu had always been fascinated by the human voice. He would spend hours watching his mother sing traditional opera, mesmerized by the way her throat vibrated with each note. But it wasn't until he stumbled upon an old, mysterious book of calligraphy in the family attic that his true talent was discovered.

The book contained strange symbols and markings that seemed to shift and change depending on how one viewed them. Intrigued, Xu began to study the book intensively, eventually learning that each symbol held a specific sonic resonance. With time and practice, he developed an uncanny ability to manipulate these sounds, allowing him to alter the way people spoke and even their memories.

One day, a wealthy merchant approached Xu with a proposition: in exchange for his silence on a dark family secret, the merchant would pay him handsomely. Xu agreed, but soon discovered that the merchant's intention was not entirely pure. The man had recently purchased a valuable artifact from an unknown seller, and suspected that it might be cursed.

As Xu continued to work with the merchant, he began to notice strange occurrences happening around them. People who had previously held grudges against each other would suddenly forgive one another, as if by some unseen force. But whenever someone tried to discuss their past grievances, their words seemed to get lost in translation.

It was then that Xu realized his gift came with a price: the more he used it, the less he could trust himself. The lines between truth and lies began to blur, and he started questioning whether his intentions were pure or if he had simply fallen prey to his own power.

In the end, Xu made a difficult decision: he refused to continue serving the merchant, choosing instead to use his gift for good. From that day forward, he traveled the countryside, helping those in need by altering their memories and soothing their wounds.

Though his methods remained shrouded in mystery, the people began to whisper about the benevolent stranger who seemed to hold the power of words within his grasp. And Xu Jian walked on, a quiet guardian of forgotten pasts and troubled souls.
