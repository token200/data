In the bustling streets of ancient Chang'an, a young man named Xu Ming (张明) walked with purpose, his eyes scanning the crowds with a sense of determination. Born into a family of modest means, Xu Ming had always been driven to succeed, determined to make a name for himself in this vast and unpredictable world.

As he made his way through the city's marketplaces, Xu Ming's thoughts turned to his father, who had fallen ill while they were on their way here from their rural village. His mother, Jia Nü (贾女), had been left to care for him and his younger sister alone, and Xu Ming felt the weight of responsibility settling heavily upon his shoulders.

Despite these challenges, Xu Ming was undaunted, his passion for learning burning brighter with each passing day. He spent every spare moment studying the classics, pouring over dusty scrolls in the city's great libraries and seeking out wise teachers to guide him on his journey.

One such teacher, a venerable scholar named Zuo Xing (周星), had taken Xu Ming under his wing, recognizing the potential that lay within the young man. Under Zuo Xing's tutelage, Xu Ming flourished, mastering the intricacies of Confucian philosophy and demonstrating a keen mind that rivaled even the greatest scholars of their time.

As the years passed, Xu Ming's reputation grew, and he became known throughout the city as a brilliant and ambitious young scholar. Though his path ahead was uncertain, one thing was clear: Xu Ming (张明) would not be content to simply follow in the footsteps of others – he had a vision for himself, and he would stop at nothing to achieve it.

And so, with Zuo Xing's blessing, Xu Ming set out into the world, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. His future was full of promise, and those who knew him could not help but feel a sense of pride in this young man, whose destiny seemed all but certain: Xu Ming (张明) would leave an indelible mark upon history.
