In the bustling streets of modern-day Beijing, a young and ambitious programmer named Xu Wenzhong (also known as Xu Wozniak for short) was making a name for himself in the tech world. Born with an insatiable curiosity and a passion for innovation, Xu Wenzhong had always been drawn to the world of coding.

As a child, he spent hours tinkering with old computers and learning how to program from online tutorials.
