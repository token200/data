Xu Aber was a name that struck fear into the hearts of those who knew him. A former assassin and mercenary, he had earned a reputation for being one of the most skilled fighters in the underworld. His full name, Xu Jianlong Aber, was whispered in hushed tones by those who dared to cross him.

Aber's past was shrouded in mystery, but it was known that he had been trained from a young age by the infamous Dragon's Fist clan. He had honed his skills on the streets of Shanghai, taking on jobs for various factions and organizations before finally striking out on his own.

One day, Aber received a message from an old acquaintance, requesting his presence at a high-stakes poker game in Macau. The stakes were high, with several powerful players vying for control of the city's underworld. Aber knew that this was an opportunity he couldn't pass up - after all, his full name was on the line.

As he arrived at the gaming hall, Aber was greeted by a familiar face: Wong Tai Leung, a fellow assassin and longtime rival. The two had a history, with Aber having foiled one of Wong's plans just months prior. Tonight, however, they would set aside their differences for the sake of the game.

The night wore on, with Aber taking down player after player with his characteristic precision. His skills were matched by none, and he emerged victorious as the last man standing. The prize: a small fortune in cash and valuable intel on the city's most powerful players.

Aber claimed his winnings, but knew that this was just the beginning. He had to report back to his employers, let them know that he was still in the game. As he left the gaming hall, Aber couldn't help but smile - after all, Xu Jianlong Aber was a name that commanded respect, and he intended to keep it that way.

With his pockets heavier and his reputation stronger, Aber disappeared into the night, ready to take on whatever lay ahead. His legend grew with each passing day, as whispers of his exploits spread throughout the underworld. And though some might say that Aber's skills were unmatched, others claimed that there was a reason why he chose to remain in the shadows - for in the world of espionage and assassination, loyalty could be the deadliest weapon of all.

For Xu Jianlong Aber, however, loyalty was just another word for "profit".
