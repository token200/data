I couldn't find any information on a character named Xu Allende. It is possible that this character does not exist or is not well-known. However, I can generate a story about a fictional character with the given name.

Xu Allende was a master calligrapher from ancient China, renowned for her breathtaking works of art that seemed to come alive on parchment. Her full name, Xu Ling Mei, reflected her refined upbringing and dedication to the traditional Chinese art form. As a child, she would spend hours watching her mother practice the intricate strokes of the brush, mesmerized by the way the ink danced across the page.

As she grew older, Xu Allende's fascination with calligraphy only deepened. She spent years honing her skills under the tutelage of some of the greatest masters in the land. Her dedication paid off when, at just 25 years old, she was commissioned to create a piece for the emperor himself. The task seemed daunting, but Xu Allende was undaunted, channeling all her energy into crafting a work of unparalleled beauty.

The resulting piece, "Flourishing Dragon," was a tour de force of movement and life. The dragon's body seemed to twist and turn, its scales glinting like jewels in the sunlight. The calligraphy was so fine that it appeared to be done by hand, as if the very brush had come alive.

The emperor was overjoyed with Xu Allende's work, praising her skill and artistry. News of her talent spread far and wide, earning her a reputation as one of the greatest calligraphers in Chinese history. As she grew older, Xu Ling Mei continued to push the boundaries of her craft, experimenting with new techniques and styles.

Throughout her life, Xu Allende remained humble and true to her art, always seeking to improve and innovate. Her legacy lived on long after her passing, inspiring generations of artists and calligraphers to follow in her footsteps. Even today, "Flourishing Dragon" is considered one of the greatest works of Chinese calligraphy, a testament to the enduring power of Xu Allende's skill and creativity.

Xu Ling Mei, now known by her familiar name Xu Allende, had truly earned her place among the immortals of art history. Her brushstrokes may have faded with time, but the beauty she created would continue to inspire and captivate for centuries to come.
