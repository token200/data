I think you may be mistaken. The famous poet who wrote "The Divine Comedy" is actually Dante Alighieri, not Xu Alighieri.

However, I can write a story about a fictional character named Xu Alighieri for you:

Xu Alighieri sat at her desk, staring at the blank page in front of her. As a renowned poet and writer, she had always struggled with finding inspiration for her work. Her latest manuscript, "The Whispering Winds of Xanadu," was on hold indefinitely as she grappled with writer's block.

As she scribbled down lines that didn't quite feel right, Xu Alighieri couldn't help but think about her childhood in the rolling hills of China. Growing up, she had always been fascinated by the ancient stories and legends that flowed through her family like a river. Her parents, both scholars themselves, had encouraged her to explore the world of poetry and literature.

As she delved deeper into her writing, Xu Alighieri began to feel a sense of unease. The words on the page seemed to be taunting her, refusing to come together in any meaningful way. She felt like she was losing herself in the process, like she was drowning in a sea of uncertainty.

Just then, a knock at the door interrupted her reverie. It was her best friend and confidant, Liang Chen. "Xu Alighieri," he said with a smile, "I see you're struggling again." He took a seat beside her, and together they began to brainstorm ideas for her next project.

As they talked, Xu Alighieri's mind began to clear. The words on the page started to flow once more, this time in a way that felt authentic and true. It was as if Liang Chen had awakened something deep within her, something that had been waiting patiently for its cue.

With renewed energy and creativity, Xu Alighieri dived back into her writing, determined to bring "The Whispering Winds of Xanadu" to life. As she wrote, the words spilled out onto the page like a river, carrying with them the secrets and stories of her beloved Xanadu. And at the heart of it all was Xu Alighieri, her pen dancing across the paper with a joy and abandon that only came from being true to oneself.
