Alessia Morel stepped into the old antique shop, her eyes scanning the cluttered space with a practiced air. She had been searching for this particular vase for months, and finally, it was nestled between two dusty vases on a high shelf.

The owner of the shop, an elderly man named Monsieur Dupont, looked up from behind the counter. "Ah, mademoiselle! Welcome back. I see you're after that rare piece again."

Alessia smiled, her dark hair tied back in a ponytail. She had been working with Monsieur Dupont for years, sourcing unique items for his collection and occasionally selling them to wealthy clients.

She carefully made her way up to the shelf, running her fingers over the vase's intricate design. It was an 18th-century piece, crafted by one of the most renowned artists of the time.

As she reached out to touch it, Monsieur Dupont spoke up again. "Be careful, mademoiselle. That vase is extremely valuable. I'd hate for it to get damaged."

Alessia nodded, her eyes still fixed on the vase. She had a reputation for being meticulous, and it showed in her work. She carefully lifted the vase off the shelf, feeling its weight in her hands.

As she turned to hand it back to Monsieur Dupont, her phone buzzed with an incoming text message. It was from her brother, Leonardo, asking her to meet him at the caf√© down the street. Something had come up, and he needed her help.

Alessia hesitated for a moment before tucking her phone away. She couldn't afford to get sidetracked now. The vase's value depended on its condition, and she had promised Monsieur Dupont that it would be delivered to his gallery by the end of the week.

With a final glance at the vase, Alessia handed it back to Monsieur Dupont and left the shop, feeling a sense of satisfaction wash over her. She was good at her job, and the rare vase would surely fetch a handsome price at auction.

As she walked down the street, her mind turned to Leonardo and whatever problem he had gotten himself into. She quickened her pace, anxious to find out what her brother needed help with. The mysterious text message had sparked her curiosity, and she couldn't wait to get to the bottom of it.
