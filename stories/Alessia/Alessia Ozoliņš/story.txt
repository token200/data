Alessia Ozoliņš stepped into the dimly lit coffee shop, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She had been searching for weeks, and finally, she had received a tip that her long-lost cousin, Elara, would be in attendance at this very gathering.

As she waited by the bar, Alessia's mind wandered back to her childhood in Riga, Latvia. Growing up with her large family, she had always felt like an outsider among her relatives. Her parents had been separated when she was young, and her father had left them little information about his life after she turned 18.

Alessia took a sip of her coffee and spotted Elara across the room, sipping on a latte with her friend, Jānis. The two women locked eyes for a brief moment before Alessia made her way over to them.

"Elara! Oh my god, it's been ages!" Alessia exclaimed, rushing towards her cousin with open arms.

The two women shared a warm hug, exchanging stories and catching up on lost time. Elara told Alessia about her life in Riga, working as an architect and raising a family of her own. Alessia shared tales of her adventures abroad, working as a freelance writer and traveling the world.

As they chatted, Jānis listened attentively from across the table, his eyes filled with curiosity. Elara leaned over to him, whispering something in his ear that made him chuckle.

After an hour or so of chatting, Alessia pulled out her phone and showed Elara a few old family photos she had found online. The two cousins giggled at memories of their childhood summers spent playing on the beaches of Riga's Kurzeme region.

As they parted ways, promising to stay in touch, Alessia felt a sense of belonging wash over her. For the first time in years, she felt like she was finally finding her place among her own family.
