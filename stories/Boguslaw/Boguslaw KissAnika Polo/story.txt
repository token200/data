Boguslaw KissAnika Polo was an enigmatic figure, known only to a select few in the art world. A Polish-Bulgarian artist, he had built a reputation for his provocative and thought-provoking works, which often blurred the lines between reality and fantasy.

One art collector, Anna, had been fascinated by Boguslaw's work for years.
