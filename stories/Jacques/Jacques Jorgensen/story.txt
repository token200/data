It was on a drizzly evening in late October that Jacques received a call from an unknown number. "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight," a low, gravelly voice said before hanging up. Intrigued, Jacques made his way to the abandoned structure, his eyes scanning the darkness for any sign of danger.

As he approached the entrance, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was a young woman, her hair disheveled and her eyes sunken with fear. "My sister's gone missing," she said, her voice trembling. "The police won't help me, but I know you can find out what's happened to her."

Jacques' instincts told him that this was more than just a simple kidnapping case. He took the woman's contact information and promised to do everything in his power to find her sister. Over the next few days, Jacques delved deep into the case, following a trail of cryptic clues and hidden leads.
