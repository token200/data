Jacques Rossi was a man of mystery, with a past shrouded in secrecy. He walked into the dimly lit café on the outskirts of town, his piercing green eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. His rugged features and sharp jawline made him look like a man who'd rather be somewhere else, but there was something about him that commanded attention.

As he slid onto a stool at the bar, the bartender, a gruff old man with a thick French accent, raised an eyebrow. "The usual, Jacques?"

Jacques nodded, and the bartender expertly mixed his drink, adding a splash of absinthe for good measure. The smell of the potent liquor wafted up to Jacques's nostrils, and he closed his eyes, savoring the taste.

Just as he was about to take a sip, the door swung open and a young woman walked in, her bright pink hair standing out like a beacon in the sea of drab uniforms. She was a waitress, or at least she would be if she wasn't carrying a gun and looking like she meant business.

Jacques watched with interest as she scanned the room, her eyes lingering on him for a fraction of a second before moving on. He recognized the look - it was the same one he'd seen in the mirror every morning for years. The look of someone who knew they were living on borrowed time.

The waitress approached Jacques's table, and he raised an eyebrow at the sight of her gun holstered at her hip. "What can I get you, sweetheart?" she asked, her voice husky and confident.

Jacques smiled, his eyes glinting with amusement. "Just a glass of wine, please," he said, his French accent dripping like honey on his tongue. The waitress's eyes narrowed slightly, but she poured him a glass without another word.

As Jacques sipped his wine, the waitress leaned in close, her voice barely above a whisper. "You're looking for something, aren't you?" she asked, her eyes locked on his.

Jacques raised an eyebrow, intrigued by her directness. "Maybe," he said, his tone neutral.

The waitress nodded once before disappearing into the back room, leaving Jacques to wonder if he'd just imagined the whole exchange. But as he gazed around the café, he felt a sense of unease settle over him. He knew that this woman was trouble, and he was more than happy to take on whatever came his way.

For a man like Jacques Rossi, danger was always just around the corner, but he wouldn't have it any other way.
