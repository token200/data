One day, Jacques received an invitation to participate in the annual "Hot Dog Eating Championship" in New York City. The event was being held at Coney Island's famous Nathan's Famous restaurant, and Jacques couldn't resist the opportunity to take on the best of the best.

As he stepped onto the stage, Jacques' opponent, Joey Chestnut, looked on with a mixture of amusement and intimidation. "You think you can take me down, Korhonen?" Joey said, his voice dripping with confidence.

Jacques grinned, his eyes sparkling with mischief. "I'm looking forward to it, my friend."
