Jacques Koval, a man in his mid-30s with an unruly mop of dark hair and a mischievous glint in his eye, walked into the small café on the corner of Main Street. He was a familiar face to the owner, Madame Dupont, who always saved him a seat by the window.

As he waited for his usual cappuccino, Jacques noticed a group of tourists gathered at the next table, eagerly flipping through their guidebooks. He recognized them as the same group that had been following him around town for the past few days, trying to piece together his mysterious identity.

Jacques chuckled to himself, knowing it was futile. No one could ever figure out who he truly was – just another face in the crowd, a ghostly presence haunting the city's streets. And he liked it that way.

Madame Dupont arrived with Jacques' coffee and set it down in front of him. "The usual, monsieur?" she asked, raising an eyebrow at the group of tourists still lingering by his table.

"Oui," Jacques replied, taking a sip of his coffee and watching as they continued to snoop around the café.

One of them, a young woman with bright pink hair, finally worked up the courage to approach him. "Excuse me, sir," she said, her voice hesitant. "We're from the travel magazine. We were wondering if you could tell us a bit about... um... your life."

Jacques raised an eyebrow and set his coffee down. "I think not," he said with a grin.

Madame Dupont intervened, ushering them away with a warm smile. "I'm afraid we don't serve travelers here, mes amis. Maybe you should try somewhere else?"

As the group dispersed, Jacques leaned back in his chair and watched as they disappeared into the crowd. He took another sip of his coffee, feeling content in his anonymity.

It was a feeling he savored deeply – being just another face in the sea of humanity. And for Jacques Koval, that was exactly where he wanted to be.
