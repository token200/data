Jacques Kovalenko stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the drizzly streets of Paris. He had been away for months, chasing leads on a case that had consumed him since he was a young detective in Moscow.

As a member of the elite Russian FSB, Jacques had been tasked with tracking down a rogue agent who had infiltrated the French intelligence community. The trail had led him from the streets of Berlin to the cafes of Montmartre, where he finally received a cryptic message that brought him back to Paris.

Now, as he made his way through the rain-soaked streets, Jacques felt a sense of unease settle over him. He had been warned about the danger lurking in every alleyway and corner, but he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.

He ducked into a small bistro on Rue des Abbesses, where he knew his contact would be waiting for him. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of stale bread and cigarette smoke. Jacques spotted his contact, a frail old man named Leon, huddled in the corner by the fireplace.

Leon nodded curtly as Jacques approached, his eyes sunken from years of neglect. "Jacques, I see you're here," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "I have information about your agent."

Jacques leaned in close, his eyes scanning the crowded room for any signs of danger. "What is it?" he asked, his voice low and urgent.

Leon hesitated before speaking, his words tumbling out in a rush. "It's a woman," he said. "She has a small tattoo on her wrist – a serpent eating its own tail."

Jacques' mind went blank for a moment, but then the pieces fell into place. He had seen the symbol once before, etched into the wall of an abandoned warehouse in Moscow. His heart racing, Jacques knew that he was closing in on his quarry.

With a nod, he thanked Leon and made his way back out onto the rain-soaked streets, his eyes scanning the crowds for any sign of his elusive target. The game was far from over, but Jacques felt a sense of determination wash over him – he would catch her, no matter what it took.
