Jacques Altmann sat in his cluttered office, surrounded by stacks of dusty papers and yellowing documents. The once-notorious financier had long since retired from his illustrious career, but his reputation still lingered, a constant reminder of the high-stakes world he had once inhabited.

As he sifted through the pages of old business deals, Jacques' mind wandered back to the glory days. He had built his empire from scratch, leveraging his charm and wit to outmaneuver even the toughest opponents. The 80s and 90s had been a wild ride for him – a time when he was at the helm of a lucrative media conglomerate, making fortune after fortune on Wall Street.

But that was before it all came crashing down. Jacques' hubris and recklessness had led to some disastrous decisions, culminating in a spectacular collapse of his empire. The headlines had been merciless: "Altmann's Downfall: How One Man Broke the System."

Despite the wreckage left behind, Jacques had never lost sight of his ambitions. He continued to operate on the fringes of finance, always keeping a finger on the pulse of market trends and exploiting loopholes to make a profit.

As he delved deeper into the archives, a handwritten note caught his eye. It was an invitation from a former protégé, who had gone on to achieve great success in her own right. The message read: "Meet me at Le Coeur de la Vie tomorrow night at midnight. Come alone."

Jacques' instincts told him this might be the opportunity he had been waiting for – a chance to revive his flagging fortunes and leave his reputation in the dust once more. He agreed, and spent the next few hours perfecting his outfit.

That night, Jacques arrived at Le Coeur de la Vie feeling like a man on a mission. His former protégé was nowhere to be seen, however – instead, he found himself face-to-face with an enigmatic stranger who introduced herself only as "La Belle Époque".

She presented Jacques with an offer: a lucrative investment opportunity in a fledgling tech startup. The stakes were high, but the reward potential was astronomical.

For the first time in years, Jacques felt his pulse quicken with excitement. Was this the ticket to redemption he had been searching for? Only one way to find out – by taking a leap of faith and diving headfirst into the unknown.

With La Belle Époque watching from across the table, Jacques made his decision: "Deal."

And so, the wheel of fortune began to turn once more.
