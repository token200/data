Jacques Kortajarena, a French-Australian fashion model and television presenter, was known for his striking features and charisma on the catwalk. Born to a French father and Australian mother, Jacques' mixed heritage had a profound impact on his unique style.

Growing up in Melbourne, Australia, Jacques began modeling at a young age, gracing the covers of various Australian magazines and walking the runways of local fashion shows.

As Jacques' career soared, so did his popularity. He became a household name in Australia, appearing on numerous television shows and hosting various events. But despite the spotlight's glare, Jacques remained grounded, crediting his upbringing to his parents for instilling in him a strong sense of self-discipline and humility.

When asked about his journey to stardom, Jacques humbly acknowledged the support of his family and friends, saying, "My mother used to tell me, 'Jacques, you are more than just your physical appearance.' She reminded me that true beauty comes from within." This wise advice stuck with him throughout his career, as he navigated the ever-changing landscape of the fashion industry.

As Jacques continued to walk the red carpet and strut down runways, he remained committed to using his platform to promote positive change. He became an advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, using his influence to raise awareness about important issues affecting the community.
