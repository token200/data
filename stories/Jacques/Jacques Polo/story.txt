A skilled artist and inventor, Jacques' talents had earned him a place among the city's elite. But there was more to this enigmatic figure than met the eye.

Rumors swirled about Jacques' past, whispers of a life lived in the shadows. Some claimed he was once a spy, using his wit and cunning to gather intel for a powerful organization.
