Balint Sten, a skilled and deadly operative, stood in the shadows, his eyes fixed on the high-rise office building across the street. His mission was to extract a valuable piece of intel from the CEO's safe, and he had been watching the target for weeks.

As he waited, Balint's mind wandered back to his past. He had grown up on the streets of Budapest, surviving by any means necessary. But it wasn't until he joined the Hungarian Intelligence Service that he found his true calling as a spy. For years, he worked tirelessly to gather information and complete missions, earning him a reputation as one of the most feared operatives in the business.

Now, as he stood outside the CEO's office, Balint felt a sense of unease. He had been hired by a rival agency to steal the intel, but something about the mission didn't feel right. The pay was too good, and the target seemed too easy. Balint's instincts were screaming at him to back out, but his contract was signed and sealed.

With a deep breath, Balint entered the building and made his way to the CEO's office. He picked the lock with ease and slipped inside, his eyes scanning the room for any signs of danger. That's when he saw her - a young receptionist, sitting nervously at her desk.

"Can I help you?" she asked, looking up at Balint with wide eyes.

"I'm here to see Mr. Jenkins," Balint replied, trying to sound confident. The receptionist nodded and stood up, leading him to the CEO's office.

As they approached the safe, Balint felt his heart racing. This was it - the moment of truth. He quickly opened the safe and retrieved the intel, feeling a rush of excitement as he did so.

But just as he turned to leave, the receptionist spoke up again. "I think I should warn you, Mr... um... Sten?"

Balint's eyes narrowed. "What is it?" he asked, his voice low and menacing.

The receptionist hesitated before speaking. "I think someone else is in the building. With a gun."
