Balint Eben listened attentively to their queries, his face expressionless but his eyes glinting with amusement. He knew he was building anticipation, creating an aura of expectation around himself that would soon be shattered.

And then, without warning, he stood up and strode out of the bar, leaving behind a stunned audience and a legend in waiting. For Balint Eben was no ordinary man – only time would reveal the extent of his strength, but one thing was certain: those who crossed him would never forget it.
