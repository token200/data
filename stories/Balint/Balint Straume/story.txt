Balint Straume stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. As he walked through the quiet streets of Ravensburg, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. A sense of unease had been following him for weeks, ever since he'd received that mysterious letter.

Balint Straume, a renowned detective with the Amsterdam Police Department, had always prided himself on his sharp instincts and keen mind. But this latest case had him stumped. The letter, which had arrived at his office in plain black envelopes without any return address or indication of how it got there, contained only two words: "Run now."

Confused but intrigued, Balint Straume had decided to follow the trail. He'd traveled to Ravensburg, a small town on the outskirts of Germany, hoping to find some answers. But so far, he'd found nothing but dead ends and empty streets.

As he walked through the quiet streets, Balint Straume noticed something peculiar - a series of identical photographs plastered on the walls of every shop window. He couldn't make out what they were of, but there was something hauntingly familiar about them.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows. A young woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair approached him, her gaze locked onto his. "Can I help you?" she asked, her voice husky and confident.

Balint Straume's instincts kicked in, and he sensed that this was no ordinary stranger. He flashed his badge, and the woman's eyes widened in surprise. "You're Balint Straume," she breathed, as if speaking to a legend. "I've heard of you."

Without hesitation, she handed him another photograph - one of herself, standing beside an abandoned lighthouse on the coast of Ravensburg. "This is where I was found," she explained, her voice trembling. "The letter came from here. And I think I know what it means."

Balint Straume's eyes narrowed as he studied the photograph. This could be the break he needed to unravel the mystery. He turned back to the woman and smiled grimly. "Let's find out."
