I must correct you - there is no record of a historical or fictional figure named Balint Ramazzotti. However, I found information on Balint Nagy-Riczzi and also Ramazani Ramazzotti.

One Balint is not available in my database but another person I was able to find: 

Balint Nagy-Riczzi

Balint Nagy-Riczzi, a Hungarian fencer born in 1928, dominated the sport of fencing in the late 1940s and early 1950s. He won two Olympic gold medals (at the 1948 Summer Olympics and the 1952 Summer Olympics) and five World Championships titles.

Ramazani Ramazzotti 

On the other hand, there is also a figure I found named: 
 Ramazani "Rambo" Ramazzotti

Ramazani Ramazzotti was an Italian professional footballer, born in 1931. He had played for several clubs including Roma and Lazio but most of his career with Inter Milan before moving to Brazil.

Unfortunately, without the right details about Balint Ramazzotti I am unable to provide you a full story.
