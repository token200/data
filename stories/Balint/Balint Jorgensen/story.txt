Balint Jorgensen stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit bar, shaking the water from his coat. A former soldier, he had seen his fair share of battles, but nothing could have prepared him for the horrors of war that haunted his dreams.

As he made his way to the counter, a gruff voice greeted him, "What can I get you, Balint?" The bartender, a grizzled old veteran himself, knew better than to ask about his past. Balint had built walls around himself, and only a handful of people dared to breach them.

He ordered a whiskey and took a seat at the end of the bar, surveying the room with a mix of curiosity and suspicion. The patrons were a rough bunch, but there was something about this place that drew him in. Perhaps it was the anonymity, or maybe it was the sense of belonging he'd never found elsewhere.

As he nursed his drink, Balint's thoughts drifted to his childhood, growing up on the streets of Copenhagen with a single mother who worked multiple jobs to make ends meet. He had always been fascinated by stories of war, devouring books and watching documentaries as soon as he could get them. It was only natural that he'd follow in his father's footsteps when he enlisted.

The memories came flooding back, each one a fresh wound. The screams of the wounded, the stench of death, the weight of responsibility on his shoulders. He pushed the thoughts away, focusing on the present.

As the night wore on, Balint found himself drawn into conversations with strangers-turned-friends. They spoke of their own struggles, their own demons, and for a brief moment, he felt seen. Not by them, exactly â€“ but perhaps by himself.

He finished his drink, tossing a few coins onto the counter as he stood to leave. The bartender nodded in understanding, "Take care, Balint." For once, he didn't feel the need to add, "Of yourself."
