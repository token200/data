Balint Rivera walked into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of life. It was late on a Wednesday evening, and the only patrons were the usual late-night owls and lost souls. He spotted an empty table by the window and made his way towards it.

As he sat down, the waitress approached him with a hesitant smile. "Can I get you something to drink?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Balint Rivera nodded, his eyes never leaving the street outside. "Just a black coffee, please."

The waitress nodded and retreated back into the kitchen, leaving Balint to sit in silence. He pulled out his phone and scrolled through his contacts, searching for a name that wasn't there. Not again. He had tried calling every friend, family member, and acquaintance, but no one had answered.

As he sat there, lost in thought, a figure emerged from the shadows across the room. It was an old woman with piercing green eyes and a wild tangle of grey hair. She glided over to Balint's table, her movements eerily silent.

"Balint Rivera," she said, her voice dripping with familiarity. "I see you're still wandering the streets at night."

Balint's eyes narrowed, his instincts on high alert. Who was this woman? And how did she know his name?

The old woman chuckled, a dry, mirthless sound. "Don't bother trying to deny it," she said. "We all know who you are, Balint Rivera. You're a ghost, a shadow of your former self."

Balint felt a surge of defensiveness, but something about the old woman's words struck a chord within him. Maybe it was the truth in her statement – that he had indeed lost himself in the darkness.

The waitress returned with his coffee, and Balint took a sip, feeling the bitter taste wash over him. He looked up at the old woman, who nodded in approval. "You need to wake up, Balint Rivera," she said. "It's time to face your demons."

And with that, she turned and vanished into the night, leaving Balint alone with his thoughts.
