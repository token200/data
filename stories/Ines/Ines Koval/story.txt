Ines Koval stepped out of the rain-soaked streets and into the dimly lit café, shaking the water off her trench coat. She had just received a cryptic message from her brother, Leon, who was rumored to be involved in some shady dealings on the wrong side of the city.

As she waited for Leon at the small table by the window, Ines sipped on a cup of black coffee and surveyed the crowd. The café was a hub for the city's underworld, filled with unsavory characters and whispered secrets.

Leon burst through the door, his eyes scanning the room before locking onto Ines' familiar profile. He slid into the seat across from her, his movements economical and practiced.

"Ines, I've got a problem," he said, lowering his voice. "Someone's been watching me, following my every move."

Ines raised an eyebrow. "Who?"

Leon hesitated, glancing around the café nervously before leaning in closer. "I don't know, but I think it's connected to the job I took on a few weeks ago."

Ines' instincts told her that Leon was holding back. She leaned in, her eyes locked on his. "Tell me more."

Leon sighed and began to explain, telling Ines about the mysterious client who had hired him to retrieve a package from an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. The job seemed simple enough – just drop off the package at a designated location – but Leon had sensed something wasn't right.

As he spoke, Ines' mind began to spin with possibilities. Who was behind this? And what did they want with Leon?

Suddenly, the café's door swung open and a young woman slipped inside, her eyes scanning the room before locking onto Leon. She smiled sweetly, but Ines saw something in her eyes that made her blood run cold.

"Looks like your stalker has arrived," Ines said, pushing her chair back from the table.

Leon followed her gaze, his expression darkening. "It's her."

The woman slid into the seat beside him, a faint scent of perfume lingering in the air. Ines watched as Leon stood up, towering over her with an air of quiet menace.

"I think it's time for you to leave," he said, his voice low and deadly.

As the woman hesitated, Ines knew that she was about to find out what happened when you crossed people like Leon Koval. With a flick of her wrist, she motioned to the door, urging him to make his move.

Leon followed her lead, pushing the woman across the table until she stumbled backwards onto her seat. The café erupted into chaos as patrons scrambled for cover, and Ines stepped forward, ready to face whatever came next in Leon's battle against those who sought to harm him.
