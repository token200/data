Ines Wei stared at her reflection in the mirror, her piercing green eyes narrowed in frustration. She was supposed to be preparing for the biggest meeting of her career, but all she could think about was the argument she had with her sister earlier that morning.

As a rising star in the tech world, Ines had always been driven by her desire to prove herself. She was smart, talented, and hardworking, but it seemed like no matter how far she climbed, she couldn't shake off the shadow of her more successful sibling. Her sister, Lena, was the one who had started their family's tech company from scratch, and Ines had always felt like she lived in her shadow.

But that all changed when Lena passed away suddenly last year. The company was left to Ines, who was determined to carry on her legacy. And so, here she stood, about to pitch her latest innovative product to the biggest investors in the world.

Ines took a deep breath and straightened her shoulders, smoothing out her sleek black dress. She was ready for this. She had spent months preparing, pouring over every detail of her presentation. This was it – her chance to prove herself as a leader in the tech industry.

As she made her way to the conference room, Ines couldn't help but feel a sense of nervous energy. What if she bombed? What if they didn't like her product? She pushed those thoughts aside and focused on the task at hand. This was her moment.

The presentation went smoothly, with Ines confidently outlining the benefits of her new technology. The room fell silent as she finished speaking, and then erupted into applause. Ines beamed with pride – she had done it. She had nailed the pitch.

But just as she was about to breathe a sigh of relief, Ines's phone buzzed in her pocket. It was an unknown number, and all it said was "You'll never make it without me". Ines felt a shiver run down her spine – what did this message mean? Was it from someone who knew more about Lena's company than they were letting on?

Ines took a deep breath and tried to shake off the feeling of unease. She had worked too hard to let some mysterious message bring her down. But as she left the conference room, she couldn't help but wonder – was she truly ready for this?
