Ines Jankowska stepped into the crowded caf√©, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him across the way, his dark hair messy and his eyes fixed on his laptop screen. It had been months since they'd last seen each other, but she could still recall the spark that flew between them like electricity.

As she made her way through the throng of people, Ines couldn't help but feel a flutter in her chest. She had been drawn to Max, the charismatic entrepreneur with a quick wit and a sharp mind, from the moment they'd met at an art gallery opening. Their conversation had flowed effortlessly, touching on everything from their shared love of poetry to their opposing views on politics.

But life had other plans. Max had left for a new city a few weeks later, chasing his dreams and leaving Ines to pick up the pieces of her own shattered heart. She'd tried to move on, throwing herself into work and art, but a part of her still yearned for that connection with Max.

As she approached him, he looked up from his screen, their eyes locking in a way that made Ines's pulse skip a beat. "Ines," he said, a smile spreading across his face. "It's been too long."

They hugged, the tension between them dissipating as they stepped away to grab a table by the window. The conversation flowed easily, like no time had passed at all. They talked about everything and nothing, their words spilling out in a joyful jumble.

Ines couldn't help but feel a sense of peace with Max, like being around him was the most natural thing in the world. She knew that she'd always been drawn to his confident exterior, but now she saw glimpses of the vulnerable person beneath.

As they finished their coffee and prepared to part ways once more, Ines felt a pang of uncertainty. Had this reunion rekindled the flame between them, or was it just a momentary lapse? She looked into Max's eyes, searching for answers. What did he see there?
