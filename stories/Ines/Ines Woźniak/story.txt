I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Ines Woźniak. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created for a specific story or context.

If you'd like, I can try to create a new character profile and write a short story about them. Alternatively, if you have more information about Ines Woźniak, such as their personality, backstory, or any notable traits, I may be able to help you write a story based on that.

Please let me know which option you prefer, and I'll do my best to assist you.

(If you're interested in creating a character profile, I can provide some general guidance on how to develop a fictional character. Just let me know!)
