Ines Balodis sat alone in her small apartment, staring blankly at the wall as tears streamed down her face. It had been three months since she'd lost her job as a graphic designer, and the rejection letter still lingered in her mind like an open wound.

She thought back to all the late nights spent working on projects, the early mornings spent sipping coffee and brainstorming ideas. She'd poured her heart and soul into every design, every layout, every color scheme. And for what? So she could be replaced by some newer, flashier talent?

Ines sighed, running a hand through her long, curly brown hair. She was 32 years old, and it felt like she was hitting rock bottom. Her savings were dwindling, and her family was starting to get anxious about her future.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was her best friend, Rachel, who'd stopped by for a visit. Ines had been too depressed to cook dinner, so Rachel had brought over some leftovers from her own apartment.

"Hey, girl, I know things are tough right now," Rachel said, setting down a plate of pasta and meatballs on the coffee table. "But you're going to get through this. You always do."

Ines forced a smile, feeling a lump form in her throat. She knew Rachel was trying to be supportive, but it wasn't easy being around someone who'd never struggled like she had.

Over dinner, Ines poured out her story – all the rejection letters, the disappointment, the feelings of inadequacy that plagued her every waking moment. Rachel listened attentively, nodding and making supportive noises as Ines spoke.

When they finished eating, Rachel pulled out her phone and started scrolling through job listings on LinkedIn. "Hey, have you looked into this design firm yet?" she asked, pointing to a listing for a junior designer position.

Ines hesitated, feeling a spark of hope ignite within her chest. Could it be? Was it possible that after all this time, she was going to find something new and exciting?

Rachel handed her phone, urging Ines to take a look. As she scrolled through the job description, Ines's heart began to beat faster. Maybe, just maybe, things were about to turn around for Ines Balodis – at least, that's what she told herself as she took a deep breath and hit send on her application.
