Ines Fliesbach stood at the edge of the old wooden pier, her eyes scanning the murky waters of the lake below. The sun had long since set, casting a golden glow over the serene landscape. She breathed in deeply, feeling the crisp air fill her lungs, and closed her eyes.

As she listened to the distant calls of birds and the gentle lapping of the water against the shore, Ines felt at peace. It was moments like these that reminded her why she came back to this place every summer. The isolation and solitude allowed her to escape the chaos of her life in Berlin.

Ines opened her eyes, taking in the familiar sight of the old cabin behind her. She had spent countless summers here with her grandmother, learning the art of traditional German baking from a young age. Her hands itched to get started on tonight's recipe: apple strudel.

As she made her way back to the cabin, Ines noticed a figure watching her from across the water. He was tall and lean, with dark hair that fell across his forehead in messy locks. She felt a flutter in her chest as he caught her eye and smiled. It had been years since she'd seen him – what was his name again?

Ines took a deep breath and walked down to the dock, where the stranger was waiting for her. "Axel?" she ventured hesitantly.

Axel's smile widened. "Jawohl," he replied, his eyes crinkling at the corners. They stood there for a moment, the only sound the water lapping against the shore.

As they walked towards the cabin together, Ines realized that Axel had come back to help her with the summer baking. Her grandmother had passed away a year ago, leaving Ines in charge of the family recipes and traditions. It was more than just a job – it was a responsibility she took seriously.

The night air was filled with the sweet scent of fresh bread as they worked together, their hands moving in tandem as they mixed and rolled out the dough. Ines felt a sense of comfort and belonging that she hadn't experienced in years. Maybe this summer would be different after all.

As the stars began to twinkle overhead, Ines and Axel finished the strudel and sat down at a small table on the porch, slicing into the warm pastry and savoring the flaky crust and sweet apples within. They ate in silence, enjoying each other's company as the world outside seemed to slow down around them.

In that moment, Ines knew she had made the right decision in returning to this place, surrounded by memories and traditions that brought her joy and peace.
