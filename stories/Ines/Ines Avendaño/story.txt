Ines Avendaño stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It had been years since she'd returned to her hometown of Puerto Peñasco, and yet the familiar scent of saltwater and sunscreen still lingered in her nostrils.

As she made her way through the deserted streets, Ines Avendaño couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her. She'd grown up in this tiny coastal town, playing in the waves and exploring the rocky tide pools. But life had taken her elsewhere – to the city, to college, to a career that had eventually led her back to Puerto Peñasco.

Ines Avendaño's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of seagulls overhead. She smiled wistfully as she watched them soar above the rooftops, their cries carrying on the breeze. She'd always loved this part of town – the beachside restaurants and shops that seemed frozen in time, like a nostalgic postcard from another era.

As she walked, Ines Avendaño noticed a figure standing outside her family's old adobe house. It was her abuela, Maria, who had moved back to Puerto Peñasco after years of living in the city. The two women embraced warmly, Ines Avendaño burying her face in Maria's warm cheek as they shared a long, tender hug.

Over coffee and tortillas, Ines Avendaño filled Abuela Maria in on her life – her job as a freelance writer, her travels to Europe, her struggles with anxiety. Maria listened intently, offering words of encouragement and advice, her eyes twinkling with wisdom.

As the sun began to set over the Gulf, casting a golden glow over the town, Ines Avendaño felt a sense of peace settle over her. She knew that she'd found her way back home, if only for a little while. And as she walked along the beach with Abuela Maria, feeling the sand between their toes and the breeze in their hair, she knew that this was where she belonged – in Puerto Peñasco, among the people and places she loved most.

As they sat on the beach, watching the stars come out one by one, Ines Avendaño turned to her abuela with a smile. "Gracias, Abuela," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I'm home."
