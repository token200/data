Years went by, and Ines's fame spread, drawing in admirers from across Europe. Yet, she remained a mystery, a ghostly figure haunting the fringes of society. Some said she was still alive, others that she had vanished into thin air.

One thing is certain: Ines D'Annunzio left an indelible mark on the world – a testament to her unwavering commitment to artistic freedom and unbridled expression. Her legacy lives on, a whispered promise of rebellion and nonconformity that continues to inspire generations of artists and outcasts alike.
