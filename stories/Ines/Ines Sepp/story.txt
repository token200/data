Inés Sepp stood alone at the edge of the frozen lake, her eyes fixed on the darkness beyond. It was as if she was staring into the soul of the winter itself, a silence that swallowed all sound and left only the faintest whisper of wind.

She had been drawn to this place for years, searching for answers that eluded her like a ghost. Her father's disappearance when she was just a child still lingered in her thoughts, a hollow ache that refused to heal. And now, as an old woman with silver hair and eyes that seemed to hold the weight of a thousand secrets, she had come back to this lake one last time.

The snowflakes fell around her like tears, each one unique and fleeting, just like life itself. She remembered her father's stories about the ice witches who once roamed these lands, their powers as fierce as the winter storms that ravaged the landscape. He said they were ancient and wise, but also fiercely independent, refusing to be bound by the rules of others.

Inés had always been fascinated by the idea of freedom, the desire to break free from the constraints that society placed on her. She remembered the thrill of her father's stories, of the power that lay within every person to shape their own destiny. And as she gazed out at the lake, she felt a spark within her stir.

Without thinking, Inés began to walk across the frozen surface, her feet leaving small prints in the snow. The air seemed to vibrate with an otherworldly energy, as if the very fabric of reality was about to unravel. She closed her eyes and let the silence wash over her, feeling the weightlessness of the world.

In a burst of clarity, Inés remembered the words of an old poem her father had recited when she was a child: "The ice witch's heart beats within your own." Suddenly, it all made sense – not just the stories, but the journey itself. The freedom that had eluded her for so long lay not in escaping the world, but in embracing its wildness.

As she walked, Inés felt the power of the ice witches course through her veins, their ancient wisdom merging with her own heartbeats. And when she finally reached the other side of the lake, she knew that she would never be alone again – for she had discovered a part of herself that was both fierce and free, waiting to set its own path in the world.
