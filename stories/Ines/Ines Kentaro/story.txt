Ines Kentaro was a name whispered among those who knew her, a woman shrouded in mystery and intrigue. Her past was a puzzle, with pieces scattered across the globe, waiting to be pieced together. Some said she was a former spy, while others claimed she was a skilled thief.

All that was certain was her presence at the luxurious Bellvue Manor, where the crème de la crème of society had gathered for the annual charity gala. Ines, resplendent in a black gown that hugged her curves like a second skin, navigated the crowds with ease, her eyes scanning the room as if searching for something – or someone.

As she wove through the throngs, a flash of recognition caught her attention. A tall, imposing figure stood by the bar, his piercing blue eyes locking onto hers with an unmistakable intensity. Kael, her former partner in crime, had somehow tracked her down.

Ines's gaze lingered on Kael for a moment before she turned away, disappearing into the sea of faces. But the encounter left a faint tremble in her fingers as she accepted a champagne glass from a waiter. The evening was young, and Ines knew that tonight would be anything but dull.

As the night wore on, whispers spread about the mysterious guest who had been spotted near the manor's security systems. Some said it was Ines, using her skills to pilfer valuables from under the noses of their hosts. Others claimed it was Kael, seeking revenge for some past betrayal.

The truth lay somewhere in between.

Ines and Kael had once been a formidable team, taking on high-stakes heists with ease. But when their latest job went sour, they found themselves on opposite sides of the law. The memories still lingered, a reminder that loyalty was a luxury Ines couldn't afford.

As the clock struck midnight, Ines slipped out into the cool night air, leaving behind the glittering façade of Bellvue Manor and its gilded guests. The shadows swallowed her whole, but one thing was certain: tonight would be just the beginning of a game between two players who knew each other's moves all too well.

And as she vanished into the darkness, a small smile played on Ines's lips – a promise that this night, and perhaps many others to come, would be hers alone.
