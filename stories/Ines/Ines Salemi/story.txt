Ines Salemi sat in her small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by the remnants of her past. The walls were adorned with faded Polaroids, and the air was thick with the scent of old perfume. She poured herself a glass of wine, feeling like she was drowning in a sea of what-ifs.

It had been two years since Ines left New York City, fleeing the heartbreak and betrayal that had shattered her world. She had thought that leaving behind the city would bring her solace, but instead, it felt like a void inside her was growing larger by the day.

As she gazed out the window, Ines's mind wandered back to the night of the argument with Alex. They had been together for five years, and Ines had thought that their love was strong enough to overcome any obstacle. But in the end, it was Alex who had broken her heart, leaving her shattered and alone.

Ines took a sip of her wine, feeling the bitter taste on her tongue. She thought about all the things she could have done differently, all the ways she could have changed the course of their relationship. But deep down, she knew that she would always be stuck in this rut, reliving the same mistakes over and over.

As she sat there, lost in her thoughts, Ines heard a knock at the door. It was her best friend, Maria, who had come to check in on her. The two women hugged tightly, and Ines felt a small sense of comfort wash over her.

"Come in," Ines said, gesturing for Maria to take a seat. "I'm making some poor decisions here."

Maria sat down next to her, handing her glass. "You're being too hard on yourself, Ines. You can't control what others do. But you can learn from your mistakes and move forward."

Ines took another sip of her wine, feeling the words sink in. Maria was right – she had been so caught up in trying to fix things that she had forgotten how to be happy for herself.

Over the next few hours, Ines and Maria talked about everything and nothing. They laughed and cried, and Ines felt a weight lifting off her shoulders. Maybe, just maybe, it was time for Ines to start writing her own story, one that didn't include Alex's heartbreak.

As the sun began to set outside, Ines stood up, feeling a sense of resolve wash over her. "Thank you, Maria," she said, smiling weakly. "I think I'm ready to take back control."

Maria smiled back, and together they clinked glasses – one filled with wine, the other with possibility.
