Inés Deschamps stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It had been years since she'd returned to her hometown of Saint-Pierre, and yet it still felt like a whispered secret that only the most hidden corners held her name.

She walked through the quiet streets, taking in the familiar sights: the worn stone façades, the narrow alleys, and the markets where fresh fish was sold alongside last week's wilted flowers. Every step seemed to unravel a piece of herself, a thread she'd carefully woven away from this place.

Inés had once been the belle of Saint-Pierre's ball, with her porcelain skin and raven hair, but life had worn down those delicate edges like sandstone under the sea. She'd fled as soon as she was old enough, to escape the whispered secrets that bound her to this town. But after a decade away, it was clear she couldn't stay forever.

As she turned onto Rue des Mures, a flicker of movement caught her eye. It was Léon, the proprietor of the local bakery, and they shared a hesitant smile as if both knew that words were too sparse to capture what needed saying. They'd grown up together, sharing midnight walks by the river and secret kisses in the moonlit fields.

Inés slid into the cozy bakery, where sweet scents and tales of old Saint-Pierre filled her senses once more. Léon wiped flour-dusted hands on a clean apron before following her to a stool by the window. Over steaming cups of tea, they talked of nothing: no news, no gossip; only the things that lingered between them – lost love and memories.

Time folded over like an old map, with each passing year leaving behind new lines and worn-out creases. Yet, in these fleeting hours with Léon, Inés felt her feet on firm ground once more. Though it might have been just a ghost of the past that stirred within her – love, loss, longing – it was enough to remind her she wasn't truly lost at all.

In the quiet of Saint-Pierre's evening air, as darkness gathered like the first wave of dawn, Inés realized perhaps she'd returned home not for answers, but just for belonging.
