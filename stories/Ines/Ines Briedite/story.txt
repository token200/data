Despite her talent, Ines struggled to find success in the competitive world of ceramics. Galleries and collectors alike passed by her work, opting for more flashy and trendy pieces. Undeterred, Ines continued to hone her craft, experimenting with new techniques and materials in her small studio.

She continued to push the boundaries of what was possible with clay, creating intricate sculptures that seemed to defy gravity.

With each new piece, Ines' confidence grew. She began to see herself as a true artist, rather than just a skilled craftsman. Her studio expanded, and she hired additional staff to help her meet the demand for her work. Still, Ines remained at the heart of everything, guiding her team with a fierce passion and attention to detail.
