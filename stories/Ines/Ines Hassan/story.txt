Ines Hassan was no ordinary girl from the small town of Al-Khutm in Oman. Born and raised amidst the golden dunes of the Arabian Peninsula, she had always been drawn to the world beyond her desert home. With an insatiable curiosity and a thirst for adventure, Ines Hassan set out to explore the globe, discovering new cultures and meeting people from diverse backgrounds.

His stories sparked something within her - a desire to learn more about the world beyond Oman. She devoured books on history, geography, and anthropology, honing her knowledge of different civilizations and their traditions.

As she grew older, Ines Hassan's passion for discovery only intensified. She pursued higher education in Dubai, studying international relations and economics.

Through her adventures, Ines Hassan discovered a sense of purpose within herself. She realized that her travels were not just about exploring new places, but also about understanding the complexities of global issues like inequality, environmental degradation, and social justice.
