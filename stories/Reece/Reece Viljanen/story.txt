Reece Viljanen leaned against the worn counter, nursing a whiskey on the rocks. The dim fluorescent lights above cast an unforgiving glare on his rugged features, but he didn't flinch. He'd seen worse.

It had been three years since the accident – three years since the world had shattered into a million pieces around him. Three years since the memories still lingered like a bad omen in his mind. Reece couldn't shake the feeling that if he closed his eyes, the wreckage would come crashing back.

He took another sip of his drink, letting the burn wash down his throat. Outside, the Seattle rain drummed against the pavement, a constant reminder that life went on despite his own catastrophic failure. The storm was supposed to be letting up by now – but it never did.

Reece thought about all the things he'd lost: his job, his family, even the spark within him that had once driven him forward. As an engineer, he'd designed the very system that had taken his life away in a freak lab accident. Now, he spent his days in a haze of despair, wondering what else he could have done differently.

A figure walked into the dimly lit bar, shaking the rain from their coat. Reece watched as they ordered a whiskey and slid onto the stool beside him.

"You know how to drink a good whiskey?" the stranger asked, eyeing Reece's glass.

"No idea," Reece replied dryly, but his eyes met the stranger's in the mirror behind the bar.

The stranger smiled. "I'm an engineer."

Reece raised an eyebrow. "What kind of accident?"

"Same as yours," the stranger said with a wry laugh. "A little too close to home – literally."

Their conversation flowed like the whiskey, each sentence spilling into the next until Reece was laughing out loud, his heart aching with a mix of anger and sorrow.

For the first time in years, he felt seen. For the first time in years, he felt not alone. In this dingy bar on a rainy Seattle night, Reece Viljanen finally found someone who understood him – the personification of 'bad luck' – as much as he understood himself.
