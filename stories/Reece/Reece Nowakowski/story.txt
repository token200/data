Reece Nowakowski trudged through the snow-covered streets, his heavy boots crunching against the frozen crystals. As a private investigator, he had grown accustomed to the cold, dark days that followed the sun's departure. But this particular case was different.

It started with a cryptic phone call from an anonymous source, claiming to have information about Reece's estranged brother, Max. The two brothers had drifted apart after their parents' messy divorce, and Reece had long assumed that Max had run off with some rich woman, leaving him to pick up the pieces.

Now, it seemed that Max was in trouble.

Reece arrived at the rundown diner on the outskirts of town, where his source had agreed to meet. A gruff waitress with a permanent scowl, she eyed Reece warily as he slid into a booth.

"What do you want, private eye?" she asked, her voice dripping with disdain.

Reece flashed his PI badge and took a seat at the counter, ordering a cup of black coffee from the grumpy waitress. "I'm here about my brother," he said bluntly. "Where is he?"

The waitress snorted, spilling sugar into Reece's cup as she replied, "He's in witness protection."

Reece raised an eyebrow. Witness protection? That sounded like something out of a bad action movie.

"What happened?" he asked the waitress, who seemed to be savoring every word.

"My source tells me that Max was involved in some shady dealings â€“ embezzlement, money laundering, the works," she said, her voice heavy with disapproval. "He got pinched by the FBI and had to go on the run."

Reece's mind reeled as he processed this information. His brother, Max, the golden boy, the star athlete? Embezzling and running from the law?

As Reece left the diner, a plan began to form in his head. He knew that getting involved with his brother would be trouble, but some things were more important than reputation or pride.

He lit up his cell phone and dialed the FBI's witness protection unit. It was time for Reece Nowakowski to take a chance on family.
