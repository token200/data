Despite his success, Pierre Roy remained a recluse, keeping his personal life shrouded in secrecy. Few people knew that he had once been part of an underground organization, working for a mysterious benefactor who paid him handsomely for his services. But Pierre Roy's loyalty to this organization was tested when his benefactor demanded that he pull off one final job - stealing a priceless artifact from a heavily guarded museum.
