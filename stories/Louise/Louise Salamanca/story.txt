Louise Salamanca, a.k.a. The Queen of Hearts, sat regally in her throne room, surrounded by the opulent trappings of her wealth and power. Her eyes narrowed as she watched the commotion outside the walls of her fortress-like estate.

Her nephew, Tony Soprano's, loyal enforcer, Ralph Cifaretto, had been caught attempting to flee with a shipment of goods intended for the infamous Lupertazzi crime family. Louise had other plans for that shipment and would not be outdone by the likes of Tony Soprano or his associates.

She summoned her loyal and trusted advisor, Silvio Dante, to her side. "Silvio, it is time we took care of Ralph Cifaretto once and for all," she said with a stern expression.

Silvio nodded, knowing better than to question Louise's orders. He called for the guards to prepare Ralph for transport, and soon he was standing in front of The Queen's throne, looking pale and nervous.

"You see, Ralph, I'm afraid you've made a grave mistake," Louise said, her voice dripping with venom. "You think you can cross me? You think you can outsmart the great Louise Salamanca?"

Ralph shifted uncomfortably under her gaze. He knew he was in the wrong, but he had also underestimated The Queen's wrath.

As she spoke, a look of malevolence crossed her face, and Ralph's eyes widened as he realized his fate. Silvio gestured to one side, where a team of burly men stood waiting with their knives drawn.

"It seems you'll be making a quick trip to the countryside," Louise said with a smile, "where you can rest in peace."

Ralph was dragged away, screaming for mercy, but his pleas were met only with The Queen's cruel laughter. As she watched him being taken, she felt a sense of satisfaction and power.

"You may think you're above me, Ralph Cifaretto," she said to herself, "but I am the one who rules these streets. And as long as I breathe, those who dare cross me will suffer the same fate."

With a wave of her hand, Silvio disappeared from view, leaving The Queen lost in thought, surrounded by the shadows of her empire.
