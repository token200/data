Louise Neumann was a woman with a past shrouded in mystery. Her piercing green eyes seemed to hold a thousand secrets, and her raven-black hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall of night. She had a reputation for being enigmatic, for being the type of person who could walk into a room and command attention without even trying.

Louise was a former spy, having spent years working for a top-secret organization known only as "The Agency". Her skills were unmatched, and she had earned the respect of her peers. But after a particularly high-stakes mission went sour, Louise found herself forced to leave The Agency behind. She disappeared into the shadows, her past erased from the records.

Years later, Louise found herself in Berlin, sipping whiskey at a dingy bar in the Kreuzberg district. It was a place where the city's underbelly came alive at night, and Louise fit right in. She had been tracking a lead on a mysterious arms deal, and her sources had told her that the deal would be brokered by none other than Viktor Kovalenko, a notorious Russian oligarch.

As she listened to the hushed conversations around her, Louise's ears picked up snippets of code words and encrypted messages. She recognized the language, it was an old one, used by The Agency in the past. Her heart quickened with excitement - this could be the break she had been waiting for.

Louise finished her drink, tossed a few euros on the table, and slid out of the bar. The night air enveloped her like a shroud as she made her way through the crowded streets. She hailed a taxi and gave the driver a single-word instruction: "Moskau". The car sped off into the darkness, with Louise sitting quietly in the backseat.

As they navigated the deserted highway, Louise's mind whirled with possibilities. Who was behind this arms deal? And what did Viktor Kovalenko have to do with it? She knew that she had stumbled upon something big - but only time would tell if she could get out of alive.
