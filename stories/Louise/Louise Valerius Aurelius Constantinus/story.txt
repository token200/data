Louise Valerius Aurelius Constantinus, or Lou to her closest friends, was an unlikely warrior. She stood at just over five feet tall with an unassuming presence that belied her sharp wit and razor-sharp instincts. Her dark hair was often tied back in a messy bun, revealing a smattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose that seemed to dance in the sunlight.

Born into a family of diplomats and mediators, Lou had always been groomed for greatness - not with swords or shields, but with words. She inherited her father's diplomatic acumen and her mother's quick mind, using them to navigate the intricate web of alliances and rivalries that defined their world.

But fate had other plans. When a brutal bandit raid swept through their village, Lou's family was caught in the crossfire. Her parents were killed, and she was left for dead by the very people they had sworn to protect.

In the aftermath, Lou vowed to use her words not just to bring peace, but to exact revenge on those who had wronged her. She became a mercenary, traveling the land with her trusty sword at her side and her wit sharp enough to disarm even the most hardened foes.

Despite her tough exterior, Lou had a soft spot for strays - human and animal alike. She took in a scrappy little dog named Rufus, who became her constant companion on the battlefield.

Lou's exploits soon caught the attention of the imperial guard, who were impressed by her skills and bravery. They offered her a place in their ranks, but Lou knew that would mean giving up her freedom - and herself.

She turned them down, choosing instead to ride into battle as a mercenary, using her words and sword to protect those who couldn't defend themselves. Her legend grew, with stories of the mysterious woman in black spreading far and wide.

And so Lou continued to fight, ever the outsider, always watching from the shadows.
