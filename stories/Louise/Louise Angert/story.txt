Louise Angert stood at the edge of the cliff, her long blonde hair whipping in the wind as she gazed out at the endless expanse of ocean. She had always been drawn to the sea, and now, on this particular day, it seemed to be calling to her.

It was a chilly autumn morning, and Louise felt invigorated by the crisp air. She had just received news that her estranged mother had passed away, leaving behind a small inheritance that came with one condition: she must return to their hometown in Maine to settle her estate.

Louise had not set foot in her hometown in years. The memories of her childhood, of arguing with her mother and feeling like an outcast among her peers, threatened to overwhelm her now. But as she stood there, the waves crashing against the rocks below, she felt a sense of peace wash over her.

She took a deep breath, the salty air filling her lungs, and began to walk down the rocky shoreline. The town was quiet, with only a few tourists wandering the streets. Louise recognized some of the old shops and restaurants, but they seemed different now, as if seen through a different lens.

As she walked, Louise noticed a small caf√© tucked away on Main Street. It was one of her favorite spots from childhood, where her mother used to take her for pancakes on Sundays. Inside, the owner, Margaret, greeted her with a warm smile.

"Welcome back, Louise," Margaret said, as if no time had passed at all. "I see you've come to settle your mother's estate."

Louise nodded, feeling a lump form in her throat. Margaret handed her a cup of hot coffee, and they sat down at a small table by the window.

Over steaming cups of coffee, Louise told Margaret about her plans to stay in town for a while, to get to know the people and the place again. As she spoke, she felt a sense of connection to this place that she had never felt before.

For the first time in years, Louise felt like coming home.
