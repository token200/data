Louise Aber stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for the familiar face of Jack Harris. She had agreed to meet him here, in a quaint corner spot off Main Street, to discuss the recent string of mysterious occurrences at Oakwood Manor.

As she waited, Louise sipped on a steaming cup of coffee and gazed out the window, watching as people bustled about their daily routines. Her mind, however, was elsewhere. The strange noises, the unexplained movements, and the eerie feeling that something was watching her from the shadows had all been keeping her up at night.

Jack appeared just as she was starting to worry he wouldn't show. He took a seat across from her, his eyes gleaming with a knowing intensity. "So, what do you make of it?" he asked, referring to the series of inexplicable events plaguing Oakwood Manor.

Louise leaned forward, her voice barely above a whisper. "I think someone – or something – is trying to communicate with us. I've been doing some research, and I found a pattern to the disturbances. They seem to be centered around specific locations within the manor."

Jack's expression turned thoughtful as he pulled out his notebook and began scribbling notes. "That makes sense," he said, "but what about the feeling of being watched? Have you experienced that firsthand?"

Louise nodded, a shiver running down her spine at the memory. "Yes, I have. Multiple times. It's like... have you ever felt like someone is standing just behind you, waiting for you to make your next move?"

Jack shook his head, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he smiled. "I don't think so," he said, "but I do know that feeling. Let's take a look at these locations and see if we can uncover what's causing this... whatever it is."

Together, they pored over maps of Oakwood Manor, identifying specific areas where the disturbances had occurred. As they worked, Louise couldn't shake the sense that they were being watched, that unseen eyes were trained on them from the shadows.

Despite the eerie feeling, she was determined to uncover the truth behind these strange occurrences. With Jack's expertise and her own determination, she felt a surge of hope that they might just uncover something remarkable – or terrifying – at Oakwood Manor.
