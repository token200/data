Louise Ruiz García sat alone in her small, cluttered office, staring at the stack of files on her desk. As a private investigator, she had seen it all - the cheating spouses, the missing persons, the corporate embezzlement cases. But none of them had ever gotten under her skin like this one.

Her latest client was a young woman named Sophia, who claimed that her best friend had stolen her fiancé just days before their wedding. Louise had agreed to take on the case, mostly out of boredom - she wasn't exactly getting any younger and didn't have a lot of other clients lined up.

As she sifted through Sophia's files, Louise couldn't help but notice that something didn't add up. The way Sophia had described her friend, Emily, seemed too rehearsed, too polished. And the details about the alleged "love triangle" between Emily, Sophia's fiancé, and a random guy they'd met at a bar... it all seemed like a carefully constructed web of deceit.

Louise decided to pay Emily a visit, hoping to get to the bottom of things. She arrived at Emily's upscale apartment complex just as she was leaving for her supposed "business trip". Louise recognized the telltale signs of guilt - the nervously fidgeting hands, the hastily applied lip gloss.

As they sat down in the lobby, Louise couldn't help but notice how... rehearsed Emily seemed. The way she smiled at Louise, the way she asked about Sophia's family - it all seemed too practiced, too scripted. And then, just as Louise was about to confront her, Emily produced a small piece of paper from her purse and handed it to Louise.

It was a text message, from an unknown number - but one that Louise recognized immediately: "Meet me at the coffee shop at 5pm. Come alone." It was from the random guy they'd met at the bar... or so Sophia claimed.

Louise's eyes narrowed as she looked up at Emily. She wasn't buying it. This whole thing had been a setup, and she aimed to find out who was behind it. With a newfound sense of purpose, Louise stood up and turned to leave - but not before catching Emily's eye and giving her a warning smile.

"You're in trouble, Emily," Louise whispered. "And I'm just getting started."
