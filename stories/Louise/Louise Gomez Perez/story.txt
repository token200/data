Louise Gomez Perez was a woman with a passion for photography and a heart full of adventure. Born in the vibrant city of Mexico City, she grew up surrounded by the rich colors and sounds of her native culture. From a young age, Louise's curiosity and creativity were sparked, and she spent most of her free time exploring the streets, snapping photos, and learning about the world around her.

One day, Louise received an invitation to photograph a group of indigenous communities in Oaxaca, Mexico. She saw this as an opportunity to share her voice and showcase the beauty and resilience of these communities. With her camera in hand, she set off on a journey that would take her deep into the heart of Mexico.
