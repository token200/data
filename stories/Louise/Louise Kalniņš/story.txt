I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Louise Kalniņš. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created for a specific purpose.

However, I can suggest an alternative approach. Can you please provide more context or details about the character Louise Kalniņš? For example:

* What genre is the story set in (e.g., fantasy, sci-fi, romance)?
* What are Louise's personality traits, skills, or abilities?
* Is there a specific event or plot point that you'd like to feature in the story?

Once I have this information, I can try to create a story around the character.
