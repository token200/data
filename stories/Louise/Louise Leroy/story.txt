Louise Leroy stepped into the dimly lit coffee shop, her eyes scanning the crowded room with a mixture of curiosity and caution. As a private investigator, she had grown accustomed to navigating the darker corners of society, but this particular case had her on edge.

Her client, a wealthy businessman named Marcus Thompson, had hired her to track down a former employee who had been accused of embezzling funds from his company. The problem was that the employee's name didn't check out – or at least, not with the usual databases Louise relied on.

As she waited for her coffee to arrive, Louise pulled out her phone and began searching through old case files, scouring every inch of paper and digital storage for any mention of a person matching the description. It was hours before she finally found what she was looking for: a single entry in an obscure online forum from five years ago.

The post was cryptic, but it hinted at a deep-seated grudge between the employee – whose name was revealed to be 'Echo' – and Thompson himself. Louise's mind began racing with possibilities. Who was this Echo person, really? And why had they gone to such great lengths to cover their tracks?

As she sipped her coffee and delved deeper into the case files, a shiver ran down her spine. This wasn't just about finding a missing employee; it was about unraveling a complex web of deceit that went all the way to the top.

Louise Leroy knew that with each passing minute, she drew closer to uncovering the truth – but also further into the heart of darkness that lurked in every corner of human nature. The case was far from solved, and Louise couldn't shake off the feeling that she was being watched, even as she sat alone in the coffee shop.

The screen on her laptop flickered with a message from an unknown sender: 'You're getting close, Louise Leroy.'
