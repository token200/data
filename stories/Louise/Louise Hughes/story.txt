Louise Hughes stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small town of Ravenswood as if searching for something she already knew was there. The air was crisp, carrying the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. It was a smell that brought back memories of lazy summer days spent exploring the woods behind her family's old Victorian home.

As she walked down the main street, people nodded or waved in greeting, their faces familiar but not particularly warm. Ravenswood was a place where everyone knew everyone, but no one really talked about anyone else. It was as if they were all trapped in a perpetual state of polite reserve, never daring to rock the boat.

Louise had always felt like an outsider here, even among her own family. Her parents had moved to Ravenswood when she was just a baby, and while they'd settled into the community with ease, Louise couldn't shake the feeling that she didn't quite belong. She'd grown up watching the world through a window, always longing to be part of it.

She pushed open the door to her favorite café, a small, cozy place run by an eccentric woman named Mabel. The bell above the door jingled as Louise slid onto her stool at the counter, exchanging a quiet smile with Mabel, who raised an eyebrow in recognition.

"What brings you back to town?" Mabel asked, wiping down the counter with a dirty rag.

Louise shrugged, ordering a black coffee and taking a seat by the window. She'd come to Ravenswood seeking answers about her family's past – the secrets they kept hidden behind their polite smiles. The locals whispered of strange happenings on the old Hughes estate, where Louise had grown up playing among the overgrown gardens.

As she sipped her coffee, watching the leaves rustle in the wind outside, Louise knew that Ravenswood held a secret or two. But for now, it was content to keep its mysteries locked away behind the polite facades of small-town life.

Just then, Mabel dropped a piece of paper on the counter – a note with an address scrawled on it: Oakwood Manor. The old Hughes estate loomed on the outskirts of town, shrouded in shadows and speculation. Louise's heart quickened as she realized that her journey to uncover the truth had finally begun.

Without thinking, she stood up, tucked the note into her pocket, and headed back out onto the platform, ready to leave Ravenswood behind once more – but this time, not with a sense of belonging, but with determination in her eyes.
