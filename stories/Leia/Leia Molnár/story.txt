Leia Molnár stepped out of her small apartment and into the vibrant streets of Budapest. As a freelance journalist, she had grown accustomed to working on her own schedule, but sometimes it was nice to take a break from the computer and people-watch.

As she strolled along the Danube Promenade, Leia couldn't help but think about her latest article assignment. She was supposed to be meeting with a source at the old parliament building, but so far, he hadn't shown up.

She decided to pay him a visit anyway, hoping that he would have some information for her. As she walked into the grand hall, she spotted her source sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee.

"Leia Molnár," he said with a nod, as if he knew exactly who she was. "I see you're not one to waste time."

Leia smiled and sat down across from him. "I'm always working, Viktor," she replied. "But I have a feeling this story is going to be big."

Viktor leaned in, his eyes scanning the room before focusing on Leia again. "It's about the new development project on the outskirts of town," he whispered. "There are rumors that it's being backed by a wealthy businessman with ties to the government."

Leia's ears perked up at this information. She had been investigating the same lead, but hadn't been able to get any concrete evidence. This could be just what she needed to crack the story.

As they chatted, Leia pulled out her notebook and began jotting down notes. Viktor spoke quickly, his words tumbling out in a rush as he shared details about the project's scope and timeline.

Leia listened intently, her eyes lighting up with excitement as each new revelation came to light. She knew that this story had the potential to expose some serious corruption, and she was determined to see it through.

Finally, after what felt like hours of talking, Viktor stood up and headed for the door. "Thanks for the chat, Leia Molnár," he said with a smile. "I think you're onto something here."

Leia watched him go, her mind racing with possibilities. She knew that she had a lot of work ahead of her, but she was ready for the challenge. Bring it on, she thought to herself, as she headed back out into the bright Hungarian sunlight.
