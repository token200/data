Leia Yang walked into the dimly lit café, scanning the room for a familiar face. It had been months since she'd last set foot in this neighborhood, and yet, it still felt like home. As she made her way to the bar, a gentle voice called out from behind.

"Hey, Leia!"

She turned to see her best friend, Jamie, waving at her from across the room. Leia smiled, feeling a wave of relief wash over her. She hadn't seen Jamie in ages, and it was like no time had passed at all.

Leia Yang made her way over to Jamie, dropping into the seat beside him with a sigh of contentment. "It's so good to see you," she said, wrapping her arms around Jamie in a tight hug.

The two friends chatted for hours, catching up on each other's lives and sharing stories about their adventures since they'd last spoken. Leia Yang listened intently as Jamie filled her in on his latest art projects, her eyes lighting up with excitement.

As the night wore on, the café began to fill with more patrons, but Leia and Jamie remained lost in their own little world. They talked about everything and nothing, their conversation flowing easily from one topic to the next.

At one point, Jamie leaned over and whispered, "You know, I've been thinking of starting a new art series inspired by your travels." Leia Yang's eyes widened in surprise, but she couldn't help smiling at the thought. It was only fitting that her friend would be influenced by her own adventures.

As the night drew to a close, Leia Yang stood up, feeling grateful for the chance encounter with Jamie. "Thanks for catching up with me," she said, her voice filled with sincerity. Jamie smiled back, his eyes shining with friendship.

"Anytime, Leia," he replied, his voice low and gentle. As they parted ways outside the café, Leia Yang felt a sense of peace settle over her, knowing that some friendships never fade.
