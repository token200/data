I must correct you that Leia's actual last name is Organa, not Durand.

Leia Organa was known throughout the galaxy as a fearless and determined leader. Born on the planet Alderaan, Leia grew up with a strong sense of justice and a desire to protect her people. As a young adult, she became involved in the Rebel Alliance, using her intelligence and diplomatic skills to help bring about an end to the Galactic Empire's tyranny.

One day, Princess Organa received a message from a trusted ally, requesting her presence on the planet Dantooine. The Rebel Alliance was planning a daring mission to destroy the Empire's new Death Star, and Leia's unique set of skills made her the perfect candidate for the job. With her blaster by her side and her iconic hair buns, Princess Organa boarded a shuttle and set off towards the moon of Tatooine.

As she arrived on Dantooine, Princess Organa was greeted by her fellow Rebel soldiers. Together, they hatched a plan to infiltrate the Death Star's plans and transmit them back to the Rebel base. It was a high-risk mission, but Leia knew that it was their only hope for defeating the Empire.

With her quick thinking and bravery, Princess Organa led the team through a series of narrow corridors and hidden passageways. They avoided stormtroopers and navigated through treacherous laser beams, all while keeping their eyes fixed on the prize. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, they reached the heart of the Death Star: the plans room.

With seconds to spare, Princess Organa transmitted the plans back to the Rebel base, ensuring that the Death Star would soon be destroyed. As she made her escape, she knew that her actions had brought hope to a galaxy in despair. And though the road ahead would be long and difficult, Leia Organa was ready to face whatever challenges came her way, knowing that she was making a difference as a leader of the Rebel Alliance.
