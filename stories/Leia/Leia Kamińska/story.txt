Leia Kamińska stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any signs of life. It had been months since she'd left the city, fleeing the memories that haunted her. The memories of her past life as a skilled hacker and member of an elite cybersecurity team.

As she made her way through the deserted streets, Leia couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. She'd traded her old life for a new one, taking on the alias "Zero Cool" in order to start fresh. But the weight of her past lingered, threatening to surface at any moment.

Leia stopped in front of a small café, its sign reading "Mae's Place". She pushed open the door and was enveloped by the warm scent of freshly brewed coffee and baked goods. The patrons looked up as she entered, their faces a blur of curiosity and suspicion.

"Table for one?" a waitress asked, eyeing Leia's worn leather jacket and scuffed boots.

"Yes," Leia replied, taking a seat at the counter. "And make it a black coffee."

As she waited for her drink to arrive, Leia noticed a figure sitting in the corner, their eyes fixed intently on her. She felt a shiver run down her spine as they nodded slightly, before returning to their book.

When the waitress returned with her coffee, Leia asked, "You know who that person is?"

The waitress hesitated, glancing nervously at the mysterious figure. "I don't know what you're talking about."

Leia smiled wryly. "I think I do. My friend, Alexei Petrov, used to work for a rival team. He's been looking for me for years."

The waitress leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. "Be careful, Zero Cool. You're not the only one who knows your true identity."

Leia's eyes locked onto the mysterious figure, their gaze a silent challenge. She knew that she couldn't stay hidden forever. But for now, she was content to blend into the shadows, and let her new life unfold.

As she finished her coffee and left Mae's Place, Leia felt a sense of determination wash over her. She would build a new life here, one free from the secrets of her past. And if that meant confronting the ghosts that haunted her, then so be it.
