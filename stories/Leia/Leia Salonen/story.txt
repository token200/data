Leia Salonen walked into the dimly lit café, scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As a private investigator, she had seen her fair share of shady characters and illicit deals gone sour. But tonight was different. Tonight, she had received a cryptic message from an old source that hinted at a major player in the city's underworld being connected to a string of high-profile murders.

Leia made her way to the bar, ordering a whiskey on the rocks as she surveyed the room. She spotted a familiar face - Victor LaGraine, a notorious loan shark with a reputation for ruthlessness. Leia had crossed paths with him before, but tonight was not about confrontation. Tonight was about information.

She struck up a conversation with LaGraine, probing gently for details about his operations and connections to the murders. LaGraine seemed evasive, but Leia's trained eyes picked up on tiny tells - a flicker of unease in his gaze, a slight hesitation before answering a question.

As she pressed her advantage, Leia sensed that she was closing in on something. But just as she was about to follow up on a lead, LaGraine's demeanor shifted. He became suddenly alert, glancing over his shoulder with an air of urgency.

"I think we're done here," he said abruptly, pushing his chair back and standing.

Leia followed suit, her instincts screaming that something was off. As she watched LaGraine swiftly exit the café, she noticed a piece of paper on the table - a small note with a single phrase scrawled on it: "Meet me at Club Europa at midnight. Come alone."

Leia's heart quickened as she picked up the paper. Who had written this? And what did they want from her? She tucked the note into her pocket, making a mental note to be there at midnight. As she left the café, Leia couldn't shake the feeling that she was stepping into something much bigger - and far more treacherous - than she had initially anticipated.
