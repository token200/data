Despite her many accomplishments, Leia remained humble and kind. She had a way of putting others at ease, from her colleagues to her friends and family. Her warm smile could light up a room, and her infectious laughter was always welcome.

One day, while working on a particularly complex project, Leia received an unexpected visit from an old friend, Captain Orion Blackwood. A fellow adventurer and space explorer, Orion had heard about Leia's latest discovery - a hidden black hole deep in the heart of the Andromeda galaxy.
