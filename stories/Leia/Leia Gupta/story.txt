Leia Gupta walked into the crowded caf√©, scanning the room for her friend. She spotted him sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee and staring intently at his phone. As she approached, he looked up and flashed a tired smile.

"Hey, Lea," he said, using her nickname despite knowing that Leia had always preferred to be called by her full name.

"I'm so glad I finally found you," she replied, plopping down into the chair across from him. "I've been searching all over for you."

Her friend, Rohan, shrugged. "I got lost in the crowd. I was supposed to meet you an hour ago."

Leia laughed. "You know how it is when you're trying to navigate this city. It's like they intentionally design it to confuse you."

Rohan chuckled. "Yeah, I guess that's one way to put it."

As they caught up on each other's lives, Leia couldn't help but notice the look of determination etched on Rohan's face.

"What's going on?" she asked, her curiosity piqued.

Rohan hesitated before speaking. "I've decided to pursue a career in environmental activism," he said, his voice filled with conviction.

Leia's eyes widened in surprise. "That's amazing! You'd be perfect for it."

Rohan smiled. "Thanks, Lea. I'm actually thinking of starting my own organization to raise awareness about climate change."

Leia felt a surge of pride and admiration for her friend. She knew that Rohan had always been passionate about the environment, but this was a huge step forward.

"I'll be your first supporter," she said, grinning at him. "We can start by organizing events together and spreading the word."

Rohan's face lit up with gratitude. "Thanks, Lea. I couldn't do it without you."

As they continued to talk, Leia realized that sometimes it takes a little push in the right direction for us to discover our true potential. And she was honored to be there to support her friend on this journey.
