Siegbert Schmidt was a man of mystery, shrouded in an aura of quiet confidence. A German-born businessman with a penchant for suits and cigars, he had made a name for himself on Wall Street, where his sharp mind and ruthless instincts had earned him the nickname "The Shark."

But behind the glitz and glamour of his high-stakes world, Siegbert's true passions lay elsewhere. In his spare time, he was an avid collector of rare and obscure books, with a particular fondness for 19th-century German literature.

One evening, while browsing through a used bookstore in the East Village, Siegbert stumbled upon a tattered copy of Goethe's "Faust". The worn cover seemed to call to him, as if beckoning him to uncover its secrets. He purchased the book on a whim, and spent the next few days devouring it from start to finish.

Enthralled by the poetic language and philosophical themes, Siegbert found himself drawn into the world of 18th-century Germany. He began to see parallels between Faust's struggles with identity and morality, and his own career as a high-powered executive. The line between good and evil seemed to blur in front of him, like the fine edges of a razor.

As he delved deeper into Goethe's masterpiece, Siegbert started to question the true cost of success in his line of work. Were the cutthroat tactics that had propelled him to the top truly worth the personal sacrifices? The moral ambiguities of his business dealings began to weigh heavier on his conscience.

One evening, while walking home through the deserted streets of Manhattan, Siegbert received an unexpected phone call from an unknown number. A low, gravelly voice spoke to him, claiming to be a long-lost cousin of Goethe's. The stranger revealed that he had discovered a hidden manuscript written by Faust himself, detailing his own journey into darkness and despair.

The manuscript was said to be hidden in a remote German castle, waiting for someone with the "right heart" to find it. Siegbert felt an inexplicable sense of destiny calling to him â€“ as if this chance encounter had set him on a path he could no longer ignore.

With his mind reeling from the possibilities, Siegbert Schmidt made a decision: leave behind the world of high finance and embark on a journey into the very heart of darkness. The Shark would become the seeker of truth, guided by the shadows of Faust's great and terrible tale.
