Gerard Arias stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of life. As the last surviving member of the notorious Arias crime family, he had grown accustomed to living in the shadows.

With a flick of his wrist, Gerard adjusted his jacket, the familiar weight of his past bearing down upon him like a physical force. He had spent years building a new life, one that bore little resemblance to the one he had left behind. Yet, the ghosts of his family's dark history lingered, always waiting to pounce.

As he made his way through the crowded streets, Gerard couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. It was a sensation he had grown all too familiar with over the years, a constant reminder that even in exile, the past never truly slept.

Eventually, he arrived at the small café where he had agreed to meet an old acquaintance. Over steaming cups of coffee, they discussed plans for his upcoming 'business venture'. Gerard listened intently, the terms of their agreement etched into his mind like a promise.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the city in a warm orange glow, Gerard Arias slipped back into the night, ready to face whatever dangers lay ahead. The shadows seemed to writhe and twist around him, but he knew them by heart – each one a reminder of the delicate balance between his old life and new.

Gerard's thoughts wandered to his family's history, to the tragic events that had torn his world apart. He wondered what secrets lay hidden in the crumbling mansion on the outskirts of town, where his kin had once ruled with an iron fist. Though he had long since abandoned that world, a part of him still yearned to reclaim it.

For now, however, Gerard Arias knew better than to get too close to home. The darkness that lurked within those ancient walls was no longer his alone to bear; others were waiting for him, eager to claim their own piece of the shattered legacy that remained.
