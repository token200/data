Gerard Angert stepped into the dimly lit caf√©, his piercing green eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a former private investigator turned private security consultant, he had seen his fair share of shady characters and seedy deals. But tonight, he was here to see an old acquaintance, one who owed him a favor.

Gerard Angert made his way to the corner table, where the man known only as "Vinnie" sat sipping on a cup of black coffee. Vinnie's eyes locked onto Gerard's, and he nodded in acknowledgement before returning to his drink.

"So, what can I do for you, Gerard?" Vinnie asked, his gravelly voice a stark contrast to the smooth baritone Gerard was accustomed to.

Gerard took a seat across from Vinnie, ordering a whiskey on the rocks as he got straight to the point. "I heard you might know something about the missing artifact," he said, referring to the priceless relic that had gone missing from the museum last week.

Vinnie snorted, taking a sip of his coffee before responding. "You're talking about the Starlight Serenade? I don't know what you're talking about, Gerard."

Gerard Angert raised an eyebrow, his gut telling him that Vinnie was hiding something. He had worked with Vinnie on several occasions in the past, and he knew that man's reputation for being tight-lipped when it came to sensitive information.

"I'm sure you do," Gerard said, leaning back in his chair. "But I've been doing some digging of my own, and I think we both know who might be behind this."

Vinnie's eyes narrowed, and for a moment, Gerard thought he saw a flicker of fear before it was extinguished. "Who is it?" Vinnie asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

Gerard Angert leaned forward, his eyes locked onto Vinnie's. "I'm not sure yet," he said. "But I will find out. And when I do, you can bet your life that you'll be the first one to know."

With that, Gerard stood up and handed Vinnie a business card. "This is my number. When you're ready to spill the beans, give me a call."
