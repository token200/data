Gerard Wei was a man shrouded in mystery, with an aura of quiet confidence that commanded attention without demanding it. As a renowned detective in the city's underbelly, he had earned a reputation for being untouchable, and his clients knew better than to ask questions.

One drizzly evening, a young woman named Sophia burst into Gerard Wei's office, her eyes brimming with tears. She whispered something about her sister's disappearance, and Gerard's expression turned stoic as he scribbled down a few notes on a pad of paper. The case files stacked up around him like monuments to the countless lives lost in this city.

Sophia hesitated before blurting out that she had heard whispers about Gerard Wei's involvement with an organization known only as "The Collective." Rumors swirled that they were the ones pulling the strings, orchestrating heists and murders alike. As Sophia spoke, Gerard's eyes narrowed, a flicker of irritation dancing across his face.

"Let's focus on finding your sister," he said finally, ushering her toward the door. "The Collective can wait."

Gerard Wei stepped out into the rain-soaked night, his thoughts straying to The Collective and the secrets they kept hidden behind their enigmatic facade. As a member of this shadowy network, Gerard had carried out countless missions, pushing the boundaries of morality with each step.

He lit a cigarette as he walked down alleys lined with flickering streetlights, eyes scanning the crowded streets for any sign of trouble. The Collective's mantra echoed in his mind – "Unity through destruction." It was a philosophy that resonated deeply within Gerard, who had found solace in its ideals after losing loved ones to senseless violence.

Eventually, he arrived at the address Sophia had given him – an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. A faint light danced from within, beckoning Gerard Wei into the unknown.
