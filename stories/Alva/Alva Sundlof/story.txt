As a child, Alva Sundlof had always been fascinated by the way light danced across the surface of water.

One day, a prominent art collector walked into Alva's studio, eager to purchase one of her latest masterpieces. As he admired the vibrant colors and textures, Alva noticed something peculiar - a faint resemblance between his face and that of an old photograph she had found in her attic. It was as if fate had brought them together, allowing her to share a piece of herself with this stranger.

Intrigued, Alva decided to create a new piece, one that would capture the essence of their unexpected connection.
