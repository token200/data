Alva Gustafsson stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station with a mix of nostalgia and disinterest. She had returned to her hometown of Härnösand, Sweden after years away, drawn by a sense of restlessness and a need to reconnect with the past.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Alva's mind wandered back to the summers she spent as a child, exploring the rocky shores and secret coves along Härnösand's coastline. She had always felt most alive when she was by the sea, the salty air and sound of the waves washing over her like a balm.

Alva stopped at the local café, ordering a cup of strong coffee and sitting down at a small table by the window. She watched as the sunlight danced across the water, feeling a sense of peace settle over her. It had been years since she'd felt this way, but being back in Härnösand seemed to be stirring something deep within her.

As she sipped her coffee, Alva noticed a figure watching her from across the street. He was an old friend, Gustav, who had moved away after high school and never looked back. They had lost touch over the years, but there was something about his intense gaze that made Alva feel seen, like he understood her in a way no one else did.

Gustav pushed off from the wall and walked towards her, a small package clutched in his hand. "Hey, Alva," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "I heard you were back."

Alva smiled, feeling a spark of excitement. "I am," she replied. "What's with the package?"

Gustav handed it over, and Alva unwrapped the brown paper to reveal an old photograph. It was taken on one of their last summer together, standing at the edge of the sea as the sun set behind them.

"This was always my favorite picture of us," Gustav said, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "You were so carefree back then."

Alva's heart swelled with emotion as she looked at the photograph. She felt like she'd been given a glimpse into her past, and it had set her free.

"I think I'm starting to remember," Alva said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Gustav nodded, his face serious. "I knew you would."

As they stood there, wrapped in the warm glow of the setting sun, Alva felt like she was finally coming home – not just back to Härnösand, but to herself.
