Alva Vasiliev sat alone in her dimly lit apartment, sipping a cup of cold coffee as she stared out at the rainy streets below. Her eyes, an piercing shade of blue that seemed to bore into those who met her gaze, were fixed on some distant point beyond the window.

It was a sight she had seen countless times before - the rain-soaked city, the deserted sidewalks, the lone figure standing in the shadows, lost in thought. But tonight felt different. Tonight, Alva's mind was consumed by memories of the past, memories she had spent years trying to forget.

As a child, Alva had been part of an elite Russian intelligence agency known as SPETSnaz, where she had honed her skills and earned a reputation for being one of the most feared operatives in the country. But it was during her final mission that everything changed - a mission that left her with a wound that would never fully heal.

She thought back to the day she discovered the truth about her agency's activities. The truth that they were using their vast resources and networks to manipulate world events, fueling conflicts and manipulating governments for their own gain. Alva had been torn between her loyalty to the organization and her growing sense of morality.

It was a decision that cost her dearly. She was forced to go into hiding, leaving behind everything she had ever known. But even now, as she stood at the precipice of a new life, Alva couldn't shake off the feeling that she was being watched.

Suddenly, the sound of footsteps echoed from outside her apartment door. Alva's instincts kicked in, and she instinctively reached for the gun hidden under her jacket. She slowly made her way towards the door, trying to gauge the situation.

As she opened the door, a figure stood before her - a woman with piercing green eyes that seemed to see right through her. The woman smiled, and Alva knew instantly that this was someone who understood her.

"You're not alone anymore," the woman said softly, before slipping inside and closing the door behind her.

For the first time in years, Alva felt like she had found a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, it was time to face the past and start anew.
