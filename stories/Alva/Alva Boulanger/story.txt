Alva Boulanger stepped into the opulent ballroom, her eyes scanning the crowded space with a mixture of disdain and calculation. As a high-ranking official in President Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, she had grown accustomed to navigating the treacherous waters of Washington politics.

A petite woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair, Alva had a reputation for being cunning and ruthless – traits that had served her well in her climb to power. Her sharp mind and quick wit allowed her to outmaneuver even the most formidable opponents, and she took great pleasure in doing so.

As she made her way through the throng of guests, Alva's gaze landed on a tall, imposing figure standing at the far end of the room. Joseph Kennedy Jr., the dashing son of Robert F. Kennedy, was a prominent supporter of Roosevelt's New Deal policies – and Alva knew that his support came with its own set of strings.

With a calculated smile, Alva began to make her way towards the younger Kennedy, her heels clicking on the polished floorboards. As she approached, she extended a manicured hand and greeted him warmly. "Mr. Kennedy, it's an absolute pleasure to see you again," she cooed.

Kennedy's eyes crinkled at the corners as he smiled back at Alva. "The pleasure is all mine, Miss Boulanger. You look stunning tonight."

Alva's eyes narrowed slightly – a slight crack in her facade that only the most perceptive observer would notice. She knew that Kennedy was not just charming her with flattery; he was probing for weaknesses, testing the boundaries of their unlikely alliance.

As they chatted and laughed together, Alva deftly steered the conversation towards topics of mutual interest – the latest economic policies, the progress of the New Deal, and the ever-present threat of fascist aggression from abroad. With each passing minute, she expertly wove a web of intrigue around Kennedy, her words dripping with subtle enticements and veiled threats.

And as the night wore on, Alva Boulanger knew that she had achieved her objective – to further cement her position within Roosevelt's inner circle, and to secure Kennedy's continued support for her own agenda. The game of politics was afoot, and she was ready to play it to the end.
