One sunny afternoon, Alva Elisabet Nielsen strolled into the opulent office of the wealthy businessman, Marcus Thompson. She was there to investigate rumors of his shady dealings, and she wasn't leaving until she got to the bottom of it. As she settled into her seat, Thompson smiled smugly at her, thinking he could intimidate her with his wealth and influence.

But Alva Elisabet Nielsen had other plans. With a flick of her pen, she began scribbling notes on her pad, her eyes scanning every inch of the room for clues. She asked pointed questions, her voice dripping with skepticism, as Thompson attempted to deflect her queries.
