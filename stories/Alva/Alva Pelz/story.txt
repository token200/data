Alva Pelz stepped out of her worn leather jacket and onto the damp pavement, the chill of the early morning air biting at her nose. She rubbed the grit from her eyes, the streetlights casting long shadows behind her as she walked towards the small café on 5th Street.

It was a habit she'd developed over the years – rising with the sun to watch the city come alive, and sipping black coffee to clear her head before another day of detective work. Alva's job at the local precinct wasn't glamorous, but it paid the bills and allowed her to stay one step ahead of the scammers and con artists that infested this city.

She pushed open the creaky door and slid onto a stool at the counter, exchanging nods with Joe, the gruff proprietor. He poured her a steaming cup without asking – Alva was a regular here – and slid it down the bar to her along with a wink.

Alva wrapped her hands around the warm mug, feeling the familiar buzz of caffeine coursing through her veins as she gazed out at the city's awakening. She'd always felt most alive when the world outside her window was quiet, the darkness only punctuated by the flicker of streetlights and the occasional car horn.

Her eyes drifted to a photograph pinned to the café's bulletin board – a faded black-and-white snap of herself as a teenager, holding an old family heirloom. Her grandma had been a renowned jeweler, and Alva had always felt a connection to her work. She'd followed in those footsteps for a time, before deciding to leave the fancy world behind and take up detective work.

The sounds of the city swirled around her once more – car horns, chatter, the wail of sirens in the distance – but Alva was tuned out, lost in her own thoughts. She took a sip of coffee, letting it warm her from the inside out as she mentally sifted through the cases on her desk.

There was always another mystery waiting to be solved, another puzzle for her to unravel. And Alva was ready, sharpening her mind and preparing herself for whatever lay ahead. With a quiet sigh, she slid off her stool and headed back out into the morning light, ready to take on whatever the city had in store for her.
