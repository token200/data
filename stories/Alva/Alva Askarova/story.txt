Growing up in a small town, Alva would often sneak away to the local museum, spending hours studying the works of the masters. Her favorite artist was Claude Monet, whose Impressionist style she aspired to emulate. As she honed her skills, Alva's confidence grew, and she began to exhibit her own work in local galleries.
