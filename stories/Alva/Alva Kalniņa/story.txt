Years passed, and Alva Kalniņa's reputation spread beyond the village borders. Merchants and nobles would commission her to create bespoke garments for special occasions, such as weddings and coronations.

One day, a young woman named Laima arrived in Cesis seeking Alva Kalniņa's help. Laima had been struggling with a mysterious illness that had afflicted her family for generations. Desperate for a cure, she begged Alva Kalniņa to weave a special fabric that would heal her condition.

Alva Kalniņa listened intently as Laima described her symptoms and the family's history of suffering. She spent many sleepless nights researching ancient rituals and weaving techniques before finally creating a magnificent tapestry infused with herbs, flowers, and sacred symbols.
