Iveta Kamiński stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of damp earth and decaying leaves filling her lungs. She had been away for what felt like an eternity, chasing the echoes of a past she couldn't quite recall. The memories lingered, though – snippets of laughter, whispered secrets, and the soft glow of candles in a long-forgotten cabin.

As she made her way through the deserted station, Iveta's thoughts turned to her latest obsession: the abandoned mine on the outskirts of town. Rumors swirled that it was haunted by the ghosts of miners who'd perished in a tragic accident. Iveta wasn't one for ghost stories, but there was something about the darkness within those tunnels that drew her in like a moth to flame.

She walked through the forest, the trees looming above her like sentinels, their branches creaking softly in the breeze. The mine loomed ahead, its entrance a yawning mouth of darkness. Iveta took a deep breath and stepped inside, her eyes adjusting slowly to the dim light.

The air was heavy with dust and the stench of decay. Iveta coughed, covering her mouth with her shirt. She fumbled in her bag for a matchbox and lit a candle, the flame casting eerie shadows on the walls. As she made her way deeper into the mine, she began to notice strange symbols etched into the stone – ancient runes that seemed to pulse with a malevolent energy.

Iveta's skin prickled with goosebumps as she realized she was no longer alone. The air seemed to vibrate with an otherworldly presence, and she could feel eyes upon her. She quickened her pace, her heart pounding in her chest. Suddenly, the tunnel split into two paths – one narrow and winding, the other a broad, ominous corridor.

Iveta hesitated, her hand on the candle holder. Which path would lead her to answers? Or deeper into the heart of darkness? With a deep breath, she chose the narrower path, the shadows swallowing her whole.
