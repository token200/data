Iveta Boulanger stepped into the dimly lit jazz club, her eyes scanning the crowded room with a mix of nostalgia and wariness. It had been years since she'd last set foot in this establishment, but the smell of smoke and stale air still brought back memories of late-night conversations and secret meetings.

As a young woman, Iveta had been a rising star in the Parisian music scene, known for her sultry voice and mesmerizing stage presence. She'd performed alongside some of the greatest jazz musicians of the time, but it was her own unique blend of French cabaret and American blues that had truly captured the hearts of audiences.

But that was before the war. Before Iveta's life had been turned upside down by the Nazi occupation of France. Before she'd been forced to flee her home, leaving behind everything and everyone she loved.

Now, as Iveta took a seat at the bar, sipping on a whiskey-fueled nightcap, she couldn't help but feel like a ghost from another era. The music was different now - more polished, more commercialized. Where had the raw emotion gone?

As if sensing her unease, the bartender, a gruff but kind-eyed man named Marcel, sidled over to her. "Iveta, ch√®re," he said, his voice low and conspiratorial. "It's been too long."

Iveta smiled wryly, her eyes drifting out onto the crowd. She spotted a familiar face in the room - a young woman with a look of fierce determination in her eyes.

"Who's that?" Iveta asked Marcel, nodding toward the stranger.

Marcel followed her gaze, his expression unreadable. "That's Camille," he said finally. "She's been singing here for a few nights now. Has a voice like honey and smoke."

Iveta raised an eyebrow. There was something about Camille that seemed...familiar. Like a whisper in the wind.

As she listened to Camille's performance - a raw, anguished rendition of a forgotten song - Iveta felt a shiver run down her spine. This girl had been born for this moment, just as she had been.

In that instant, Iveta knew that she'd found a kindred spirit, someone who understood the depths of their own experience. The war was over, but its legacy lived on in the voices and hearts of those who'd survived it.

As Camille took her final bow, Iveta rose from her seat, her eyes locked on the young singer. "Come with me," she whispered to Marcel, a plan already forming in her mind.

"Where are we going?" Marcel asked, his voice laced with curiosity.

Iveta's smile was enigmatic. "Somewhere the music never stops."
