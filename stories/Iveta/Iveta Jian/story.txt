Iveta Jian stepped into the small, cluttered café on a crisp winter morning. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, enticing her to sit down at one of the worn wooden tables by the window. As she unwrapped her scarf, a flutter in her chest betrayed her usual composure.

Iveta was known for her razor-sharp intellect and analytical mind, making her an indispensable asset to the team at Quantum Innovations, where she worked as a software engineer. However, beneath the polished exterior, Iveta harbored a deep-seated secret: she was an avid poet.

As she sipped her coffee, Iveta's thoughts wandered to the words that had been flowing from her pen for months now – fragmented verses about love, loss, and longing. Her friends at work found it peculiar that their brilliant colleague would spend hours scribbling poetry in a worn notebook. But Iveta knew that this creative outlet was what set her apart.

Just then, Rachel, her closest friend since childhood, walked into the café, her bright smile illuminating the quiet space. "Hey, genius! What brings you here?" she asked, nodding toward Iveta's book.

Iveta hesitated before setting down her coffee and pulling out the worn notebook from her bag. She handed it to Rachel, who flipped through its yellowed pages with a mixture of surprise and curiosity.

As they sat together in comfortable silence, scanning the pages, Iveta realized that sharing her poetry was not about validation but about connection – connecting with someone who could see beyond the façade she presented to the world. For the first time, Iveta felt like being seen.

Rachel's eyes widened as she read through the raw emotions and introspection on each page. "Wow, I had no idea!" she exclaimed. "You're so talented!"

Iveta laughed softly. No one ever called her "talented" before; they always spoke of her accomplishments in code or innovation. Her voice, usually steady, cracked with emotion.

The café door swung open, and a young couple walked in, giggling together as they ordered their drinks. Iveta watched them, noticing the way the woman's eyes sparkled when she laughed – something that resonated deeply within her own heart, long-dormant poetry and all.

As the couple left with cups in hand, Rachel turned back to Iveta, a question sparkling in her eyes. "Iveta? Can I ask you something?"

"Of course," Iveta replied, feeling an unfamiliar warmth spread through her chest.

"Do you think there's beauty in both the world of code and...life?"
