Iveta Shinichi stepped off the crowded train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of familiarity. A stranger in a foreign land, she had been forced to leave her home in Prague behind, seeking refuge from the weight of her past.

As she made her way through the throngs of people, Iveta's thoughts turned to her family, who had struggled to come to terms with her own dark history. Her parents had always warned her of the dangers of being different, and now it seemed that very difference was what had led her here.

She spotted a small caf√© across the street and made her way towards it, hoping to find some solace in its quiet atmosphere. Inside, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee enveloped her, and she took a seat at the bar, ordering a cup of black coffee from the attentive bartender.

As she waited for her drink to arrive, Iveta couldn't help but feel like an outsider in this new world. Her eyes, an unnatural shade of green, seemed to draw attention from everyone she met, and she found herself wondering if anyone truly accepted her for who she was.

The door swung open, and a young woman with piercing blue eyes walked in, her gaze sweeping across the room until it landed on Iveta. For a moment, they simply stared at one another, an unspoken connection forming between them.

"Mind if I join you?" the stranger asked, nodding towards the empty stool beside Iveta.

"Not at all," Iveta replied, a small smile playing on her lips as she gestured for the woman to take a seat.

As they sipped their coffee together, Iveta found herself opening up to this stranger in ways she hadn't been able to with anyone else. The woman listened intently, her eyes sparkling with curiosity and compassion.

"I'm Luna," the stranger said finally, extending a hand.

"Iveta Shinichi," Iveta replied, taking Luna's hand in hers.

For the first time since leaving Prague, Iveta felt like she was home. Like she had found someone who saw beyond the darkness of her past and accepted her for who she truly was.
