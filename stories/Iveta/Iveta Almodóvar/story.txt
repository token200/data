Iveta Almodóvar stepped into the crowded café, scanning the room for her friend's familiar smile. She spotted Ana María in the corner, sipping a cup of strong coffee and chatting with a stranger. Iveta made her way through the throng of people, exchanging hellos and laughter with acquaintances.

As she approached her friend's table, Ana María caught sight of her and beckoned her over. "Iveta, come sit down! I've got some news to share." Iveta sat beside her, intrigued by the excitement in her voice.

Ana María leaned in, lowering her voice. "I've been accepted into a prestigious art program in Madrid. It's going to be a whirlwind year, but I know it'll be worth it." Iveta beamed with pride for her friend, who had always dreamed of pursuing a career in the arts.

The two friends chatted long into the afternoon, discussing everything from their shared love of 19th-century literature to their plans for travel. As they talked, the sounds of the café faded into the background, and it felt as though they were the only ones left in the world.

As the hours passed, Iveta realized that she had forgotten all about her own errands for the day. But when she looked over at Ana María, who was scribbling notes on a napkin with her pen, Iveta's thoughts turned to their shared passion for writing. Maybe it was time for Iveta Almodóvar to start working on her novel again – the one that had been lingering in the back of her mind for months.

As they prepared to leave, Ana María reached out and took Iveta's hand. "You know what? I think we should make a pact. If you finish your manuscript before me, I'll read it and give you my honest opinion." Iveta grinned, knowing that with a friend like Ana María by her side, she'd be able to push through any creative blocks that came her way.
