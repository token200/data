Iveta Ozols was a woman with a passion for photography that rivaled her love for life itself. Born to a family of artists in Riga, Latvia, Iveta had grown up surrounded by canvases, paintbrushes, and the endless possibilities of the creative world. As she grew older, her interest shifted from painting to capturing moments through the lens of her camera.

Iveta's photography career took off when she began exhibiting her work at local galleries in Riga. Her unique perspective and eye for detail quickly gained attention from critics and collectors alike. Before long, Iveta Ozols was in high demand, traveling the world to capture images that told stories of hope, love, and resilience.

One day, while wandering through a small village in rural Latvia, Iveta stumbled upon an old woman who would change her life forever. The woman, with eyes that seemed to see right through her, shared with Iveta the secrets of traditional Latvian folk medicine. Enchanted by the stories and rituals passed down through generations, Iveta Ozols knew she had found a new passion.

As she delved deeper into the world of traditional medicine, Iveta began to incorporate elements of it into her photography. She started documenting the healing practices and people who were working tirelessly to preserve these ancient traditions. Her images told powerful stories of community, perseverance, and the human spirit.

Years went by, and Iveta Ozols' work continued to gain international recognition. But more than anything, she was grateful for the opportunity to share the stories of the women and men who were keeping their culture alive. And as she looked through her lens, Iveta knew that she had found her true purpose â€“ using her camera as a tool to preserve the beauty and wisdom of the past.

Iveta Ozols' photographs have since become an integral part of museums and private collections around the world. But for Iveta, it was never about the recognition or fame; it was always about sharing the stories that needed to be told.
