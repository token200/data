Iveta Trevisan stepped out of the fog-shrouded streets of Prague and onto the worn cobblestones of the old town square. Her long, dark hair was tied back in a loose knot, revealing a face that seemed chiseled from the same stone as the Gothic spires surrounding her. She wore a fitted velvet coat, its crimson hue a stark contrast to the dull gray of the city's atmosphere.

As she navigated through the crowded market stalls, Iveta's eyes scanned the vendors with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. Her reputation preceded her: that of a master thief, known for stealing the most valuable treasures without leaving a single clue behind. Some said she was cursed, born with the luck of the devil himself.

Iveta had grown up on the streets of Prague, surviving by her wits and stealth. She had lost count of how many times she'd narrowly escaped capture, but one thing was certain – she would never be tied down. Not to a man, not to a life, not even to her own desires.

A gust of wind swept through the square, sending vendors scrambling to secure their wares. Iveta spotted an opportunity and darted between the stalls, weaving past a pair of burly guards who eyed her with hostility. She bypassed a stall selling intricately carved wooden figurines and snatched a glittering gemstone from its display case.

As she vanished into the crowd, a lone figure emerged from the shadows. He was tall and lean, his eyes fixed intently on Iveta's retreating form. He wore a black coat with a silver pin in the shape of a serpent – the mark of the Order of the Nightwatch, an organization rumored to be hunting her down.

Iveta didn't dare look back, but she could feel the weight of the Nightwatch's gaze upon her. She quickened her pace, the gemstone clutched tightly in her fist. The streets seemed to stretch on forever, but she knew these alleys and courtyards like the back of her hand.

As she disappeared into the fog-shrouded night, Iveta couldn't shake the feeling that she was being pulled toward a trap – or perhaps, toward something more sinister than she had ever imagined. For in this city of shadow and secrecy, nothing was as it seemed, and Iveta Trevisan was about to become a pawn in a game far larger than herself.
