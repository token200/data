Lily MÃ¤kinen sat at her desk, staring blankly at the computer screen in front of her. As a freelance journalist, she had grown accustomed to the loneliness of her job, but it didn't make it any easier when the deadline for her latest article loomed.

A Finnish native, Lily had always been drawn to the darker side of life - true crime stories, abandoned asylums, and forgotten history books filled her nights with eerie fascination. Her editor at the Helsinki Times had taken notice of her unique perspective and given her a chance to write about one of Finland's most infamous unsolved murders.

The article was going to be on the case of Taneli Ohtonen, a young sailor whose body had been found on a deserted island off the coast of Turku five years ago. The police had closed the case, but Lily knew she had stumbled upon something bigger - a web of secrets and lies that went all the way to the top.

As she typed away at her story, Lily's mind wandered back to the days when she was younger, exploring the forests and lakes of her hometown with her grandfather. He had been a sailor himself, and his stories of the sea were always filled with mystery and adventure. She remembered how he would tell tales of hidden coves and sunken ships, of curses and legends that haunted the Finnish coast.

Lily's thoughts snapped back to reality as she heard a knock at the door. It was her best friend, Sofia, who had stopped by to bring over some fresh fish from the market. As they chatted about everything except work, Lily couldn't help but feel a pang of envy towards Sofia's life - stable, comfortable, and free from the constant pressure of deadlines.

But as she watched Sofia devour the grilled salmon with a look of pure delight on her face, Lily knew that she wouldn't trade this job for anything. There was something about digging into the darkness, about uncovering secrets that nobody else cared to, that drew her in like a moth to a flame.

As the night wore on and the hours ticked by, Lily finally finished her article. She read through it one last time, making sure everything was perfect before hitting send. And then she leaned back in her chair, ready to take on whatever came next - the Finnish coast, with all its secrets and mysteries, had her number.
