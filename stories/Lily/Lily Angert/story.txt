One day, while researching a tip about a local businessman, Lily stumbled upon a suspicious transaction that seemed too good (or bad) to be true. She was immediately intrigued and decided to dig deeper.

Over the course of several days, Lily poured over financial records, spoke with sources close to the businessman, and followed a trail of breadcrumbs that led her to a seedy underground deal.
