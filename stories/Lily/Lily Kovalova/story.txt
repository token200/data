Lily Kovalova stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any signs of life. It had been years since she'd set foot in this rural town, and yet the familiarity of the old building and the smell of diesel fuel still felt like home.

As a child, Lily had spent summers with her grandparents here, playing in the fields and forests just outside of town. She remembered the countless afternoons spent exploring the creek, skipping stones across the water, and watching the fish dart about beneath the surface. Her grandfather used to tell her stories of the old country, of her great-great-grandmother who had immigrated from Poland with nothing but a suitcase full of hope.

Lily's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps behind her. She turned to see a woman in her mid-30s, with a kind face and a mop of curly brown hair, approaching her. "Lily Kovalova?" the woman asked, her eyes widening in surprise.

"Katy!" Lily exclaimed, surprised that the woman knew her name. They had been friends since kindergarten, but Katy had long since left the town to make a life for herself in the city.

As they hugged, Katy pulled back and eyed Lily's worn leather jacket and faded jeans. "You look like you've been traveling," she said, nodding towards Lily's luggage. "What brings you back?"

Lily shrugged, feeling a mix of emotions. She had come to visit her grandparents' graves, to pay her respects and say goodbye for good. Her grandfather had passed away a year ago, but Lily still missed him dearly.

Katy listened attentively as Lily told her the story of her journey, of how she'd felt lost and alone on the train ride back to the town where it all began. As they talked, the station fell quiet around them, the only sound the distant hum of the engine and the rustling of leaves in the breeze.

When Lily finished speaking, Katy reached out and took her hand, giving it a gentle squeeze. "Welcome home, Lily Kovalova," she said softly. And in that moment, Lily knew that she was exactly where she needed to be.
