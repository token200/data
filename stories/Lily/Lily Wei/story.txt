Lily Mei-ling Wei had always been fascinated by the mystical world of Feng Shui. As a young woman with a passion for architecture and design, she spent countless hours studying the ancient art of balancing energies in a given space. Her parents, both successful business owners, encouraged her pursuits, but often found themselves bewildered by her fascination with "ancient superstitions."

As Lily Mei-ling Wei delved deeper into the world of Feng Shui, she began to notice the subtle yet profound effects it had on people's lives. A well-placed crystal or strategically arranged mirror could alter the trajectory of someone's destiny, or so she believed. Her friends and family would often tease her about her "woo-woo" interests, but Lily Mei-ling Wei didn't care. She was convinced that there was truth to the ancient art.

One fateful evening, as she was working on a new design project, a mysterious stranger walked into her studio. Tall, with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair, he introduced himself as Kaito, an expert in Feng Shui from Tokyo. Enchanted by his presence, Lily Mei-ling Wei found herself opening up to him about her passions and interests.

Over steaming cups of jasmine tea, Kaito shared stories of the ancient art's power to transform lives. He revealed to her that the Chinese zodiac was more than just a calendar – it held secrets to understanding human nature and destiny. As they talked long into the night, Lily Mei-ling Wei felt an unexpected connection to this stranger from Tokyo.

As Kaito prepared to leave, he handed Lily Mei-ling Wei a small crystal pendant on a silver chain. "This will guide you," he whispered. She accepted it with gratitude, feeling a sudden surge of energy course through her veins. From that moment on, Lily Mei-ling Wei knew that her journey as a Feng Shui practitioner was just beginning – and she was eager to see where the ancient art would take her.
