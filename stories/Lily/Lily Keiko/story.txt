She studied hard and eventually landed an internship with a prestigious research organization, where she worked alongside some of the top experts in her field. Her dedication and work ethic earned her a coveted spot on a team tasked with monitoring a critical marine sanctuary.

One day, while conducting a survey of the sanctuary's ecosystem, Lily Keiko stumbled upon a hidden cove teeming with life.
