Błażej Fernández stepped off the plane, his worn leather boots making a soft thud on the hot airport tarmac. He adjusted his battered baseball cap and surveyed his surroundings with a practiced air of disinterest. This wasn't his first time in the city, but it was always a new experience.

As he made his way through customs, Błażej's mind began to wander back to the streets of Buenos Aires, where he had grown up playing futsal and dreaming of escape. He had left years ago, taking on odd jobs and building a reputation as a skilled mechanic. But something had always felt off, like there was more out there for him.

Now, at thirty-five, Błażej found himself in Warsaw, Poland, working on his own car repairs business. It wasn't glamorous, but it paid the bills and gave him the freedom to roam.

He hailed a taxi outside the airport and headed towards the old town, taking in the historic architecture as they drove by. Błażej had always been fascinated by Eastern European history, and Warsaw was like a time capsule – old buildings, forgotten streets, and secrets lurking around every corner.

As he checked into his small flat on the outskirts of the city, Błażej noticed a peculiar poster tacked to the wall near the fridge. It depicted a young girl with piercing blue eyes and jet-black hair, her face framed by the words "Search for me" in bold letters.

Błażej's curiosity was piqued. He wondered who this girl might be, what she had gotten herself into, and why someone would post about it on public notice.

The next day, Błażej walked through the winding streets of the old town, searching for answers about the mysterious poster. He spoke to locals, showing them a picture of the girl, but no one seemed to recognize her. Frustrated, he decided to seek out some advice from his friend, Marek.

Marek owned a small antique shop in the heart of the city and had an ear for every rumour that came through Warsaw's streets. Over a cup of coffee, Błażej showed him the poster and asked if he knew anything about it.

Marek's expression turned thoughtful as he sipped his coffee. "There is a legend," he said finally. "About a girl with those eyes. She was lost in the city many years ago."
