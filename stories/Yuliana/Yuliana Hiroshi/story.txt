Born to a Japanese mother and Brazilian father, Yuliana had grown up surrounded by the diverse culture of her homeland. She had honed her skills on the streets, learning how to pick locks, pick pockets, and talk her way out of sticky situations. As she matured, Yuliana became increasingly restless, yearning for something more than the simple thrill of the heist.

That was when she stumbled upon an old, leather-bound book hidden away in a dusty antique shop. The tome belonged to a notorious thief from Yuliana's past, and as she flipped through its yellowed pages, she discovered a code that would change her life forever.

In this instant, Yuliana Hiroshi was free, lost in the thrill of the heist, and the rush of adrenaline coursing through her veins.

The legend of Yuliana Hiroshi lived on, etched in the annals of thievery, forever etching her name as one of the greatest thieves of all time.
