Yuliana Salonen stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the small station as if searching for something. It had been years since she'd set foot in this quaint Finnish town, but memories came flooding back with every step. Her grandmother used to take her here on summer days when Yuliana was a child, watching the lake shimmer in the sunlight and listening to the sound of seagulls overhead.

Yuliana's thoughts were interrupted by the familiar sound of her phone buzzing in her pocket. She pulled it out to find a text from an unknown number: "Meet me at the old oak tree. Come alone." A shiver ran down her spine as she read the message, her mind racing with possibilities.

She had always been a bit of a mystery to herself, and lately, there had been whispers that Yuliana Salonen was more than just a simple small-town girl. Some said she possessed a hidden talent for healing, passed down from her grandmother's line. Others claimed she could communicate with the spirits of the dead.

Yuliana didn't know what to believe, but she couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more to her life. She made her way through the station, dodging fishermen and tourists as they went about their day. The lake loomed before her, its surface calm and inviting.

As she approached the old oak tree, a figure emerged from behind it. Yuliana's heart skipped a beat as she saw that it was Juhani, a boy from her childhood who had always been trouble. He was tall now, with piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through her.

"Yuli," he whispered, his voice low and husky. "I've been searching for you."

Yuliana's hand flew to her mouth as she felt the memories of their past flood back. She had thought they were just kids playing a game of tag, but now she saw the truth in Juhani's eyes: they were meant for something more.

"What do you want from me?" Yuliana asked, trying to sound calm despite the butterflies in her stomach.

"I've been searching for answers," Juhani replied, his eyes locked on hers. "And I think I've found them in you."

As the sun began to set over the lake, casting a golden glow over the water, Yuliana felt the threads of her past and present begin to weave together. She knew that her life would never be the same again, not now that Juhani had shown up on her doorstep with secrets and promises.
