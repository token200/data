I couldn't find any information on a person named Yuliana Huffington. However, I believe you may be referring to Arianna Huffington, who is a well-known entrepreneur and author.

Arianna Huffington is best known for co-founding The Huffington Post, a popular online news aggregator and blog network. After a series of health scares and a devastating breakup with her fianc√©, Arianna took a step back from the fast-paced world of journalism to focus on her own well-being.

As she sat in silence, meditating and practicing yoga, Arianna had an epiphany - she realized that she had been living her life according to other people's expectations, rather than her own. This moment of clarity sparked a journey of self-discovery and introspection, which would eventually lead to the creation of her new venture: Thrive Global.

Arianna Huffington is now the founder and CEO of Thrive Global, a non-profit organization dedicated to improving well-being and reducing stress in the workplace. She has written several bestselling books on the subject, including "Thrive" and "The Sleep Revolution".

One of Arianna's most significant achievements as an entrepreneur was her ability to balance her work and personal life. Despite being one of the most influential women in media, she made sure to prioritize her own well-being and take breaks when needed. This approach has inspired countless people around the world to reevaluate their priorities and make self-care a central part of their daily routine.

As Arianna Huffington continues to inspire and empower people through her work, it's clear that her journey is one of personal growth and transformation. From her early days as a journalist to her current role as CEO of Thrive Global, she has consistently demonstrated a commitment to living a life of purpose and meaning.
