As Yuliana grew older, her talent became increasingly evident. She began performing at local concerts and festivals, quickly gaining a reputation as one of Estonia's most promising young violinists. Her full name, Yuliana Järv, was often mentioned alongside hers, as she was often paired with her parents for performances.

One day, the opportunity arose for Yuliana to perform at the prestigious Tallinn Music Festival. She had always dreamed of sharing her music on that iconic stage, and now it seemed like a reality. With the help of her family, including her full name being mentioned in promotional materials as part of a collaborative effort, she prepared tirelessly for the big event.
