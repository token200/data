One fateful evening, as Bernard Deschamps sat in his dimly lit office, puffing on his signature cigar, a knock at the door broke the silence. It was his trusted sidekick, Emily Wilson, with a look of utmost urgency on her face.

"Bernard Deschamps," she said, "we've got a doozy of a case for you."

Intrigued, Bernard Deschamps rose from his seat and followed Emily to the crime scene. The victim was none other than wealthy businessman, Richard Langley, found dead in his mansion with no signs of forced entry or struggle.

As they surveyed the area, Bernard Deschamps noticed a small, almost imperceptible scratch on the wall near the victim's body. His eyes lit up as he realized that this might be the key to unraveling the mystery.

"Emily," he said, "let's take a closer look at this scratch. I think it might be more than just a coincidence."

Together, they carefully examined the scratch and discovered that it was actually a hidden code. Decoding the message revealed a shocking twist: Richard Langley had been blackmailing several high-profile figures in the city, using secrets he had gathered through his business dealings.

With this new information, Bernard Deschamps began to piece together the events leading up to the murder. He discovered that one of the blackmailed individuals had been desperate enough to take matters into their own hands.
