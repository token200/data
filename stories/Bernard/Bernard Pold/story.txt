As a child, Bernard had always been fascinated by the supernatural. He spent hours poring over dusty old books on the occult, much to the dismay of his parents. "Bernard Pold, you're going to turn into a ghost!" they would cry, but he just couldn't get enough of it.

As he grew older, Bernard's interest in the paranormal only deepened. He began to explore the world of psychic readings and mediumship, much to the amusement of his friends. "Bernard Pold, you're going to be the next big thing!" they would tease, but he just shrugged it off.

Despite the skepticism, Bernard was undeterred. He spent years honing his skills, studying the ancient arts of divination and spiritualism. And slowly but surely, people began to take notice. Word got out about the "Bernard Pold" who could predict your fortune with uncanny accuracy, and before long, he had a waiting list a mile long.

One day, a particularly skeptical client came to Bernard's table, demanding that he prove his abilities once and for all. Bernard smiled sweetly and began to shuffle a deck of cards, his eyes glazing over as he connected with the spirit world. The client watched in amazement as Bernard's fingers moved with lightning speed, laying out a seemingly random pattern on the table.

And then, in a voice that sent shivers down the client's spine, Bernard declared: "You will meet your true love within the next six months!" The client was stunned, and from that day on, Bernard Pold was hailed as a master of his craft. He went on to build a reputation as one of the most sought-after psychics in the land, all thanks to his unwavering dedication to the mysterious arts.
