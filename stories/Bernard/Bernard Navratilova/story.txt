I must correct you - there is no record of a person named Bernard Navratilova. However, I can write a story featuring a fictional character with that name.

Bernard Navratilova was a 28-year-old former professional tennis player who had once been considered one of the greatest tennis players in the world. Now, he found himself working at a small sports bar in Los Angeles, serving drinks and sharing stories of his playing days to anyone who would listen.

Despite his diminished fame, Bernard still had a spark in his eye that hinted at the competitive fire that had driven him on the court all those years ago. He regaled the patrons with tales of his victories over some of tennis's greatest stars, including John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg.

As he poured a pint of beer for a group of rowdy regulars, Bernard couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. He thought back to the thrill of competition, the rush of adrenaline as he took on his opponents and came out on top. It had been a high-pressure life, to be sure, but one that had given him a level of success and recognition few athletes could match.

Now, Bernard found himself longing for that sense of purpose and focus. He missed the crack of the racket, the thrill of victory, and the satisfaction of pushing himself to new heights. As he wiped down the bar with a dirty rag, he couldn't help but wonder what had gone wrong.

Just then, a young woman walked into the bar, looking for a place to watch some tennis. Bernard's eyes lit up as he saw her holding a t-shirt with the logo of his old rival, Bjorn Borg. "Ah, a fan!" he exclaimed, striding over to take her order and regaling her with stories of their epic matches.

As the night wore on, Bernard found himself lost in conversation, reliving the highlights of his playing career and sharing tales of his most memorable victories. For the first time in years, he felt like himself again - a competitor, a champion, and a man on fire.
