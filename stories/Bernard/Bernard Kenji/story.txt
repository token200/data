Bernard Kenji was a man shrouded in mystery. His eyes, an unnerving shade of blue, seemed to hold secrets that only he knew. His sharp jawline and chiseled features made him look like a chameleon, blending seamlessly into his surroundings.

A native of Tokyo, Bernard had grown up on the streets, surviving by his wits and cunning. He had always been drawn to the shadows, where he could observe and learn without being seen. As a result, he had developed an uncanny ability to read people, to discern their true intentions from beneath the surface.

Bernard's skills as a "watcher" had earned him a reputation among Tokyo's underworld, a network of informants and enforcers who relied on his expertise to stay one step ahead of their enemies. His connections went all the way to the top, where he was whispered about in hushed tones by the city's most powerful figures.

One day, a wealthy businessman named Taro approached Bernard with a proposal. Taro had heard rumors of a valuable artifact hidden deep within the Tokyo subway system and wanted someone with Bernard's unique skills to help him retrieve it.

The catch: the artifact was said to be cursed, rumored to drive its possessors mad with greed. Bernard, ever the pragmatist, didn't care about curses or superstitions; he only cared about getting paid.

Together, Bernard and Taro navigated the labyrinthine tunnels beneath Tokyo, avoiding deadly traps and rival treasure hunters along the way. As they delved deeper into the system, Bernard's eyes grew more intent, his gaze slicing through the darkness like a hot knife through butter.

Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, they reached the artifact: a small, golden statue nestled within a velvet-lined coffin. But as soon as Bernard touched it, he felt a jolt of electricity run through his body. The statue seemed to sear itself into his mind, its presence echoing in every cell of his being.

Taro watched with growing unease as Bernard's expression changed, his eyes going wide and unblinking. For a moment, the two men were locked in a silent understanding: Taro had underestimated the true nature of the artifact, and now he was paying the price.

With Bernard firmly under his control, Taro made his escape, leaving the statue and its dark magic behind. But as they emerged into the bright lights of Tokyo, Bernard couldn't shake the feeling that something had changed within him. The statue's power pulsed through his veins, threatening to consume him whole.
