One rainy evening, a mysterious woman walked into Bernard Dupuis's office, her eyes brimming with tears. She introduced herself as Sarah, a young artist who had been accused of stealing a priceless painting from a local gallery. The owner, a wealthy businessman named Mr. Jenkins, was determined to get his money back, no matter the cost.

Bernard Dupuis listened intently as Sarah recounted her side of the story. He asked pointed questions, poking holes in the prosecution's case and revealing inconsistencies in their testimony.

As the rain poured outside, Bernard Dupuis sat back in his chair, puffing on his cigar. His eyes narrowed as he pondered the next case, already mentally preparing himself for whatever lay ahead. He was Bernard Dupuis, detective turned private investigator - and he would not rest until justice was served.
