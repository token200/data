Bernard Ryota stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the unfamiliar station. He had been traveling for days, and the exhaustion was starting to catch up with him. As he made his way through the crowds, a small figure caught his attention - a young woman with piercing green eyes and curly brown hair.

"Excuse me," she said, approaching Bernard with a hesitant smile. "Are you looking for the Ryota estate?"

Bernard's curiosity was piqued. He had received a letter from an unknown sender, inviting him to meet someone at this very station. "Who are you?" he asked, eyeing the woman warily.

"My name is Emiko," she replied, producing a small business card from her pocket. "I'm here to discuss some... matters of family."

Bernard's heart skipped a beat as he took the card. Ryota was his father's surname - but he had never met anyone with that name before. His father had passed away when he was just a child, and all he knew about his family was what he had learned from others.

"What kind of matters?" Bernard asked, curiosity getting the better of him.

Emiko hesitated, glancing around nervously before leaning in close. "Your father's estate is being sold," she whispered. "Someone has been trying to get their hands on it for years."

Bernard's eyes narrowed. He had always assumed that his family was wealthy and influential - but now he realized that there were others who wanted a piece of the Ryota legacy.

As they walked towards the estate, Bernard felt a sense of unease growing inside him. Who was this woman, really? And what did she want from him?

When they arrived at the grand mansion, Emiko led Bernard through the rooms, pointing out various family heirlooms and artifacts. It was like stepping into a dream - but also a nightmare.

"This is all so... surreal," Bernard said, feeling like he was walking through someone else's life.

Emiko smiled wryly. "I know how you feel," she said. "But trust me, this is just the beginning. You have a lot to learn about your family, and yourself."

As they stood in front of his father's old study, Bernard felt a sense of trepidation wash over him. What secrets lay hidden within these walls? And what would happen if he uncovered them all?
