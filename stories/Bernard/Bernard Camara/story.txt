Bernard Camara walked into the dimly lit café, scanning the room for familiar faces. It was a rare evening off from his work as a journalist, and he had decided to unwind with a cup of coffee and some good company. As he waited in line, he noticed a figure sitting at the bar, nursing a whiskey on the rocks.

"Mind if I join you?" Bernard asked, nodding towards the empty stool beside the stranger.

The man looked up, his piercing blue eyes locking onto Bernard's. "Not at all," he replied, extending a hand. "I'm Bernard Camara."

Bernard chuckled, feeling a strange sense of déjà vu. "Well, I suppose that's fitting then," he said, shaking hands.

As they ordered their drinks and sat down, the conversation flowed easily. They talked about everything from politics to pop culture, finding common ground in their shared love of literature. Bernard was drawn to the man's wit and intelligence, feeling a connection he hadn't experienced in a long time.

Over coffee and whiskey, they delved deeper into each other's lives. The stranger, it turned out, was a writer himself, working on his first novel. Bernard found himself inspired by the man's passion and creativity, feeling a spark of renewed purpose within himself.

As the night wore on, Bernard realized he had forgotten what time it was. He glanced at his watch, surprised to see that the evening had slipped away unnoticed. The stranger, sensing his friendliness began to fade, stood up to leave.

"Thank you for an incredible evening," Bernard said, standing up to escort him out. "I'm glad I ran into... well, me."

The man smiled, a hint of mischief dancing in his eyes. "I'll make sure to remember that next time we meet," he said, winking before disappearing into the night.

Bernard watched him go, feeling a sense of gratitude and wonder. He couldn't wait to see what other unexpected connections life had in store for him. As he walked home, lost in thought, he couldn't help but smile at the serendipity that had brought him together with his new friend, Bernard Camara.
