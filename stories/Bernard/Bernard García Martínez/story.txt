Bernard García Martínez was a man shrouded in mystery, with an aura of quiet confidence that commanded attention without demanding it. A former Spanish journalist turned private investigator, he had built a reputation for being one of the most skilled and tenacious sleuths in Madrid.

Born and raised in the historic neighborhood of La Latina, Bernard grew up surrounded by the city's winding streets and vibrant markets. His early life was marked by hardship and loss, but it also instilled in him a fierce determination to succeed. After serving his time in prison for a crime he didn't commit, Bernard turned to journalism as a way to tell stories that needed to be told.

As a journalist, Bernard gained a reputation for being fearless and relentless in pursuit of truth. He wrote about corruption, organized crime, and social injustices, often putting himself at risk in the process. But it was his final story that changed everything: a exposé on a corrupt government contract that put him directly in the crosshairs of those he had exposed.

Sentenced to three years in prison for "inciting unrest," Bernard spent what felt like an eternity locked away, waiting for his sentence to be commuted. But when it finally came through, he vowed never to spend another day behind bars. Instead, he turned his skills as a journalist into a career as a private investigator, determined to use his talents for good rather than to expose the truth.

As Bernard sat in his cramped office above the tavern in Malasaña, sipping on a worn-out cup of coffee and staring out at the vibrant street below, he couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness. There were always cases that needed solving, stories that needed telling. And Bernard was ready to take them all on.

Suddenly, his phone rang, shrill and insistent. "Ah," Bernard said, with a hint of anticipation in his voice, "I think I have one." He listened intently as the caller spoke, his eyes narrowing into slits as he took mental notes. It seemed that a wealthy businessman had gone missing, and no one knew where to look.

With a quiet smile, Bernard pushed back from his desk, rose from his chair, and began to pace. The game was on.
