Bernard Moreno Martinez was known for his extraordinary talent in music, particularly in the Latin American genre. Growing up in a humble household, Bernard's love for music was fostered by his mother, who was an avid listener of traditional folk songs from Colombia and Mexico.

As he grew older, Bernard's passion for music only intensified, leading him to pursue a career as a singer-songwriter. He spent countless hours perfecting his craft, studying the works of legendary musicians such as Juanes and Shakira.
