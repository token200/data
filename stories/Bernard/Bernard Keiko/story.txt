Excited by his discovery, Bernard Keiko immediately shared the news with his team, and together they set out to uncover the secrets of Tanis. And so, after months of tireless work, they finally stumbled upon the lost city, its ruins shrouded in mystery and dust.

As Bernard stood before the ancient temple, he felt a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over him. He had done it – he had uncovered the truth. The phoenix had risen from the ashes, just as his grandmother had once told him. And now, Bernard Keiko knew that he was ready to face whatever adventures lay ahead.

For this man of mystery and intrigue, the thrill of discovery was addictive, and Bernard Keiko knew that he would spend the rest of his life uncovering the secrets of the past, one ancient text at a time.
