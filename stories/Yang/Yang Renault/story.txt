Below her, the sounds of laughter and music drifted up from the club's main gathering spot. Yang Renault's gaze lingered on a group of young riders, their faces flushed with excitement as they spun tales of their latest exploits. She smiled slightly, remembering when she had once been like them - reckless, carefree, and full of life.

As she descended back into the club, Yang Renault was greeted by her second-in-command, Marcus. "Yang, we've got a problem," he said, his voice low and urgent. "One of our riders has gone missing. The cops are starting to sniff around."

Yang Renault's expression hardened. She knew that when it came to her people, she would stop at nothing to keep them safe. "Find out what happened to him," she ordered Marcus. "And make sure those coppers don't get their hands on our business."

With a nod, Marcus turned and disappeared into the crowded club, leaving Yang Renault to survey the scene before her. She spotted a handful of Vipers riding in from the city, their bikes roaring as they weaved through the crowded streets.

Yang Renault watched them with a critical eye, assessing the numbers and the skill level of each rider. It was going to be a long night, but she was ready for whatever lay ahead. As leader of the Red Vipers, Yang Renault Renault would fight tooth and nail to protect her people, no matter what it took.

The sound of engines grew louder, and Yang Renault's eyes flicked to the horizon, where a sea of red and black bikes threatened to engulf the city. She smiled grimly - tonight was going to be a night she would never forget.
