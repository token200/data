But something about the merchant's words resonated with him. He felt a sense of purpose in accepting the challenge, and his hands began to move with renewed energy. For weeks, he worked tirelessly on the statue, pouring his heart into its creation. When it was finally complete, the merchants eyes widened in awe as he beheld the magnificent piece.

Yang Briedis smiled humbly as the merchant thanked him profusely. He knew that this project would be remembered for years to come – a testament to his skills and dedication as a master carpenter.
