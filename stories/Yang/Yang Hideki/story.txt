Yang Hideki trudged through the snow-covered streets, her long coat flapping behind her like a dark wing. As a member of the prestigious Kaito Academy's detective club, she had been tasked with solving the mysterious disappearance of one of their classmates.

Hideki's eyes scanned the crowded market square, searching for any sign of her missing friend, Emily Wilson. The streets were bustling with students on winter break, but Hideki knew that time was of the essence if they were to find Emily before it was too late.

She stopped at a small café, ordering a hot chocolate to warm herself up. As she sipped her drink, Hideki's mind replayed the events leading up to Emily's disappearance. They had been working on a group project together, but on the night of the incident, Emily had received a mysterious message that had sent her into a panic.

Hideki pulled out her phone and scrolled through the messages, searching for any clues that might lead her to Emily. She knew that the detective club was getting close to uncovering some secrets within the school's administration, but she couldn't shake off the feeling that they were in over their heads.

As she walked away from the café, Hideki's gaze fell upon a figure watching her from across the street. It was Taro Yamada, one of the club's senior members and an old friend. He nodded at her, indicating for her to follow him.

Hideki quickened her pace, catching up with Taro as they walked through the winding alleys of the old town. They stopped in front of a dilapidated warehouse, where Taro produced a key and unlocked the door.

Inside, Hideki saw a makeshift room filled with files, notes, and photographs. It was clear that someone had been searching for evidence, but who? And what did they hope to find?

Hideki's eyes widened as she realized that the search was not just about finding Emily, but about unraveling a larger conspiracy that threatened the very foundations of Kaito Academy.
