Yang Schafer was known for her unorthodox approach to problem-solving. As a renowned detective, she had a knack for thinking outside the box and uncovering clues that others missed.

One rainy evening, Yang Schafer received a cryptic message from an anonymous source, claiming to have information about a high-profile case involving a prominent businessman. The message read: "Meet me at the old warehouse on 5th and Main at midnight. Come alone."

Yang Schafer's instincts told her that this could be the break she needed to crack the case, so she decided to take a chance. As she arrived at the warehouse, she noticed a figure in the shadows, waiting for her.

"Who are you?" Yang Schafer demanded, her eyes scanning the dimly lit space.

The figure stepped forward, revealing a young woman with a look of desperation in her eyes. "My name is Sarah," she said. "I used to work for the businessman. I saw things that night that I couldn't ignore."

Yang Schafer's curiosity was piqued. She motioned for Sarah to follow her, and they began to discuss the case. As they walked through the warehouse, Yang Schafer listened intently as Sarah recounted the events of that fateful night.

According to Sarah, the businessman had been involved in a shady deal, and she had stumbled upon evidence that threatened to bring him down. But just as she was about to expose him, he silenced her with a threat.

Yang Schafer's mind was racing with possibilities. She knew that she had to act fast to prevent further harm. As they left the warehouse, Yang Schafer made a mental note to investigate the businessman's alibi and gather more evidence.

With Sarah's testimony in hand, Yang Schafer felt like she had finally found the piece of the puzzle she needed to solve the case. She was determined to see justice served and bring the perpetrator to account for their actions.

As Yang Schafer walked back to her office, the rain-soaked streets seemed a little less daunting. She knew that she had a long road ahead of her, but with Sarah's help, she felt confident that she could crack the case and uncover the truth.
