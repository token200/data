One day, while working on a particularly puzzling case, Yang received an unexpected visit from his estranged brother, Michael. The two had been close as children, but a falling out in their teenage years had left them at odds for years.

Yang was taken aback by the sudden appearance of his brother, but he tried to remain composed as they sat down to discuss the reason for Michael's visit. It turned out that their long-lost father had passed away, leaving behind a mysterious will that left Yang the majority of his estate – including a small, rundown bakery.

Yang was stunned. He had never known about his father's existence, let alone his involvement in the family business. As he delved deeper into the will and began to unravel the secrets it held, he discovered a trail of clues leading back to an old crime that had gone cold years ago.

Determined to solve the case once and for all, Yang threw himself into the investigation, working tirelessly alongside his team to uncover the truth. As they dug deeper, they uncovered a web of deceit and corruption that went all the way to the top of the city's elite.

In the end, Yang couldn't help but think of his brother Michael, who had inadvertently led him to this breakthrough. He knew that their family's complicated history was far from over, but for now, he was content in knowing that justice had been served. As he walked out of the police station, a sense of satisfaction washed over him – Yang Wisniewski had done it again.
