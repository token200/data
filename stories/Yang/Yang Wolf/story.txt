Yang Wolf sat at his desk, surrounded by stacks of papers and scattered notes. He was known for being one of the most brilliant forensic scientists in the world, but that reputation often came with a price: isolation.

As he pored over the latest case file, his mind began to wander back to the events that had led him to this point. It started with a gruesome murder at the local university, where Yang Wolf had been called in to help investigate. The killer had left behind no fingerprints, no DNA, and no clear motive.

Days turned into weeks as Yang Wolf worked tirelessly, following every lead, interviewing every witness, and analyzing every shred of evidence. And finally, after months of work, he cracked the case: a rare genetic disorder that made the victim's skin incredibly resilient to damage.

But it wasn't just the solution to the crime that had haunted Yang Wolf; it was the image of the killer's face. A blank slate, devoid of expression or emotion. It haunted him like a ghost, reminding him that sometimes even with all his knowledge and expertise, justice eluded him.

Yang Wolf took another sip from his lukewarm tea, lost in thought. His colleagues had grown accustomed to his reclusive nature, but they didn't understand the weight he carried on his shoulders. The pressure to solve every case was suffocating at times, making it difficult for him to form relationships or trust others.

As he closed the file and began to pack up his things, Yang Wolf couldn't shake the feeling that there were more secrets out there waiting to be uncovered. He had a reputation for being a perfectionist, but what drove him was not just the pursuit of justice; it was the need to understand the world and all its intricacies.

Yang Wolf's eyes wandered towards the small glass jar on his desk, containing a single strand of hair that belonged to the killer. A tiny piece of evidence, yet it held so much significance for him. He carefully placed the jar back in its case and closed the lid, feeling a sense of resolve wash over him: he would continue to chase the truth, no matter how elusive it seemed.

With a quiet determination, Yang Wolf gathered his belongings and left the office, disappearing into the crowded streets like a ghost. The city swirled around him, oblivious to the brilliant mind working tirelessly behind the scenes, driven by an insatiable hunger for justice.
