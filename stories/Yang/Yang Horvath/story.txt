Yang Horvath stood alone in the rain-soaked streets of New Eden, the city's neon lights reflecting off the wet pavement like a canvas of broken dreams. As a member of the infamous "Cleaner" task force, Yang had seen her fair share of darkness and corruption, but tonight felt different.

She lit a cigarette, the flame casting an eerie glow on her pale face as she gazed out at the city's underbelly. Yang Horvath was a woman with a troubled past, one that had led her to this moment: a solo mission to take down a notorious gang lord who had been using his influence to exploit and terrorize the city's most vulnerable citizens.

As she watched the rain soak through her jacket, Yang felt a familiar sense of detachment wash over her. She was a ghost, a specter haunting the streets in search of justice. Her past was marked by pain and loss, but it had also given her a sharp edge, one that served her well in this line of work.

Yang Horvath knew every alleyway, every backroom, and every hidden corner of New Eden. She knew how to navigate its twisted landscape with ease, always staying one step ahead of her enemies. Tonight was no different.

She followed the scent of smoke and desperation, leading her to a seedy bar on the outskirts of town. The patrons were a mix of desperate men and broken women, all waiting for something that never came. Yang Horvath smiled to herself as she watched them, knowing exactly who she was looking for: Victor LaGraine, the gang lord with a reputation for ruthlessness.

As she pushed open the door, a warm blast of smoke and anger greeted her. Victor LaGraine sat at the center of it all, his eyes locked on Yang Horvath like a predator sizing up its prey. For a moment, they just stared at each other, the air thick with tension. Then, without a word, Yang Horvath walked into the fray, ready to put an end to LaGraine's reign of terror once and for all.
