Yang Visconti was known for her unwavering determination and unrelenting passion for justice. As a renowned detective, she had solved some of the city's most heinous crimes, earning her a reputation as one of the best in the business.

Her latest case had been particularly challenging, involving a string of high-profile burglaries that seemed to be linked to an anonymous figure known only as "The Shadow." Yang Visconti had been working tirelessly to unravel the mystery, following every lead and interviewing potential suspects.

As she sat at her desk, pouring over the evidence, a knock came from the doorway. It was her trusty sidekick, Tommaso. "Yang Visconti, I think we're getting close," he said, his eyes shining with excitement. Yang Visconti raised an eyebrow, intrigued.

Tommaso handed her a file containing the latest surveillance footage. As she scanned it, her eyes narrowed. The figure in the shadows was unmistakable - it was none other than Lorenzo De Medici's own son, Leonardo.

Yang Visconti's mind racing with the implications, she turned to Tommaso. "What do we know about Leonardo's alibi for the night of the burglary?" Tommaso consulted his notes, frowning. "Not much, but he did claim to have been at a business meeting."

Yang Visconti's eyes narrowed further. She knew that Lorenzo De Medici was one of the most powerful men in Florence, and if he had ordered his own son to commit a crime, it would mean the end of their reputation. She needed to confront Leonardo immediately.

As they arrived at the De Medici estate, Yang Visconti could feel the tension building. She knocked on the door, and when it opened, Leonardo himself stood before her. His eyes locked onto hers, and for a moment, Yang Visconti saw something there that gave her pause - a glimmer of desperation.

"Leonardo," she said, her voice firm but measured. "We know what you did. It's over."

The air was thick with anticipation as Leonardo spoke his first words: "I didn't do it alone."
