As a child, Yang would spend hours listening to his grandfather's stories about the struggles of the working class and the corrupt officials who preyed on their vulnerabilities.

As he left the nightclub, Yang Taro knew that this was just the tip of the iceberg. He had a story to tell, and he was determined to see it through to its conclusion. With his full name etched in the minds of those who mattered, Yang Taro disappeared into the night, ready to take on the next challenge in his quest for truth.
