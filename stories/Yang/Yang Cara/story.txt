Yang Cara sat on the edge of his bed, staring blankly at the worn wooden floorboards beneath him. His long black hair was tied back in a ponytail, revealing a face etched with fatigue and worry. As the Chief of the RDA (Resource Depot Administration), Yang had shouldered the weight of maintaining order and resources for the dwindling survivors on Mars.

It had been years since the Martian colony's collapse, leaving only a handful of RDA personnel to scavenge what was left. The once-thriving hub now served as a mere outpost, struggling to stay afloat amidst the harsh Martian environment. Yang Cara, the man who had taken up the mantle of leadership, felt like he was constantly teetering on the edge.

As he pondered his next move, Yang's comms device crackled to life. "Yang Cara, this is Lieutenant Arlo. We've received a distress signal from one of our outposts. Reports indicate that supplies are running low and the crew is in dire need of assistance."

Yang's eyes narrowed as he processed the information. He knew what it meant – another failed venture, leaving more RDA personnel in harm's way. But Yang Cara was determined to see this mission through. He couldn't afford to lose more people under his watch.

With a resolute nod, Yang Cara set off towards the outpost, accompanied by Lieutenant Arlo and a small team of security personnel. As they trudged through the barren Martian landscape, the weight of responsibility settled heavy on his shoulders.

Upon arrival, Yang quickly assessed the situation. The crew was indeed in trouble – low on food, water, and medical supplies. But despite the dire circumstances, Yang Cara remained steadfast. He worked tirelessly alongside the team, marshaling what resources he could to stabilize the outpost.

As night began to fall on Mars, Yang's thoughts drifted back to his own origins. Born Yngvild Yang Kari, a young engineer from New Eden Colony, he had never imagined himself leading this ragtag group of survivors. Yet here he was – Yang Cara, Chief of RDA.

For a moment, the burdens of leadership receded, and he remembered why he'd joined the Martian colony in the first place: to build a new home for humanity. Now, as he looked out at the star-studded expanse of Mars, Yang Cara felt a spark of hope ignite within him. He knew that as long as there were people like him – willing to take up the challenge – there was always a chance for redemption and renewal.
