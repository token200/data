Yang Pei-ling was known throughout the city for her striking features and sharp wit. As a renowned merchant's daughter, she had grown up surrounded by luxury and excess, but Yang Pei-ling's true nature was far from pampered.

While her parents' business empire flourished, Yang Pei-ling spent most of her days exploring the winding alleys of their merchant quarter. She marveled at the vibrant colors and exotic spices on display, and she knew every shopkeeper by name. Her knowledge of the market's inner workings was unparalleled, and many believed that Yang Pei-ling possessed a secret talent for divination.

One sunny afternoon, a young man named Lin arrived in town, seeking to make his fortune. He had heard tales of the local market's best buys and worst deals, but he lacked the connections to navigate it successfully. As fate would have it, Lin stumbled upon Yang Pei-ling haggling over prices with a merchant at the famous Red Phoenix Silk Store.

Over steaming cups of jasmine tea, Yang Pei-ling analyzed Lin's requests, pointing out both genuine opportunities and concealed pitfalls. Her insight proved uncannily accurate, and soon, Lin was leaving the Red Phoenix with a wealth of knowledge and a few valuable pieces of silk. From that day on, Yang Pei-ling and Lin became close allies, working together to find the best deals in town.
