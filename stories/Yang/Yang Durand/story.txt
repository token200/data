Yang Durand stepped into the crowded market, her long black hair tied back in a ponytail as she navigated through the throngs of people. As the daughter of a prominent merchant family, Yang Durand was no stranger to the hustle and bustle of city life.

With a few quick gestures, Yang Durand expertly haggled over the price of a bundle of fresh silk fabrics, her sharp mind and quick wit allowing her to secure a fair deal. She smiled sweetly at the vendor, who couldn't help but be charmed by her warm demeanor.

As she continued through the market, Yang Durand's eyes scanned the stalls, taking in the vibrant colors and enticing aromas on offer. She was a connoisseur of fine things, and her family's wealth had given her access to some of the rarest and most exquisite goods in the land.

Yang Durand's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her name being called from across the market. She followed the voice and spotted her childhood friend, Li Wei, waiting for her by a nearby food stall. The two girls had grown up together, exploring the city and sharing secrets beneath the warm sun.

"Yang Durand!" Li Wei exclaimed, as Yang Durand approached. "I've been looking all over for you! I heard that your father is planning to host a grand banquet soon."

Yang Durand's eyes sparkled with excitement. Her father was indeed planning a lavish celebration, one that would showcase the family's wealth and status to the entire city. As the daughter of Yang Durand, she would be expected to attend in style, wearing the finest gown and jewelry that her family could afford.

With a mischievous glint in her eye, Yang Durand leaned in close to Li Wei. "I have a plan," she whispered. "Let's sneak into the banquet early, just before it starts, and see if we can get our hands on some of the rarest delicacies."

Li Wei grinned, and together the two girls made their way through the crowd, already planning their mischief for the night ahead.
