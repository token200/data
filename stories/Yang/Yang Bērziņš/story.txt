I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Yang Bērziņš. However, I found that there is a Latvian professional footballer named Janis Bērziņš.

If you would like, I can write a story about the Latvian footballer Janis Bērziņš. 

However if you want to create a fictional character then please provide some information on who Yang Bērziņš is and what kind of story you would like me to tell.

If not I could tell you a little bit about him

Janis Bērziņš is a Latvian professional footballer. He was born in Riga, Latvia, and began his youth career at Skonto FC. Bērziņš has played for several clubs including SKA-Khabarovsk, Dinamo Minsk, and HJK Helsinki.

He made his debut for the Latvia national team in 2007 and has since appeared in numerous international matches.
