Yang Palmas was a woman of mystery and intrigue, known for her striking features and razor-sharp wit. Born as Yang Mei-Ling, she had always been an outsider, preferring to keep to herself rather than seek the company of others.

As a young girl, Yang Mei-Ling had grown up on the streets of Shanghai, relying on her cunning and resourcefulness to survive. She had quickly learned how to pick locks, talk her way out of trouble, and manipulate those around her to get what she wanted.

Years later, when Yang Palmas was in her mid-twenties, she found herself at the center of a high-stakes game of cat and mouse with a rival crime lord. The stakes were high: control of the city's underworld, and Yang Mei-Ling was determined to come out on top.

With her quick mind and sharp tongue, Yang Palmas had already managed to evade capture not once but twice, but she knew that her luck wouldn't last forever. She needed a new plan if she wanted to stay one step ahead of her nemesis.

One night, as she walked through the winding alleys of old Shanghai, Yang Mei-Ling stumbled upon an unlikely ally: a street-smart informant named Jia. With his insider knowledge and instincts, he seemed like the perfect partner in crime.

Yang Palmas quickly formed a bond with Jia, trusting him implicitly as they hatched a plan to take down their common enemy once and for all. Together, they gathered evidence, built alliances, and carefully crafted a strategy that would leave their rival reeling.

As the stakes grew higher, Yang Mei-Ling found herself torn between her loyalty to Jia and her own ambitions. But with each passing day, she knew that one thing was certain: Yang Palmas was born, and nothing would ever be the same again.
