Yang Jhih-hao was a man with an unassuming presence, often going unnoticed in crowded spaces. Yet, beneath his reserved exterior lay a sharp mind and quick wit, honed from years of navigating the cutthroat world of Taiwanese business.

As the CEO of his family's struggling paper mill, Yang Jhih-hao had taken it upon himself to turn the company around. With the help of his trusted advisor, Mr. Lee, he implemented a series of innovative cost-cutting measures and expansion strategies that began to bear fruit.

Despite his best efforts, however, Yang Jhih-hao couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that had been plaguing him for months. The company's financials were improving, but at what cost? The workers were still being paid meager wages, and the environmental impact of their operations was becoming increasingly unsustainable.

One evening, as he pored over financial reports in his office, Yang Jhih-hao received a visit from Mr. Lee. "Jhih-hao," the older man said softly, "you need to take care of yourself too." He handed him a steaming cup of tea and gestured for Yang Jhih-hao to sit down.

For a while, they sipped their tea in silence, watching the sunset through the window. Then, Mr. Lee spoke up again. "You're not just a businessman, Jhih-hao. You're a leader, a father, and a son. Don't forget that."

Yang Jhih-hao took a deep breath, feeling a sense of clarity wash over him. He knew what he needed to do – to prioritize the welfare of his employees and the planet alongside his business interests.

As the days turned into weeks, Yang Jhih-hao made bold changes at the paper mill. He implemented new, eco-friendly production methods and raised wages for all workers. It was a risk, but one that would pay off in the long run.

And as he looked out over the revitalized landscape, Yang Jhih-hao smiled to himself. For the first time in years, he felt like his full name – Yang Jhih-hao, son of the earth – resonated within him.
