Dasha Leroy stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the small station as she pulled out her phone to check the time. She had arrived in Ravenswood just an hour ago, and already the sleepy town seemed to be stirring from its slumber.

As a journalist for The Daily Chronicle, Dasha had been sent to investigate rumors of strange occurrences in Ravenswood. People had whispered about ghostly apparitions and unexplained events, but no one seemed willing to talk on record. Determined to get to the bottom of it all, Dasha had packed her bags and set off from the city.

As she made her way through the station, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was an older man with a kind face and piercing blue eyes.

"Can I help you?" he asked, nodding towards Dasha's phone.

"I'm looking for information," she replied, tucking the phone away. "I've been sent to investigate some strange occurrences in town."

The old man's expression turned serious. "Ah, yes. The whispers."

"You know about it?" Dasha pressed on.

"Know about it?" The man chuckled. "That's putting it lightly. My name is Henry, by the way. I used to live here, back when this was a thriving town."

Dasha pulled out her notebook and pen. "Can you tell me more?"

Henry hesitated, glancing around nervously before leaning in close. "People have been seeing things at night," he whispered. "Ghostly apparitions, strange noises... some folks say they've even seen shadowy figures lurking in the woods."

Dasha's eyes widened with excitement. This was exactly what she had come to find.

"But that's not all," Henry continued, his voice barely audible. "There's something else going on here, something deeper than just ghost stories. People are disappearing."

Dasha's heart skipped a beat. Disappearances? That was the lead she needed.

Over the next few days, Dasha interviewed locals and scoured the town for clues. She spoke to folks who claimed to have seen strange lights in the sky, others who swore they'd heard disembodied voices. But one person seemed particularly evasive: a reclusive millionaire named Marcus Ravenswood.

Dasha tracked him down to his grand estate on the outskirts of town. As she approached the mansion, she felt an unsettling chill run down her spine. She had been warned about this place – whispers of dark rituals and twisted experiments.

But Dasha was not one to shy away from a story. She stepped forward, ready to face whatever lay within the mansion's walls.

And that was when everything went black.

When Dasha came to, she found herself back on the train platform, her phone still clutched in her hand. The station was empty, except for a single figure watching her from the shadows – Henry, the old man who had given her the first lead.

"I think you've dug up something big, kiddo," he said with a nod before vanishing into the night.
