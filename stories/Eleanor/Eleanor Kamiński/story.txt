Eleanor Kamiński stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit café, shaking the water from her hair. She took a seat at the bar and ordered a whiskey on the rocks, the bartender raising an eyebrow as he poured it.

"What brings you in here tonight, Eleanor?" he asked, his voice low and sympathetic.

Eleanor shrugged, her eyes scanning the room as she waited for her drink. "Just trying to get out of the rain," she said, her Polish accent rolling off her tongue.

As she sipped her whiskey, a familiar face walked into the café – Jace, her old friend from college. They had lost touch after graduation, but now it seemed like fate had brought them together again.

"Jace! Long time no see!" Eleanor exclaimed, setting her drink down and standing up to hug him.

Jace laughed and hugged her back, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "Eleanor Kamiński, you look just as beautiful as ever," he said, pulling back to examine her face.

Eleanor rolled her eyes good-naturedly. "I'm not that old yet," she teased, taking a seat next to him on the stool.

As they caught up over drinks, Eleanor couldn't help but notice the way Jace's eyes seemed to hold a depth of emotion he rarely expressed. She had always known him as the charming, laid-back friend who could talk his way out of – or into – just about anything. But tonight, there was something different about him.

"Hey, what's going on?" she asked, her voice softer than usual.

Jace hesitated, taking a slow sip of his own drink before speaking. "I've been thinking about my future," he admitted, his eyes meeting hers. "And I'm not sure if I know what I want anymore."

Eleanor listened intently as Jace poured out his concerns and fears, her heart going out to him in understanding. As the night wore on, she found herself drawn into a world of possibility and uncertainty – one that was both thrilling and terrifying.

As they parted ways outside the café, Eleanor smiled up at Jace. "You're not alone, friend," she said, her voice filled with conviction.
