Eleanor Mancini stepped into the dimly lit art gallery, her eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As a renowned detective and owner of Mancini Investigations, she had seen it all before - but that didn't mean she wasn't on high alert.

The owner of the gallery, Mrs. Jenkins, flitted around her, nervously fidgeting with her gloves. "Eleanor, thank goodness you're here! I need your expertise. One of our most valuable pieces has been stolen."

Eleanor's gaze narrowed as she took in the scene. The painting, a rare Monet, hung askew on the wall, its frame cracked and broken. She knelt beside it, her trained eyes examining every detail.

"Tell me, Mrs. Jenkins," Eleanor began, "when did you first notice the painting was missing?"

"It happened last night," the woman replied, trembling. "I came in to open up for the day's visitors and... and there was nothing."

Eleanor stood, dusting off her pants. She surveyed the room once more before turning back to Mrs. Jenkins. "Did anyone else have access to the gallery overnight?"

The owner hesitated. "Well, I did invite a few volunteers to help with cleaning... but they're all reliable people."

Eleanor raised an eyebrow. "Reliable? That's quite a vague term, don't you think? Who were these volunteers?"

A small voice piped up from the corner of the room. "I was one of them, Mrs. Jenkins. I helped clean the exhibit yesterday night."

The room fell silent as Eleanor turned to face the young woman. "Can you tell me what you did last night?" she asked firmly.

The volunteer nodded hesitantly before launching into a story about watering plants and checking the security cameras. Eleanor listened intently, her mind racing with theories.

As she left the gallery that evening, the Monet still askew in its frame, Eleanor couldn't shake off the feeling that something wasn't quite right. And she had a hunch that one of those volunteers might be hiding more than just dust and dirt from the painting's frame...
