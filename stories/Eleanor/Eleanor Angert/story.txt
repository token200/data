Eleanor Angert stepped out of her small apartment, gazing up at the grey London sky. She pulled her coat tighter, the chill of winter air biting at her skin. A detective by trade, Eleanor had seen her fair share of rain-soaked days, but today felt particularly bleak.

She made her way to the police station, the familiar streets a blur as she went through the motions. Eleanor's eyes were fixed on the notebook in her hand, its pages dog-eared and worn from countless nights spent pouring over case files.

At the station, she was greeted by the usual assortment of uniforms and detectives, all vying for attention from their superiors. Eleanor nodded politely to a few of them as they passed, her focus solely on the latest briefing: a string of petty burglaries in the upscale parts of town.

The lead detective on the case, a gruff but affable man named Jenkins, had called in to brief Eleanor and his team. As she listened, she felt a familiar spark of curiosity ignite within her. There was something more to these burglaries than met the eye – the thief seemed almost... precise.

Back at her desk, Eleanor began to dig deeper into the case files, searching for patterns and inconsistencies. Her eyes scanned the pages, highlighting key details in her notebook as she worked.

Just as she was starting to get somewhere, a knock at the door interrupted her train of thought. It was Jenkins himself, his expression stern. "Angert, I need you to take a look at something."

Eleanor's heart quickened as she gathered her things and followed him out into the corridor. They stopped in front of a closed door marked "Evidence Storage". Jenkins produced a small key and unlocked the door, revealing a row of filing cabinets.

"Take a look through these," he said, handing her a folder labeled "Angert Case 456".

As Eleanor scanned the contents, her eyes widened in recognition. This was it – the break she needed to crack the case wide open. The petty burglaries were just a smokescreen; something far more sinister was at play.

With newfound determination, Eleanor began to piece together the puzzle, the cold London air now seeming almost... refreshing.
