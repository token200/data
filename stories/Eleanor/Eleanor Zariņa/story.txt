Eleanor Zari≈Üa was a name that struck fear into the hearts of those who knew her. A former KGB agent turned rogue, she had made a career out of pulling off impossible heists and evading capture.

Born in Latvia, Eleanor's life had taken a dramatic turn when she joined the Soviet Union's secret intelligence agency at the age of 20. She quickly rose through the ranks, earning a reputation as one of the most skilled and fearless operatives in the business.

But after the fall of the Soviet Union, Eleanor found herself without a country to call home. With her skills and expertise in high demand, she began taking on private clients - thieves, smugglers, and other high-stakes players.

Her latest target was a priceless diamond necklace on display at a museum in Paris. The owner, a wealthy collector named Marcus, had hired Eleanor to steal the necklace and sell it on the black market.

Eleanor arrived in Paris under the alias "Lena", a French artist with a talent for forgery. She spent weeks gathering intel on the museum's security system and waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

On a chilly winter night, Eleanor slipped into the museum through a ventilation shaft, avoiding the guards as she made her way to the exhibit hall where the necklace was displayed. With a few swift moves, she disabled the alarms and snatched the necklace from its case.

As she made her escape, Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. She glanced over her shoulder, but saw nothing out of the ordinary.

Back in her hideout, a dingy flat on the outskirts of town, Eleanor began to clean and cut the necklace into smaller pieces for sale. But as she worked, she noticed something strange - a small note hidden among the diamonds, with a single phrase scrawled in red ink: "You will be found".

Eleanor's heart skipped a beat as she realized that her latest heist had attracted unwanted attention. She knew she had to lay low for a while, but the question remained - who was behind this message? And what did they want from her?
