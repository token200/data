Martín Esther stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small town of San Juan del Sur. The salt air filled his lungs as he breathed in, a familiar sensation that always brought him back to this place. He had spent countless summers here as a child, playing in the dusty streets and listening to his abuela's stories.

As he made his way through the quiet streets, Martín couldn't help but notice the changes. The old adobe buildings still stood, but they were now adorned with colorful murals and trendy cafes. The town had grown, but it still felt like home.

Martín's thoughts turned to his abuela, who had passed away a few months ago. He had promised her he would return to San Juan del Sur for the summer solstice, and now that he was here, he felt a sense of restlessness. He had left the city behind, feeling suffocated by the noise and crowds.

As he walked towards his small casita on the outskirts of town, Martín noticed a group of locals gathered near the town square. They were laughing and talking, their faces creased with joy. He recognized the familiar sound of Spanish music drifting from the direction of the center.

Feeling a pang of curiosity, Martín wandered into the gathering. A young woman caught his eye, her dark hair tied back in a ponytail as she played a lively tune on a guitar. Her smile lit up the crowd as she sang about love and heartbreak.

Martín felt a spark ignite within him, but he quickly pushed it aside. He had come to San Juan del Sur for closure, not distractions. Still, he couldn't help but be drawn to her energy. As the music faded away, Martín found himself standing near the young woman, who introduced herself as Sofia.

As they talked, Martín felt his abuela's presence surrounding him. The stories she had told, the laughter and tears – it was all coming back to life in this small town. He shared with Sofia the tales of his childhood summers, the memories he had made here by the sea.

The night fell, and Martín offered to walk Sofia home. As they strolled along the beach, the stars twinkling above, Martín began to realize that perhaps his abuela's spirit was not a loss, but an invitation. The summer solstice would be different this year, and Martín felt the weight of his promise begin to lift.

In the weeks that followed, Martín found himself swept up in the vibrant rhythms of San Juan del Sur. He danced with Sofia under the stars, listened to tales from the old ones, and let go of the grief he had carried for so long. The town was alive, and Martín's heart began to beat in time once more.
