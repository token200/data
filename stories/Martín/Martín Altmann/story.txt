Martín Altmann stood alone on the edge of the cliff, the wind whipping his dark hair into a frenzy as he gazed out at the endless expanse of ocean below. As the son of a wealthy industrialist, Martín had always been given every opportunity to succeed, but something about this moment felt different.

He thought back to his childhood, spent playing on the windswept coast and exploring the crumbling ruins that dotted the shoreline. It was there, among the rocks and the sea spray, that he had first discovered a sense of purpose - not in the family business, nor in the pursuit of wealth or status, but in the quiet, meditative act of watching the waves.

As Martín's thoughts drifted back to the present, he felt a presence behind him. He turned to see his best friend, Emma, standing at the edge of the cliff, her eyes fixed on the sea with a look of equal intensity.

"Martín Altmann," she said, her voice barely above a whisper, "what are you doing out here?"

"Just lost in thought," he replied, gesturing to the ocean. "I was just thinking about how much I used to love this place."

Emma nodded, her eyes never leaving the sea. "It's still beautiful," she said.

Martín nodded in agreement. He had always known that Emma understood him in a way that no one else did. She had grown up with him on the coast, and they had spent countless hours exploring the hidden coves and secret beaches that only they knew about.

As they stood there in silence, Martín felt a sense of peace wash over him. He knew that he was at a crossroads in his life - should he follow in his father's footsteps and take over the family business, or should he forge his own path?

For a moment, he hesitated, unsure which way to turn. But then, as the waves crashed against the shore below, he felt a sense of clarity wash over him. He knew what he had to do.

"I'm going to leave," he said, turning to Emma with a sense of determination in his voice.

Emma's eyes widened in surprise, but she smiled anyway. "I'll support you no matter what, Martín Altmann."

Martín grinned back at her, feeling a weight lift off his shoulders. He knew that he would always be grateful for the friendship and guidance that Emma had given him - and for the quiet, peaceful moments they had shared on this windswept coast.
