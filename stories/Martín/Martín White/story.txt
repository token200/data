Martín White was a man with a passion for photography. He spent most of his days roaming the streets of Tokyo, camera in hand, capturing the vibrant city life. With his sharp eye and quick wit, he had built a reputation as one of the city's best street photographers.

One day, while exploring the alleys of Shimokitazawa, Martín stumbled upon a small, mysterious shop tucked away from the bustling streets. The sign above the door read "Curios and Wonders," and Martín felt an inexplicable pull to enter. Inside, he found himself surrounded by oddities and trinkets that seemed to hold secrets and stories of their own.

The shop owner, an elderly woman with kind eyes, greeted Martín warmly and asked if he was looking for something in particular. Martín explained his passion for photography, and the old woman smiled knowingly. She offered him a small, intricately carved wooden box with a strange symbol etched onto its lid.

"This is said to enhance one's vision," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "But be warned, Martín White, the power it holds comes at a price."

Martín was both intrigued and skeptical, but he couldn't resist the temptation to try it out. He took the box back to his small apartment in Harajuku and opened it, revealing a swirling mist that seemed to dance in the air.

As he looked through his camera lens, Martín felt an intense focus wash over him. His shots became more vivid, more alive than ever before. But as the days passed, he began to notice strange occurrences happening around him - people in the background of his photos, faces and places that didn't belong.

It was then that Martín realized the truth: the box had indeed granted him a new level of vision, but at the cost of his own memories and experiences. The world through his lens was now a curated reality, one that was both beautiful and unsettling.

Martín White knew he had to be careful with this newfound power, to use it wisely and not let it consume him. As he looked through his camera lens once more, he saw the world in a new light - but also a reminder of the price he paid for it.
