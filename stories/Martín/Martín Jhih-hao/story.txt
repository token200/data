Martín Jhih-hao was a man of mystery and intrigue. A master thief from the streets of Taipei, he had earned a reputation for being untouchable. His full name, which roughly translated to "Martin Faithful," seemed almost ironic given his profession.

Despite his tough exterior, Martín had a soft spot for those in need. He used his skills to steal from the wealthy and give to those less fortunate. His latest mark was a corrupt businessman who had been embezzling funds meant for the local community center. Martín planned to infiltrate the businessman's high-rise office and make off with the stolen money.

As he donned his disguise, a tailored suit and wig, Martín couldn't help but think of his full name's meaning. Faithful, indeed. He had always been true to himself and those he cared about, even when it meant going against the odds.

With a deep breath, Martín set out on his mission. He navigated the office building with ease, avoiding security guards and cameras with a practiced air of nonchalance. Reaching the top floor, he found himself face-to-face with the businessman's private vault.

The heist was a success, and Martín made off with the stolen funds. But as he gazed out over the city, he felt a sense of unease. Had he done the right thing? Was his actions truly faithful to the greater good?

These doubts would have to wait. Martín had a reputation to uphold, and he couldn't let it be tarnished by second-guessing himself. He disappeared into the night, leaving behind only whispers of his presence.

Years went by, and Martín Jhih-hao became a legend in his own right. His full name was whispered in awe by those who knew him, and his exploits were the stuff of urban myth. Yet, deep down, he remained the same man – driven by a sense of justice and a strong moral compass. His faithfulness to himself and others had never wavered, even as the world around him changed.
