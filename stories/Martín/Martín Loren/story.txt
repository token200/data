Martín Loren stepped into the dimly lit tavern, the smell of worn leather and stale beer hitting him like a punch to the gut. It was a place he knew all too well – a refuge for outcasts and misfits, where even the most hardened souls came to escape the world outside.

As a former member of the elite Guardia del Rey, Martín had thought he'd left his past behind. But after a fateful mission gone wrong, he found himself disillusioned with the very organization that had once hailed him as a hero. The memories still lingered, etched into his mind like scars on his skin.

The patrons of the tavern barely acknowledged him as he made his way to the bar. Martín's rugged features and weathered eyes commanded respect, but it seemed no one was willing to talk to him anymore. He ordered a whiskey, the liquid fire burning down his throat as he took a sip.

A figure caught his attention – a young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair, sitting alone at a table in the corner. She looked like she belonged here, her presence a whispered rumor of something more. Martín's curiosity got the better of him; he made his way over to her table.

"Mind if I join you?" he asked, his deep voice low.

The woman raised an eyebrow, but nodded curtly. "Not at all."

Martín slid into the chair across from her, and they fell silent for a moment. The air was heavy with tension, but it wasn't unpleasant – just a familiar ache that came from knowing someone else's story.

"I'm Martín," he said finally, breaking the silence.

"Lyra," she replied, her voice husky as a summer breeze.

As they talked, Martín found himself drawn to Lyra's intensity. She was a wild card, untamed and unpredictable – exactly what he needed after so many years of taming his own demons.

The night wore on, the tavern emptying out one by one until only the two of them were left. The fire crackled in the hearth, casting flickering shadows across Lyra's face. Martín felt a spark of attraction ignite within him – a flame that threatened to consume him whole.

For the first time in years, he felt alive.
