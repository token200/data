The days that followed were a blur of intense study and analysis, but Martín's team remained optimistic. They worked tirelessly to unravel the secrets hidden within the inscription, and finally, they made a breakthrough.

With trembling hands, Martín carefully placed the slab into its new home - a state-of-the-art display case at the museum. As he stepped back to admire their handiwork, he couldn't help but smile. He knew that this discovery would be remembered for generations to come, and he felt honored to have played a part in uncovering it.
