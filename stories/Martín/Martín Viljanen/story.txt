Martín Viljanen stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of life. As a private investigator, he had grown accustomed to the quiet hours of dawn and dusk when most people were too tired or too scared to venture out. The rain pattered against the windows, casting a rhythmic melody that seemed to match the beat of Martín's own weary heart.

He spotted an empty table in the corner and made his way towards it, his eyes fixed on the small notebook clutched in his hand. It was a list of leads, a patchwork quilt of half-remembered rumors and scraps of information that might just unravel the tangled threads of a decades-old mystery. Martín had always been drawn to such puzzles, like a moth to flame.

As he settled into his chair, the door swung open and a young woman slipped in, shaking the rain from her coat. She was shivering, her eyes darting about the room as if searching for an escape route. Martín's instincts told him she wasn't here to order a coffee; he watched her with interest, waiting for her to make a move.

The woman spotted Martín and hesitated, her hand hovering over her purse. He raised a finger in a gentle gesture, beckoning her closer. "Mind if I join you?" he asked, his voice low and soothing. She shook her head, her eyes still scanning the room as if searching for an exit. Martín took that as an invitation to sit.

"I'm Martín Viljanen," he said, extending a hand. The woman hesitated, then shook it firmly. "I'm Sofia," she replied, her voice barely above a whisper. As they introduced themselves, Martín's mind began to whirl with possibilities. This was exactly the kind of case he had been waiting for – a whispered rumor, a cryptic message, and a mystery that needed solving.

The rain continued its relentless beat outside, but inside, Martín felt his pulse quickening. He pulled out his notebook and began to scribble down notes, Sofia's eyes locked on his face as if she could see the wheels turning in his mind. This was just the beginning of a long and winding road, one that Martín Viljanen was eager to take on alone.
