Martín Wiśniewska was known for his unorthodox approach to art. As a painter, he often disregarded traditional techniques in favor of experimental methods that pushed the boundaries of what was considered "acceptable." His bold style and innovative use of materials had garnered him both critical acclaim and controversy.

One evening, Martín received an invitation from a wealthy collector to showcase his work at an exclusive gallery opening. The collector, known for his eclectic taste, was rumored to have amassed a vast collection of avant-garde pieces.

When it was time for Martín's piece to be unveiled, he stepped forward nervously, his full name echoed through the gallery by a soft-spoken voice.
