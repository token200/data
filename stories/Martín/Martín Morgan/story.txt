Martín Morgan sat alone at the small café, nursing a cup of black coffee. His eyes wandered to the rain-soaked streets outside, reflecting on his life's path. He had always felt like an outsider, a wanderer without a true home.

Born in the sprawling city of New Eden, Martín grew up with a sense of restlessness. As a child, he'd watch the rain-soaked streets and imagine himself lost in the misty veil that shrouded the city's alleys. His parents, though well-meaning, couldn't grasp his desire for freedom.

Years went by, and Martín dropped out of college to travel. He traversed continents, collecting stories and experiences like a patchwork quilt. In Tokyo, he sipped sake with a group of salarymen; in Rio, he danced the night away on Carnival's streets. Each place became a chapter in his book, but never a home.

One evening, as Martín strolled through a Parisian market, he stumbled upon an antique shop tucked between historic buildings. The owner, an elderly man with eyes that saw right through him, handed Martín a small key.

"This is for the smallest room in my house," the old man said. "A place where you can keep your own story."

Martín purchased the key and spent months searching for the shop. Eventually, he found it hidden behind a waterfall in the Swiss Alps. The door creaked open, revealing a small, book-lined chamber filled with a soft, golden light.

For the first time in his life, Martín felt at home. He spent years collecting stories from travelers and writing them down, filling each room of the shop with tales from far-flung lands. People came from all over to hear the wanderer's tales, but Martín knew that his own story remained hidden behind the key.

As the rain continued to fall outside, Martín smiled to himself, feeling for the first time like he belonged somewhere in the world. He realized that the smallest room was not just a physical space but a place where you could keep your stories and find yourself.
