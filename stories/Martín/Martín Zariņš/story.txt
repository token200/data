I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Martín Zariņš. However, I can create a story about him.

Martín Zariņš was a man with a mysterious past. He had always kept to himself, working as an accountant in a small firm in Riga, Latvia. His colleagues knew him only by his name and title, but no one really understood what made Martín tick.

One day, while working late in the office, Martín stumbled upon an old photograph tucked away in a dusty file cabinet. The picture showed a group of people gathered around a table, smiling and laughing together. Among them was a young woman with piercing green eyes - a girl he had never seen before.

Intrigued, Martín decided to investigate further. He started searching for any information on the photograph, but found nothing concrete. Frustrated, he decided to take matters into his own hands. Under the cover of darkness, he snuck out of the office and onto the streets of Riga.

He wandered through the city's winding alleys, searching for any clues that might lead him back to the girl in the photograph. As the night wore on, Martín began to feel a sense of unease - as if someone was watching him. Suddenly, he heard footsteps behind him and turned around to see the young woman from the photograph standing before him.

"Who are you?" Martín asked, his voice shaking slightly.

"I'm Marta," she replied, her eyes locked on his. "And I think we have a connection."

Over the next few weeks, Martín and Marta spent countless hours together, exploring Riga's hidden corners and uncovering secrets about their shared past. As they delved deeper into each other's lives, they discovered that they were more alike than either had ever imagined.

Martín's life would never be the same again - not after meeting Marta and unraveling the mysteries of his own forgotten history.
