Antoni Mercier stepped off the plane in New Orleans, his eyes scanning the humid air as if searching for something. The city was alive with music and laughter, but he felt like an outsider, a ghost haunting the streets.

As a former hitman for the French-Canadian mafia, Antoni had thought he'd left it all behind. But after a botched job in Quebec, he'd received a mysterious phone call offering him a chance to start anew in the Crescent City. It was too good to pass up – or so he told himself.

Now, as he made his way through the airport, Antoni's thoughts turned to his past. He thought of his wife, Colette, who had disappeared after he'd been injured on a job gone wrong. She had always been the light in his life, and without her, everything felt dark and foreboding.

Antoni spotted a black taxi idling by the curb, its driver eyeing him with interest. "Where can I take you, monsieur?" he asked gruffly.

"Hotel Monteleone," Antoni replied, tossing a twenty on the dashboard.

The drive through the city was a blur of colors and sounds – the sweet scent of magnolias, the cacophony of jazz drifting from clubs on Bourbon Street. When they arrived at the hotel, Antoni hailed the elevator and pressed the button for the lobby floor.

Inside, the air was thick with history. A faded photograph of a young Louis Armstrong caught his eye. As he stood there, lost in thought, a soft voice broke the silence.

"Welcome to the Hotel Monteleone, monsieur."

Antoni turned to find a woman with piercing green eyes and skin as smooth as polished marble. "I'm Madeleine," she said, offering him her hand.

The handshake was firm, but Antoni felt a spark of connection. Maybe this city, this chance at redemption – it was exactly what he needed.

Over the next few weeks, Antoni settled into his new life, exploring the streets and learning the stories behind every brick and mortar. He found solace in the rhythms of New Orleans – the second lines, the jazz clubs, the late-night conversations over coffee on Jackson Square.

Antoni Mercier was finally starting to find himself again, one jazz note at a time.
