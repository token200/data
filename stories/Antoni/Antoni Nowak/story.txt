Antoni Nowak trudged through the pouring rain, his worn leather boots splashing in the puddles that lined the deserted streets. As a private investigator, he had seen it all – the desperation, the lies, and the broken dreams. But nothing could have prepared him for the phone call that morning.

The woman on the other end of the line was trembling, her voice barely above a whisper. "Please, Antoni, you have to find my sister," she begged. "She's been missing for weeks, and I think something terrible has happened to her."

Antoni had worked with this client before, but he knew that desperation often led to reckless decisions. He agreed to take the case, sensing that there was more to the story than met the eye.

As he walked into his office, Antoni's mind began to spin. The rain outside seemed to match the turmoil brewing inside him. He lit a cigarette and began pacing back and forth in front of his desk. What could have happened to this young woman? And what did she want from her sister?

The hours ticked by, with Antoni digging through records and interviewing witnesses. But every lead ended in a dead-end street or a false alibi. It was as if the missing girl had vanished into thin air.

Just when he was about to pack it all in for the day, a phone call came from an unknown number. "Look again at her last known whereabouts," a low voice whispered on the other end. Antoni's instincts kicked in – this could be his only chance.

He dug up the missing girl's final phone records and discovered a suspicious text message sent to her sister just days before she disappeared. The words seemed innocuous enough, but something about them nagged at Antoni. He paid a visit to the sender's last known address, a seedy bar on the outskirts of town.

Inside, he found himself face-to-face with a familiar face – one that made his blood run cold. "I'm afraid I've been waiting for you," the man sneered, as Antoni pushed open the door.
