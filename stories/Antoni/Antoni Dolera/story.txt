Antoni Dolera stepped into the dimly lit bar, the scent of whiskey and smoke enveloping him like an old friend. He took a seat at the end of the counter, his eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. The bartender, a gruff but kind-hearted man named Sal, raised an eyebrow as Antoni slid onto the stool.

"Same as always," Antoni said, nodding towards the bottle of bourbon that sat beside him.

Sal nodded, pouring a generous shot without asking twice. Antoni took a sip, feeling the burn all the way down his throat. He had always found solace in this bar, where the patrons were a mix of lost souls and hardworking men who'd come to drown their sorrows.

Antoni's mind began to wander as he sipped his drink. He thought about his life, or what passed for it. A former engineer, Antoni had been working on a high-profile project when his brother, Alex, had gone missing. The investigation had turned up nothing, and Antoni had never forgiven himself for not being able to protect the man who'd raised him.

As the night wore on, the bar began to clear out. Sal slid onto the stool beside Antoni, wiping down the counter with a dirty rag.

"You look like you've got your troubles," Sal said, his voice low and understanding.

Antoni nodded, taking another sip of his drink. "I just want answers, Sal. I want to know what happened to Alex."

Sal nodded sympathetically. "Sometimes, Antoni, some things are better left unspoken."

Antoni looked at him, a mixture of frustration and desperation in his eyes. "But that's not fair, Sal. You're always telling me to face my demons, to move on from the past. How can I do that when I don't even know what happened?"

The silence between them was heavy, but eventually, Sal spoke up. "I'm sorry, Antoni. But some secrets are meant to remain secrets."

Antoni sighed, finishing his drink in one swift motion. As he stood to leave, he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror behind the bar. He looked older than he felt, worn down by the weight of his own grief.

But for tonight, at least, Antoni Dolera could let go and just be. He slid out of the booth, Sal's parting words echoing in his mind: "Sometimes, it's okay to just let the past rest."
