Antoni Taylor stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the sleepy town below. She had come to visit her estranged grandmother, Rosa Taylor, who lived on the outskirts of town in a small, rustic cottage. Antoni's parents had passed away when she was young, and her grandmother had been left to raise her alone.

As she made her way through the dusty streets, Antoni couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her. This was where her mother grew up, where her own memories of childhood were forged. She quickened her pace, excitement building in her chest as she approached the old cottage.

The door creaked open before she even reached it, and Rosa Taylor stood before her, a warm smile on her weathered face. "Antoni! Darling child!" she exclaimed, sweeping Antoni into a tight hug. "It's been far too long!"

As they sat down to tea in the cozy living room, Antoni couldn't help but notice the way her grandmother's eyes crinkled at the corners when she smiled. It was a trait that had always made her laugh, and it did so again now, as Rosa regaled her with stories of Antoni's parents.

"You were such a curious child," Rosa said, her voice full of affection. "Always asking questions, seeking answers. Your father was quite the engineer, you know. He built this very house himself."

Antoni's eyes widened in surprise, but she played along, eager to hear more. As they sipped their tea and munched on biscuits, Rosa talked about Antoni's parents with a warmth and love that made her feel seen and heard.

As the afternoon drew to a close, Rosa took Antoni's hand and led her out into the garden. The sun was setting over the rolling hills, casting a golden glow over the landscape. "I'm so glad you came, Antoni Taylor," Rosa said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I've missed you terribly."

Antoni felt a lump form in her throat as she hugged her grandmother tight. She knew that this visit was just what she needed â€“ a chance to reconnect with the past, and to rediscover the love and connection that had always been there, even if it had been hidden for so long.

As they walked back inside, hand in hand, Antoni felt a sense of peace settle over her. She knew that she still had much to learn from Rosa Taylor, and she was grateful for this second chance to connect with the woman who had shaped her into the person she was today.
