Antoni Dufresne stood in front of the mirror, adjusting his tie for what felt like the hundredth time. He was supposed to meet a potential client at noon, and he couldn't afford to be late.

As he headed out the door, he caught a glimpse of himself. His dark hair was mussed, and his eyes looked tired from lack of sleep. Antoni rubbed the stubble on his chin, trying to shake off the feeling of exhaustion that had been plaguing him for weeks.

It wasn't just the lack of sleep, though. It was the weight of the world bearing down on him. As a former investment banker, Antoni had made his share of enemies in the financial world. The stress of dealing with high-stakes clients and navigating the complex web of corporate politics had taken its toll on his mental health.

But that wasn't all. Antoni's decision to leave it all behind and start fresh in New York City had been a risk, one he wasn't sure was worth taking. His family back home still didn't understand why he had given up such a successful career, and the pressure from them was starting to take its toll.

As he walked to the meeting, Antoni couldn't help but think about his plan. He had always dreamed of running his own restaurant, one that served traditional French cuisine with a modern twist. But it wasn't just the money or the prestige that drove him – it was the sense of purpose and creativity that came with being his own boss.

Antoni arrived at the meeting spot early, taking a seat in the waiting area to collect himself before entering. As he waited, he pulled out his phone and sent a quick text to his sister back home. "Hey sis, just wanted to let you know I'm going to be late. Don't worry about me, I've got this."

He took a deep breath and stood up, smoothing out his jacket as he walked into the meeting room. The client looked up at him with a mixture of curiosity and skepticism, but Antoni could see the hint of excitement in their eyes.

"Welcome," they said, extending a hand. "I'm looking forward to hearing what you have to say."

Antoni smiled, feeling a spark of confidence ignite within him. This was it – his chance to prove himself all over again. And he was ready for whatever came next.
