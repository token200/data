Antoni Cooper stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station as if searching for something – or someone. He had been away for months, traveling the world and trying to outrun the memories that haunted him.

As he made his way through the deserted town, the chill of the evening air began to seep into his bones. Antoni shivered, despite the thickness of his leather jacket, and quickened his pace. He had a place to be, a friend waiting for him in this godforsaken town.

The streets were narrow and winding, lined with ancient buildings that seemed to lean in on each other as if sharing secrets. Antoni navigated them with ease, his feet carrying him toward the sound of laughter and music drifting from a small bar on the corner.

He pushed open the door and stepped inside, his eyes adjusting to the warm glow of lanterns and the hum of conversation. The air was thick with cigarette smoke and the smell of cheap whiskey. Antoni's stomach growled in protest as he made his way to the bar.

That's where he found him – Mateo, his old friend and confidant, sipping on a drink with a look of quiet satisfaction on his face. "Antoni!" Mateo exclaimed, setting his glass down and sweeping his friend into a bear hug. "You're finally here!"

As they hugged, Antoni felt the familiar sense of relief wash over him. This was home, this was where he belonged. He pulled back, his eyes locking onto Mateo's. "What's going on?" he asked, already knowing the answer.

Mateo smiled, a small smile that hinted at secrets and plans. "There's a job to be had," he said, his voice low and conspiratorial. "Someone needs someone with your particular set of skills."

Antoni raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. He knew what Mateo meant – it was always something. But this time, for once, he felt ready. Ready to face whatever lay ahead, to leave the past behind.

Together, they downed their drinks and stepped back out into the night air, the shadows closing in around them like a shroud. Antoni Cooper took a deep breath, feeling the city's energy coursing through his veins. He knew that he was exactly where he needed to be.
