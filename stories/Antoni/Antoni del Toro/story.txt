Antoni del Toro stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the dimly lit station. The air was heavy with the scent of smoke and damp earth, a smell that brought him back to his childhood in this very town.

As he walked through the streets, Antoni's thoughts turned to the letter he had received just days before. His cousin, Francisco, had written to say that their family's ancestral farm was up for sale. The land had been in their family for generations, and Antoni couldn't bear the thought of it being taken from them.

He stopped at a small caf√© on the outskirts of town and ordered a cup of coffee. The owner, Maria, nodded at him warmly as he took a seat by the window. "How's life treating you, Antoni?" she asked, her eyes crinkling at the corners.

Antoni shook his head, taking a sip of the bitter coffee. "It's been... complicated," he admitted. Maria nodded sympathetically and handed him a small pastry. He took it gratefully, savoring the flaky crust and sweet filling.

As he ate, Antoni thought about his past. Growing up, he had always felt like an outsider in this town. The other children would play together until dark, laughing and shouting, while Antoni was left to explore the abandoned orchard on the outskirts of town. But those afternoons had been some of the happiest of his life.

He finished his coffee and headed out into the evening air. The stars were beginning to twinkle overhead as he walked towards the old farm. He could feel a sense of restlessness building inside him, a desire to claim this land back from whoever had taken it from them.

As he approached the farmhouse, Antoni saw that the door was open. He stepped inside cautiously, his heart pounding in his chest. The interior of the house was just as he remembered it - dusty and decaying, but full of memories.

And there, on the kitchen table, lay a small notebook. It belonged to Francisco, written in the same spidery handwriting that Antoni's own hand had once used. He opened the book, his eyes scanning the pages until he found what he was looking for.

A letter, addressed to him, said that Francisco had left it here before... something terrible happened. The words blurred on the page as Antoni read them over and over again, trying to make sense of them.
