Antoni Wozniak, a brilliant and reclusive inventor, had spent his entire life locked away in his cluttered workshop. His eccentricities had earned him a reputation as a mad scientist among his neighbors, but few suspected the depths of his genius. Antoni's obsession was to create a machine that could harness the power of the universe.

One fateful evening, after weeks of tireless work, Antoni finally succeeded in building his masterpiece: the Cosmic Engine. This behemoth of machinery hummed with an otherworldly energy, as if the very fabric of space and time had been woven into its metal bones.

As the engine roared to life, a brilliant light illuminated the workshop, bathing Antoni in an ethereal glow. He gazed upon his creation with awe and trepidation, aware that he had stumbled upon something that could change the course of human history.

But Antoni's triumph was short-lived. The engine's immense power coursed through the air like a living entity, disrupting the workshop's fragile equilibrium. Suddenly, equipment shattered, sparks flew, and a blinding flash illuminated the room.

When the light faded, Antoni found himself face-to-face with an alternate version of himself: younger, wiser, and eerily identical in every way. This doppelganger spoke to him in hushed tones, revealing that he had traveled from a parallel universe to warn Antoni against unleashing the Cosmic Engine's full potential.

The two versions of Antoni engaged in a heated debate about the nature of reality and the responsibility that came with playing god. Ultimately, it was the older Antoni who emerged victorious, but not before his doppelganger vanished into the cosmos, leaving behind a cryptic message: "The power is yours, but be warned."

As the days passed, Antoni struggled to comprehend the implications of his discovery and the weight of his newfound responsibility. He realized that his creation had become more than just a machine â€“ it was a portal to infinite possibilities and unfathomable dangers. And with this knowledge came the haunting realization: he was no longer alone in his journey.
