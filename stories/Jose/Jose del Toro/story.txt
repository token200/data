Jose del Toro was a man with a passion for the old country. Born and raised in Mexico City, he spent most of his life reminiscing about the vibrant markets, delicious street food, and warm smiles of his childhood. As a young boy, Jose del Toro would often help his abuela sell fresh produce at their small family stall in the bustling Mercado de San Juan.

Years went by, and Jose del Toro grew into a successful businessman, expanding his family's business to include a chain of authentic Mexican restaurants across the city. He never forgot his humble beginnings and always made sure to bring a taste of Mexico to every corner of his empire.

One day, while on a business trip in New York City, Jose del Toro found himself wandering through the West Village, searching for a slice of homemade pizza. As he turned a corner, he stumbled upon a small Mexican market that transported him back to his childhood. The aroma of sizzling chorizo and warm tortillas filled the air, and Jose del Toro's eyes widened as he spotted an old friend, Maria, behind the counter.

Maria had known Jose del Toro since they were children, and she was thrilled to see her old friend enjoying a taste of home. Over plates of spicy tacos and crispy empanadas, they caught up on each other's lives. As they chatted, Jose del Toro shared stories of his business ventures and Maria revealed that she was opening her own small market back in Mexico City.

Inspired by Maria's determination, Jose del Toro made a promise to himself: he would invest in Maria's new venture and help her bring the flavors of old Mexico to a new generation. With renewed energy and purpose, Jose del Toro returned to his restaurant empire, eager to share the love and passion for Mexico that had driven him all along.

Years went by, and Jose del Toro's Mexican restaurants became iconic institutions in the city. And every time he traveled back to Mexico City, he made sure to visit Maria's market, reliving memories of his childhood and forging new ones with the people and places that mattered most.
