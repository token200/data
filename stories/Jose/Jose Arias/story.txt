Jose Arias walked into the small caf√©, scanning the room for a familiar face. He spotted her sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee. It had been months since they last saw each other, but Jose knew he could always count on Sofia to be there.

Sofia looked up as Jose approached, a hint of a smile on her lips. "Jose Arias," she said, using his full name with a nod. "Long time no see."

Jose took a seat across from her, feeling a sense of relief wash over him. He had been traveling for weeks, and it was good to be back in the city where he knew everyone's name.

Sofia ordered another cup of coffee for Jose, and they settled into a quiet conversation. They talked about everything and nothing, catching up on each other's lives. Jose told Sofia about his latest project, a community center he had been working on with a group of volunteers. Sofia shared her own news, a new job she had started at a local non-profit.

As they chatted, Jose couldn't help but notice the way Sofia's eyes sparkled when she laughed. He remembered the first time they met, at a art exhibit where Sofia was showcasing her photography. They had hit it off immediately, bonding over their shared love of art and social justice.

Jose Arias thought back to that night, remembering the way Sofia's smile lit up the room. He felt a flutter in his chest as he gazed at her now, his heart still racing with excitement whenever she was around.

Sofia noticed Jose staring at her and raised an eyebrow. "What are you thinking about?" she asked, a hint of playfulness in her voice.

Jose shrugged, feeling a little embarrassed. "Just remembering our first meeting," he said, trying to sound nonchalant. Sofia smiled, reaching out to take his hand.

"You're still as charming as ever," she said, squeezing his hand gently. Jose felt a rush of happiness, grateful to have found someone like Sofia in this chaotic world.
