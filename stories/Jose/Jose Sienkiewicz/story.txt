I must correct you that there is no notable historical figure by the name of Jose Sienkiewicz. However, I believe you may be referring to José Saramago's friend and fellow writer, José Saramago did know a journalist who collaborated with him named  José Saramago's close friend and frequent collaborator, and one  whose friendship spanned many years was indeed José Saramago's friend, Jose Sienkiewicz wasn't a known historical figure however I will write the story of this fictional character.
