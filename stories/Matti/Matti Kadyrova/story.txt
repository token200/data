Matti Kadyrova stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of her friend. She had received a cryptic message from Sasha earlier that morning, and she was eager to hear what he had to say.

As she waited in line to order her coffee, Matti couldn't help but think about her life as an artist. She was a painter, known for her vibrant and emotional works of art that seemed to capture the very essence of her subjects. Her latest exhibition was gaining attention from critics and collectors alike, and she was feeling both elated and overwhelmed.

When it was finally her turn to order, Matti took a seat at the bar, sipping on her coffee as she pulled out her phone to text Sasha. The response came almost immediately – "Meet me in the garden," with no further explanation.

Matti felt a thrill of excitement as she made her way through the bustling café and into the quieter courtyard beyond. The sun was shining down on the lush greenery, casting dappled shadows across the stone benches.

As she spotted Sasha sitting alone on one of these benches, Matti couldn't help but feel a sense of trepidation. What could he possibly want to discuss? She sat down beside him, trying to appear nonchalant despite her racing heart.

"Sasha, what's going on?" Matti asked, as Sasha leaned in close and began to speak in hushed tones.

"I've been getting some amazing offers for your art," Sasha said, his eyes shining with excitement. "Major museums are interested in featuring your work. You could be making a fortune by the time you're 30."

Matti's mind reeled at the prospect. Was this really what she wanted? The fame and fortune came with so many strings attached – the pressure to produce, the scrutiny of every brushstroke.

As she looked out over the garden, Matti felt a sense of clarity wash over her. This was exactly why she had become an artist in the first place – to create something that brought people joy and beauty. She didn't need the validation of others to make it worthwhile.

"I'll think about it," Matti said finally, turning back to Sasha with a determined look on her face.

Sasha grinned, clearly pleased with himself. "That's all I can ask for."
