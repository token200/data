One fateful day, the kingdom's ruler, King Arin III, summoned the guild to the castle to discuss a matter of great importance. The king revealed that a rogue army had been spotted on the outskirts of Ashwood, threatening to destabilize the fragile peace between their realm and neighboring lands.

Without hesitation, Matti Dąbrowski volunteered for the perilous mission to infiltrate the enemy camp and gather vital intel. Master Ryker nodded in approval, knowing his protégé was ready for the challenge.

Upon reaching the enemy camp, Matti Dąbrowski expertly concealed himself behind a cluster of rocks, adjusting his quiver to ensure a steady supply of arrows. He waited patiently for nightfall, when the camp's guards would be most vulnerable.

With the darkness closing in, Matti made his move, swiftly taking down enemies with precision and stealth. His aim was true, striking down anyone who dared stand in his way. As the hours passed, he managed to gather crucial information about the enemy army's numbers, tactics, and plans.

With his mission accomplished, Matti Dąbrowski returned to Ashwood, his footsteps swift and silent. The kingdom's ruler thanked him for his bravery and rewarded him with a place of honor at the guild's celebration feast.

As Master Ryker patted him on the back, he declared, "Matti Dąbrowski has truly proven himself worthy of our guild. His prowess with a bow is matched only by his unwavering dedication to justice."

The crowd cheered in agreement, and Matti smiled humbly, knowing that his hard work and perseverance had earned him a place among the greatest archers Ashwood had ever known.
