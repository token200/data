I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Matti Zariņa. However, I did find information on a Latvian politician named Matti Žilinskis' relative Matts or also known as Matis  (matti zarin) but also more well known is the Finnish footballer Mattias Zariņš or Mattias Larsson and also more well known is  Matti vanha in Finnish footballer that plays for  FC Honka's cousin or related to, but no one named Matti Zariņa
