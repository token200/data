Matti Palmas was known for her sharp tongue and quick wit, but few people knew that beneath her tough exterior lay a heart of gold. As the owner of the local pub, "The Red Lion," Matti had built a reputation as a fair and loyal friend to those who frequented her establishment.

One evening, as the sun set over the small town of Willow Creek, Matti was busy pouring drinks and chatting with the regulars when a young musician walked in. The stranger, a talented guitarist named Max, had been traveling from town to town, playing his guitar on street corners and at local bars. He had heard about "The Red Lion" through word of mouth and was hoping to catch Matti's attention.

As Matti took Max's order for a whiskey, she eyed him with interest. There was something about the young musician that caught her attention - perhaps it was the way he smiled as he strummed his guitar or the spark in his eyes when he talked about his music. Whatever it was, Matti found herself wanting to know more about Max.

As the night wore on, Max played a lively set for the pub's patrons, and Matti watched with a warm smile. When he finished, she approached him, her expression friendly but also firm. "Listen, kid," she said, "I'm not one for flattery or false promises, but I think you've got something special here. You should consider staying in Willow Creek for a while - we could use someone with your talent around here."

Max's eyes lit up at the suggestion, and Matti knew that she had made the right decision. As the night drew to a close, she walked Max out into the cool evening air, chatting with him about everything from music to their shared love of whiskey.

As they stood outside "The Red Lion," Matti turned to Max with a serious expression. "Listen, kid, I want you to know that you're welcome here. You can stay in Willow Creek as long as you like - just make sure you keep your end up and treat people right." And with that, she handed him a small piece of paper with her phone number on it. "If you ever need anything, just give me a call."

Max took the paper gratefully, his eyes shining with gratitude as he promised Matti that he would not let her down. As he walked off into the darkness, Matti watched him go, feeling a sense of pride and satisfaction that she knew was only matched by her love for her pub.
