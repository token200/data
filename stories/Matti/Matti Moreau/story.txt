Matti Moreau stepped into the dimly lit room, her eyes scanning the space for any signs of life. As a private investigator, she had seen her fair share of shady characters and cramped hideaways. But there was something about this place that felt off.

She approached the barkeep, a gruff-looking man with a scruffy beard, and slid onto a stool beside him. "Whiskey," she said, her voice low and steady.

The bartender raised an eyebrow but poured her a shot without asking. Matti Moreau took it in one swift motion, feeling the burn all the way down. She knew better than to let her guard down around people like this.

As she waited for her next drink, Matti's gaze wandered around the room. It was a dingy, rundown joint, the kind of place where only those with secrets came to hide. And she had a feeling that's exactly what she was looking for.

The door swung open and a tall, lean figure slipped inside. Matti's eyes locked onto his, and she felt a jolt of recognition. It was Ryker, one of the most notorious con artists in the city. She had been tracking him for weeks, trying to get her hands on the evidence he'd stolen from her client.

Matti Moreau rose from her stool, wiping down the bar with a dirty rag as she moved towards Ryker. "Well, well, well," she said, a sly smile spreading across her face. "Looks like we've got ourselves a little reunion."

Ryker's eyes narrowed, but he didn't flinch. Matti could see the calculation in his eyes, weighing his options and coming up with a plan. She knew him too well for that.

"You're a hard man to find, Ryker," she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "But I suppose you are here now."

With a flourish, Ryker pulled out a small notebook from his pocket and flipped through the pages, stopping at a particular entry. Matti's heart skipped a beat as he read aloud the words, "Property of Matti Moreau."
