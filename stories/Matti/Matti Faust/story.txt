Matti Faust stepped into the dimly lit pub, scanning the room for a familiar face. The patrons were a mix of locals and travelers, all gathered to share stories and enjoy a pint of ale. Matti Faust's eyes landed on a hooded figure sitting in the corner, sipping on a mug of beer.

As she approached, the figure looked up, revealing piercing green eyes that locked onto hers. "Matti Faust," they said, their voice low and gravelly.

"Mati," she replied, using the nickname only her closest friends knew.

The hooded figure pushed back its cloak, revealing a messy tangle of brown hair. "I've been looking for you, Matti Faust," they said, their eyes never leaving hers.

Matti Faust raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "What's going on?"

"I have information about your sister," the stranger said, their voice barely above a whisper. "Information that could change everything."

Matti Faust's grip on her mug tightened as she felt a shiver run down her spine. Her sister, Elara, had gone missing five years ago, and Matti Faust had been searching for answers ever since.

"What do you know?" she demanded, her voice firm.

The stranger hesitated, glancing around the room before leaning in close. "I saw her," they whispered. "Elara Faust. She was alive, but...different."

Matti Faust's heart skipped a beat as she processed the information. Different? What did that even mean?

The stranger continued, their voice filled with a mixture of fear and conviction. "She was being held by people who didn't want her to be found. People who would stop at nothing to keep their secrets safe."

Matti Faust's eyes narrowed, her mind racing with possibilities. She knew she had to act fast, to find out more about Elara's fate and bring those responsible to justice.

With a newfound determination, Matti Faust turned to leave, the stranger's words echoing in her mind: "You're not alone, Matti Faust."
