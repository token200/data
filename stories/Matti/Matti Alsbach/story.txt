Matti Alsbach stepped into the dimly lit café, scanning the room for a familiar face. The scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the hum of hushed conversations. She spotted him sitting in the corner, his dark hair slicked back and a book lying open on the table in front of him.

As she approached, Matti Alsbach couldn't help but notice the way the dim lighting accentuated the lines etched into his face. Years of late nights spent pouring over ancient texts had taken its toll, but it only added to his rugged charm. She slid onto the chair opposite him, her eyes meeting his across the table.

"Mind if I join you?" she asked, her voice low and even.

Matti Alsbach shrugged, his shoulders barely rising above the worn fabric of his leather jacket. "Not at all," he replied, his eyes never leaving hers.

The silence between them was comfortable, a familiar companion to their late-night discussions about philosophy and history. Matti Alsbach knew every detail about him – from the way he chewed on the inside of his cheek when deep in thought to the peculiar way he smiled when discussing his favorite authors.

As they sipped their coffee, Matti Alsbach asked for his opinion on a particular passage from an ancient text she had been studying. His response was insightful and thoughtful, revealing a depth of knowledge that belied his unassuming demeanor. She listened intently, her eyes sparkling with interest as he explained the nuances of the text.

Their conversation flowed easily, like they were two old friends reuniting after years apart. Matti Alsbach felt at ease in his presence, as if she could be herself without fear of judgment. As they finished their coffee and prepared to leave, she reached out and touched his arm, her touch sending a shiver down her spine.

"Thanks for the chat," she said, smiling up at him. "I needed that."

Matti Alsbach smiled back, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "Anytime," he replied, his voice low and gravelly. As they parted ways outside the café, Matti Alsbach knew that their conversation would linger in her mind long after she left his presence behind.
