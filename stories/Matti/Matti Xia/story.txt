Matti Xia stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any signs of familiarity. She had been traveling for days, ever since she'd received that cryptic letter from an old acquaintance. The message had read simply: "Meet me in Ravenswood. Come alone."

As she made her way through the deserted town, Matti couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. Every windowsill, every shadowy alleyway seemed to hold a secret, waiting to be uncovered.

It wasn't until she turned a corner onto Main Street that Matti spotted him – an old man with piercing green eyes and a wild shock of white hair, his face etched with deep lines and creases. He was standing outside the local pub, puffing on a cigar as if he owned the place.

Matti approached him warily, her hand straying to the small pistol holstered at her hip. The old man didn't flinch as she drew closer, his gaze never leaving hers. "You're Matti Xia," he said finally, his voice like gravel on stone.

"How do you know my name?" Matti asked, trying to keep her tone steady.

"I know everything about you, child," the old man replied with a wry smile. "I've been watching you for years. You have... potential."

Matti raised an eyebrow. "Potential?"

The old man nodded, beckoning her inside the pub. Over a whiskey-stained table, he revealed to Matti that she was the last living heir of an ancient lineage – one rumored to wield the power of the elements themselves.

As the night wore on, Matti's mind reeled with questions and doubts. Was this some sort of wild goose chase? Or was there truth to the old man's words?

With every passing minute, however, Matti felt a spark within her ignite – a flame that threatened to consume everything in its path. It was as if she'd been sleeping, waiting for the call to awaken. And now, the world was hers for the taking.

"You're not just some crazy old man's wild card," Matti declared, her voice barely above a whisper. "I'm ready."

The old man chuckled, his eyes glinting with amusement. "Ah, but that's where you're wrong, child. You have no idea what you've become."
