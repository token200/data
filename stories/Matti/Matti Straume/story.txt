Matti Straume stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station as if searching for something – or someone. The coastal town of Ravenswood was never bustling, but on this particular morning, it seemed especially quiet.

As he walked through the streets, the crisp sea air filling his lungs, Matti's thoughts turned to his past. He had grown up in Ravenswood, the son of a fisherman and a sailor. His life had been one of waves and weather, of the ocean's moods and rhythms. But after a tragic accident left him with a disability, Matti had retreated from the sea, leaving behind the only home he had ever known.

Years had passed since then, and yet the call of Ravenswood remained strong. A mysterious letter, postmarked from an unknown sender, had arrived at his small apartment in Oslo, beckoning him back to the town where his heart still lingered.

Matti walked along the docks, watching as fishermen prepared for another day on the water. Their faces, etched with experience and worry, seemed familiar – like a worn map he knew by heart.

He stopped at the local café, ordering a strong black coffee that burned his tongue. The proprietor, Elsa, looked up from her perch behind the counter, a hint of recognition in her eyes. "Matti Straume?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Matti nodded, taking a seat at the bar. The past few weeks had been a blur, but this simple gesture spoke volumes. He was home.

As he sipped his coffee, Matti noticed a figure standing outside – a young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. Her gaze locked onto his, a spark of recognition igniting between them.

Without a word, the stranger slipped into the café, her presence quiet but potent as she made her way to Matti's side. "We need to talk," she said, her voice low and urgent.

Matti set his cup down, feeling the familiar tug of the ocean pulling him back in – this time, though, it wasn't just the sea that drew him home.
