Matti Nielsen stood at the edge of the frozen lake, her eyes fixed on the distant figure that had been following her. She had lost count of how many days it had been since she'd fled her hometown in rural Sweden, but she knew one thing for sure: she couldn't go back.

As a teenager, Matti had been a talented ice skater, always destined for greatness. But after a devastating accident on the rink left her with chronic pain and limited mobility, she was forced to give up the sport she loved. The grief and anger that followed consumed her, driving her to leave everything behind and start anew.

Now, in her early twenties, Matti had found solace in the quiet rhythms of her new life. She lived off the grid, her days spent tending to a small garden, fishing in the lake, and honing her skills as a wilderness survivalist. The solitude had helped her heal, but it also meant she had no one to turn to when trouble came knocking.

Trouble was exactly what Matti saw before her now – a ruggedly handsome stranger with piercing blue eyes and a mop of messy brown hair. He skated towards her, his movements fluid and powerful, as if he'd been gliding across the ice since birth. Matti's instincts told her to be wary, but there was something about this stranger that put her at ease.

As they drew closer, Matti saw that the stranger wore a backpack and carried an axe slung over his shoulder – signs of a seasoned outdoorsman. She watched warily as he skated up to her, his eyes locked on hers with an unnerving intensity.

"Who are you?" she asked gruffly, trying to keep her tone neutral.

"I'm Max," the stranger replied, his voice deep and rich. "And I've been following you for days."

Matti's grip on her axe tightened. "Why?"

Max hesitated before answering. "I lost someone too, a long time ago. Someone who loved ice as much as I do. And then one day...I saw you out here, alone and lost, just like I was all those years ago. I had to find you."

Matti's heart skipped a beat as she took in Max's words. No one knew about her past, no one except for the ghost of her own guilt and regret. But there was something about this stranger that told her he'd seen right through her.

Without thinking, Matti nodded. "I'll show you what I've built here," she said, a small smile creeping onto her face.

For the first time in years, Matti felt like she wasn't alone.
