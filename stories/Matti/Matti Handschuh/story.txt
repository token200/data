Matti Handschuh, the infamous hacker extraordinaire, sat in front of his computer, eyes fixed on the screen as he expertly navigated the dark web. His fingers danced across the keyboard with lightning speed and precision, leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that led nowhere.

But in the shadows, whispers began to circulate about Matti's true intentions.
