A renowned historian specializing in 19th-century Polish culture, Malgorzata's extensive research had garnered her numerous accolades and publications.

One fateful evening, while lecturing at the University of Warsaw, Malgorzata Gorski stumbled upon a cryptic manuscript that hinted at a long-forgotten secret society operating within the city's historical heart.
