Tamás Novák sat alone in his small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and faded photographs. As a retired professor of Hungarian literature, he had spent most of his life immersed in the works of Attila József, Endre Ady, and Sándor Márai. But now, at 75 years old, Tamás found himself struggling to connect with the world beyond his own four walls.

Tamás's thoughts drifted back to his childhood, growing up in Budapest during World War II. His parents had been intellectuals themselves, and their love of literature had been passed down through generations. As a young man, Tamás had followed in their footsteps, earning a degree in Hungarian studies and going on to teach at several universities throughout his career.

Despite his many accomplishments, however, Tamás felt like a relic of the past. The world was changing too fast for him to keep up, and he found himself increasingly isolated from those around him. His friends had long since moved away or passed on, leaving Tamás alone with his thoughts.

As he pondered his own mortality, Tamás's gaze fell upon an old photograph of himself in academic regalia. It was a picture he hadn't looked at in years, but something about it stirred something deep within him. He remembered the thrill of delivering lectures, of watching students' faces light up as they discovered new authors and ideas.

Tamás's eyes wandered to the shelf behind him, where his prized collection of Hungarian literature sat on display. He ran his fingers over the spines of the books, feeling a sense of comfort in their familiar shapes and scents. Among them, one book stood out: "Poems", a slim volume of Attila József's works that Tamás had first read as a teenager.

For a moment, Tamás felt transported back to a time when words were enough, when the world outside his window didn't matter. He took a deep breath, and let the silence wash over him. In that stillness, he found a sense of peace, a reminder that even in isolation, there was still beauty to be found.

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the room, Tamás Novák settled back into his chair, surrounded by the comforts of his own world. He opened "Poems" once more, and let József's words wash over him like a balm to his soul. In that moment, he knew that as long as he had his books, he would never be truly alone.
