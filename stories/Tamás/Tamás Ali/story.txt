Tamás Ali was a man with a mysterious past. He had few friends, but those he did have were fiercely loyal to him. He lived in Budapest, Hungary, and spent most of his days working as an antique dealer.

One day, a wealthy client walked into the shop where Tamás worked. The man introduced himself as Ivan, and Tamás could sense that there was something unusual about him. Ivan seemed particularly interested in a small, intricately carved music box that Tamás had recently acquired.

"I'll give you 500 euros for it," Ivan said, his voice low and smooth. "But I want to make sure it's authentic."

Tamás knew that the music box was valuable, but he also knew its history. It belonged to a wealthy family from Vienna who had emigrated to Budapest during World War II.

"I'll need 700 euros for it," Tamás said, his eyes locked on Ivan's. "I've done extensive research on this piece, and I'm confident that it's genuine."

Ivan smiled, revealing perfectly white teeth. "Very well," he said. "But if you're not satisfied with the price, I'll have to take my business elsewhere."

Tamás was intrigued by Ivan's demeanor, but he also knew that he couldn't pass up the opportunity. He agreed to sell the music box for 700 euros.

As soon as Ivan left the shop, Tamás felt a sense of unease. Who was this man really? And why did he seem so interested in the music box?

That evening, Tamás received a mysterious phone call from an unknown number. "Tamás Ali, I've been watching you," a low voice said. "You're not who you claim to be."

Tamás's heart skipped a beat. Who was this person? And how did they know his real identity?

The line went dead, and Tamás was left with more questions than answers. But one thing was certain: he had to be careful around Ivan now.

Over the next few days, Tamás noticed strange occurrences happening around him. People would approach him on the street, asking about the music box or trying to sell him other antiques. It was as if Ivan had set something in motion.

Tamás began to investigate Ivan's past, determined to uncover the truth behind his enigmatic presence in Budapest. But little did he know that he was just getting started on a journey that would change his life forever.
