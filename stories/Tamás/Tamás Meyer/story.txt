Tamás Meyer was known for his unorthodox approach to problem-solving. As a brilliant and resourceful detective, he had an uncanny ability to think outside the box and uncover clues that others might miss. His colleagues often joked that Tamás had a Ph.D. in creative thinking, and it wasn't far from the truth.

One day, Tamás was called to investigate a string of burglaries in the upscale neighborhood where his family lived. The victims were all wealthy business owners, and the thief seemed to be targeting only those with the most valuable possessions. As Tamás began his investigation, he noticed that each break-in occurred during a specific lunar phase – new moon.

Tamás's eyes lit up as he made the connection. He recalled a similar case from his past, where a serial killer had used the same lunar pattern to plan his crimes. The similarities were striking, and Tamás knew he was onto something big.

As he delved deeper into the case, Tamás discovered that the thief was not just any ordinary burglar, but someone with a deep understanding of astrology and astronomy. The thief was using the new moon as a signal to strike, taking advantage of the darkness and the cover of night to carry out their crimes.

With this newfound knowledge, Tamás set a trap for the thief, using the next new moon as bait. And sure enough, the thief took the bait, setting off a chain of events that would lead Tamás straight to their doorstep.

As Tamás confronted the thief, he couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. He had solved the case, once again proving himself to be one of the best detectives in the business. His colleagues were already buzzing with excitement about his next move, wondering what creative solution he would come up with next.

For Tamás Meyer, it was just another day on the job – a chance to use his unique skills and experience to bring justice to those who had been wronged. And as he walked away from the crime scene, he couldn't help but smile at the thought of what other challenges lay ahead for him to overcome.
