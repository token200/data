Tamás Charpentier stepped out of his small café on Rue de Rivoli, surveying the bustling streets of Paris. As a former detective, he had seen it all - the beautiful and the ugly, the joyous and the heartbroken. But as he walked towards the Seine, he couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off.

It had been two years since his sister, Colette, had gone missing. The police had given up on the case, but Tamás knew she hadn't just vanished into thin air. He had a hunch, and it drove him to keep searching for answers.

As he strolled along the riverbank, the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the city. Tamás spotted a young woman sitting alone on a bench, staring at the water. There was something about her that reminded him of Colette - the same dark hair, the same green eyes.

Tamás approached the woman cautiously, not wanting to startle her. "Bonjour," he said softly. The woman turned, startled, and Tamás saw the faintest glimmer of recognition in her eyes. She was a stranger, but she knew him.

"I've seen you before," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "You have a face from my dreams."

Tamás sat down beside her, his mind racing with possibilities. Who was this mysterious woman? And what did she know about Colette's disappearance?

The woman pulled out a small notebook and began to flip through its pages. "I've been looking for answers too," she said, her eyes scanning the book. "About my sister. She was a detective like you."

Tamás' heart skipped a beat as he took in the words. His sister had worked with some of the toughest cases in Paris - and now this woman claimed to have information about Colette's disappearance.

The sun dipped below the horizon, casting the city in darkness. Tamás knew that he had just scratched the surface of something much bigger than himself. He looked at the woman with newfound hope and determination - together, they might finally uncover the truth about his sister's disappearance.
