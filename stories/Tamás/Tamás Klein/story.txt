Tamás Klein stood at the edge of the Danube River, gazing out at the twinkling lights of Budapest. He took a long drag on his cigarette, feeling the cool night air fill his lungs as he watched the stars reflected in the water below.

It was moments like these that Tamás felt most alive – free from the constraints of his mundane routine and the weight of his family's expectations. As the sole heir to his father's modest import business, Tamás felt suffocated by the burden of responsibility. His parents had always envisioned him taking over the family company, but Tamás had other plans.

He dreamed of becoming a writer – of capturing the essence of Hungary's complex history and culture on paper. But every time he tried to sit down with his trusty typewriter, his father would appear at his doorstep, warning him about the dangers of "wasting his talent" on frivolous pursuits.

Tamás sighed, exhaling a plume of smoke into the night air. Why couldn't they understand that writing was his true passion? He had grown up surrounded by the stories of Hungarian poets and writers – Attila József, Gyula Krúdy, and Endre Ady – their words weaving a spell around him like a magic carpet.

As he stood there, lost in thought, Tamás noticed an elderly woman watching him from across the river. Her eyes were sunken, her skin weathered by years of hard labor and hardship, but they sparkled with a deep kindness. For a moment, their gazes locked, and Tamás felt an inexplicable connection to this stranger.

Without thinking, he began to recite a poem by Krúdy – "The river flows in its sleep" – the words tumbling out of him like a confession. The woman smiled, her eyes welling up with tears as she listened. When he finished, she approached him, her voice barely above a whisper.

"You have the heart of a poet, Tamás Klein," she said, her accent thick with the Hungarian language. "Don't let anyone dull your spark."

In that moment, something shifted within Tamás. He knew he had made a choice – to follow his dreams and take a chance on himself. As the stars above twinkled like diamonds, he smiled, feeling the river's current carry him forward into an uncertain but vibrant future.
