Tamás Laine stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station as he breathed in the familiar scent of old wood and damp earth. It had been years since he'd set foot in Budapest, but the city never forgot its children.

Tamás had returned to his hometown after a decade away, driven by a sense of restlessness that couldn't be shaken. He'd spent years wandering the world, taking on odd jobs and collecting stories, but something was missing. His father, a skilled carpenter, had passed away a year ago, leaving Tamás his small workshop and a sense of duty to keep the tradition alive.

As he walked through the station, memories came flooding back: the smell of freshly cut wood, the sound of hammers ringing out, and the laughter of children playing in the streets. He'd always been close to his younger sister, Szofi, who had taken it upon herself to take care of their mother after their father's passing.

Tamás made his way through the crowded streets, nodding hello to familiar faces as he passed by the market stalls and cafes that lined the way. His stomach growled with anticipation – the smell of freshly baked bread wafting from the nearby bakery was too enticing to resist.

As he walked, Tamás couldn't help but notice the changes in his hometown. The old buildings were still there, weathered and worn, but new businesses had sprung up along the streets, catering to tourists and young professionals. It was a different city now, one that was gentrifying at an alarming rate.

Tamás felt a pang of unease as he approached his father's workshop – it looked smaller than he remembered, with newer equipment scattered about the floor. But something about the dusty tools and familiar smell drew him in. He took a deep breath, feeling a sense of homecoming wash over him.

Szofi greeted him at the door, her eyes shining with tears as she wrapped him in a tight hug. "Welcome home, Tamás," she said, her voice trembling. "We've missed you so much."

Tamás smiled, his throat constricting as he hugged her back. He knew that this was where he belonged – in this small workshop, surrounded by the memories of his past and the promise of a new future.
