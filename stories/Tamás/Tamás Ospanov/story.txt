Tamás Ospanov stepped out of the rain and into the warm, golden light of the Budapest Café. The smell of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the hum of conversation and the clinking of glasses. As a freelance journalist, Tamás had spent countless hours in establishments like this one, pouring over notes and researching stories.

But on this particular evening, Tamás wasn't here to work. He was here for more personal reasons. His eyes scanned the room, searching for the familiar smile of Szofi Szabó, his friend and confidant. She had agreed to meet him tonight, and he couldn't wait to catch up with her.

As if on cue, a petite figure emerged from the crowd and made her way over to Tamás's table. Her long, dark hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall, and her bright green eyes sparkled as she smiled at Tamás.

"Mind the wine stain," Szofi said, nodding toward the smudge on her dress. "I had an accident while getting ready this morning."

Tamás chuckled and handed her a napkin to clean up the spill. "You look beautiful, even with a wine stain," he said, as he took his seat across from her.

Over coffee and conversation, Tamás filled Szofi in on the latest developments in his investigation into the local art world. She listened intently, asking insightful questions and offering words of encouragement.

As they chatted, a hush fell over the café, and the patrons began to stare at the small, elegantly-dressed couple. There was something about Tamás's intensity, his passion for justice, that commanded attention. Szofi leaned in close, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Tamás, what's really going on with this case? You're not telling me everything."

Tamás hesitated, weighing the risks of revealing too much. But he trusted Szofi, and she was the only person who could see past his tough exterior to the vulnerable man beneath.

"It's getting personal," Tamás said finally, his eyes locked on hers. "I'm starting to think that the art world is involved in something sinister."

Szofi's eyes widened, and she reached out to take Tamás's hand.
