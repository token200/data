Tamás Sepp was an unlikely hero in Budapest's underbelly. By day, he was just another face in the crowded streets of Pest, working as a florist to make ends meet. But by night, he donned a different persona - one that commanded respect and fear in equal measure.

As the leader of the infamous 'Rouge Violets', Tamás Sepp orchestrated daring heists and high-stakes poker games with an elegance that belied his rough demeanor. His gang was a motley crew of misfits, each with their own unique skillset: Sándor 'The Bull' Nagy, an ex-weightlifter with a penchant for violence; László 'Lucky' Keresztes, a card shark with a talent for math; and Erzsébet 'Ebbie' Szabó, an enigmatic hacker who could infiltrate even the most secure systems.

Tamás Sepp was the mastermind behind it all, pulling the strings from the shadows. His reputation grew with each success, earning him both adoration and notoriety among Budapest's elite. Some whispered that he had ties to organized crime syndicates, while others claimed he was a rogue agent working for a foreign power.

Despite the whispers, Tamás Sepp remained enigmatic, his true loyalties unknown even to those closest to him. He moved through the city like a ghost, leaving behind a trail of broken rules and shattered reputations in his wake. Those who dared cross him paid dearly - or became his unlikely accomplices.

One fateful night, Tamás Sepp received an offer he couldn't refuse: a high-stakes game against the enigmatic 'Golden Ace', rumored to be unbeatable at poker. Tamás Sepp accepted the challenge, knowing that victory would cement his place as Budapest's top dog. As the cards were dealt and the games began, only one thing was certain - only one man would walk away with the prize.

With a flick of his wrist, Tamás Sepp slid into his seat, a sly smile spreading across his face. He was Tamás Sepp, the master of the Rouge Violets, and he had a reputation to uphold.
