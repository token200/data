Tamás Viljanen trudged through the snow-covered streets of Helsinki, his eyes fixed on the frosty pavement beneath his feet. As a former detective turned private investigator, he had seen it all - the darkest corners of human nature and the most desperate of cases.

But this latest assignment was different. It was personal.

Tamás's client, a young woman named Lea, had approached him with a mystery that seemed to have no solution. Her sister, a renowned Finnish author, had gone missing while researching her next novel in the remote wilderness of Lapland. The police were stumped, and Tamás had taken on the case as a favor to Lea.

As he walked, the snowflakes danced around him like tiny ballerinas. He thought about the case, trying to piece together the few clues Lea had provided. A cryptic note found near her sister's research site, a rumor of a rival author who had been stalking her sibling...it was all too vague.

Tamás arrived at his office, a small, cluttered room above a pub in the heart of the city. He poured himself a cup of coffee and began to sift through Lea's notes. The handwriting was shaky, but one word stood out: "Echo".

He made a mental note to look into this, and then pulled out his phone to dial a number. His old partner, Juhani, had retired from the force, but Tamás knew he still kept an ear on the ground. Maybe Juhani had heard something.

As he waited for the call to go through, Tamás's mind wandered back to Lea and her sister. What drove them to disappear into the wilderness? And what did they know about "Echo"? He was determined to find out.

The phone rang, and Tamás answered, his eyes narrowing as Juhani spoke on the other end. There was a pause, and then Juhani whispered a single word: "Raven".

Tamás's heart quickened. Raven was an old name for the wind, but it also had connotations of magic and mystery. He knew he was onto something.

"I'll meet you at the old windmill on the outskirts," Tamás said, already planning his next move.

As he hung up, a snowflake landed on his nose, and he smiled to himself. This case was about to get a whole lot more interesting.
