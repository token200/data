Tamás Roberts trudged through the snowy streets of Budapest, his eyes fixed on the pavement beneath his boots. As a journalist, he had seen it all - the beauty and the ugliness, the triumphs and the tragedies. But today was different. Today, he was searching for something more.

It had been three months since his sister, Szofi, had gone missing. The police were stumped, and Tamás' own investigations had yielded nothing but dead ends. He had lost count of the number of times he'd sat in front of a blank computer screen, staring at the cursor as if it held the answer.

As he walked, the buildings seemed to grow taller and more menacing, their stone facades like cold, unforgiving eyes. Tamás quickened his pace, his thoughts consumed by Szofi's bright smile and laughter. He remembered the way she used to dance in the rain, her hair flying out around her face like a wild halo.

He turned into a narrow alleyway, the walls towering above him on either side. The air was thick with the scent of wood smoke and decay. Tamás followed his nose to a small café, its door slightly ajar.

 Inside, he spotted a familiar figure hunched over a cup of coffee. It was Viktor, an old friend from college who had always been drawn to the darker side of life. Tamás slid into the booth across from him, his eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble.

"What are you doing here?" Tamás asked, his voice low and cautious.

Viktor looked up, a hint of curiosity in his eyes. "Just enjoying the view," he said, nodding towards the snow-covered rooftops. "The city's always at its most beautiful when it's about to collapse."

Tamás felt a shiver run down his spine. Viktor was known for his fascination with the underbelly of Budapest, and Tamás had no doubt that his friend was hiding something.

But as they sat there in silence, watching the snow fall like a veil over the city, Tamás began to feel a sense of hope. Maybe, just maybe, he was on the cusp of something new - a lead, a break, or even just a glimmer of light in the darkness.

With a newfound determination, Tamás pushed back his chair and stood up, the snow outside seeming to fall slower, as if time itself had slowed down. "Let's look for Szofi together," he said, his voice firm and resolute.
