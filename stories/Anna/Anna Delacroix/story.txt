Anna Delacroix was a woman with a mysterious past, shrouded in whispers and speculation among those who knew her. Few people had ever seen her smile, and even fewer had heard her speak without a hint of sarcasm lacing her words.

As she walked into the dimly lit café, a bell above the door jingled softly, announcing her arrival to the patrons within. Her piercing green eyes scanned the room, as if searching for someone – or something. She slid onto a stool at the bar, ordering a whiskey on the rocks without hesitation.

The bartender, a gruff but affable man named Jack, raised an eyebrow at Anna's request. "You sure you want that, miss? It's not exactly a gentle drink."

Anna Delacroix flashed a rare smile, revealing a hint of mischief in her eyes. "I'm not exactly fragile, Jack. I can handle it."

As the night wore on, the café began to fill with more patrons, each drawn by Anna's enigmatic presence. Some came seeking answers, while others simply wanted to bask in her aura. Anna listened intently, her gaze piercing through the chatter and noise.

One man, a young writer named Alex, approached her table, notebook and pen at the ready. "I've heard rumors about you, Anna Delacroix," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "Some say you're cursed, others that you're blessed. What's the truth?"

Anna leaned back in her stool, eyes never leaving Alex's face. "The truth is simple, Alex. I'm just trying to survive. The rest is just noise."

As the hours passed, the café emptied, and Anna Delacroix was the last one left. Jack refilled her whiskey glass, his expression a mixture of concern and curiosity.

"You know, miss, you're not like most people," he said, as if sharing a secret. "You have this... presence about you. It's almost otherworldly."

Anna Delacroix raised an eyebrow, a hint of amusement dancing in her eyes. "Otherworldly? That's quite a word for someone who's just trying to make it in the world, Jack."

The bartender chuckled, shaking his head. "I guess I'm just drawn to you, Anna Delacroix. You're a puzzle I'll never fully understand."

As she downed her last drink, Anna stood up, her movements fluid and confident. The night air enveloped her like a shroud, but for one moment, it seemed as though she was invincible – a fleeting glimpse of something more than human, just before she vanished into the shadows once again.
