Anna King stood at the edge of the city, her eyes gazing out at the endless expanse of concrete and steel. She was a woman on the run, haunted by secrets that threatened to consume her. As she breathed in the cool night air, the weight of her past seemed to settle heavier on her shoulders.

A former journalist turned private investigator, Anna had spent years chasing down leads and unearthing scandals. But when her sister's murder shook her world, Anna's obsession with the truth had led her down a dark path. Her investigation had uncovered a web of corruption that went all the way to the top – and now, she was being watched.

Anna's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her phone buzzing in her pocket. She pulled it out, her eyes scanning the screen for any sign of recognition. A text from an unknown number flashed before her: "You're getting close, Anna. Meet me at the old clock tower if you want to uncover the truth."

Anna's instincts screamed caution, but a spark of curiosity ignited within her. She had a feeling that this could be the break she needed – or the key to unraveling the tangled threads of her sister's death.

With a sense of trepidation, Anna made her way through the deserted streets, avoiding alleys and side streets in favor of the main road. The clock tower loomed ahead, its imposing silhouette casting long shadows across the pavement. As she approached, a figure emerged from the darkness – hooded and shrouded in shadows.

Anna hesitated for a moment before stepping forward, her hand instinctively reaching for the small gun hidden beneath her jacket. "Who are you?" she demanded, her voice steady despite the rising panic within.

The figure pulled back its hood, revealing the face of a young woman – one who looked uncannily like Anna's sister in life and death.

"Look at me," the woman said, her eyes gleaming with an otherworldly intensity. "I'll show you the truth. Come with me."

Anna's world spun as she hesitated between fear and curiosity. Something within her urged her forward – a desperate desire to uncover the secrets that had haunted her for so long.

"I'm in," she said finally, extending her hand to seal the pact.
