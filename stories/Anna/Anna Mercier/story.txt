Anna Mercier stood at the edge of the ocean, her toes curled over the worn wooden planks of the pier. The salty air whipped through her long, dark hair as she gazed out at the waves. She felt small and insignificant in the face of the vast expanse of water before her.

It was a feeling Anna had grown accustomed to. As a child, she'd watched her parents struggle to make ends meet on the small island where they lived. Her father's fishing trips had been infrequent and unreliable, leaving them scrambling to put food on the table. But when he did come back with a catch, the smell of fresh seafood would fill their tiny cottage, transporting Anna to a world of simple joys.

As she grew older, Anna began to realize that her parents' struggles were not unique. Many families in the small community relied on the sea for their livelihoods. The constant uncertainty had taken its toll – her father's fishing trips became more sporadic, and eventually, he vanished at sea when Anna was just a teenager.

She'd always felt guilty about his disappearance. Had she been too demanding? Too clingy? The questions swirled in her mind like the currents beneath the waves.

Now, as an adult, Anna had left the island to chase her own dreams. She worked as a marine biologist, studying the ocean's creatures and ecosystems. Her work took her to different parts of the world, but she always felt a pang of homesickness whenever she returned to the island.

As she stood on the pier, lost in thought, Anna spotted a familiar shape bobbing in the distance – her father's old fishing boat, now painted a vibrant shade of blue. She watched as it drew closer, its engine sputtering and coughing out white steam.

Her heart skipped a beat as her father stepped ashore, his weathered face creasing into a warm smile. He walked towards her, the wind whipping his hair back, and wrapped his arms around her in a tight hug.

"I was just checking on the nets," he said, releasing her from his grasp. "You're doing well, kiddo. I'm proud of you."

Anna felt tears prick at the corners of her eyes as she hugged him tightly. For the first time in years, she felt like she'd found a part of herself again – the sense of belonging to this place and its people. As they walked along the pier together, watching the sun set over the ocean, Anna knew that no matter where life took her, she would always carry the sea with her.
