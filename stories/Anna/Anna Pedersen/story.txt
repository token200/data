Anna Pedersen sat alone in her small apartment, staring out at the rain-soaked streets of Copenhagen. It was a typical Wednesday evening, and yet she felt like the whole city was moving without her. Her phone buzzed on the coffee table beside her, but she let it ring. She didn't want to face anyone just yet.

It had been six months since Anna's grandmother passed away, leaving her the old family bakery in the heart of the city. Anna had always dreamed of running the bakery herself, but now that reality stared back at her, she felt lost and uncertain. Her grandmother had been her rock, her confidante, and her biggest supporter. Without her, the thought of taking over the bakery was daunting.

As she sat there, feeling sorry for herself, Anna's mind began to wander back to her childhood. She remembered helping her grandmother mix dough, knead bread, and decorate pastries with intricate designs. Those memories brought a smile to her face, but they also made her realize just how much her grandmother had been the driving force behind the bakery.

Just as Anna was starting to feel like she'd never be able to escape her grief, there was a knock at the door. It was her best friend, Sophia, who had arrived unannounced with a plate of freshly baked cookies. "I brought some chocolate chip goodness," Sophia said, waving the plate in front of Anna's face. "You can't stay cooped up all day feeling sorry for yourself."

Anna smiled weakly, taking one of the warm cookies from the plate. As she bit into it, the sweetness exploded on her tongue, transporting her back to a time when life was simpler and less complicated. Sophia sat down beside her, putting a comforting arm around Anna's shoulders.

"You know what?" Sophia said after they'd eaten in silence for a few moments. "I think your grandmother would want you to do this. She would want you to take over the bakery and make it your own."

Anna looked at Sophia, feeling a surge of determination. Maybe her grandmother was right â€“ maybe this was exactly where she was meant to be. With newfound resolve, Anna stood up, wiping away a stray tear. "You're right," she said, smiling. "I'm going to do it."
