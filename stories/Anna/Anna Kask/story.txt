Anna Kask was a young and ambitious journalist who had always been drawn to the darker side of life. With her sharp instincts and quick wit, she had built a reputation for herself as one of the most feared investigative reporters in the city.

One night, Anna received a cryptic message from an anonymous source claiming to have information about a high-profile murder that had taken place several months earlier. The victim was a wealthy businessman who had been found dead in his office with no signs of forced entry or struggle. The only clue was a small piece of paper on the floor with a single sentence written on it: "You will never find me."

Anna's curiosity was piqued, and she immediately began to dig into the case. She spent hours poring over police reports and conducting interviews with witnesses, but every lead seemed to end in a dead-end.

Undeterred, Anna decided to pay a visit to her source, who had promised to meet her at a local coffee shop. As she sat down at the table, she noticed that her source was wearing a distinctive silver necklace with a small pendant in the shape of a bird.

"What do you want me to know?" Anna asked, trying to keep her tone neutral.

Her source leaned in close and whispered, "Anna Kask, I think I can help you crack this case. But you have to promise me one thing: you have to trust me."

Anna hesitated for a moment before nodding. Her source then began to tell her the story of how the victim had been blackmailing several prominent politicians in the city, using secrets and information that he had obtained through his business dealings.

As Anna listened intently, she realized that this was the break she had been waiting for. With new leads and clues in hand, she vowed to get to the bottom of the case and expose the truth.

Anna Kask left the coffee shop feeling more determined than ever. She knew it wouldn't be easy, but she was ready to face whatever challenges came her way.
