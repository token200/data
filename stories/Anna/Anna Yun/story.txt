Anna Yun had always been fascinated by the ancient art of calligraphy. As a young child, she would spend hours watching her grandmother painstakingly practice the intricate strokes and curves that made up Chinese characters. Now, as a professional artist, Anna's passion for calligraphy only deepened.

Despite the risks, Anna Yun remained committed to her artistic vision. Her innovative approach earned her a solo exhibition at the National Gallery in Beijing, which drew critical acclaim from both domestic and international audiences.
