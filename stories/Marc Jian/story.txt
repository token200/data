Marc Jian was an enigmatic figure, shrouded in mystery. Few knew much about him beyond his striking features and razor-sharp wit. Some said he was a master thief, while others whispered that he was a spy, a ghostly operative who vanished into thin air at the most inopportune moments.

The truth was far more complicated. Marc Jian was, in fact, a retired intelligence agent, driven by a sense of duty and a deep-seated need for revenge against those who had wronged him.

As a young man, Marc had been recruited into the Agency, an elite organization dedicated to defending the world from threats both human and supernatural. He excelled under pressure, earning a reputation as one of the most skilled operatives in the business. But during his final mission, everything went terribly wrong. His sister was killed in action, and he was left for dead.

Marc's colleagues thought him lost forever, but in reality, he had been covertly trained by the Agency's top scientists to survive even the most impossible situations. He disappeared into hiding, vowing to one day exact revenge on those responsible for his sister's death.

Years went by, and Marc Jian became a mythic figure, a ghost who haunted the fringes of espionage. Some said he was still working for the Agency, that he continued to pull the strings from behind the scenes. Others claimed he had turned to a life of crime, using his skills for personal gain.

The truth was too complicated even for Marc himself. He had become lost in his own world, haunted by memories of the past and driven by a desire to right the wrongs that had been done to him. His name became synonymous with danger and deception, but he knew nothing of either.

One night, as the rain pounded against the pavement like a relentless drumbeat, Marc Jian slipped out of the shadows, his eyes locked on the building where his sister's killer was hiding. The game was far from over; it was time for him to take back what was rightfully his.
