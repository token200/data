Leo Fernández González sat alone in his dimly lit office, staring out at the cityscape below. The once-bustling streets were now eerily quiet, as if the world outside had moved on without him. He ran his fingers through his graying hair, feeling the weight of years.

As a former detective, Leo had seen it all – the good, the bad, and the ugly. But nothing could have prepared him for the personal loss he'd suffered just a few months ago. His partner, his friend, and his confidant, Ana Moreno, had been murdered in a brutal act of violence. The case remained unsolved, and Leo's anger and frustration simmered just below the surface.

Leo's mind began to wander back to the days when he was on the force, when every lead felt like a lifeline to justice. He thought about his time with Ana – their late-night stakeouts, their celebratory drinks after solving a tough case, and the quiet moments when it was just the two of them.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the city in an orange glow, Leo rose from his chair. He lit a cigar and walked over to the window, where he stood lost in thought for several minutes. The cool breeze carried with it whispers of memories long past – conversations had with Ana about her dreams, their late-night debates about justice, and the look she'd give him when he got something right.

Leo took one last puff before stubbing out his cigar. With a sigh, he turned away from the view and began to walk towards his desk. In front of him sat an old notebook, its pages dog-eared from countless late-night study sessions with Ana. He flipped through the pages, running his fingers over familiar names – suspects, witnesses, theories.

As he continued flipping, something caught his eye – a scribbled note in the margins, written in Ana's handwriting: "Look into the red file." The memory of that case hit him like a ton of bricks – it was the one they'd put on the backburner, unable to crack due to lack of evidence. But Leo remembered something about it now – something his subconscious had been trying to tell him for months.

A faint light in the room seemed brighter as Leo's eyes widened with newfound determination. He knew exactly what he needed to do next – take a fresh look at that case and see if justice could finally be served.
