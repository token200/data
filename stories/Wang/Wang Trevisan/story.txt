I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Wang Trevisan. However, I can create a short story based on your request.

Wang Trevisan was a young and ambitious artist living in modern-day Beijing. Born Wang Zhongjun Trevisan to a family of humble means, he had always been drawn to the world of art. Despite facing numerous rejections from galleries and studios, Wang Trevisan persevered, determined to make a name for himself.

One day, while exploring the winding alleys of the ancient city, Wang Trevisan stumbled upon a small, mysterious shop tucked away in a forgotten corner. The sign above the door read "Ming's Art Supply," and the windows were filled with an assortment of strange and exotic materials that sparkled in the fading light.

Intrigued, Wang Trevisan pushed open the door and stepped inside. The shop was dimly lit, but as his eyes adjusted, he saw a bespectacled old man sitting behind a workbench, surrounded by half-finished canvases and paint-splattered palettes. "Welcome, young one," Ming said with a warm smile. "I've been expecting you."

Wang Trevisan explained his struggles to make it as an artist, and Ming listened intently, nodding his head from time to time. When the young man finished speaking, Ming handed him a small, intricately carved wooden box. "This is a gift," he said. "Inside, you'll find a special brand of paint that will unlock your true creative potential."

Over the next few weeks, Wang Trevisan worked tirelessly with the enchanted paint, creating pieces that were unlike anything he had ever produced before. His art began to gain attention from critics and collectors alike, and soon, his name was on everyone's lips.

As Wang Trevisan stood in front of his latest masterpiece, a sense of pride and accomplishment washed over him. He thought back to the old man who had changed his life and realized that he owed it all to Ming and his magical art supply. From that day forward, Wang Trevisan knew that nothing was impossible with a little creativity and the right tools.
