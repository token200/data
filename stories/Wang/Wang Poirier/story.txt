Wang Poirier was a enigmatic figure, known only by his surname to the people of Montreal's vibrant Chinatown. Born with the traditional Chinese name Wang Pingjun, he had shed his cultural heritage to adopt the French-Canadian moniker that suited him better.

Poirier worked as a part-time DJ at a local nightclub, spinning tracks that blended traditional Chinese instruments with modern electronic beats. His eclectic style drew in crowds from all over the city, and soon, his reputation as one of Montreal's most exciting DJs spread like wildfire.

Despite his newfound success, Poirier remained true to his roots. He still made time for his loved ones back in China, whom he affectionately called "Mama" and "Baba" over video calls. They would often joke about his French-Canadian name being an attempt to fit in, but Poirier knew that Wang Pingjun was where his heart truly lay.

One night, as Poirier was setting up for a gig at the famous Place Jacques-Cartier square, he noticed a group of young artists gathered around him. They were admiring his vintage synthesizers and asking questions about his creative process. One of them, a talented musician named Lily, approached Poirier with an intriguing proposal.

"Hey Wang, I've been listening to your sets nonstop," Lily said, "and I think we could collaborate on something amazing together." Poirier's eyes lit up as he considered the idea. He had always been open to experimenting with new sounds and styles, and working with a talented local artist like Lily seemed like a match made in heaven.

As the night went on, Poirier and Lily brainstormed ideas for their joint project. They talked about fusing traditional Chinese instruments with modern electronic beats, creating something entirely new and innovative. The possibilities were endless, and Poirier couldn't wait to get started.

Backstage, as he was preparing for his set, Poirier's mind wandered back to his childhood in China. He remembered playing the guqin with his "Baba" under the stars, feeling a deep connection to the ancient instrument. Now, as Wang Poirier, he felt like he had found a new way to express himself â€“ one that combined his love of music with his roots and heritage.

As the crowd began to fill in at the square, Poirier took a deep breath, put on his headphones, and let the music take over. The beat pulsed through the air, and for a moment, all was right with the world.
