Wang Ruiz García stepped out of his small, cluttered shop in the heart of Old Town, taking a deep breath of the crisp morning air. As a master craftsman and woodworker, he spent most of his days surrounded by the scent of sawdust and varnish, but after a good night's sleep, it was invigorating.

 Ruiz García took pride in his work, carefully selecting each piece of wood to create beautiful and intricate pieces that were sought after by collectors from all over the world. His latest project, a stunning wooden clock with delicate carvings of Chinese dragons and phoenixes, had taken him weeks to complete.

As he walked through the winding streets of Old Town, Ruiz García noticed the way people moved with purpose, each one lost in their own thoughts. He smiled to himself, remembering when he too was consumed by his work. His father, also a skilled craftsman, had taught him everything he knew, and Ruiz García's passion for woodworking had grown stronger with each passing year.

Despite the success of his shop, Ruiz García never forgot where he came from.
