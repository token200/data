Wang Kovalova's tireless efforts paid off when she successfully cultivated the new orchid species, which she named "Kovaloviana" in honor of herself. The discovery sparked a new wave of interest in botany and conservation, inspiring a generation of scientists and explorers to follow in Wang Kovalova's footsteps.

Years later, Wang Kovalova looked back on her remarkable journey with pride, knowing that her passion for botany had led to some of the most significant discoveries of the century. Her name became synonymous with bravery, intelligence, and a love for nature â€“ a testament to the power of dedication and perseverance in the face of adversity.
