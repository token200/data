Wang Koch trudged through the dense forest, his worn leather boots sinking into the damp earth. He had been searching for hours, following every lead, no matter how small, in his quest to uncover the truth behind his sister's disappearance.

As a young boy, Wang had idolized his sister, Mei. She was the one who had always encouraged him to pursue his dreams, even when their family struggled to make ends meet. Now, at 25 years old, she was gone without a word, leaving only a cryptic message on her phone: "The river is where I'll find you."

Wang's eyes scanned the forest floor, searching for any sign of Mei's presence. He had heard rumors that she had been seen in this area, talking to someone who claimed to have information about her whereabouts. But every lead ended in a dead end.

As he walked, Wang's thoughts turned to his family's history. His parents had emigrated from China when he was just a boy, seeking a better life for themselves and their children. Mei had always been fascinated by their past, poring over old letters and photographs in search of clues about their ancestors' struggles and triumphs.

Wang stopped at the edge of a clearing, his eyes adjusting to the bright sunlight filtering through the trees. In the center of the clearing stood an ancient willow tree, its branches twisted and gnarled with age. A small wooden boat bobbed gently on the water below, partially hidden by the reeds.

A shiver ran down Wang's spine as he approached the boat. He had seen this same boat in a dream just last night, and Mei had always been drawn to the river. Could it be? Was this where she would find him?

With trembling hands, Wang pushed off from the shore and boarded the boat. As he glided across the water, the world seemed to slow down. He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath, and let the rhythm of the river wash over him.

When he opened his eyes again, a figure stood waiting on the far bank, beckoning him closer. Wang's heart leapt with hope as he rowed towards them, finally finding the answers he had been searching for all these months.
