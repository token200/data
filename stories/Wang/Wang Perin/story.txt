Wang Perin was a wandering bard, traveling from town to town with his lute and a repertoire of tales that could charm even the most hardened of hearts. His real name was Wang Pei Ren, but he had long since shed his humble beginnings for the freedom of the open road.

As he walked into the local tavern, his piercing green eyes scanned the room for familiar faces. The patrons eyed him warily at first, unsure what to make of this charismatic stranger with a voice like honey and skin as smooth as silk. But Wang Perin was not one to be intimidated; he had been performing on street corners since he was a child, honing his craft until it became an extension of himself.

He took the stage in front of a rapt audience, launching into a ballad about lost love and regret. His fingers danced across the strings of his lute, weaving a spell of longing and heartache that had the crowd transfixed. Wang Pei Ren's voice soared like a nightingale on high wings, echoing off the rafters as he wove his tale.

When he finished, the room erupted into applause, with coins tossed onto the stage as a token of appreciation. Wang Perin smiled, taking a bow as the crowd cheered and whistled for more. He obliged, launching into a rousing rendition of an ancient folk song that had everyone stomping their feet and clapping along.

As the night wore on, Wang Pei Ren began to feel at home among these strangers, who were soon his friends and confidants. They shared stories of their own struggles and triumphs, their eyes lighting up with recognition as Wang Perin's tales resonated deep within them. He knew that this was why he did what he did – not just for the applause or the coin, but to connect with others on a fundamental level.

When it was time to leave, the patrons bid him farewell, pressing their coins into his hands like tokens of gratitude. Wang Pei Ren smiled and tucked them away, knowing that he had found something far more valuable than material wealth – a sense of belonging among these people who would remember his name, if only as "that bard with the voice of an angel."
