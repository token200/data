Gabriele "Kiss" Mori Bernard was a name whispered in awe by those who knew him. A man of mystery, with a past shrouded in secrecy and a present filled with intrigue. His eyes gleamed like stars on a clear night, drawing people in with an otherworldly allure.

Born into a family of diplomats, Gabriele's early life was a whirlwind of international events and high-stakes negotiations. But it was during his late teenage years that he discovered his true calling – music. With a voice like honey and gold, Gabriele would sing to anyone who would listen, entrancing crowds with his soulful melodies.

As his talent grew, so did the rumors surrounding him. Some said he had made a pact with a mysterious patron to ensure his success; others whispered that he was cursed by a rival musician who couldn't bear to share the spotlight.

The truth, however, lay somewhere in between. Gabriele's gift was real, but it came at a cost. Every time he sang, he felt the weight of someone else's sorrow or joy. It was as if his voice was a conduit for the emotions of those around him.

Despite this, Gabriele continued to perform, mesmerizing audiences with his performances. He traveled the world, playing to sold-out crowds in grand concert halls and intimate jazz clubs. His name became synonymous with excellence, and fans clamored for tickets to see him live.

But behind the scenes, Gabriele's life was a tangled web of relationships and rivalries. There was Adèle, his muse and lover; Marcel, his rival musician who seethed with jealousy; and Dr. Luna, a psychologist who sought to unravel the secrets of Gabriele's remarkable gift.

One night, after a performance in Tokyo, Gabriele received a mysterious package containing an old violin and a note that read: "Play for me, Kiss." Without hesitation, he took the stage once more, his voice soaring as he sang for an audience of one – himself. In that moment, the weight of other people's emotions lifted, leaving him free to create.

And so, Gabriele continued to perform, weaving a spell of enchantment over those who listened. His legend grew, but few knew the truth about the man behind the music – a complex, multifaceted individual with a voice that could heal and inspire.
