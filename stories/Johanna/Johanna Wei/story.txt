Johanna Wei sat in her small studio apartment, surrounded by half-finished paintings and scattered canvases. As an up-and-coming artist, she was constantly juggling multiple projects at once, but nothing seemed to be going as planned. Her latest exhibition had been a disappointment, with only a handful of buyers showing interest in her work.

Feeling defeated, Johanna poured herself a cup of coffee and slumped onto the couch. She stared blankly at the wall, wondering where it all went wrong. Was she just not good enough? Did she need to change her style or take a different approach?

Just then, her phone rang, breaking the silence. It was her best friend and confidant, Emma. "Hey, Johanna, what's up?" Emma asked, noticing Johanna's downtrodden tone over the phone.

Johanna sighed, sharing her frustrations with Emma. The two friends talked for a while, discussing everything from art to relationships to their shared love of 80s music. As they chatted, Johanna began to feel a weight lift off her shoulders. Maybe she wasn't alone in this struggle after all.

Over the next few days, Emma encouraged Johanna to take a break and focus on herself. "You need to remember why you started creating art in the first place," Emma said. "For you, it's about expressing yourself and telling stories that need to be told."

Johanna took Emma's advice to heart, spending more time exploring her own creative voice rather than trying to please others. She spent hours sketching and painting, experimenting with new techniques and mediums.

As she worked, Johanna felt a sense of freedom wash over her. This was what it meant to be an artist - not just about creating something visually appealing, but about tapping into her own unique energy and perspective.

One evening, as she stepped back from her latest piece, Johanna Wei felt a surge of pride and satisfaction. It wasn't perfect, but it was hers, a true reflection of her artistic voice. For the first time in weeks, she felt like she was back on track, ready to take on whatever challenges lay ahead.

With renewed confidence, Johanna picked up her phone and dialed Emma's number once again. "Hey, guess what?" she said with a grin. "I think I'm starting to get it."
