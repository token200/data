Johanna Vargas Llosa stepped off the bus and onto the worn asphalt of the small town's main street. She had been traveling for days, trying to escape the memories that haunted her. As she made her way through the crowded market, Johanna Vargas Llosa's eyes scanned the colorful stalls, searching for something – anything – to distract her from the pain.

She stopped in front of a small food cart, where a vendor offered her a steaming cup of coffee and a warm smile. "Welcome, Johanna," he said, his voice dripping with familiarity. She smiled back, feeling a pang of sadness at the thought that she had once called this place home.

Johanna Vargas Llosa sat down on a bench, cradling her cup in her hands as she watched the crowd bustle around her. The vendor's wife came out with a plate of freshly baked empanadas, and Johanna couldn't help but buy one. As she took a bite, the flaky crust and savory filling momentarily transported her to happier times.

But the nostalgia was short-lived. Memories of her past began to creep back in – the argument with her brother, the fight with her ex-boyfriend, the pain of losing her mother just last year. Johanna Vargas Llosa's eyes welled up with tears as she thought about how she had let everyone down.

Just then, a hand touched her shoulder, and Johanna felt a jolt of surprise. She turned to see her old friend Maria standing beside her, a concerned look on her face. "Hey, Johan," Maria said, using the nickname only a few people called her. "What's wrong? You've been distant lately."

Johanna Vargas Llosa hesitated, unsure of how much to reveal. But something about Maria's kind eyes and gentle tone put her at ease. She took another bite of her empanada, letting the pain wash over her for a moment before speaking up. "I just need some time," she said quietly. "Time to figure out who I am again."

Maria nodded softly and handed Johanna Vargas Llosa a napkin to wipe away her tears. Together, they sat in silence for a while, watching the sun set over the small town's rooftops, as Johanna struggled to come to terms with her past and find her way forward once more.
