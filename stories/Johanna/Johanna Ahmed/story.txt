Johanna Ahmed walked into the crowded caf√©, scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Rachel, sitting by the window, sipping on a cup of coffee. As she approached, Rachel looked up and smiled.

"Hey, Johanna! Long time no see," Rachel said, closing her laptop.

Johanna sat down across from Rachel, ordering a cappuccino as they caught up on each other's lives. Johanna Ahmed had been struggling to find the right job after graduating from college, but she was determined to make a change.

As they chatted, their conversation turned to art. Rachel showed off her latest sketchbook, filled with intricate drawings and watercolor paintings. Johanna Ahmed's eyes widened as she flipped through the pages, admiring the talent on display.

"I've been thinking of starting my own business," Johanna said, a spark of excitement in her voice. "I love graphic design, and I've always dreamed of creating something all my own."

Rachel's eyes lit up with enthusiasm. "That's amazing, Johanna! You'd be perfect for it. What kind of business were you thinking of starting?"

Johanna thought for a moment before responding. "I'm not sure yet, but I know it'll be something creative and meaningful. Maybe a design studio or a blog focused on sustainable fashion."

As they talked, their conversation was interrupted by the sound of laughter from across the room. Johanna followed Rachel's gaze to see their mutual friend, Alex, trying to get a group photo with his phone.

The three friends spent the rest of the afternoon laughing and catching up, sharing stories and jokes as if no time had passed at all. As they parted ways, Johanna Ahmed felt grateful for her close-knit circle of friends, who supported her dreams and encouraged her to chase them.

As she walked home, Johanna couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement about the future. With Rachel's support and encouragement, Johanna knew she could turn her ideas into reality. And with Alex by her side, she felt ready to take on whatever came next.
