Johanna Nilsson stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the salty air of the Swedish coast filling her lungs. She had been away for months, working as an aid in refugee camps in the Middle East, but her family's summer house on this island was calling to her.

As she made her way up the winding path, Johanna felt a sense of nostalgia wash over her. She had spent countless summers here as a child, playing in the waves and exploring the nearby coves with her siblings. Her parents had bought this little slice of paradise when they were young, just like her.

Johanna's eyes scanned the familiar landscape, taking in the patchwork fields and wildflowers that seemed to bloom at every corner. She spotted her younger sister, Lena, playing alone on the beach, a worn wooden bucket and spade beside her.

"Lycka till!" Johanna called out, dropping her bag onto the grassy bank.

Lena skipped over, eyes shining with excitement. "Johanna's back! We've got a surprise for you!"

Johanna followed Lena down to the beach, where their parents were waiting with cool glasses of lemonade and a blanket spread beneath the willows. As they sat down to eat, Johanna noticed something odd - her mother was sitting quietly at one end of the table, looking troubled.

"What's wrong, Mamma?" Johanna asked, concern etched on her face.

Her mother sighed, collecting her thoughts before speaking. "I received a letter from your friend Sofia, who works with refugees in Syria. She mentioned that some families are being forced to leave their homes due to the conflict."

Johanna felt a knot form in her stomach. This was why she had left the first time - to try and make a difference, even if it was just in small ways.

"We'll send more money, help in any way we can," Johanna promised, feeling a surge of determination.

As they sat there on the beach, watching the sun set over the waves, Johanna knew that she had found her true purpose - to use her skills and experience to make a difference, no matter where the world needed it. This little summer house might be just a memory for some, but to Johanna Nilsson, it was the beginning of something bigger.

"I'm going back," she told Lena, her eyes locking onto hers. "I'm going to keep fighting, and I want you with me."
