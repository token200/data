Johanna Harris sat alone in her small apartment, staring out the window as the sun set behind the city skyline. She had just received an eviction notice, and with it, a harsh reminder that she was one step away from losing everything.

As she wandered around her cluttered space, Johanna's mind began to wander back to her childhood. Growing up in a low-income household, she had always felt like she was fighting for scraps. Her parents had done their best, but they had never been able to provide the stability and security that Johanna had craved.

Despite the struggles, Johanna had always managed to hold onto her dreams. She had studied hard, earning a degree in fine art, and had spent years working as a freelance graphic designer. But the pay had never been great, and she had found herself constantly juggling bills and expenses.

As she looked around at the makeshift furniture and faded paint on her walls, Johanna couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration wash over her. How had it come to this? She was a talented artist, with a vision and a voice that spoke to others. Why did she need to struggle just to make ends meet?

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was her best friend, Maria, who had stopped by to check on her. Johanna broke down in tears as Maria wrapped her in a warm hug.

"What's going on?" Maria asked, concern etched on her face.

Johanna sniffled and wiped away her tears. "I just got an eviction notice," she said, feeling a lump form in her throat. "I don't know what I'm going to do."

Maria nodded sympathetically. "We'll figure it out together, Johanna Harris," she promised. "You're not alone in this."

As they sat down on the couch and began brainstorming, Johanna felt a spark of hope ignite within her. Maybe this was just a bump in the road, rather than a dead end. With Maria by her side, she knew that she could face whatever came next.
