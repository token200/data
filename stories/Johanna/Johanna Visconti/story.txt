Johanna Visconti sat alone in the grand salon, her piercing green eyes scanning the room as if searching for an escape. She had always been the rebel, the one who defied convention and pushed boundaries. But now, with the weight of her family's legacy on her shoulders, she felt trapped.

As the daughter of Duke Visconti, Johanna was expected to marry well and secure alliances for the powerful House of Milan. Her parents had already begun negotiations with a wealthy nobleman from Florence, but Johanna had other plans.

She stood up, her long black dress rustling as she moved towards the window. The sunlight streaming through the panes cast a golden glow on her pale skin, highlighting the sharp angles of her features. She felt like a caged bird, yearning to fly free from the expectations that suffocated her.

Johanna's mind wandered back to her childhood days, spent exploring the castle and dreaming of adventure. Her parents had been so strict, forbidding her from even speaking with the servants, let alone venturing outside without a chaperone. But Johanna had always been drawn to the unknown, and she longed for excitement.

As she stood there, lost in thought, a faint knock at the door broke the silence. It was her loyal lady-in-waiting, Lucia. "Milady," Lucia said softly, curtsying before speaking up, "I've brought news from the stables."

Johanna raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite herself. Lucia handed her a small parchment, sealed with the Visconti crest. Johanna broke the seal and unfolded the paper, revealing a bold message scrawled in handwriting she recognized – it was that of her secret admirer.

Her heart skipped a beat as she read the words: "Meet me at the old oak tree in the forest tonight, under the light of the full moon." Johanna's pulse quickened with excitement; this could be her chance to break free from the constraints of her life.

For the first time in months, she felt like herself again – restless, reckless, and alive. She tucked the parchment into her cloak and turned back to Lucia, a mischievous grin spreading across her face.

"Tonight," Johanna said, her voice barely above a whisper, "I shall follow my heart."

And with that, she vanished into the shadows, leaving behind the stifling world of courtly duty and convention. For in the darkness, she knew she would find freedom – and perhaps, just perhaps, love.
