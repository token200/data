Johanna Piatek stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee and staring intently at his laptop screen.

As she made her way towards him, he looked up and caught her gaze. A warm smile spread across his face as he closed his laptop and stood up, brushing off his jeans. "Hey, Johanna," he said, extending his hand for her to take.

"Hey, Mateusz," she replied, shaking his hand firmly. They had known each other since their university days, bonding over late-night study sessions and impromptu dance parties. Despite going their separate ways after graduation, they had remained close friends.

Over a cup of coffee, Mateusz filled Johanna in on his latest projects – a freelance writing gig and a budding passion for photography. Johanna listened intently, her eyes lighting up with excitement as he spoke about his creative endeavors.

As they chatted, Johanna couldn't help but notice the way Mateusz's eyes sparkled when he talked about something he loved. She remembered that same enthusiasm she had seen in him during their university days, and it filled her heart with a sense of nostalgia.

Their conversation drifted from work to music, and before long, they were belting out their favorite tunes together. The café patrons around them couldn't help but smile at the infectious energy emanating from Johanna Piatek and Mateusz.

As the afternoon wore on, they decided to take a walk through the nearby park. The sun was shining, casting a warm glow over the lush green grass and vibrant flowers. Mateusz tossed a glance in Johanna's direction, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he smiled. "You know, I've missed having you around," he said.

Johanna smiled back, feeling a sense of gratitude towards her friend. "I've missed it too, Mateusz," she replied. As they strolled hand in hand through the park, Johanna knew that some friendships were worth holding onto – no matter what life threw their way.
