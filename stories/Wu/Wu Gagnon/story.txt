I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Wu Gagnon. It's possible that this character is not well-known or doesn't exist in popular culture.

However, I can create a story about a fictional character with the surname Gagnon. Here it is:

Wu Gagnon was a brilliant and eccentric scientist who had spent her entire career studying the mysteries of the universe. Born Wu Gagnon on a stormy night in April 1985, she had always been fascinated by the unknown. As a child, she would spend hours gazing up at the stars, dreaming of the secrets they held.

As an adult, Wu Gagnon's fascination with the universe only grew stronger. She became obsessed with unlocking its secrets, spending years studying the latest research and experimenting with new technologies. Her colleagues often referred to her as "Wu-san" - a nickname that reflected her unique blend of Eastern and Western influences.

One day, while working late in her laboratory, Wu Gagnon stumbled upon an unusual phenomenon. She had been testing a new device that used advanced quantum physics to manipulate energy patterns. As she activated the machine, she felt a sudden surge of electricity run through her body. The results were astonishing - a massive burst of energy appeared on her oscilloscope screen, revealing a previously unknown pattern in the universe.

Overjoyed by her discovery, Wu Gagnon spent the next several weeks studying the data. She soon realized that this phenomenon was not just limited to her laboratory - it was happening all over the world. Her findings were met with skepticism at first, but as more and more evidence came to light, the scientific community began to take notice.

Wu Gagnon's discovery sent shockwaves through the scientific world, earning her international recognition and acclaim. As she accepted awards and accolades from around the globe, Wu Gagnon smiled humbly, knowing that this was just the beginning of a new era in human understanding. And though she had made a name for herself as one of the most brilliant scientists of her generation, Wu Gagnon knew that there was still so much more to discover - and she was eager to get started.
