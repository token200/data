Wu Mercier was a master thief known only by his alias. With a reputation for being untouchable, he had evaded capture for years, leaving behind a trail of clues and puzzles that had stumped even the most seasoned detectives.

Born Wu Mengqi, Mercier's early life was marked by hardship and poverty. Orphaned at a young age, he was forced to fend for himself on the streets, where he quickly learned to rely on his wits and cunning to survive. As he grew older, Mercier's natural aptitude for thievery became apparent, and he began to build a reputation as a skilled pickpocket.

However, it wasn't until he met his partner in crime, a charismatic con artist named Leon, that Mercier's true potential was unleashed. Together, they formed an unstoppable duo, taking on the most high-stakes heists and emerging with enormous rewards.

Mercier's skills were unmatched, and his ability to blend into crowds made him all but invisible. He could slip in and out of shadows unnoticed, always seeming to be one step ahead of his pursuers. His full name, Wu Mengqi, was rarely spoken outside of the underworld, where he was known only as Wu Mercier – a name that struck fear into the hearts of those who knew him.

Despite his notorious reputation, Mercier was not without his vulnerabilities. He had a weakness for rare and exotic teas, which often led him astray on high-stakes jobs. His love of tea was so great that he would risk everything to get his hands on a single batch of the finest jasmine green.

One day, Mercier and Leon set their sights on the infamous Golden Chrysanthemum Museum in Tokyo, where they planned to steal a priceless artifact. But as they executed their plan, Mercier's love of tea proved to be their downfall. Distracted by the scent of the museum's rare collection, he failed to notice his partner slipping away, leaving him to face the authorities alone.

Mercier's capture was swift and decisive, but even in prison, his legend lived on. Wu Mengqi, the master thief, had finally been brought down – or so it seemed. For despite his capture, Mercier knew that his true identity remained safe, hidden behind a mask of anonymity and a reputation that would haunt him forever.
