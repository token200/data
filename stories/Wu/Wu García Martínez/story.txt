Wu García Martínez's passion for art was ignited at a young age, watching his abuela, María, paint intricate patterns on the walls of their family's small shop. He spent hours observing her techniques, learning the secrets of traditional Spanish folk art, and experimenting with new styles.

Over the next year, Wu's murals appeared across the city, inspiring conversations about climate change, immigration, and identity.

Throughout it all, Wu García Martínez remained humble and true to his artistic vision.
