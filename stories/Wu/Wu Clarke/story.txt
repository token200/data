Wu Clarke trudged through the rain-soaked streets, his eyes fixed on the pavement ahead. He had just received word that his old mate, Gethin, was in trouble again. This time, it seemed, he'd gotten mixed up with some dodgy characters.

As Wu walked, memories flooded back - of laughter-filled nights spent drinking down at the pub, and late-night conversations about everything from footy to philosophy. Gethin had always been the wild one, never afraid to speak his mind or take a risk. But sometimes that recklessness could be deadly.

Wu reached out into the rain, hailing a taxi, and jumped in before anyone else could get their hand on the door. 'Fynny Road,' he told the driver, who shot him a look in the rearview mirror before nodding and putting the cab in gear.

When they arrived at Fynny Road, Wu spotted Gethin standing under an awning, shivering like a wet rat. He burst out of the taxi, splashing water everywhere, and flung himself at his friend's chest.

'Wu!' Gethin exclaimed, embracing him tightly. 'I'm so glad you're here! I've gotten myself mixed up in some bloody mess.'

Wu pulled back, surveying their surroundings. The buildings around Fynny Road seemed to loom over them like giants, casting long shadows across the wet pavement.

'What's going on?' Wu asked, eyes narrowing as he tried to piece together the situation.

Gethin hesitated before spilling it all out - about some dodgy business associates who wanted a share of his 'unique' skills, and how Wu was going to have to bail him out.

Wu listened intently, anger growing inside him. He'd always known Gethin had a bit of a wild streak, but this was getting out of hand.

As they stood under the awning, watching as passersby scurried away into the rain, Wu made up his mind. 'Alright,' he said, voice cold and steady. 'We're leaving Fynny Road behind, mate.'

Gethin's eyes went wide with alarm. 'What about me business?'

Wu gave him a hard look. 'You'll figure it out, Gethin. But you need help getting out of this one. I'm not leaving you to your own devices any more.'

With that settled, Wu and Gethin set off into the rain-soaked night, side by side, ready to face whatever came their way next.
