Wu Fernandez was a mysterious figure, known only by her enigmatic smile and piercing green eyes. Born as Wu Hua-Fen, she had grown up on the streets of Shanghai, surviving by her wits and cunning. As she grew older, her skills as a thief and con artist became renowned among the city's underworld.

One day, while casing a high-stakes poker game at the exclusive Golden Dragon Club, Wu Fernandez caught the eye of the club's enigmatic owner, Mr. Li. He was immediately drawn to her unique blend of charm and danger, and soon offered her a deal: work for him, and she would have access to any mark or score she desired.

Wu Hua-Fen accepted, and quickly proved herself to be a valuable asset to the club's operation. Her reputation as a master thief spread far and wide, and people began to whisper about the mysterious woman with the green eyes and the smile that could charm the devil himself.

As Wu Fernandez's fame grew, so did her ego. She became more reckless, taking on bigger and riskier scores. But Mr. Li was always there to temper her ambition, reminding her of her roots and the thin line between success and disaster.

Despite this, Wu Hua-Fen continued to push the limits, always staying one step ahead of her enemies and claiming victories that would make even the most seasoned thief jealous. Her legend grew, and she became known as one of the greatest thieves in all of Shanghai.

But there was a cost to Wu Fernandez's success. She had lost touch with her past, and her relationships were few and far between. The only people who knew her true name were Mr. Li and a handful of others who had earned her trust.

As she stood at the edge of the Golden Dragon Club's rooftop, gazing out over the city, Wu Hua-Fen knew that she would never be content with just being a thief. She was Wu Fernandez, a master of shadows and deception, always ready to take on the next challenge that came her way.
