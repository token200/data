Wu Salamanca stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway, his eyes scanning the crowded streets of Los Angeles. His sharp gaze took in every detail, from the faded graffiti on the buildings to the pedestrians hurrying to and fro.

As a silent partner to the infamous Mexican cartel, Wu was known for his ruthless efficiency and calculated demeanor. Few people saw him outside of business meetings or high-stakes negotiations. Those who did rarely remembered it, except for one haunting phrase: "The Great White Fang".

Wu's past was shrouded in mystery, but whispers circulated among the cartel's ranks about a former CIA operative turned hitman. His nickname, given by a rival organization after a particularly brutal takedown, stuck like a badge of honor.

Tonight, Wu had received intel that suggested one of his top lieutenants had been compromised by an internal mole. The threat hung heavy in the air as he approached the heavily fortified safehouse on Sunset Boulevard.

As he burst through the doors, flanked by his loyal bodyguards, Wu's gaze locked onto his second-in-command, Javier. The younger man seemed nervous, fidgeting with a gold ring bearing the cartel's insignia.

Wu's voice cut through the tension like ice, devoid of inflection. "Who betrayed me?"

Javier shook his head, sweat beading on his forehead. "I don't know, Wu."

The room fell silent, the weight of Wu's gaze crushing any hope for escape. A slow smile spread across his face, revealing sharp teeth.

"You will tell," he said finally. The sound of shattering glass and splintering wood accompanied the crackle of a lit match as Javier's ring burst into flames. Wu watched, unblinking, as the symbol of loyalty was reduced to ashes.

As the inferno died down, Wu turned to his bodyguards. "Take him away."

The pair sprang into action, dragging Javier out of the safehouse and into the night. Wu remained standing, surveying the destruction he had wrought with an air of detachment.

For a moment, a glimmer of human emotion flickered across his face - anger, perhaps, or sorrow â€“ but it vanished as swiftly as it appeared, leaving behind only an unyielding sense of duty to protect his empire at all costs.

Wu Salamanca disappeared into the night, leaving behind a trail of broken men and shattered reputations. In the shadows, whispers spread like wildfire: "The Great White Fang had struck again."
