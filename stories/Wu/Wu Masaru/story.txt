Wu Masaru was a man of few words, but his actions spoke volumes. As a young boy, he had been trained in the ancient art of Kung Fu by his mentor, Master Li. Growing up on the streets of Shanghai, Wu had quickly proven himself to be one of the most skilled and formidable fighters among his peers.

As he grew older, Wu Masaru began to make a name for himself as a master thief and assassin. His reputation preceded him, striking fear into the hearts of those who dared to cross him. Despite this, he remained fiercely loyal to his friends and family, using his extraordinary abilities only to protect those he cared about.

One day, Wu Masaru received an offer from a wealthy businessman to steal a valuable artifact from a highly secured museum. The catch: the artifact was said to be cursed, causing anyone who touched it to fall into a deep coma. Wu Masaru was intrigued by the challenge and accepted the job.

Under the cover of night, Wu Masaru snuck into the museum, avoiding guards and security cameras with ease. He navigated through the darkened halls, his eyes scanning for any sign of the artifact. Finally, he found it: a small, golden box adorned with intricate carvings. As soon as he touched it, Wu Masaru felt a strange sensation wash over him, but he pushed on, determined to complete his mission.

With the artifact in hand, Wu Masaru made his way back out of the museum, disappearing into the night. He returned to his hideout, where he carefully examined the box. As he did, he began to feel a creeping sense of unease. Suddenly, he felt himself becoming dizzy and disoriented. The last thing Wu Masaru remembered was falling into a deep sleep.

The next morning, Master Li found Wu Masaru lying unconscious in their training hall. He had been searching for his young apprentice everywhere, worried that something had gone terribly wrong. As Wu Masaru slowly regained consciousness, he realized that the artifact had indeed cursed him, leaving him vulnerable to those who sought to exploit his skills.
