Wu Nagy stepped out of his small apartment and into the bustling streets of Taipei. As the lead singer of the popular Taiwanese rock band "Riot's Revenge," he was no stranger to crowds and chaos. But tonight, Wu Nagy had other plans.

He made his way to the local park, where a group of street artists were setting up their easels and paints. Wu Nagy watched as they began to capture the cityscape on canvas, their brushes dancing across the palette. He felt a pang of nostalgia wash over him, remembering the countless nights he had spent painting alongside his friends in similar moments.

As he wandered through the crowd, Wu Nagy noticed a young girl with a sketchbook clutched tightly in her hand. She couldn't have been more than ten years old, but there was something about her determination that resonated with Wu Nagy. He approached her quietly and asked if she needed any guidance or inspiration.

The girl looked up at him nervously before speaking in halting English. "I want to be like you," she said, her eyes fixed on Wu Nagy's hands as he held his guitar pick. Wu Nagy smiled kindly and began to strum a few chords on an imaginary instrument.

As the night wore on, Wu Nagy watched the girl's skills improve dramatically under his guidance. He realized that she reminded him of himself when he was younger - full of fire and passion, but also uncertain about her place in the world.

Eventually, Wu Nagy bid the group farewell and headed back to his apartment. As he settled into bed that night, he couldn't help but think about his own journey as an artist and musician. He remembered the countless hours spent honing his craft, the sacrifices made along the way, and the moments of triumph that had defined him.

As Wu Nagy drifted off to sleep, his mind wandered back to the young girl in the park. He hoped that she would one day find her own path to stardom, and that he could be a part of guiding her there.
