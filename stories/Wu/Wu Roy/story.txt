Wu Roy's eyes scanned the crowded market stalls, her fingers instinctively tightening around the worn wooden staff that had been her constant companion since childhood. Her full name, Wu Xinyue, was often lost on strangers, who would instead address her as "Wu Roy" or simply "the warrior."

As a member of the Moonlit Clan, a group of nomadic warriors known for their skill with the bow and their unwavering loyalty to one another, Wu Roy had grown up with the art of combat etched into her very being. Her full name, however, was reserved for those closest to her - her mother, her grandmother, and the elder members of the clan.

Today, Wu Roy was on a mission to gather rare herbs for the clan's healer. The village elders had spoken of a special plant that grew only under the light of the full moon, and she aimed to find it before nightfall. As she navigated the stalls, Wu Roy's trained eyes picked out the telltale signs of the elusive herb - its pale blue hue, its delicate fragrance.

She stopped at a small stall tucked away in a corner, where an old man with wispy hair and kind eyes offered her a nod of recognition. "Wu Roy," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "I see you're searching for the Moonbloom. Rare indeed."

Wu Roy smiled, a hint of mischief dancing in her eyes. The old man chuckled, producing a small pouch of dried herbs from behind the counter. "For the healer's hand, I reckon?"

Wu Roy took the pouch, her fingers brushing against the soft leaves within. She paid the old man with a few copper coins and continued on her way, the staff feeling solid in her grasp once more.

As night began to fall, Wu Roy returned to the clan's encampment, her pockets heavy with the precious herbs. Her full name echoed through the tents as the others welcomed her back - "Wu Xinyue" they said, their voices filled with a sense of pride and admiration. For in this world, it was Wu Roy who had proven herself worthy of the Moonlit Clan's trust.
