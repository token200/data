Wu Mel's rise to fame began in the early days of e-commerce, when she launched a small online marketplace that quickly gained traction among Shanghai's affluent community.

With a fierce determination burning within her, Wu Mel pressed on, driven by an insatiable hunger for success and a passion that would take her business to new heights.
