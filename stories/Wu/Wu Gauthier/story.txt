I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named "Wu Gauthier." It's possible that this is a new or unknown character, or it may be a typo or misremembering of a different name.

However, I can suggest some alternatives. Would you like me to:

1. Create a new character based on the name Wu Gauthier?
2. Write a story about a historical figure named Wu (e.g., Wu Zetian, Wu Xing, etc.) or a character from literature/film who has a similar name?

Let me know if either of these options appeal to you, and I'll be happy to assist!
