Here's a 400-word story about a fictional character:

---

The sun had barely risen over the bustling streets of Berlin when Werner "Wu" Durchdenwald made his way to the local bakery. As a young apprentice baker, Wu took great pride in his work, carefully crafting each pastry and bread loaf with precision and care.

As he worked, Wu's mind wandered back to his childhood. Growing up in a family of bakers, Wu had always been fascinated by the art of baking. He spent hours watching his parents and grandparents expertly mix, knead, and shape dough into all manner of delicious treats.

Wu's specialty was the traditional Berliner Pfannkuchen – a flaky pastry filled with sweet jam or chocolate. He took great pride in his creations, carefully balancing flavors and textures to create a truly unique experience for each customer.

As the morning rush subsided, Wu's boss, Herr Müller, approached him with a hint of excitement in his voice. "Wu, I have a special request from the mayor himself. Tonight, we'll be serving the Berliner Pfannkuchen at a grand banquet in honor of our city's heritage."

Wu's eyes widened as he accepted the challenge. He spent the rest of the day perfecting his recipes and practicing his techniques. When the night of the banquet arrived, Wu took his place alongside Herr Müller at the table.

As the guests sampled Wu's creations, their faces lit up with delight. The pfannkuchen were a hit, and Wu knew that this was just the beginning of an illustrious career in the world of baking.

With a warm smile, Wu took a bow as the mayor approached him, patting his back in congratulations. "You've done it, young Durchdenwald," the mayor said. "You're a true master of the craft."
