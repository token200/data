Jérôme Salamanca, known to few outside his inner circle as "Tio Salamanca" or simply "Salamanca", was a man whose reputation preceded him. His sharp jawline and piercing gaze commanded respect, even in the most intimidating settings.

As a young boy growing up in the sprawling metropolis of Albuquerque, Jérôme had always been drawn to the shadows. He watched with fascination as his uncles built their vast business empire from humble beginnings. As he grew older, Jérémon began to make a name for himself through strategic alliances and ruthless tactics.

Over the years, Salamanca earned a reputation as a businessman who got things done – no matter the cost. His companies diversified across various sectors: construction, energy, mining, and even pharmaceuticals. He held an iron grip on each of his interests, crushing competition with a swift strike or a well-placed bribe.

Jérémon's rise to power had not been without its losses. Several close family members had met their demise at his hands – the rivalries often fueled by greed or simply because he saw them as threats to his dominance. The most recent casualty, a nephew who sought to usurp Salamanca's control, was buried in the desert with no markers.

One day, the Albuquerque police department received a mysterious package containing Jérémon's own signature silver pendant. They immediately knew that whatever message it carried, it would not be trivial.

Inside the pendant lay an uncut diamond worth millions. The note accompanying it, scribbled in Salamanca's distinctive handwriting, read: "You know nothing."

Police quickly realized this was no ordinary ransom request but rather a warning to stay clear of Salamánca and his affairs. He was sending them a message that their actions would be met with brutal efficiency.

Salamanca remained at large, watching from the shadows as Albuquerque struggled to rebuild its economy in the wake of the mysterious diamond. This enigmatic figure knew exactly how to get under people's skin – it wasn't a game he ever seemed to lose.
