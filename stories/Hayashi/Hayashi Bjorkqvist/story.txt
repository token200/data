Hayashi Björkqvist was a Swedish-Swedish Sami artist known for her vibrant and eclectic style. Born in Luleå, Sweden to parents from the Sami indigenous community, Hayashi grew up surrounded by the rich cultural heritage of her people. As a child, she spent hours listening to tales of her ancestors' lives, traditions, and legends.

Hayashi's fascination with art led her to study fine arts at the University of Umeå, where she honed her skills in painting, sculpture, and installation art. Her work often incorporated elements of nature, mythology, and personal experiences, reflecting her Sami heritage and connection to the land.

After completing her studies, Hayashi traveled extensively throughout Europe, visiting remote villages and meeting people from different cultures. She became particularly interested in the concept of " hygge" – a Danish term that roughly translates to coziness, warmth, and contentment. Inspired by this idea, she began incorporating it into her art practice.

Hayashi's latest project, "Northern Lights," is a multimedia installation featuring large-scale projections of aurora borealis displays on wooden panels. The work pays homage to the breathtaking natural light shows that are an integral part of Sami culture and tradition.

During the exhibition opening, Hayashi Björkqvist was overwhelmed by the response from visitors. Many were drawn to her work's ability to evoke a sense of wonder, calmness, and connection to nature. As she mingled with attendees, she spoke about her inspirations, artistic process, and the significance of preserving Sami culture in modern times.

A prominent art critic approached Hayashi, asking if she had considered exhibiting her work internationally. Hayashi nodded thoughtfully, mentioning that she had indeed received interest from galleries worldwide. However, for her, home was where the heart was – and for her, that meant embracing her roots as a Swedish-Swedish Sami artist.

As the evening drew to a close, Hayashi Björkqvist reflected on the significance of her work in preserving Sami identity and culture. Her art would continue to inspire and educate others about the beauty and richness of her people's traditions, and she felt grateful for the opportunity to share it with the world.
