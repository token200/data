A talented artist, Hayashi had grown up surrounded by the vibrant colors and textures of her Puerto Rican heritage. Her parents, both accomplished musicians, had encouraged her creative pursuits from a young age, and Hayashi's talent soon became evident.

As she grew older, Hayashi's art took on a life of its own. She experimented with various mediums, from oil painting to sculpture, but it was her use of mixed media that truly set her apart.
