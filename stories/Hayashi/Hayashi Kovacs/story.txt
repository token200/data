Hayashi Kovacs stepped out of the rain-soaked streets and into the dimly lit bar, shaking the droplets from his jacket. A former Envoy of the Central Bureau of Investigation, Kovacs had seen his fair share of dark alleys and corrupt officials. But nothing could have prepared him for the mysterious message that led him here.

As he ordered a whiskey, his eyes scanned the room, taking in the patrons. There was something unsettling about this place - the air was thick with tension, like a held breath waiting to be released. Kovacs' instincts told him to leave, but his curiosity kept him rooted to the stool.

The door swung open and a young woman stepped inside, her eyes scanning the room until they landed on Kovacs. She slid onto the stool beside him, her presence radiating an otherworldly energy. "You're Hayashi Kovacs," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Kovacs nodded, his mind racing with questions. "Who are you?"

"I'm someone who knows what you're looking for," she replied, producing a small data pad from her pocket. The screen flickered to life, displaying a cryptic message: "Project Erebus: Phase 3 Initiated".

Kovacs' eyes widened as he took in the information. Project Erebus was a top-secret program run by the Central Bureau of Investigation, rumored to be connected to some of the most heinous crimes on the planet. If this message was indeed from an inside source... Kovacs knew his life would never be the same.

The woman handed him the data pad, her hand brushing against his as she did so. A spark of electricity ran through his veins, and for a moment, he felt like he was staring into the eyes of his own destiny. "What's my next move?" he asked, his voice low and steady.

The woman smiled, a hint of mischief dancing in her eyes. "That's up to you, Hayashi Kovacs." With that, she turned and vanished into the night, leaving Kovacs with more questions than answers - but one thing was certain: this was just the beginning of his next adventure.
