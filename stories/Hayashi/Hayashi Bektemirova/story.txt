Hayashi Bektemirova sat alone in her small, cluttered office, staring blankly at the stack of files in front of her. As the lead investigator for the Tokyo Police Department's Missing Persons Unit, she had seen it all - the hopeful pleas, the frantic parents, the endless questions. But none of them seemed to have a lead that could crack the case.

Bektemirova sighed and rubbed her tired eyes. She had been working on the case for months, pouring over every shred of evidence, interviewing every witness. And yet, she still had nothing concrete. It was as if the victim had vanished into thin air.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. "Ah, Hayashi Bektemirova?" it was one of her colleagues, calling out to announce the arrival of their boss, Chief Watanabe.

Bektemirova groaned inwardly - she knew what this meant. The chief was not pleased with the lack of progress on the case, and he would be coming in to "offer his guidance". She reluctantly made her way to the chief's office, trying to prepare herself for a lecture.

But when she arrived, she found something unexpected: Chief Watanabe sitting at his desk, sipping tea and looking more relaxed than she had ever seen him. "Hayashi Bektemirova," he said warmly, "I see you're still working hard on the case."

Bektemirova bristled slightly - who was this version of her boss, exactly? But before she could protest, Watanabe continued, "I've been going over the evidence myself, and I think I might have found something. A small detail that I missed at first, but it's enough to give us a lead."

Bektemirova's heart skipped a beat as she leaned forward, her eyes locked on the chief's face. This was it - this was finally something they had been waiting for. "Tell me more," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Watanabe smiled and began to explain, his words spilling out in a rapid-fire stream. Bektemirova listened intently, her mind racing with possibilities. Finally, he finished and leaned back in his chair, looking at her expectantly.

Bektemirova felt a surge of gratitude towards this unexpected version of her boss - whoever he was. "Thank you," she said sincerely, trying to put into words the sense of hope that had washed over her.
