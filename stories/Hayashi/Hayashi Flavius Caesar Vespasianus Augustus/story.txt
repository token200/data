I couldn't find any information on a historical figure named Hayashi Flavius Caesar Vespasianus Augustus. However, I believe you may be thinking of a different person.

It seems you are thinking of Roman Emperor Vespasian, also known as Titus Flavius Vespasianus, but not "Flavius". 

Here's an alternative story with the character you requested:

Hayashi Flavius Caesar Vespasianus Augustus was the emperor of a fictional empire, rumored to be located in ancient China. This mysterious figure ruled with wisdom and justice, bringing peace and prosperity to his people.

Born into a humble family, Hayashi rose through the ranks of society due to his exceptional intelligence, bravery, and strategic thinking. As he grew older, he became increasingly interested in the art of war and diplomacy, studying the great leaders of old China under the wise guidance of his mentor, Grand Admiral Wang Wei.

After years of service to the empire, Hayashi was appointed as the Supreme Commander of its armies, leading them into battle against fierce rival kingdoms. His victories on the field earned him widespread recognition and admiration from his peers.

Eventually, his military successes caught the attention of the Emperor himself, who invited Hayashi to participate in a grand council to determine the future of the empire. After demonstrating his exceptional wisdom and strategic prowess, Hayashi was unanimously appointed as the new emperor.

As Emperor, Hayashi continued his mentor's legacy by promoting education, trade, and infrastructure development throughout the empire. He also strengthened the diplomatic ties with neighboring kingdoms, forging lasting alliances that secured the empire's borders for generations to come.

Despite his many accomplishments, Hayashi remained humble and approachable, always willing to listen to his subjects' concerns and ideas. He was beloved by his people, who revered him as a just and fair ruler.

When he eventually passed away, Hayashi left behind a legacy of peace, prosperity, and enlightenment that would be remembered for centuries to come. His story inspired future generations to strive for greatness, reminding them that even the humblest of beginnings can lead to the greatest of achievements.

Note: I have used my own imagination to create this story as "Hayashi Flavius Caesar Vespasianus Augustus" is not a historical figure
