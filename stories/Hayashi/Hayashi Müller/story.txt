Hayashi Müller stood at the edge of the bustling streets, his eyes scanning the crowds with an air of detachment. A former detective turned private investigator, he had seen it all – the darkest corners of human nature, the most heinous crimes, and the desperate lives that hung in the balance.

As a child, Müller's life had been forever altered by the disappearance of his younger sister, Maya. The case remained unsolved, leaving behind only whispers and theories that refused to die. His obsession with finding answers drove him to leave the police force, seeking new leads and new clues in the city's hidden corners.

Now, at 45, Müller's services were sought after by those who dared not approach the authorities. He worked out of a cramped office above a noodle shop, where he poured over old case files and watched the rain-soaked streets below.

The phone rang, shrill in the silence. Müller picked up, his voice low and measured as he listened to the words on the other end. "I need you to find her," the woman said, her voice trembling. "My sister's been missing for three days."

Müller nodded, even though she couldn't see him. He scribbled a few notes on a piece of paper, his mind already racing with possibilities. Three days was a long time – too long to assume someone had simply vanished.

He agreed to meet the woman at her sister's apartment complex an hour later. As he walked through the streets, Müller felt a sense of unease growing inside him. This could be another dead end, just like all the others. But something about this case resonated with him – a faint echo of his own lost sister.

The complex was dimly lit, its corridors winding like a maze. Müller's eyes scanned every face he met, searching for signs of distress or deception. He found them in a girl who wouldn't meet his eye and an old man who seemed too eager to help.

The door to the apartment was unlocked, as if waiting for him. Inside, he found evidence of a hasty departure: scattered clothes, abandoned belongings, and a piece of paper with a single sentence scrawled on it – "I'll be home soon."

Müller's eyes narrowed as he read the words over again, searching for any hidden meaning or clue. He knew that sometimes, the truth was not what it seemed – and in this case, nothing would come easily.
