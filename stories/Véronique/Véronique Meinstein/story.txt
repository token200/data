Born in Paris, France, Véronique grew up surrounded by art and culture. Her parents, both art historians, encouraged her creative pursuits from an early age. As she honed her skills, Véronique's artwork began to attract attention from galleries and collectors.

One day, Véronique received an invitation to exhibit her work in a prestigious gallery in Tokyo, Japan. Overjoyed, she packed her bags and set off on the long journey to Asia. In Tokyo, she immersed herself in the vibrant culture and stunning landscapes of Japan.
