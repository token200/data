Véronique Zariņa was a young and ambitious photographer known for her captivating portraits. She had grown up in a small town in Latvia, where she developed an early passion for photography. After completing her studies, Véronique moved to Riga to pursue a career in photography.

Her big break came when she landed a feature in a prominent Latvian magazine. The article highlighted her unique perspective and style, which blended traditional techniques with modern digital manipulation. As her reputation grew, so did the demand for her work.
