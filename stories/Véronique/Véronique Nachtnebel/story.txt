In the sleepy town of Ashwood, where the misty dawn kissed the crumbling stones of its ancient streets, Véronique Nachtnebel stirred like a wraith from the shadows. Her eyes gleamed like opals in the moonlit windowpane as she rose from her velvet-draped bed, a midnight black dress billowing behind her like a dark cloud.

Véronique was a woman of secrets and whispers. Some said she had once been a courtesan to the royal court, while others claimed she was a sorceress who danced with the spirits under the moon. But Véronique knew no one's truth but her own. She wove a web of intrigue and deception, each thread carefully crafted to ensnare those around her.

Tonight was different. Tonight, she felt the weight of her years bearing down upon her like the crushing stones that lined the streets outside her crumbling mansion. Véronique moved with an unnerving precision, as if every step, every gesture, held a hidden purpose. Her hands, delicate and pale as alabaster, grasped a small vial filled with the essence of nightshade.

She climbed to the attic, where her collection of forbidden books lay scattered like autumn leaves. As she opened the cover of the worn leather volume, an invisible breeze rustled the pages, revealing the words 'Tempo della Notte' – Time of Night. Véronique's eyes shone brighter with each passing moment as she read from the ancient text.

With a slow smile spreading across her face, she poured a measure of the potion into a waiting chalice. The liquid seemed to shimmer and move like life itself. As Véronique raised the cup to her lips, the room around her began to spin with an otherworldly rhythm, as if the very night itself was alive and dancing in anticipation.

In that instant, Véronique Nachtnebel became the embodiment of Ashwood's darkest magic – a fusion of beauty and darkness, light and shadow. When she finally set the cup down, the chalice seemed to hold her very essence, leaving behind an impression of cold moonlight on its rim.
