As a young woman, Véronique spent most of her days wandering through ancient marketplaces, listening to tales of forgotten spirits and mythological creatures.

Intrigued by its secrets, Véronique devoted herself to unraveling the mysteries hidden within the tome's pages. As she delved deeper into the ancient texts, she found herself imbued with a newfound sense of purpose and destiny.

Years went by, and Véronique's travels took her to distant lands, where she encountered a diverse array of individuals who possessed secrets and knowledge beyond the realm of ordinary mortals. She befriended wisemen, mystics, and even a few rogue sorcerers, each with their own tale to tell.

One day, while exploring an abandoned temple in the heart of China, Véronique stumbled upon a hidden chamber filled with ancient artifacts and mysterious scrolls. Among them was a worn-out wooden box adorned with intricate carvings that seemed to echo her own name – Véronique Tzu-chi.

As she opened the box, a puff of misty air wafted out, carrying with it whispers of an ancient civilization long forgotten. The voice within the box spoke of a hidden realm where time and space were but mere illusions. It beckoned Véronique to join her on a journey through the very fabric of reality.

Entranced by the call, Véronique set forth on an odyssey that would take her across dimensions, confronting unseen dangers and unraveling mysteries of the cosmos. With each step forward, she shed the constraints of mortal life, embracing the boundless potential hidden within herself.
