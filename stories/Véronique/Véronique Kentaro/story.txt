"Bonjour," Véronique said with a warm smile. "Would you like to meet my art?"

The girl nodded eagerly, her ponytail bouncing with excitement. As they chatted, Véronique learned that the girl's name was Léa, and she had recently moved to the city from a small town in the countryside.

Inspired by their conversation, Véronique pulled out her sketchbook and began to draw alongside Léa. Together, they created an impromptu collaboration of art, blending Véronique Kentaro's signature style with Léa's naive yet vibrant drawings. As the sun dipped below the horizon, the alleyway came alive with color, music, and laughter.

As word of their spontaneous exhibition spread, passersby began to gather around, drawn in by the infectious energy emanating from Véronique Kentaro and her new friend Léa.
