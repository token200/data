Ishaan Palmas stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of old tracks and saltwater air washing over him like a warm hug. He had been away for what felt like an eternity, and yet, it was only a few weeks since he'd left his hometown of Tidal Cove.

As he made his way through the station, Ishaan's eyes scanned the crowds of people rushing to catch their own trains. The sound of laughter and hushed conversations filled the air, mingling with the cries of seagulls wheeling overhead. He smiled, feeling a sense of comfort in this place where time seemed to stand still.

Ishaan had left Tidal Cove for one reason: to escape. After the loss of his father, he'd struggled to find meaning in his life as a fisherman's son. The sea that had once brought him so much joy now felt like a constant reminder of what was lost. But here, back in his hometown, Ishaan knew he would be welcomed with open arms.

He made his way through the crowded station, nodding to familiar faces along the way. His friend and confidant, Rohan, stood waiting for him by the exit. "Hey, man! Long time no see," Rohan exclaimed, clapping Ishaan on the back.

Ishaan smiled, feeling a little more at ease with each passing moment. The two of them walked side by side through the winding streets of Tidal Cove, catching up on old times and sharing stories of their adventures.

As they strolled along the beach, the sound of the waves grew louder, washing away Ishaan's doubts and worries. He thought about his father, and the countless hours he'd spent out at sea with him. Though it still felt like a void in his chest, the memory of those days brought a sense of peace.

The sun was beginning to set over the ocean when Rohan stopped suddenly, pointing out at the water. "Hey, man! Look!" Ishaan followed his gaze and saw a pod of dolphins playing in the waves, their sleek bodies glinting in the fading light. In that moment, Ishaan knew he'd come home for more than just a visit. He was here to heal, to find himself, and to rediscover the joy of life.

Ishaan Palmas smiled, feeling the sea air fill his lungs once again. He knew that no matter what lay ahead, this place – and the people in it – would always be there to catch him when he fell.
