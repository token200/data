Ishaan Bauer stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar sounds of the station enveloping him like an old friend. As he waited for his connection to arrive, he pulled out his phone and checked the time. Just a few minutes to kill before he had to meet up with his sister.

"Ishaan Bauer," a voice called out from behind him.

He turned to see his sister, Rohini, flashing a bright smile as she made her way towards him. "Hey, Ishaan! How's it going?"

"Not bad," he replied, dropping his bag onto the floor. "Just waiting for my connection."

Rohini nodded sympathetically. "Yeah, I know how that feels. You'll be back home before you know it."

Ishaan chuckled. It was always like this with Rohini - she had a way of making him feel at ease, even on his most stressful days.

As they waited for the train, Ishaan filled her in on the details of his trip - a business conference in Mumbai, followed by some downtime to explore the city before heading back home. Rohini listened intently, asking questions and making notes as he spoke.

"Ishaan Bauer, you have to try the food here," she said, eyes sparkling with excitement. "You're missing out if you don't."

Ishaan laughed. He had already tried some of the local cuisine during his last trip to India - spicy curries, fragrant biryani, and crispy samosas that still lingered on his taste buds.

As they boarded the train, Ishaan took a seat next to Rohini, feeling grateful for this little slice of comfort before he dove headfirst into the chaos of his conference schedule. With her by his side, he felt ready to take on anything - even if it was just a busy few days in India.

The train rumbled forward, carrying Ishaan Bauer towards his destination with Rohini's reassuring presence riding shotgun beside him.
