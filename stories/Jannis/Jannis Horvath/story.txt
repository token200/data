Jannis Horvath stood alone in the dimly lit alleyway, his eyes fixed on the figure before him. The city's streets were always bustling with life, but here, in this deserted corner, time seemed to stand still.

He had been searching for what felt like an eternity, following every lead, every hint, every whisper of information that might bring him closer to his goal. And finally, after months of tireless work, he had received a tip that led him to this very spot.

As he watched, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was a young woman, her eyes darting nervously around the alleyway as if she feared being seen by unseen eyes. Jannis Horvath's instincts told him that she was in danger, and he knew he had to act quickly.

Without hesitation, he stepped forward, his voice low and commanding. "What do you want?" he demanded, his hand resting on the grip of his gun.

The woman flinched, her eyes locking onto Jannis Horvath's face for the first time. For a moment, they simply stared at each other, sizing each other up. Then, slowly, she nodded.

"I'm here to deliver a message," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "From someone who wants you to know that you're getting close."

Jannis Horvath's eyes narrowed. "Who is it?" he growled, his patience wearing thin.

The woman hesitated, then took a deep breath before speaking the words: "It's from...my boss. Someone I work for. He wants you to know that we've been watching you, Jannis Horvath."

Jannis Horvath felt a surge of adrenaline course through his veins. This was it, the break he had been waiting for. He nodded curtly at the woman, then turned and disappeared into the night, leaving her to make her way back to...wherever she came from.

As he vanished into the shadows, Jannis Horvath couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. He had finally received the confirmation he needed, and now, nothing could stop him from achieving his ultimate goal. The game was on, and he was ready to play.
