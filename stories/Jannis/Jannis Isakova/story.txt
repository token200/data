Jannis Isakova, a former Russian intelligence officer turned rogue, sat at his small café table, sipping on a cup of black coffee. His piercing blue eyes scanned the room, taking in the bustling atmosphere of the crowded café. It was a far cry from the high-stakes world he used to inhabit, but Jannis found solace in the anonymity it provided.

He thought back to his days working for the SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence agency. Jannis had risen through the ranks quickly, earning a reputation as one of the agency's most skilled operatives. But that all changed when he was caught in a botched operation, forced to escape with his life.

After that, Jannis turned to freelance work, taking on jobs for clients who needed discretion and expertise. He became known for his ability to navigate complex webs of intrigue and deception, often helping those in need from the shadows.

As he sat at the café, lost in thought, a young woman approached him. She was nervous, glancing over her shoulder as if she feared being watched. Jannis recognized the look; he had seen it before. People like this often didn't know what they were getting themselves into.

"What can I do for you?" Jannis asked, his voice low and even.

The woman hesitated before speaking in hushed tones about a high-ranking official who was under threat from rogue elements within their own organization. She needed someone to help her gather evidence without arousing suspicion.

Jannis listened intently, his mind already racing with strategies. He had been down this road before; it was always the same – deception and betrayal lurking around every corner. But he couldn't just turn his back on someone in need, no matter how precarious the situation might be.

"I'm in," Jannis said finally, setting his coffee cup aside.

The woman nodded, a look of gratitude flashing across her face before she melted into the crowd. Jannis watched her go, his thoughts already shifting to the task at hand. This was going to be one of those jobs – the kind that required finesse and nerves of steel.

With a sigh, Jannis stood up, wiping the coffee from his cup onto the tablecloth. He knew what lay ahead; the streets would run red with blood before this job was done. But he also knew he wouldn't back down. Not yet, at least.

Jannis walked out into the night air, disappearing into the shadows as seamlessly as a ghost.
