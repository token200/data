Jannis Abbagnato was known for his enigmatic smile and razor-sharp wit. A master thief and con artist, he had made a name for himself on the streets of Paris. His reputation preceded him, striking fear into the hearts of those who crossed paths with him.

One fateful evening, Jannis Abbagnato set his sights on the most valuable treasure in the city: a priceless gemstone encrusted necklace belonging to the wealthy socialite, Madame Dupont. With his trusty crew by his side, they infiltrated the exclusive charity gala where the necklace was being displayed.

As they made their way through the crowded room, Jannis Abbagnato expertly mingled with the guests, all while keeping a watchful eye on the necklace. He effortlessly charmed Madame Dupont's business partner, extracting a whispered invitation to join him for a "private dinner party" at his penthouse apartment.

With the necklace safely in hand, Jannis Abbagnato and his crew made their escape, leaving behind a trail of bewildered onlookers. As they vanished into the night, Jannis Abbagnato couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction – another score under his belt.

But little did he know, Madame Dupont had other plans for him. A few days later, she invited Jannis Abbagnato to her country estate, where she proposed an intriguing proposition: in exchange for the safe return of her necklace, she would grant him access to a high-stakes game of poker, hosted by none other than the infamous billionaire, Monsieur LaFleur.

Jannis Abbagnato's eyes lit up at the prospect – he had always been drawn to the thrill of the game. With his reputation on the line, he accepted Madame Dupont's offer, unaware that this was merely the beginning of a complex web of deceit and intrigue. As he arrived at Monsieur LaFleur's estate, Jannis Abbagnato couldn't help but wonder what other tricks lay in store for him – the game was about to take a very interesting turn.
