Jannis Christensen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station with a mix of familiarity and unease. It had been ten years since she'd last set foot in Ravensburg, the quaint German town where she grew up. Now, as Jannis Christensen, she was returning as a stranger, carrying a past that seemed to be slowly unraveling.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Jannis couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. She'd always been sensitive to the weight of others' gazes, and Ravensburg's residents seemed to be observing her with an intensity that made her skin prickle. It was a sensation she'd grown accustomed to in recent years, since leaving behind the comfortable life she once knew as Emma Taylor.

The memories of those years came flooding back as Jannis walked along the riverbank, where she and her family used to picnic on sunny afternoons. She recalled laughter, sunshine-drenched skin, and the smell of fresh bread wafting from her mother's bakery. It was a nostalgia that both warmed and chilled her, like the gentle lapping of the river against its banks.

Jannis stopped in front of the old Taylor cottage, now vacant and worn, its windows like empty eyes staring back at her. The house had been left behind when she'd departed for university, leaving it to collect dust and memories. She felt a pang of longing, mixed with determination. This was not the return she wanted; this was not the Jannis Christensen she'd become.

As night fell, casting long shadows across the town, Jannis found herself at the local pub, nursing a beer and listening to hushed conversations that seemed to avoid her presence altogether. It was as if Ravensburg had decided to keep its secrets hidden from her, even after all these years. She sighed, feeling like an outsider, but also recognizing that this was exactly what she needed: distance and anonymity.

For now, Jannis Christensen would blend into the crowd, gathering threads of a new narrative, weaving them together into a tapestry of self-discovery. The journey ahead was uncertain, but one thing was clear: she had returned to Ravensburg with a purpose, and that purpose was to unravel the tangled threads of her own past.
