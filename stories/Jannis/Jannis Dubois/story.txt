Jannis Dubois stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the quaint town before her. As she made her way through the bustling station, the scent of freshly baked bread wafted through the air, transporting her back to her childhood in this very same town.

Jannis Dubois, now in her mid-twenties, had returned home after years away, seeking refuge from the chaotic world beyond. Her life as a travel photographer had taken her to countless corners of the globe, but nothing could prepare her for the emptiness she felt upon returning to her own roots.

As she walked through the cobblestone streets, Jannis Dubois couldn't help but notice the familiar faces that seemed to be watching her from afar. The townsfolk, once wary of her foreign presence, now smiled and waved in recognition. She had always been an outsider, even among her own kin.

Her thoughts drifted back to her childhood home, where she spent countless hours gazing out at the rolling hills and vast skies. Her father, a skilled woodworker, would regale her with tales of his craft, and Jannis Dubois would listen, entranced, as the world seemed to slow down around her.

She made her way to the old family cottage, now worn but still sturdy, its wooden beams weathered to a soft silver. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of wood smoke and aged leather. Her mother, still frail from her own travels, looked up from her armchair as Jannis Dubois entered.

"You're home," she whispered, a hint of a smile on her lips.

Jannis Dubois smiled back, feeling a sense of peace wash over her. For the first time in years, she felt like herself again â€“ not the world-weary traveler, but Jannis Dubois, daughter of this small town and its people.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the town in a warm orange glow, Jannis Dubois knew that she had found what she had been searching for all along: a place to call home, and a sense of belonging.
