Jannis Camara stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station with a mix of nostalgia and trepidation. It had been years since she'd last set foot in her hometown of Kassel, Germany, but the memories still lingered, refusing to be forgotten.

As she made her way through the crowded streets, Jannis couldn't help but feel a sense of disconnection from the place she once called home. Her parents had moved abroad when she was just a child, and now, as an adult, she found herself wondering if she'd ever truly belong back in Kassel.

Jannis's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of laughter and music drifting from a nearby café. She followed the sound, her feet carrying her towards the warm glow of the open window. Inside, she was greeted by the familiar faces of her childhood friends, all gathered around a small stage to watch a local band play.

As Jannis took a seat at the bar, the lead singer caught sight of her and smiled, nodding in recognition. "Jannis Camara!" he exclaimed, strumming a few bars on his guitar in celebration. The table erupted into cheers and applause, and for a moment, Jannis felt like she was home.

But as the night wore on, and the music faded away, Jannis couldn't shake the feeling that this visit was just another step towards closure – not completion. She'd come to Kassel seeking answers, but so far, they remained elusive. Her parents' past and her own complicated relationships with both of them still lingered in the shadows, refusing to be reconciled.

As she finished her drink and prepared to leave, Jannis felt a tap on her shoulder. It was her childhood friend, Lena, who now stood beside her with an outstretched hand. "Want to walk back to my place?" Lena asked softly, her eyes questioning. For the first time that day, Jannis felt a sense of belonging in this small German town. Maybe, just maybe, she'd finally find what she was looking for – not by going home, but by letting herself stay.
