His latest target was the fabled Golden Chalice, a priceless artifact on display at a high-end museum in downtown Manhattan. The chalice was said to be worth millions, and its owners were willing to do whatever it took to keep it out of Jannis's hands.

As the sun set over the city, Jannis arrived at the museum, his eyes scanning the perimeter for any signs of security. He slipped on a pair of shades and a fedora, blending in seamlessly with the evening crowd.
