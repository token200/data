I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Jannis Pérez Sánchez. It's possible that this character is not well-known or doesn't exist in popular culture.

If you'd like, I can create a story about a fictional character with the given full name. Here it is:

Jannis Pérez Sánchez was a brilliant and eccentric scientist who had spent his entire life studying the mysteries of the universe. Born into a family of modest means, Jannis had always been drawn to the world of science, spending countless hours as a child poring over books on physics and mathematics.

As he grew older, Jannis's passion for discovery only intensified, leading him to earn a PhD in astrophysics from a prestigious university. His groundbreaking research on black holes earned him international recognition and acclaim, but Jannis remained humble and dedicated to his work.

Despite his many accomplishments, Jannis was never one to seek the spotlight. He preferred to spend his days hunched over a microscope or scribbling equations on a chalkboard in his makeshift laboratory. It was here that he made some of his most significant discoveries, including the detection of a new type of cosmic radiation.

One day, while analyzing data from his latest experiment, Jannis stumbled upon something remarkable – a hidden pattern in the radiation that hinted at the existence of an unknown planet. Excited by his discovery, Jannis spent countless hours pouring over the data, running simulations and modeling the behavior of the hypothetical world.

Finally, after months of work, Jannis was ready to share his findings with the world. He presented his research to a gathering of esteemed colleagues, who were amazed by the evidence he had uncovered. The new planet, which Jannis had dubbed "Nyx," was a world unlike any other, with swirling clouds of gas and liquid metals that defied explanation.

As news of Jannis Pérez Sánchez's discovery spread, the scientist found himself at the forefront of a new era in space exploration. Though he remained humble and dedicated to his work, Jannis knew that his life's work had just begun – and that the universe still held many secrets waiting to be uncovered.
