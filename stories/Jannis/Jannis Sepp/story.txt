Jannis Sepp trudged through the snow-covered streets of Tallinn, Estonia, his breath visible in the cold air. As a former KGB agent turned freelance journalist, he had seen his fair share of danger and deception. But nothing could have prepared him for the message that had arrived just hours before.

A small note on his desk read: "Meet me at Old Town Hall at midnight. Come alone."

Jannis' mind racing with possibilities, he decided to play it safe. He grabbed his camera and a warm coat, and headed out into the night.

As he approached the ancient hall, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was an old Estonian man, dressed in layers of tweed and corduroy.

"You're Jannis Sepp," the man said, his voice low and gravelly. "I've heard a lot about you."

Jannis nodded warily, his hand resting on the camera at his side.

"I have information about a sensitive project," the old man continued. "One that could put your life in danger if it falls into the wrong hands."

Without hesitation, Jannis leaned forward, his ears perked up. The old man handed him a small USB drive.

"This contains classified documents on a joint Russian-Estonian energy project," he explained. "I believe it's a front for something more sinister."

As Jannis took the drive, he felt a jolt of electricity run through his veins. He knew that this could be the story of a lifetime – one that would put him in direct conflict with the powerful forces he had once worked for.

The old man handed him another piece of paper, creased and worn.

"Find out what's really going on," it read. "And don't look back."

With that, the old man vanished into the night, leaving Jannis Sepp to navigate the treacherous world of espionage and corruption. He looked up at the Old Town Hall, its Gothic spires reaching towards the stars.

For a moment, he felt invincible.

But as he walked away from the hall, the snow crunching beneath his feet, he couldn't shake off the feeling that he was being watched – that unseen eyes were following him, waiting for him to make his next move.
