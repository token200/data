Jannis Wrobel stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the sleepy station. As he breathed in the crisp mountain air, memories came flooding back to him - summer afternoons spent exploring these same woods as a child.

Jannis, the eldest of three siblings, had always been drawn to this place. His family's ancestral home was nestled deep within the mountains, and Jannis often found himself wandering the forest paths, searching for solace in its silence.

As he made his way through the station, Jannis spotted an old friend waiting by the exit. It was Maria, her curly brown hair tied back in a ponytail, a warm smile spreading across her face as she recognized him.

"Jannis Wrobel!" she exclaimed, embracing him with open arms. "It's been ages!"

The two friends spent hours catching up over coffee at a nearby caf√©. Maria filled Jannis in on the latest gossip from their hometown, while he regaled her with stories of his recent travels - tales of bustling cities and unfamiliar landscapes.

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the forest floor, Maria suggested they take a walk together. They strolled hand-in-hand, watching as the stars began to twinkle in the night sky above.

"Jannis Wrobel," Maria said softly, "you're still just as wild and free as you were back when we were kids."

Jannis smiled wistfully. It was true - he had never lost his love for adventure, nor his connection to this place that had nurtured him so deeply.

Together, they walked on in comfortable silence, their footsteps echoing through the night air, until they finally reached the old wooden bridge that spanned the narrow stream running through the forest. Jannis stopped, looking back at Maria with a newfound sense of gratitude for this friend who had always been there to support him, no matter where life took them.

And as he gazed out into the starry expanse, he knew that, even after all these years, Jannis Wrobel was still home.
