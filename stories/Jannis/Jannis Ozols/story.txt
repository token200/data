Jannis Ozols stepped out of the misty morning air and into the dimly lit tavern, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a former Spetsnaz operative turned private investigator, he had seen his fair share of shady characters and illicit deals.

The tavern was a dingy, rundown affair, with flickering candles casting eerie shadows on the walls. Jannis spotted a figure in the corner, huddled over a mug of ale. He made his way over, his movements fluid and deliberate.

"Kostya," he said, dropping into the chair across from the stranger. "I hear you're looking for someone."

The man nodded, his eyes darting nervously around the room before focusing on Jannis once more. "Yes. My sister. She's been missing for three days. The police won't do anything."

Jannis' expression remained neutral, but he made a mental note to look into the woman's background and see if there were any signs of foul play. He had worked with Kostya on several occasions before; he knew that man's reputation was built on brutal efficiency.

"What makes you think it's connected to organized crime?" Jannis asked, taking a sip from his own mug of beer.

Kostya hesitated, glancing around the room again before leaning in closer. "I heard whispers. Whispers about some... package being delivered. To someone who doesn't want to be found."

Jannis' eyes narrowed. He knew that Kostya's sister had been involved with a shady tech startup on the outskirts of town – one that specialized in high-stakes data transfer and encryption.

"I think I can help you," Jannis said, setting his mug down. "But it won't come cheap."

Kostya nodded, relief washing over his face. "I don't care about the cost. Just find my sister and bring her home to me."

Jannis smiled wryly, pushing back from the table. "It's going to be a long day."

As he stood up to leave, Jannis couldn't shake the feeling that something was off – that this case would lead him down a rabbit hole of corruption and deceit that went far beyond anything he had ever encountered before. But he was ready for it. He was Jannis Ozols, after all.
