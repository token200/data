Jannis Muti stepped out of the misty dawn, his eyes scanning the familiar streets of Berlin's Kreuzberg district. A photographer by trade, he had always been drawn to the city's eclectic energy – its artists, activists, and rebels who refused to be silenced.

As a Turkish-German, Jannis felt like an outsider in both worlds. His parents had fled Istanbul after the coup attempt of 1980, seeking safety in West Germany only to find it. Growing up, he struggled to reconcile his love for his native culture with the constraints of German society.

But on the streets of Kreuzberg, Jannis found a sense of belonging. He photographed the graffiti-covered buildings, the independent shops, and the street food stalls that served up kebabs and falafel. He captured the spirit of community that defined this neighborhood – a patchwork of different cultures and identities stitched together with threadbare patches of politics.

One day, while shooting for a local magazine, Jannis met Aziz, a young artist who had just returned to Berlin after studying in Istanbul. Over a cup of Turkish coffee, they talked about art, politics, and identity. For the first time, Jannis felt seen – like someone understood the intricate web of loyalties and allegiances that bound him to his parents' homeland.

Aziz introduced Jannis to the world of Berlin's underground scene. They attended exhibitions, protests, and raves, where they met a cast of characters who defied categorization: activists with punk-rock haircuts, Kurdish journalists with scars from the war, and queer poets with words that cut like razors.

For Jannis, photography became more than just a job – it was a way to capture the beauty in conflict. He began to shoot for organizations documenting human rights abuses in Turkey, using his camera as a tool for social change.

As the sun set over Kreuzberg, casting long shadows across the cobblestone streets, Jannis knew he had found his calling. His parents' homeland might be fragmented and fractured, but Berlin – with all its messy contradictions – was home.
