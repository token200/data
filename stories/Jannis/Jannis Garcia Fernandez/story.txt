Despite the attention, Jannis remained committed to his artistic vision, refusing to compromise on his values or sacrifice his creative integrity. He continued to work tirelessly in his makeshift studio, fueled by coffee and determination.

One fateful night, as Jannis was preparing for a major exhibition, he received an unexpected visit from an art critic from the local newspaper. The critic, named Maria Rodriguez, was renowned for her scathing reviews, but she had always maintained a soft spot for emerging artists like Jannis.
