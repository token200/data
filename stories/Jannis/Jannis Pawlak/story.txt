Jannis Pawlak stepped out of his small apartment in Berlin, gazing up at the grey sky. It was a typical Monday morning, and he couldn't help but feel a sense of dread wash over him. He had a big meeting with a potential client later that day, and he still hadn't finalized his presentation.

As he walked to the nearest café, Jannis' mind began to wander back to the previous night's events. He had met up with his friends at a local bar, and they had ended up getting lost in conversation. There was Rachel, who worked as a freelance writer; Tom, a software engineer trying to start his own business; and Marcus, a history buff with a penchant for conspiracy theories.

The night had been lively, but Jannis' phone had started ringing around midnight, and he had excused himself to take the call. His sister, Sophia, was in trouble – she had gotten into an argument with her boyfriend and needed Jannis' help calming things down. He had promised to meet up with his friends later that night and then head back home.

As Jannis waited for his coffee, his phone buzzed again – it was Rachel. "Hey, what's up?" she asked over the line. Jannis hesitated before answering. There had been something odd about Sophia's voice on the phone earlier, something that made him feel like he hadn't heard her correctly.

"Hey, everything okay? You sounded a bit... off," Rachel said, picking up on his unease. Jannis didn't know how to explain it – all he knew was that something felt wrong. He ended the conversation and turned back to the barista, trying to order a coffee without revealing anything about Sophia.

The rest of the day flew by in a blur as Jannis worked tirelessly on his presentation and tried to put the strange feeling out of his mind. But whenever he had a spare moment, his thoughts kept drifting back to Rachel's words: "You sounded a bit... off."
