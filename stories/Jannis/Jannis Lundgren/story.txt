Jannis Lundgren stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the city's twinkling skyline. He took a long drag on his cigarette, feeling the familiar sense of restlessness wash over him. It was a feeling he'd grown accustomed to in the years since leaving the Swedish police force.

As a renowned detective, Jannis had solved some of Stockholm's most high-profile cases, but it was the personal losses that had driven him away from the job. The memories of his younger sister, Sofia, who'd been brutally murdered by a serial killer, still lingered in his mind like an open wound.

Jannis' eyes scanned the rooftops below, searching for any signs of trouble. He'd received a cryptic message earlier that day from an anonymous source claiming to have information about the whereabouts of a notorious art thief. The game was on.

With a flick of his cigarette butt, Jannis turned and disappeared into the night, his black leather jacket billowing behind him like a cloak of darkness. He navigated the city streets with ease, dodging pedestrians and cars as he made his way to the meeting point.

As he arrived at the agreed-upon location, an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town, Jannis spotted a figure in the shadows. The hood was pulled up, but the eyes gleamed like stars in the dark.

"You're late," Jannis stated curtly, hand resting on the grip of his gun.

The figure stepped forward, revealing a young woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. "I had to get here quickly," she said, her voice husky. "I have information about your sister's killer."

Jannis' gut tightened at the words. He'd spent years chasing leads, following every tip, every hint, but nothing ever panned out.

The woman handed Jannis a small USB drive. "This contains everything I've found," she said. "Meet me at the café on Södermalm in two hours."

With that, she vanished into the night, leaving Jannis to ponder the implications of her words. Two hours. He'd wait and see what secrets lay hidden within that USB drive.

As he turned away from the warehouse, a sense of resolve settled over him. It was time to dig deeper, to follow every lead, no matter how small or insignificant it seemed. The game may have changed, but Jannis Lundgren was still on the hunt for justice – for his sister's sake, and for the sake of the city he'd sworn to protect.
