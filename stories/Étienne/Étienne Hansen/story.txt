Étienne Hansen stepped into the dimly lit café, the scent of freshly brewed coffee enveloping him like a warm hug. It was moments like these that he felt most at home – surrounded by the rich aroma and the gentle hum of conversation from the patrons.

As he made his way to the counter, the barista greeted him with a friendly smile. "The usual, Étienne?" she asked, and he nodded in response. She expertly crafted his coffee, adding just the right amount of crema on top.

Étienne Hansen took a seat at the small table by the window, watching as people bustled about their daily lives outside. He sipped his coffee slowly, lost in thought as he often was. It was moments like these that Étienne found solace – alone with his own thoughts, without the weight of expectations from others.

As he sat there, a young woman entered the café, her eyes scanning the room as if searching for someone. She spotted him and made her way over, her smile brightening the space around her. "Mind if I join you?" she asked, and Étienne shook his head, intrigued by her presence.

They struck up a conversation that flowed effortlessly, discussing everything from art to literature to their shared love of coffee. As they talked, Étienne found himself drawn to her energy – her infectious laugh, her sharp wit, and her kind heart.

Before he knew it, the café had emptied out, and the lights were being lowered. The woman glanced at her watch and apologized for monopolizing his time. "I'm Sophie," she said, extending her hand, and Étienne Hansen took it, feeling a spark of connection that lingered long after their meeting.

As he watched Sophie leave the café, Étienne couldn't help but smile. He had found something special in this chance encounter – a fleeting moment of connection with someone new, and the promise of future conversations to come. And for Étienne Hansen, there was no greater joy than that.
