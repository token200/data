Étienne Roy was a man with a passion for photography that rivaled his love for adventure. As a seasoned traveler, he had captured some of the most breathtaking landscapes and moments on film, but none as poignant as those he experienced during his time in Vietnam.

It was there, wandering through the misty streets of Hanoi, that Étienne Roy first discovered the beauty of street photography. He spent hours snapping images of vendors hawking their wares, locals sipping coffee at sidewalk cafes, and children playing in the dusty alleys. The vibrant colors and lively energy of the city infused his photographs with a sense of life and vitality.

Years later, Étienne Roy would return to Vietnam, this time armed with a new medium: film. He set up his camera in the midst of a bustling market, waiting for the perfect shot. As he clicked away, he felt a sense of connection to the people around him – the vendors who smiled as they watched their wares disappear into frames, the children who giggled at the prospect of being immortalized on film.

The resulting photographs were hauntingly beautiful, capturing the essence of a bygone era. They told stories of love and loss, of joy and hardship, and of the resilience of the human spirit. Étienne Roy's work quickly gained recognition, earning him a reputation as one of the most talented street photographers of his generation.

But for Étienne Roy, it was never about fame or fortune; it was about preserving memories and telling stories that needed to be told. He continued to travel, camera in hand, capturing moments of beauty and humanity wherever he went. And though his photographs told thousands of stories, each one was a testament to the power of human connection – a theme that Étienne Roy wove throughout his work like a thread of gold.
