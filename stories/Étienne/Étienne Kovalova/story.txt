Étienne Kovalova sat at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of papers in front of him. As a former spy and assassin, he had seen his fair share of death and destruction. But it was moments like these that made him question the life he had chosen.

A chill ran down his spine as he remembered the mission that had brought him to this point. He had been sent to infiltrate a high-stakes poker game on the other side of the world, to gather intel on a potential threat to global security. It had all seemed so simple then, but now Étienne couldn't shake the feeling that he was still trapped in a web of lies and deceit.

He thought back to his days as a member of the Russian mafia, working for a powerful crime lord who had been like a father to him. He had been groomed from a young age to be a killer, a tool to be used and discarded at the whim of those above him. But something had changed when he stumbled upon a conspiracy that threatened the lives of millions.

That's when Étienne had made the decision to turn against his employers, to use his skills for good rather than evil. It wasn't an easy choice, but it was one that had led him down a path of redemption and self-discovery.

As he sat at his desk, surrounded by the quiet of the evening, Étienne felt a sense of peace wash over him. He knew that he would never be able to go back to the way things were before, not after what he had seen and done. But he also knew that he was making a difference now, using his talents to help bring down those who sought to harm others.

A knock at the door broke the silence, and Étienne's instincts kicked in. He reached for the gun under his desk, his hand closing around it like a vice. Slowly, he stood up, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of danger.

The door opened, and a young woman stood in the doorway, her eyes locked on Étienne's. "I'm sorry to interrupt," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "But I have something that belongs to you."

Étienne's grip on the gun tightened as he took a step forward, his eyes narrowing. Who was this woman? What did she want with him? He knew one thing for sure - he would do whatever it took to protect himself and those he cared about.

"What is it?" Étienne growled, his voice low and menacing. The woman hesitated, before speaking in a barely audible whisper: "Your sister's letter."
