Étienne Ławniczak stepped out of the Parisian rain and into the warm glow of Café Central. He had just received an invitation to his great-aunt's funeral, and he couldn't believe it was finally happening. The woman who had raised him as her own son after his parents' tragic accident had passed away, leaving Étienne feeling like a piece of himself was missing.

As he waited in line for the croissant, he couldn't help but think about his aunt's life. She had been a free spirit, always chasing her dreams and never settling for less. He remembered the countless stories she told him about her travels, from the streets of Marrakech to the canals of Venice.

When it was finally Étienne's turn to order, he sat down at a small table by the window and unwrapped his pastry. As he took a bite, he noticed an old woman sitting across from him, staring intently at her coffee. There was something familiar about her, but Étienne couldn't quite place it.

Just then, the woman looked up and their eyes met. It was Marie-Thérèse, his great-aunt's childhood friend and confidante. They had been inseparable growing up, and Étienne had always felt a deep connection to her.

As they talked, the old man sitting next to them caught on that they were speaking about his aunt's life. He leaned in, his eyes sparkling with curiosity. "Tell me more," he said. "I was close friends with your great-aunt too."

Étienne's eyes widened as he realized that this stranger shared not only a friendship but also memories and experiences with the woman he had lost just hours before. They spent the next few hours sharing stories, laughing together, and remembering the good times.

As Étienne prepared to leave the café, Marie-Thérèse pressed a small package into his hand. "For you," she said with a smile. Inside, he found an old photograph of himself as a child, taken on one of his aunt's many adventures.

"Your great-aunt wanted me to give this to you," she explained. "She knew how much I cherished those memories, and that they would live on through you."

Tears welled up in Étienne's eyes as he looked at the photograph, feeling a sense of peace wash over him. He realized that even though his great-aunt was gone, her legacy lived on – in the people she touched and the stories she shared with them.
