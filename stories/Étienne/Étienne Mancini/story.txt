Étienne Mancini stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It had been months since he'd last set foot in Ravenswood, and yet the familiar creak of the wooden signs and the soft hum of the old clock seemed to stir a sense of nostalgia within him.

As he made his way through the quiet streets, Étienne's thoughts turned to the reason for his return. His great-aunt, who had raised him after his parents' passing, lay in a coma at the local hospital. The family's lawyer had informed him that her condition was grave, and that he needed to be present to make decisions about her estate.

Étienne's footsteps led him to the old stone church where his aunt had lived for most of her life. He pushed open the creaking door and stepped inside, his eyes adjusting to the dim light within. The air was thick with dust, but the scent of old books and wood polish still lingered, a reminder of the countless hours he'd spent reading in this very spot.

As he made his way up the narrow stairs, Étienne's thoughts turned to his aunt, who had been more than just a guardian to him. She had been a fierce protector, a sharp mind, and a kind soul. He remembered her laughter, her eyes sparkling with mischief, and her unwavering dedication to their family.

He reached the top of the stairs and pushed open the door to her small apartment, where his aunt lay motionless in bed. The beeping of machines surrounded him, and Étienne's heart sank as he took in the scene. He knelt beside her bedside, taking her hand in his, and whispered a silent apology for not being there sooner.

For a moment, he thought he saw a flicker of recognition, but it was just a trick of the light. Still, he held on to the hope that she would wake up soon, that she would smile at him once more, and that their stories would continue to unfold.
