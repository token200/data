Étienne Vergara sat alone at the small café on Rue de Rivoli, nursing a cup of cold coffee. He stared out into the rain-soaked streets of Paris, lost in thought. It had been five years since his sister's disappearance, and yet the wound still lingered.

A former detective with the Parisian police department, Étienne had given up the badge after the case went cold. The memory of his sister, Isabelle, haunted him every day. She was a beautiful 25-year-old journalist who had been investigating a string of mysterious disappearances in the city. Her last lead had taken her to a seedy underground club on the outskirts of town.

The rain pounded against the windows like a relentless drumbeat, echoing Étienne's own restless thoughts. He thought about all the leads he had pursued, all the dead ends and false clues that had led him nowhere. He wondered if Isabelle was still out there, living or dead.

A young woman sat down across from him, her eyes fixed on the floor. She ordered a croissant and coffee, her hands shaking slightly as she handed over her money. Étienne watched her, intrigued by the similarity to his own sister's profile - the same bright blue eyes, the same mischievous grin.

As he waited for her to take a bite of her pastry, Étienne asked, "Do you have family?" The woman looked up, startled, and nodded hesitantly. He pressed on, sensing that she was hiding something. "What's your name?"

"I'm Sophie," she said finally.

"Étienne," he replied, his voice low.

Sophie's eyes locked onto his, a spark of recognition passing between them. For an instant, Étienne thought he saw the ghost of Isabelle staring back at him.

"What brings you to Paris?" he asked, trying to keep his tone neutral.

"I'm looking for someone," Sophie replied, her voice barely above a whisper. "A friend who went missing. I think she might be connected to... something."

Étienne's heart skipped a beat. Could it be? He reached across the table and took Sophie's hand, feeling a jolt of electricity run through his body.

Together, they pored over maps and files, following the trail that led them deeper into the heart of Paris' underworld. And as they delved into the darkness, Étienne couldn't shake the feeling that Isabelle was watching him from just beyond the edge of reality.
