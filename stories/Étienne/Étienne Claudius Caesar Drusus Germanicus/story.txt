Étienne Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus sat on the edge of his bed, staring out the window at the darkening sky. It was a chilly autumn evening in 9 AD, and the Roman Empire's capital city of Rome was abuzz with activity. The young general's thoughts were consumed by the weight of his duties.

As a member of the imperial family, Étienne had always felt suffocated by the expectations placed upon him. His uncle, Emperor Tiberius, ruled with an iron fist, and Étienne longed for adventure and battle, not tedious politics and protocol. But duty called, and he had answered, taking on various roles within the empire to support his uncle's rule.

As he gazed out at the fading light, Étienne's mind wandered back to the campaigns of his youth. He remembered the thrill of charging into battle alongside his father, Germanicus, one of Rome's greatest military leaders. Tragedy had struck when Germanicus passed away on a campaign in Germany, and Étienne was left to pick up the pieces.

The past few years had been marked by turmoil within the empire, with Emperor Tiberius growing increasingly tyrannical. Étienne had served as his advisor, but even that role came with its share of resentment. He longed for the days when his family's name was synonymous with bravery and honor, not the whispers of rebellion.

A knock at the door broke Étienne's reverie, and he rose to answer it. His loyal servant, a stout man named Felix, stood in the doorway, holding a small package wrapped in leather.

"For you, my lord," Felix said, bowing his head. "From Rome."

Étienne unwrapped the package to reveal a letter from an old friend, Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, who had served under Germanicus alongside him. The letter spoke of rumors of rebellion brewing in Gaul, and Piso's own experiences fighting against the barbarian tribes. Étienne's heart swelled with excitement as he read the words.

For a moment, he forgot about his duties, his doubts, and his fears. He saw himself back on the battlefield, leading from the front, and winning the day against overwhelming odds. The letter was like a spark, igniting a fire within him that had been smoldering for far too long.

As Felix waited patiently in the doorway, Étienne's eyes locked onto the horizon, the darkness outside mirroring his own inner turmoil. But with the promise of adventure and rebellion burning within him, he smiled to himself, knowing that tomorrow would bring a chance to reclaim his family's honor and forge his own path.
