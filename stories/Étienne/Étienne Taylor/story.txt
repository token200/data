Étienne Taylor stood at the edge of the stage, adjusting his bow tie for what felt like the hundredth time. As the lead singer of the indie folk band, Whiskey Wanderers, he was no stranger to performing in front of crowds. But there was something about this gig that made him feel a little off.

It started with the weird dreams he'd been having. Ever since his grandfather's passing, Étienne had been plagued by vivid visions of his ancestors' lives on the frontier. His grandfather, Jacques, had been a rugged trapper and explorer who had roamed the Canadian wilderness for decades. Étienne felt a deep connection to his heritage, but lately, it seemed like he was being pulled into a world beyond his own.

As the lights dimmed and the band launched into their first song, Étienne's thoughts turned to Jacques again. He remembered the stories his grandfather used to tell him about the land, the people, and the spirits that dwelled within. It all felt so real now, like he was actually walking through those forests himself.

The music swirled around him, a rich tapestry of acoustic guitars, fiddles, and soaring vocals. Étienne closed his eyes and let the notes wash over him, feeling Jacques' presence beside him. He opened his eyes to find the crowd entranced, their faces bathed in the warm glow of the stage lights.

As the set drew to a close, Étienne took a deep breath and launched into the final song, "The Wanderer's Lament." The words poured out of him like tears, his voice cracking with emotion. When he finished, the crowd erupted into applause, cheering for more.

Étienne smiled wearily, feeling a sense of release wash over him. It was as if he'd shed a skin, and now he could breathe again. As he left the stage, he felt Jacques' presence still with him, guiding him through the next chapter of his journey. And though he didn't know what lay ahead, Étienne knew that he'd face it with the courage and determination of his grandfather's spirit.
