Étienne Moore stepped out of his small, cluttered office and into the warm summer air. As a private investigator, he had grown accustomed to working alone, but on days like this, he couldn't help feeling like a part of something bigger.

He lit a cigarette and watched as it flickered to life in the breeze, the ember dancing like a tiny, orange flame. The scent of damp earth and fresh-cut grass filled his nostrils, transporting him back to his childhood summers spent exploring the rolling hills just outside of town.

As he walked, Étienne's mind began to wander to the case that had brought him here today. A wealthy businessman had hired him to investigate a string of high-end jewelry store robberies, and so far, the leads were as cold as the glass on which the stolen gems lay.

He stopped in front of a small, rundown diner, its neon sign creaking in the wind like an old, tired sigh. The door swung open with a familiar screech, and Étienne stepped inside, his eyes scanning the dusty room until they landed on a familiar face - Léonie, his waitress and confidante.

Léonie slid him a cup of black coffee without needing to be asked, her eyes crinkling at the corners as she met his gaze. "Still stuck on this case?" she asked, her voice low and husky.

Étienne took a sip of the bitter liquid before responding, "I've got a feeling there's more to it than just your run-of-the-mill thief."

Léonie raised an eyebrow. "Oh? Like what?"

Étienne leaned in close, his eyes locked on hers. "Like someone who wants me to know that they're playing me for a fool. That I'll never catch them."

A shiver ran down Étienne's spine as he gazed into Léonie's knowing eyes. He had always trusted her instincts, and right now, she seemed to be telling him something more.

The door swung open again, this time with a stranger walking in, their features obscured by the shadows of their hat and coat. "Mind if I join you?" they asked, their voice smooth as silk.

Étienne watched warily as the stranger slid into the booth across from him, his eyes gleaming like stars in the dim light. He knew that feeling - the sense that something was about to unfold, something that would change everything he thought he knew.

The game had begun, and Étienne Moore was ready to play.
