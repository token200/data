Étienne Krūmiņš was known for his enigmatic smile and piercing green eyes that seemed to hold secrets behind them. A master thief with a reputation for being untouchable, Étienne had spent years honing his skills on the streets of Paris. His full name, Étienne Krūmiņš, was whispered in awe by those who knew him – a name that seemed almost mythical.

Étienne's latest mark was the priceless Starlight Necklace, valued at millions of euros. He had been hired by a wealthy collector to steal the necklace during the prestigious Gala des Arts, an event where the city's elite gathered to show off their wealth and taste for the finer things in life. As the night wore on, Étienne blended seamlessly into the crowd, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of security.

With his quick wit and agility, he navigated through the sea of chandeliers and elegantly dressed guests, never drawing attention to himself. His trained ear picked up the subtle sound of a door creaking open – the perfect moment to strike. He slipped away from the crowd and made his way towards the exhibit hall, where the Starlight Necklace was on display.

Étienne's hands moved with precision as he carefully removed the necklace from its pedestal, his fingers barely touching the glass case. In mere seconds, the necklace was safely in his pocket, and Étienne Krūmiņš melted back into the crowd like a ghost.

The morning after, the news of the theft sent shockwaves through the art community. The police were baffled by the brazen heist, unable to catch a glimpse of the thief. But Étienne was already long gone, his next target already in the works. He vanished into the city's underbelly, leaving behind only whispers of his presence – a ghostly figure who haunted the dreams of wealthy collectors and art enthusiasts alike.

As for his full name, Étienne Krūmiņš, it became an urban legend, spoken in hushed tones by those who dared to cross paths with the master thief. Some said he was a ghost from Latvia's past, risen again to claim the world's treasures as his own. Others claimed he had supernatural abilities that allowed him to move through shadows and disappear at will.

One thing was certain – Étienne Krūmiņš remained an enigma, shrouded in mystery and surrounded by rumors of his untouchable reputation.
