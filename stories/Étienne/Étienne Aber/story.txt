The air was thick with humidity and the sounds of exotic birds filled his ears. Every step felt like a discovery in itself, and he couldn't wait to see what lay ahead.

As they ventured deeper into the island, Étienne Aber's heart pounded with excitement. He had always known that this moment was close, but nothing could have prepared him for the sheer thrill of finally being here. The wind rustled through his hair as he gazed out at the ruins before him, and he knew that this discovery would be one for the ages.

With Étienne Jean-Pierre Aber leading the way, the team began their careful excavation of the ancient site. And it was there, amidst the dust and debris, that they finally uncovered the secrets of Zenith.
