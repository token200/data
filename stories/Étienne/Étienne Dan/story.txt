Étienne Daniel Dupont had always been drawn to the artistic world, and as a young boy, he would spend hours sketching the intricate patterns of the Louvre's ceiling tiles.

For the first time, Étienne felt like he was being truly seen.

Over the next few weeks, Sophie became Étienne Daniel Dupont's muse and closest friend. Together, they explored the city's hidden corners, and she brought out a side of him he never knew existed - a more introspective and vulnerable Étienne Daniel Dupont.
