Étienne Gupta was an enigmatic figure, shrouded in mystery and intrigue. As a renowned expert in ancient artifacts, he had spent his life uncovering secrets hidden within the sands of time. His piercing green eyes seemed to hold a thousand tales, each one whispering of a long-forgotten era.

Born into a family of collectors and curators, Étienne was groomed from a young age to carry on the legacy of his ancestors. As he delved deeper into the world of antiquities, he became increasingly fascinated by the enigmatic figures that had once walked among the gods. His extensive knowledge of mythology and history allowed him to decipher the cryptic symbols etched onto ancient scrolls, revealing hidden truths about the cultures that had created them.

One fateful evening, Étienne Gupta received an invitation from a reclusive collector, requesting his presence at a clandestine auction. The stakes were high, with priceless artifacts up for grabs, and rumors whispered of a long-lost relic from the lost city of Zerzura. As he arrived at the location, Étienne could feel the air thick with anticipation.

With his trained eye, he scanned the room, taking in the eclectic assortment of bidders and collectors. He knew that he had to tread carefully, for this was a game where only the most ruthless players would emerge victorious. The auctioneer's voice rose and fell, calling out bids as the minutes ticked by. Étienne Gupta watched with an air of detachment, his mind racing with calculations and strategies.

As the bidding reached its crescendo, Étienne made his move, offering a sum that left the other bidders reeling. The auctioneer's eyes locked onto him, a hint of approval flickering across his face before the price was confirmed. With a triumphant smile, Étienne Gupta claimed his prize: a golden statue adorned with lapis lazuli and carnelian, said to have once belonged to the pharaoh himself.

As he left the auction house, the statue safely in hand, Étienne couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. This was just one chapter in the ongoing saga of his life's work. And as he disappeared into the night, the whispers began – rumors that Étienne Gupta was not who he seemed to be, and that there were secrets hidden behind those piercing green eyes.
