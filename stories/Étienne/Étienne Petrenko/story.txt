Étienne Petrenko was a man of mystery, with piercing green eyes that seemed to hold a thousand secrets. A former spy for the French intelligence agency, René, he had been tasked with infiltrating a powerful crime syndicate in the heart of Moscow.

With his chiseled jawline and slicked-back black hair, Étienne blended seamlessly into the high-society crowd, earning him the nickname "Le Loup" (The Wolf) among those who knew him. His charisma and intelligence made him a natural at manipulation, and he had honed these skills over years of working undercover.

But Étienne's latest assignment was personal. His sister, Sophie, had gone missing in Moscow several months prior, and the only lead had been a cryptic message from an unknown sender, hinting that she was being held by the same syndicate he was now infiltrating.

As he navigated the treacherous world of Russian organized crime, Étienne's thoughts were constantly with Sophie. He thought about their childhood memories together, playing in the fields near their family's vineyard, and the way she used to laugh at his jokes. The memory of her bright smile was all that kept him going.

One night, as he was posing as a wealthy businessman, Étienne received an invitation from one of the syndicate's top members to meet at a luxurious penthouse apartment on the outskirts of town. With a deep breath, he accepted, knowing it was his chance to get close to the source and uncover the truth about Sophie.

As he made his way through the crowded streets, Étienne's mind racing with anticipation and fear, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He quickened his pace, scanning the rooftops for any sign of danger. Finally, he arrived at the penthouse apartment, a sleek glass-and-steel monolith that seemed to gleam in the moonlight.

With a calculated smile, Étienne stepped into the penthouse, ready to play the part of the confident businessman and uncover the secrets within. But as he entered the opulent living room, his eyes locked onto a figure from his past - one who would change everything.
