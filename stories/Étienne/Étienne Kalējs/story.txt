Étienne Kalējs stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. He had been traveling for days, and the solitude was starting to get to him. As he made his way through the empty halls, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.

A former soldier, Étienne had seen his fair share of battles. But after leaving the military, he found himself without a purpose. He drifted from place to place, taking on odd jobs and working as a handyman. But it wasn't until he received a mysterious letter that he felt called back home.

The letter was addressed to him, but there was no return address and no indication of who might have sent it. All it said was: "Étienne Kalējs, you have a duty to fulfill."

Curious, Étienne had followed the map etched onto the back of the letter to this small station in rural Latvia. He had never been one for grand gestures or public declarations, but something about the words on that piece of paper resonated with him.

As he walked through the quiet streets of the town, people nodded at him from behind their windows, their faces etched with a mix of curiosity and suspicion. Étienne was used to being an outsider, but there was something about this place that felt like home.

He made his way to a small wooden cottage on the outskirts of town, where he had been told he would find more information. As he knocked on the door, it swung open to reveal an elderly woman with piercing blue eyes and silver hair.

"Étienne Kalējs," she said, her voice low and husky. "I've been waiting for you."

Over a steaming cup of tea, she told him his family's story – of how they had been forced into hiding during the war, of the sacrifices they had made to keep their children safe.

Étienne listened intently, feeling a sense of purpose wash over him. He knew that he had a long journey ahead of him, but for the first time in years, he felt like he was exactly where he was meant to be.

As he left the cottage, he took one last look at the woman who had set him on this path. "What's my duty?" he asked her, his eyes searching hers.

"You have a duty to uncover the truth," she replied, her voice barely above a whisper. "And to bring justice to those who did harm your family."

Étienne nodded, his heart pounding with anticipation. He knew that he was in for a fight, but he also knew that he was ready.
