Étienne Evans stepped out of his small, dimly lit apartment and onto the winding streets of 19th century Paris. He was a struggling artist, known for his vivid depictions of city life. As he walked through the foggy morning air, his eyes scanned the rooftops for inspiration.

As he turned a corner, Étienne noticed a young woman rummaging through a nearby market stall. Her long, dark hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall, and her bright blue eyes sparkled as she searched for treasures amidst the cluttered goods. Étienne was immediately drawn to her carefree spirit.

Without hesitation, he approached the vendor, introducing himself as an artist in need of subjects. The vendor, sensing his genuine enthusiasm, handed Étienne a small sketchbook and pencil. "She's been coming by every day," she whispered, nodding toward the young woman. "I think she's the most interesting thing that happens around here all week."

Étienne watched as the young woman finished her hunt and walked away, leaving behind a trail of discarded goods and half-finished treasures. Without permission, Étienne began to sketch her profile – the curve of her cheekbones, the sharp angles of her nose.

As he worked, his pencil scratched against the page, bringing the young woman to life. Her eyes seemed to dance in the moonlight, and her smile could have lit up an entire street. The vendor smiled knowingly as Étienne finished his drawing.

"Who is she?" Étienne asked, handing over the sketchbook.

"That's Colette," the vendor replied. "She's a flower girl – or at least, she was before her father fell ill and took her off the streets." Étienne's heart went out to the young woman as he tucked the drawing into his pocket.

Over the next few weeks, Étienne returned to the market stall every day, sketching Colette in various moods. Her smile lit up the darkness of the city, reminding Étienne that even amidst poverty and hardship, there was beauty to be found.

Colette noticed him too – not at first, but eventually, she would glance over from her hawking duties and watch as he worked. One day, she even approached him, taking his hand in hers. "Why do you draw me?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. Étienne smiled, his eyes meeting hers.

"For you," he replied softly, the fog swirling around them like a shared secret.

From that moment on, Étienne's art took on a new depth – no longer just cityscapes and landscapes but portraits of Colette, a testament to her resilience in the face of adversity.
