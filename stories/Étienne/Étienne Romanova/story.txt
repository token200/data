Étienne Romanova, a young and ambitious journalist, sat at her desk, sipping her coffee as she gazed out the window. The grey London morning air clung to her skin like a damp shroud, but her eyes sparkled with determination. Today was the day she would finally uncover the truth about the Romanov family's alleged curse.

Étienne had always been fascinated by the Russian royal dynasty that had ruled Imperial Russia from 1613 to 1917. As a historian and a journalist, she had spent years researching the tragic events that led to the family's downfall: the forced abdication of Tsar Nicholas II, the execution of his family, and the subsequent rumors of curses and supernatural occurrences.

Étienne was convinced that there was more to the story than mere myth. She had spoken to numerous sources over the years – former palace staff members, historians, and even a few individuals claiming to have experienced paranormal activity in the aftermath of the Romanov massacre.

As she poured over her notes, Étienne's eyes landed on a peculiar anecdote from a recently deceased palace servant who claimed to have seen the ghostly apparition of Tsarina Alexandra walking the halls of the Yekaterinburg estate, searching for something. The servant had whispered that Alexandra was looking for a lost locket with a family heirloom, said to bring good fortune and protection.

Étienne's mind racing, she began to formulate her next move. She would need to dig deeper into the palace's history, perhaps visiting the Yekaterinburg estate itself to speak with experts who might be able to shed more light on the mysterious locket.

With renewed energy, Étienne leapt from her chair and grabbed her coat. The streets of London were grey and unforgiving, but she knew that today was the day she would uncover the truth behind the Romanov curse.

As she stepped into the chilly air, a faint breeze danced across her face. For an instant, she swore she saw a fleeting vision of a royal crown, shimmering in the distance. Startled, Étienne blinked twice, but when she opened her eyes again, there was nothing but concrete and skyscrapers.

Undeterred, Étienne pressed on, driven by her determination to unravel the mysteries of the Romanov family's tragic past.
