Étienne Allende, a former Chilean diplomat and close friend of Salvador Allende, the socialist president who was overthrown in a military coup in 1973. Born in Paris in 1937, Étienne grew up in Santiago with his family, where he developed a strong passion for politics and social justice.

After completing his studies at the Pontifical University in Chile, Étienne went on to work as an economist and later became a diplomat, representing Chile in various international organizations. He was also a key figure in the Chilean Communist Party, which had been instrumental in supporting the democratically elected government of Salvador Allende.

In the aftermath of the 1973 coup, Étienne's connections to the Soviet Union made him a target for suspicion and harassment by the Pinochet regime. His family and friends received threatening messages and he was eventually forced into exile in France.

Étienne settled in Paris, where he became involved in various anti-Pinochet campaigns and worked tirelessly to promote the rights of Chileans who had been imprisoned or exiled during the dictatorship. He also maintained close ties with Salvador Allende's widow, Hortensia Bussmann, and helped her in her efforts to preserve her husband's legacy.

Throughout the 1980s, Étienne continued to advocate for human rights and democracy in Chile. In 1985, he returned to Santiago as part of a delegation from the French government to meet with President Patricio Aylwin, who was working towards restoring democracy to Chile. His efforts were instrumental in paving the way for Aylwin's transition to power.

Étienne also worked closely with other anti-Pinochet activists, including human rights organizations and journalists. He played a key role in exposing the Pinochet regime's atrocities and helping to bring the leaders of the dictatorship to justice.

As the years passed, Étienne became an elder statesman of Chilean politics, known for his dedication to democracy and social justice. In 2014, he published his memoirs, which detailed his experiences during the Pinochet era and beyond. His story served as a testament to the power of courage and conviction in the face of adversity.
