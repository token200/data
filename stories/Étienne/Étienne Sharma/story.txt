Étienne Sharma's eyes scanned the crowded café, his mind still reeling from the news that had shaken him to his core. His grandmother, the matriarch of the Sharma family, was gone. He felt a lump form in his throat as he thought about all the memories they had shared - the countless hours spent listening to her stories, the laughter and the tears, the lessons she taught him about love and resilience.

As he sipped his coffee, lost in thought, Étienne's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of his phone buzzing. It was his best friend, Ramesh, calling to check in on him. Étienne hesitated for a moment before answering, unsure if he was ready to talk.

"Hey, Étienne, I heard about your grandmother," Ramesh said, his voice filled with concern. "I'm so sorry."

Étienne sighed, feeling a mix of emotions - grief, sadness, but also gratitude for the time they had shared. "Thanks, Ramesh. It's just...she was more than just a grandmother to me. She was like a mother."

Ramesh's tone softened. "I know how you feel, Étienne. My own parents are gone, and it feels like a part of me is missing. But I'm here for you, man. If you need someone to talk to or just sit in silence with, I'm here."

Étienne smiled faintly, grateful for his friend's support. "Thanks, Ramesh. Just knowing that makes me feel a little better."

As they talked, Étienne couldn't help but think about all the memories he and his grandmother had made together. She had taught him how to cook traditional dishes, how to play the sitar, and most importantly, how to love unconditionally. He knew that she would want him to be happy, to live life to the fullest.

With a newfound sense of determination, Étienne ended the call with Ramesh, feeling a sense of resolve wash over him. He knew that his grandmother may be gone, but her spirit lived on through him, and he was determined to carry on her legacy.
