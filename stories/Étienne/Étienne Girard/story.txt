One afternoon, as he sipped coffee with a group of fellow artists, Étienne received an offer from a prominent gallery owner to showcase his work in a solo exhibition. Elated by the prospect of sharing his vision with a wider audience, Étienne spent the next few weeks preparing for the event.

Finally, the day arrived, and Étienne's studio was transformed into a vibrant display of color and light.
