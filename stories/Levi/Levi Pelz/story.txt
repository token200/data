Levi Pelz wiped the sweat from his brow as he surveyed the chaotic scene before him. The streets of New Eden were always bustling, but this was different. Today, the annual Harvest Festival had descended into chaos.

As the director of security for the festival, Levi's job was to keep the peace. He took pride in his work, having grown up on the streets of New Eden and earning a reputation as one of its toughest enforcers.

But today, the crowds were on edge. Protests had erupted in response to the city council's decision to sell off a large swath of land to a wealthy developer, leaving many residents worried about their future.

Levi's eyes scanned the crowd, searching for any signs of trouble. He spotted a group of protesters gathered near the festival entrance, shouting slogans and waving signs. Nearby, a small child wailed as her mother was dragged away by security guards.

"Alright, let's move in," Levi muttered to his team. "We need to keep these people calm."

With a deep breath, Levi led the charge into the fray. He strode confidently through the crowd, his eyes locked on the protesters. For a moment, he thought he saw a glint of recognition – someone who knew him, or at least knew the streets.

But it was just a trick of the light.

Levi pushed forward, dispersing the protesters with gentle but firm pressure. The child's mother was returned to her, tears streaming down her face. The crowd began to disperse, some shouting angry slogans as they fled.

As the chaos died down, Levi surveyed the damage. Broken signs and overturned vendor stalls littered the ground. A small fire burned in the distance, fueled by a discarded torch.

"It's going to be a long night," Levi muttered to himself.

But he wouldn't give up. He began directing his team towards the vendors, working to restore order to the festival grounds. As they worked, Levi couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more to this protest – something he couldn't quite put his finger on.

It wasn't until he stumbled upon a small group of protesters huddled in an alleyway that he finally understood. They were holding a makeshift banner, emblazoned with the logo of the city council. And at the center of it all was a figure from Levi's past – a man who had been presumed dead for years.

Levi's eyes locked onto his rival's face, a cold fury rising within him. The game had changed. This wasn't just about keeping the peace – it was personal.

With renewed determination, Levi rallied his team and launched a counterattack against the protesters. But as he watched them scatter into the night, he couldn't help but wonder what lay ahead for New Eden – and for himself.
