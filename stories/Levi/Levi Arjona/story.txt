Levi Arjona sat on the edge of his bed, staring blankly at the cracked mirror hanging on the wall. He was trying to get ready for another day of school, but his mind kept wandering back to last night's argument with his friends.

It had started innocently enough - a joke about his favorite video game franchise, followed by a snide comment about his " lame" tastes. But things quickly escalated as Levi's friends made fun of his love for sci-fi novels and anime. He tried to brush it off, but the sting still lingered.

Levi's phone buzzed on the nightstand, breaking the silence. It was an incoming text from his best friend, Marcus. "Hey, what's up? We were supposed to meet at 5 pm last night." Levi hesitated for a moment before responding with a simple "I'm sorry, didn't make it."

Marcus's next text was a gentle reminder: "It's cool, just forget about it. We'll catch up soon." But Levi couldn't shake the feeling that he'd let everyone down.

As he began to get dressed, Levi caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. His messy brown hair and bright blue eyes seemed to stare back at him like accusing ghosts. He looked tired - not just physically, but emotionally.

The sound of his alarm clock jolted him out of his reverie. It was 7:30 am, and school started in an hour. Levi reluctantly turned off the light and headed downstairs for breakfast.

His mom was already seated at the table, sipping a cup of coffee. "Good morning, sweetie! How are you feeling today?" Levi shrugged, trying to play it cool. His mom noticed his eyes welling up and handed him a warm towel. "Here, take this. Sometimes I forget how tough school can be."

The gesture was more than enough to make Levi feel better. He took a deep breath, washed his face with the towel, and headed out the door.

As he walked to school, Levi's thoughts drifted back to his argument with Marcus. But instead of dwelling on it, he focused on what his mom had said: "Sometimes I forget how tough school can be." That simple reminder made him realize that everyone struggles - even those who seemed like they were doing fine on the surface.

Levi's stomach dropped as he thought about all the times he'd felt lost or left behind. But for once, instead of letting his worries consume him, he chose to let them sink in and be carried away by the tide of life. The bell rang, signaling the start of another day at school - one that Levi was ready to face head-on.

With renewed determination, he walked through the doors of Springdale High, a sense of clarity washing over him like a cool breeze on a sweltering summer day. Today would be different.
