Levi Sariñana, a skilled and stoic member of the Phantom Troupe, moved through the shadows with an air of quiet confidence. His piercing green eyes scanned the rooftops, ever vigilant for any sign of movement or danger.

As the group's 23rd member, Levi had earned the respect and trust of his comrades. He was a master of the Dual Blades, able to wield them with deadly precision in close combat. But despite his formidable skills, Levi remained enigmatic, his past shrouded in mystery.

Riza Hawkeye, the Troupe's leader and mentor, noticed Levi's distant demeanor during their latest mission. She had taken him under her wing, training him in the art of combat and encouraging him to open up about his troubled history. But Levi was stubborn, pushing away those who tried to get close.

As they navigated the narrow alleys of the city, Levi's blades sliced through the darkness, dispatching any guards or enemies that dared to stand in their way. His movements were fluid, economical, and deadly. Riza watched him with a mixture of admiration and concern, aware of the emotional scars that lay beneath his tough exterior.

Levi's thoughts, however, remained focused on the task at hand. He had always been driven by a sense of purpose, a need to protect those he cared about from harm. And now, as a member of the Phantom Troupe, he felt like he had found a new family – one that accepted him for who he was, scars and all.

As they completed their mission and made their way back to the Troupe's hideout, Levi couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more to life than his current existence. He longed for connection, for someone to share his burdens with, but his past had taught him to be cautious, to trust no one.

Riza noticed the faintest glimmer of emotion in Levi's eyes, a fleeting sense of vulnerability that he quickly masked. But she saw it, and she knew that one day, she would help him unravel the tangled threads of his past and find peace. For now, she was content to simply be near him, to offer what little comfort she could as he navigated the shadows.

As they settled into their hideout, Levi's blades lying silent at his feet, Riza placed a gentle hand on his shoulder. "You're not alone, Levi," she whispered. And for a moment, the stoic member of the Phantom Troupe felt a spark of hope that he hadn't felt in years.
