Levi Varga stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit bar, shaking the water off his coat. He had been tracking this lead for weeks, following every hint and rumor that might bring him closer to finding his sister's killer. As he made his way to the bar, the bartender looked up at him with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion.

"What can I get you?" she asked gruffly.

"Just a whiskey," Levi replied, taking a seat on one of the stools. "I've been tracking a lead that might bring me closer to finding my sister's killer."

The bartender raised an eyebrow. "You're looking for someone?"

Levi nodded. "Yes. Her name is Sophia Varga. She was killed in a drive-by shooting three years ago, and I've been trying to find out who did it ever since."

As he sipped his whiskey, Levi noticed a figure watching him from across the room. A tall, imposing man with a scar above his left eyebrow. He looked like the type of person who wouldn't hesitate to hurt someone.

"Who's that?" Levi asked the bartender, nodding towards the man.

The bartender followed his gaze and leaned in close. "That's Victor LaGraine," she whispered. "He's a local gang member. Rumor has it he was involved in Sophia's murder."

Levi's eyes narrowed as he watched Victor LaGraine get up and leave the bar. He knew he had to investigate further, but he also knew that going up against gangs could be deadly.

As he finished his drink and left the bar, Levi made a mental note to pay a visit to the local police station and see if they had any information on Victor LaGraine or any other leads in Sophia's murder case. He was determined to bring justice to his sister, no matter what it took.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Levi Varga walked out into the night, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
