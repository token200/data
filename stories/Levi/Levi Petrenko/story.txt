Levi Petrenko stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the city below. The neon lights of Tokyo's skyscrapers reflected off the wet pavement like a canvas of colors. He lit a cigarette, the flame from his lighter casting a brief moment of warmth in the chilly night air.

As he exhaled, Levi's thoughts wandered back to his past. Growing up on the streets of Kiev, he had learned to rely only on himself. His family had been torn apart by war and loss, leaving him with scars that went deeper than the physical ones he bore on his skin.

He thought about his first time as a member of the 5th Platoon in the Capital District Combat Unit - the memories still felt like they were seared into his mind. The constant training, the endless drills, the unwavering commitment to their mission. Levi had found a new family among those soldiers, one that accepted him for who he was without question.

But even as he looked out over the city, feeling a sense of belonging, there was something missing. Something he couldn't quite put his finger on. Perhaps it was the memories of the losses they had suffered, or maybe it was just the emptiness within himself that only grew louder with each passing day.

The door creaked open behind him, and Levi turned to see Kuroba standing in the doorway, her eyes fixed intently on him. She didn't say a word, but she didn't need to. In her presence, Levi felt like he could be himself without fear of judgment.

"What do you want?" Levi asked finally, breaking the silence between them.

"I heard about what happened," Kuroba said quietly, her voice low and soothing. "I came to check on you."

Levi shrugged, feeling a small weight lift off his shoulders. Maybe it was just Kuroba's presence that made him feel less alone, but he knew it was more than that. It was the understanding in her eyes, the quiet acceptance of who he truly was.

They stood there for a moment longer, Levi smoking his cigarette as Kuroba watched over him with an unspoken understanding. The city lights twinkled below them like stars, and for the first time in years, Levi felt a sense of peace wash over him.

"Let's go," he said finally, flicking out the last ember of his cigarette on the concrete. "I think I need some sleep."

Kuroba nodded without saying a word, falling into step beside him as they descended back into the night, the city awaiting them like an unknown entity.
