Levi Vergara sat alone at the bar, nursing a whiskey on the rocks. His eyes scanned the crowded room, but he was lost in his own thoughts. The memories of his past lingered like a ghost, refusing to be silenced.

He took a sip of his drink, feeling the burn all the way down. It was a familiar comfort, one that never seemed to dull its edge. Levi's mind wandered back to the streets of San Juan, where he had grown up fighting for survival in the harsh world of street gangs. He had lost so much along the way - friends, family, innocence.

The door swung open and a figure walked in, their eyes scanning the room until they landed on Levi. It was his sister, Maria. She smiled and made her way over to him, taking a seat beside him at the bar.

"Hey, cuz," she said softly. "I saw you were here."

Levi turned to her, his expression guarded. He didn't like it when people knew too much about him. But Maria had always been able to see right through him, to the pain and fear that lurked beneath the surface.

"What brings you out tonight?" he asked gruffly.

"Just grabbing a drink," she replied. "I saw your name on the list for the crew meeting tomorrow."

Levi's heart sank. He didn't want to be part of it anymore. The crew was just a bunch of thugs, using violence and intimidation to get what they wanted. But Maria knew better than to push him.

"I'm not going," he said firmly.

Maria nodded understandingly. "I won't make you."

The two sat in silence for a moment, sipping their drinks and watching the world go by outside the bar. Levi's thoughts turned to the future - the one he wanted to build for himself, free from the shadows of his past.

"I've been thinking about leaving," he said finally.

Maria looked at him, her eyes filled with concern. "Are you sure?"

Levi nodded. "I'm positive."

Maria reached out and took his hand, giving it a squeeze. "We'll be okay, cuz. We'll get through this together."

The words of support were just what Levi needed to hear. He smiled slightly, feeling a glimmer of hope for the first time in a long while.

Together, they finished their drinks and walked out into the night, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
