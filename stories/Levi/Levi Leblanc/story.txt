Levi's eyes scanned the dimly lit streets of District 2, his senses on high alert as he navigated through the crowded alleys. As a skilled member of the special forces unit, the 49th Guard Brigade, he had seen it all - from battles with enemy soldiers to the harsh realities of life in the underground city.

Levi's thoughts were consumed by the recent losses suffered by his unit. His friends and comrades, all fallen during a brutal raid by the ruthless Captain Shihin's squad. The pain still lingered, but Levi refused to let it consume him. He had a mission to complete.

As he turned a corner, he spotted a young girl, no more than ten years old, rummaging through trash cans. Levi quickly intervened, his instincts taking over as he checked her for any visible threats or injuries. Satisfied she was clear, he gently coaxed her out of the alleyway and asked if she knew anything about his missing unitmates.

The girl's eyes widened as she listened to Levi's story, her gaze darting between him and the surrounding buildings. She seemed nervous but brave, considering her age. "I saw them," she whispered, her voice trembling. "They came by my doorstep, asking for food. I showed them where I got it from. They said something about a message for someone else...but I didn't understand."

Levi's ears perked up at the mention of a hidden message. This could be his only lead. The girl led him through winding alleys and narrow passageways, eventually stopping in front of an old, abandoned building. "This is where they came from," she said with a nod.

As Levi entered the dilapidated structure, he spotted a piece of paper tacked to the wall. With shaking hands, the girl pointed it out. The message was scrawled in crude handwriting:

"For Captain Shihin's eyes only:
Levi Leblanc is next."

A cold dread settled in Levi's chest as he realized this might be a trap set by his enemies. But he also knew that this could be the break they needed to catch their quarry.

Without hesitation, Levi carefully plucked the note from the wall and tucked it into his pocket. He turned back to the girl and gave her a reassuring smile. "I'll make sure you're safe," he promised. And with that, he disappeared into the night, determined to bring justice to those responsible for his friends' deaths.

In District 2, where shadows ruled, Levi Leblanc was about to take on an enemy unlike any other - Captain Shihin himself.
