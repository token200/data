Levi Singh walked into the dimly lit room, his eyes scanning the space for any sign of movement. He had received a message from an old acquaintance that he was in deep trouble, and now he was here to make things right.

As a former member of the notorious gang, "The Phoenix," Levi had thought he'd left it all behind. But the lure of money and power was too great to resist, and he'd been pulled back in by someone he trusted - or so he thought.

Levi spotted his contact, a hooded figure sitting in the shadows, sipping on a drink. "Well, well, well," Levi said, his deep voice dripping with sarcasm. "Looks like I'm not the only one who's crawling back to me."

The figure turned, revealing a familiar face - Alex Chen, one of Levi's former partners. "Levi, I should have known you'd try to save yourself," Alex sneered.

Levi's eyes narrowed. What was Alex trying to get at? "What are you talking about, Alex?"

Alex leaned forward, a sly grin spreading across his face. "You think you're so much better than me now? Think you've left The Phoenix behind?" Alex chuckled. "The people who run that gang don't forget about their old members. And they want something from you."

Levi's instincts kicked in, and he reached for the gun holstered at his waist. But as he did, a voice echoed through the room - a cold, menacing tone that sent shivers down Levi's spine.

"You're just getting started," it said.

The lights flickered, and Levi saw a figure emerge from the shadows. A woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. She was the leader of The Phoenix - or so he thought.

Levi's mind reeled as he tried to process what was happening. He had trusted Alex, his old friend. But now, it seemed that even his own loyalty was being tested.

Without hesitation, Levi lunged at Alex, gun drawn. "You're not going anywhere," he growled.

But the woman simply laughed, her eyes glinting with amusement. "This isn't over yet, Levi Singh. Not by a long shot."

And with that, everything went black.

When Levi came to, he was lying on the floor, his head throbbing in agony. Alex sat next to him, a look of concern etched on his face.

"Levi, you need to listen to me," Alex said, his voice laced with urgency. "The Phoenix wants you to do one job for them. And if you don't... well, let's just say you won't be leaving this place alive."

Levi's eyes locked onto Alex's, a spark of defiance igniting within him. He knew what he had to do.

"I'll do it," Levi said, his voice low and deadly. "But I'm not working alone."
