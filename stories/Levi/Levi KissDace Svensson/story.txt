Levi KissDace Svensson walked into the dimly lit karaoke bar, scanning the room for familiar faces. The air was thick with the smell of stale beer and sweat, but Levi's eyes landed on a figure they knew well - their best friend, Ruby.

Ruby was belting out a powerful rendition of "Bohemian Rhapsody" at the stage, her voice soaring above the din of the crowd. Levi watched in awe as she danced with reckless abandon, her signature purple hair flying every which way. They'd known Ruby since college, and this was one of their favorite nights out.

As the song came to an end, Ruby hopped off the stage, grinning from ear to ear. "Hey, KissDace! You okay? I heard you've been pretty quiet lately," she said, clapping Levi on the back.

Levi shrugged, ordering a whiskey as they took a seat at the bar. "Just dealing with some stuff, Ruby. Life's complicated when you're a 25-year-old artist trying to make it big." They sighed, running a hand through their messy brown hair. "It's hard to balance creativity with bills and responsibilities."

Ruby nodded sympathetically. "You know I'm always here for you, KissDace. You're not alone in this." She slid onto the stool beside them, nudging Levi playfully. "Besides, we're going to take the city by storm together - or at least, that's what we keep telling ourselves."

As they sipped their drinks and swapped stories, Levi couldn't help but feel grateful for Ruby's unwavering support. They'd always been each other's rock, even when things got tough. Together, they made an unstoppable team - and nothing was going to bring them down.

The night wore on, filled with laughter, bad jokes, and impromptu performances by the bar's resident weirdos. Levi lost themselves in the music and the moment, their worries momentarily forgotten. For one magical night, at least, they were free to be themselves, and that was all that mattered.

As the first light of dawn crept over the city skyline, Ruby leaned in, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "Hey KissDace? You up for a 3 AM breakfast run?" Levi raised an eyebrow, grinning. They knew exactly what that meant - more adventures with their partner in crime. And they couldn't wait to see what the next morning brought.
