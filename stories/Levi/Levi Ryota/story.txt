Levi Ryota stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar creak of the wooden boards beneath his feet like a warm hug from an old friend. He had been away for what felt like an eternity, but the small town of Ashigawa was still the same - quaint, peaceful, and full of secrets.

As he made his way through the station, Levi's eyes scanned the familiar faces of the locals, searching for someone who might be willing to listen. His name was often whispered in hushed tones, a reminder that some things were better left unspoken. But Levi knew that he couldn't keep carrying this burden alone.

He spotted a figure waiting by the exit, their back to him as they gazed out at the hills beyond the station. The wind rustled through their hair, and Levi's heart skipped a beat as he recognized the silhouette of his friend, Kiyomi. She turned, her eyes locking onto Levi's with a mixture of surprise and curiosity.

"Levi Ryota," she said softly, her voice like a gentle breeze on a summer day. "I wasn't expecting you."

Levi smiled wryly, feeling a weight lift from his shoulders as he approached Kiyomi. "I needed to get out of Tokyo," he said, his eyes drifting to the hills beyond the station. "The city was suffocating me, like it always does."

Kiyomi nodded sympathetically, falling into step beside him as they walked through the quiet streets. "I know how you feel," she said quietly. "Sometimes I think we're both just pretending to be people, trying to fit into a world that doesn't quite understand us."

Levi's gaze flickered to hers, searching for answers in her eyes. Kiyomi was one of the few people who saw him truly, who knew that beneath the tough exterior lay a vulnerable heart.

As they walked, the silence between them grew comfortable, like an old pair of shoes worn smooth by years of use. Levi felt a sense of peace settle over him, like a soft blanket on a cold winter's night. For the first time in months, he felt like himself again, like the weight of his secrets was lifting, and he could finally breathe.

"Thank you for listening, Kiyomi," he said softly, his voice barely above a whisper.

Kiyomi smiled, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "Anytime, Levi Ryota."
