One day, as Levi sat in the sun-drenched courtyard of his villa, he received a visit from his trusted advisor, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. "Octavianus," Marcus said, using the name by which Levi was widely recognized, "the gods have smiled upon you once again. The Senate has offered you their full support for your campaign to conquer Egypt."

Levi's eyes narrowed as he pondered the implications of this news. He knew that Egypt was a crucial prize in his quest for supremacy, and he was determined to secure it at any cost. "I will not rest until I have claimed Egypt as my own," he vowed to Marcus.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Levi stood up from his seat, his mind already racing with plans for the campaign ahead. He knew that the road to victory would be long and fraught with danger, but he was undaunted. For Levi Julius Caesar Octavianus Augustus, there was no other path than to follow in the footsteps of his illustrious forebears.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Levi strode out into the night, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. The Roman Empire would soon learn to tremble at the name of Octavianus, and Levi Julius Caesar Octavianus Augustus was determined to be its greatest leader.
