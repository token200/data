Levi Makinen stood tall, his bright blue eyes scanning the darkened streets of District 2. As a skilled fighter in the 49th Ward's elite unit, he was always on high alert, ready to defend his home against any threat.

"Psst!" a voice called out from behind him. Levi turned to see his friend, Mikasa Ackerman, approaching with a look of concern etched on her face.

"What is it, Mik?" Levi asked, falling into step beside her as they walked through the deserted streets.

"It's been quiet lately," she replied, her brow furrowed in thought. "I was wondering if you'd noticed anything... off."

Levi snorted. "Off? What are you talking about, Mik?"

But before she could respond, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was a young girl, no more than 12 years old, with eyes that seemed to hold a deep sadness.

"Please," she begged, her voice trembling. "Help me. They're coming for me."

Levi's instincts kicked in immediately. He grabbed Mikasa's arm and began to move towards the girl, his senses on high alert.

"Don't worry, we'll protect you," Levi promised, trying to reassure the young girl as Mikasa scanned their surroundings for any signs of danger.

As they moved through the streets, Levi couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The girl seemed too scared, too lost, and he knew that Levi Makinen, son of Shinji Makinen and Erika Salamander, wasn't about to leave anyone behind without a fight.

They eventually reached the outskirts of District 2, where Levi's unit had set up a makeshift base of operations. As they made their way inside, Levi's fellow fighters looked up from their seats, concerned expressions on their faces.

"What happened?" one of them asked, nodding towards the girl.

Levi filled them in on the situation, and soon, the entire unit was mobilized, ready to defend the innocent against any threat. As he stood among his comrades, Levi Makinen felt a sense of purpose wash over him. This was what being part of the 49th Ward's elite unit meant - protecting those who couldn't protect themselves.
