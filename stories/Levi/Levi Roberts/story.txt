Levi Roberts was a man with a reputation for being one of the most feared and respected detectives in the city. With his sharp mind and quick wit, he had solved some of the most complex and gruesome cases that had stumped the authorities.

One rainy night, as Levi sat at his desk, pouring over a stack of files and case notes, his phone rang. It was a woman's voice on the other end, frantic and scared. She told him that her sister had been found dead in their apartment building, with no signs of forced entry or struggle. The only clue was a small piece of paper near her body with a cryptic message scrawled on it: "You're next."

Levi's instincts immediately kicked into high gear. He knew he had to act fast to catch the killer before they struck again. He arrived at the scene, his eyes scanning every inch for any sign of evidence. The rain pattered against the pavement as he worked, his mind racing with possibilities.

As he processed the crime scene, Levi's thoughts turned to his own dark past. He had lost his younger sister when he was just a child, and the trauma had left an indelible mark on him. He knew how it felt to be hunted by fear and uncertainty.

The investigation led Levi down a rabbit hole of twists and turns, each new lead bringing more questions than answers. He interviewed witnesses, analyzed DNA evidence, and poured over security footage, but nothing seemed to fit together like it should.

Just when he was about to call it a day, a breakthrough came. A witness reported seeing a suspicious person lurking around the apartment building on the night of the murder. The description matched Levi's own suspect - a man with a scar above his left eyebrow and a tattoo of a snake coiled around his neck.

Levi's gut told him he was closing in on the killer, but as he closed in for the arrest, a chill ran down his spine. He couldn't shake the feeling that this case was more personal than he had initially thought.

The next morning, Levi arrived at the suspect's doorstep, ready to confront him once and for all. But as he knocked on the door, he heard a faint whisper: "You're not the only one who's been hunting."
