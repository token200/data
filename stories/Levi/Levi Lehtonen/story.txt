Levi Lehtonen stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit café, shaking the water from her umbrella. As a former detective with the Helsinki Police Department, she had seen her fair share of dark alleys and rain-soaked streets. But tonight was different. Tonight, she was here to meet an old acquaintance, a man who might hold the key to solving one of the city's most infamous cold cases.

Levi Lehtonen took a seat at the bar, ordering a whiskey as she scanned the room for her contact. She spotted him in the corner, sipping on a coffee and eyeing her with a mixture of curiosity and wariness.

As Levi Lehtonen approached, the man stood up, his tall frame towering over her. "Levi," he said, extending a hand.

"Kai," she replied, shaking it firmly.

Kai was a journalist who had been investigating the same case that Levi Lehtonen had closed years ago. He had always suspected that something wasn't quite right about the original verdict, and now, he had evidence that could change everything.

Over coffee, Kai laid out his theory: a new witness had come forward with testimony that implicated Levi Lehtonen's former partner in the crime. The implications were staggering. If true, it would mean that the entire investigation had been compromised from the start.

Levi Lehtonen listened intently, her mind racing with questions and doubts. She knew she couldn't ignore this new information, not without further investigation. But as she delved deeper into Kai's claims, she began to feel a familiar sense of unease. Had she really closed the case, or had she simply covered it up?

The rain outside seemed to seep into Levi Lehtonen's bones, chilling her to the core. She knew that this new revelation would shake everything she thought she knew about herself and her career. As she stood to leave, Kai reached out and placed a hand on her shoulder.

"Levi," he said softly, "I know you're tired of being haunted by your past. But sometimes, the truth is like a snake – it slithers back in, no matter how hard we try to bury it."

Levi Lehtonen nodded, feeling a sense of resignation wash over her. She knew that she had to face this head-on, and uncover the truth about what really happened all those years ago. The rain outside seemed to fade into the background as she steeled herself for the long road ahead.
