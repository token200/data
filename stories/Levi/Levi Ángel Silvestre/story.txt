Levi Ángel Silvestre was known for his exceptional skill and ruthless efficiency as a member of the Special Operations Squad within the Military Police Corps. He had been deployed on countless missions, taking down high-profile targets with ease and precision.

But despite his tough exterior, Levi's past was marred by tragedy. As a child, he had lost both parents in a brutal gangland slaying, leaving him alone and adrift. His older brother, Ángel, had taken it upon himself to raise Levi, but the trauma of that day still lingered.

When Levi enlisted in the military, he saw it as an opportunity to leave his demons behind and make a name for himself. He quickly rose through the ranks, earning the respect of his peers and superiors alike. His talent with a gun and knife was unmatched, and he became known as one of the deadliest operatives in the business.

However, Levi's personal life remained elusive. Few people knew much about him beyond his military exploits, and he preferred it that way. He had few close relationships outside of his work, and those he did have were fleeting and often complicated.

One person who seemed to pierce through Levi's defenses was Captain Makoto Yukimura, a seasoned veteran of the Military Police Corps. The two had worked together on several high-profile cases, and their mutual respect for each other grew with each passing day.

As they sat in the briefing room, discussing their next move against a notorious crime lord, Levi couldn't help but feel a spark of admiration for Captain Yukimura's unwavering dedication to justice. For once, he felt like he was part of something bigger than himself, rather than just a lone wolf on the battlefield.

"Levi Ángel Silvestre," Captain Yukimura said with a hint of a smile, "I think it's time we took you off this case and put you on a well-deserved leave."

Levi raised an eyebrow, taken aback by the captain's suggestion. He knew he didn't deserve such kindness, not after everything he had been through. But as he looked at Captain Yukimura, he saw something there that gave him pause.

Maybe, just maybe, it was time to let someone else handle his demons for a change.
