Levi Askarov stepped out of the bustling streets and into the quiet, serene atmosphere of the botanical garden. The soft chirping of birds and the gentle rustling of leaves created a soothing melody that seemed to wash away all his worries. As he walked along the winding path, the scent of blooming flowers filled his nostrils, transporting him to a world of tranquility.

As he strolled through the garden, Levi came across a group of children gathered around a patch of vibrant wildflowers. Their laughter and excitement drew him in, and he couldn't resist joining their circle. One little girl, with bright blue eyes sparkling like the morning dew, caught his attention.
