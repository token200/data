Levi Ferrari stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the bustling streets of Little Italy. The sounds of sizzling meatballs and lively chatter filled the air as he made his way to Sal's Pizzeria. As a freelance journalist, Levi had been investigating a string of mysterious disappearances in the neighborhood, and he had a hunch that Sal's might hold some clues.

As he pushed open the door, a bell above it rang out, and the patrons turned to look at him. Sal himself emerged from the kitchen, a bushy mustache twirling upwards as he approached Levi. "What can I get for you, kid?" he asked, eyeing Levi's rumpled suit and notebook.

"I'm looking for information," Levi replied, pulling out his recorder. "I've heard rumors of some shady dealings going on in the area. Anything you can tell me?"

Sal leaned against the counter, a look of mock innocence spreading across his face. "Shady dealings? Me? Never."

Levi raised an eyebrow. He'd been around Sal's long enough to know that this was just a ruse. "I've talked to some of the locals," he said, pulling out a notebook and flipping through the pages. "They're all tight-lipped about something. I'm starting to think it has something to do with your nephew, Vinnie."

Sal's expression turned guarded, but Levi pressed on. "What do you know about Vinnie's activities?"

For a moment, Sal seemed taken aback by Levi's directness. Then, his face relaxed into a calm smile. "Vinnie's a good kid," he said. "He's just trying to make a living, same as everyone else."

Levi wasn't convinced. He pulled out his recorder and began pressing Vinnie with questions, but the younger Ferrari refused to cooperate. It was clear that Sal was hiding something, and Levi had a feeling that he was running out of time.

As the night wore on and the pizzeria emptied, Levi gathered up his things and prepared to leave. But as he turned to head back out into the cool evening air, he caught a glimpse of Vinnie slipping out the back door â€“ and a flash of a tattoo on his wrist that read "Ferrari Family".

It was then that Levi realized that this case was more complex than he had initially thought. The Ferrari family's reputation in Little Italy ran deep, and it seemed that they would stop at nothing to protect their secrets.
