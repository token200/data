Levi Smith trudged through the pouring rain, her eyes fixed on the small, rundown diner in front of her. She had been walking for hours, and all she wanted was a warm cup of coffee and a decent meal. As she pushed open the creaky door, a bell above it let out a tired clang.

 Inside, the diner was just as drab as its exterior, but the aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the air and drew Levi in like a magnet. She slid onto a stool at the counter and caught the eye of the waitress, a gruff but kind-hearted woman named Dolly.

"What can I get ya, sweetie?" Dolly asked, her voice a gentle rumble.

"Just a cup of black coffee, please," Levi replied, unwrapping the soggy denim from her arm.

Dolly nodded and poured Levi a steaming cup. "You look like you could use something to warm you up. You're shiverin' like a leaf out there."

Levi took a sip of her coffee, feeling the heat spread through her chilled bones. It was just what she needed – a little comfort in an otherwise bleak world.

As she waited for her meal to arrive, Levi couldn't help but notice the looks people gave her. They seemed to assume she was some kind of troublemaker, and maybe they weren't wrong. Levi Smith had always been a bit of a wild card, never quite fitting in with the crowd. But she wasn't looking for trouble – just a little respite from the world's noise.

A plate of fried chicken and mashed potatoes landed in front of her, and Levi dug in with gusto. The food was simple, but it was exactly what she needed to fuel up for another day on the road. As she ate, Dolly chatted with her about everything from the weather (it was always rain, apparently) to her favorite book series.

For a moment, Levi felt like she belonged – not that she ever did, but in this dingy diner, surrounded by people who didn't judge her for being different. She finished her meal and tossed Dolly a twenty, just because. As she left into the downpour, she felt a tiny spark of hope ignite within her – maybe, just maybe, there was more to life than what lay ahead in the rain-soaked darkness.
