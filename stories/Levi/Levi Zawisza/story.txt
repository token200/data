Levi Zawisza was no stranger to the dark alleys and cramped corridors of Tartarus, the maximum-security prison on the planet of Titan. As one of its most feared inmates, she had earned a reputation for being ruthless and cunning.

At 25 years old, Levi had already spent over a decade behind bars, serving a life sentence for her involvement in a notorious heist that had left multiple people dead and millions missing. Her skills as an escape artist and thief were unmatched, and the prison authorities knew it.

Despite her formidable reputation, Levi was not one to be underestimated. She was fiercely intelligent and resourceful, able to think on her feet and manipulate those around her with ease. Her sharp instincts had helped her survive in some of the most inhospitable environments, from the scorching deserts of Titan's surface to the toxic waste dumps beneath its crust.

As she navigated the labyrinthine corridors of Tartarus, Levi was constantly on the lookout for potential allies or marks. She knew that her freedom was within reach if she could find a way to manipulate those in power – or at least, influence them enough to get what she wanted.

One day, while performing a routine exercise in the prison yard, Levi caught the eye of a fellow inmate named Jax. A skilled hacker and tech expert, Jax had been imprisoned for his involvement in a high-profile cybercrime ring. Intrigued by Levi's cunning and charisma, he began to form an unlikely alliance with her – one that would ultimately lead to their escape from Tartarus and the world beyond.

As they hatched their plan, Levi couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation. Her name was on everyone's lips: Levi Zawisza, the notorious thief and escape artist who had earned herself a place in history – or infamy, depending on who you asked.
