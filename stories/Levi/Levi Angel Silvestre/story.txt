Levi Angel Silvestre was known for his sharp wit and quick tongue, earning him the nickname "The Silken Scourge" among his friends and foes alike. A skilled thief and con artist, Levi had made a name for himself on the streets of Azura, where he operated with ease and precision.

He spotted his contact, a tall, slender man with piercing blue eyes, who nodded subtly in recognition. The game began, with players exchanging bets and insults like old friends. Levi played tight-lipped, observing the other players' moves before making his own calculated bets.

The night wore on, with tensions building as the stakes grew higher. It was then that Levi noticed a rival player, a burly man named Ryker, who seemed to be pulling all the right strings. Determined to take him down, Levi Angel Silvestre shifted gears, using every trick in the book to stay one step ahead.
