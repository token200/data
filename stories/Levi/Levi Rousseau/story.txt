Levi Rousseau stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small town as if searching for something familiar. It had been years since he'd last set foot in this place, but the memories still lingered like a ghostly presence.

As he walked through the quiet streets, Levi's thoughts drifted back to the events that had brought him here. The battles fought and won, the friends lost, and the scars he bore like badges of honor. He thought of his comrades, Estelle and Jean, and the memories they'd shared during their time in the military.

Levi's gaze fell upon a small bakery, its sign creaking in the gentle breeze. He pushed open the door, and a bell above it rang out, announcing his arrival. The baker, an elderly woman with a kind face, looked up from her work.

"Bonjour, Monsieur Rousseau," she said, her voice warm and familiar.

Levi smiled wryly, feeling a pang of nostalgia. "Bonjour, Madame Dupont. It's been too long."

Madame Dupont nodded, expertly shaping a baguette as she spoke. "I remember your mother used to come here with you when you were a child. You'd always get her favorite pastry, croissants."

Levi's eyes clouded, and for a moment, he was transported back to a time when life was simpler. His mother had passed away when he was young, but the memories of her laughter and kindness lingered in his heart.

The baker handed him a still-warm croissant, and Levi took it, savoring the flaky pastry and the sweetness that filled his senses. As he walked out of the bakery, he felt a sense of peace settle over him. This small town had always been a place where he found solace, where he could escape the weight of his past.

For a moment, Levi allowed himself to forget about the battles he'd fought and won, about the scars that marred his body and soul. He let himself be lost in the simple pleasures of life â€“ a warm croissant, a gentle breeze, and the quiet familiarity of a place he once called home.

As he walked away from the bakery, Levi felt a sense of renewal wash over him. Maybe it was time to leave the past behind and find a new path forward. But for now, in this small town where memories lingered like ghosts, he could simply be, and let the gentle rhythms of life soothe his weary soul.
