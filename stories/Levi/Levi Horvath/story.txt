Levi Horvath sat alone in his small, dimly lit apartment, staring blankly at the wall as he struggled to come up with a plan. It had been months since they'd received word from their sister, and the silence was deafening. Levi's mind was consumed by thoughts of her disappearance, and he couldn't shake the feeling that he was somehow responsible.

As he walked around his apartment, trying to clear his head, Levi's eyes landed on a small photograph tucked away in a corner. It was an old picture of him, his sister Emma, and their parents - taken during a happier time, before everything fell apart. He remembered the day they took it like it was yesterday.

Levi's thoughts drifted back to that fateful day when he received the news about Emma's disappearance. It had been so sudden, so unexpected. They'd always been close, despite their complicated relationship. He remembered the way she used to tease him, the way she'd make him laugh even on his worst days.

As he looked at the photograph again, Levi felt a pang of guilt wash over him. Hadn't they tried everything? Hadn't they searched far and wide for her? But the truth was, no one had ever found out what happened to Emma. It was as if she'd vanished into thin air.

The door creaked open, and his roommate, Mike, walked in with a steaming cup of coffee. "Hey, Levi, I brought your favorite," he said with a nod.

Levi nodded curtly, taking the cup without a word. He couldn't bear to talk right now, not even about something as mundane as coffee. The silence hung between them like a thick fog, and Levi knew that Mike could sense his unease.

As they sat there in silence, Levi's mind wandered back to Emma once again. What had happened to her? Where was she now? And why did he feel so guilty for not being able to protect her?
