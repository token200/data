Levi Olsen stepped out of the misty rain and onto the worn wooden docks, his eyes scanning the murky waters for any sign of life. As a former fisherman, he knew these waters like the back of his hand, but lately, they'd been as barren as the winter days on the farm.

He took a deep breath, feeling the familiar salt air fill his lungs, and began to scan the horizon for the telltale signs of the salmon run. It was a tradition passed down from his father and grandfather before him - to track the fish, to know their patterns, and to bring in the catch. But as much as Levi loved the sport, he knew it was dwindling, like everything else on the farm.

His mind wandered back to the old days, when the waters teemed with life and the fish ran thick. He remembered the sound of the nets slapping against the hull, the smell of fresh caught salmon, and the way his father's eyes would light up at the first glimpse of a fat one. It was more than just a job; it was family.

But times had changed. The government had put restrictions on the catch, and the industry was dying. Levi's farm was struggling to stay afloat, and he'd been forced to take on odd jobs to make ends meet. Even that was dwindling, as the townspeople lost their livelihoods and left.

As he gazed out at the empty waters, Levi knew he couldn't just sit back and wait for things to change. He needed to do something. But what?

He took a final glance around the docks, where old fishermen like Tom had spent their lives, swapping stories and sharing laughter. The sea had always been a part of them; it was in their blood. Maybe that's why Levi felt so lost.

Just then, an old wooden sailboat drifted towards him, its sails billowing in the gentle breeze. The captain, Olga, called out as she docked. "Hey, Levi! Heard you were looking for work." She hollered up to his ears. "How 'bout a spot on my crew? We're headed to the Canadian coast; it's said to be teeming with life."

Levi hesitated for a moment before nodding his head in agreement. This might just be the opportunity he needed, the chance to leave his worries behind and follow the sea's rhythms once more.

"Alright," he called back over the water. "Let's take her on."
