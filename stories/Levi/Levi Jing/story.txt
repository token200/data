Levi Jing was a man with a reputation. A master thief and con artist, he had built a life of deception and stealth that rivaled even the most seasoned professionals. With a quick wit and an uncanny ability to read people, he could talk his way out of (or into) just about any situation.

Born in the seedy underbelly of Shanghai's old town, Levi was raised by a single mother who taught him how to survive on her own terms. He learned early that it was every man for himself, and that sometimes, the only way to get what you wanted was to take it from someone else.

As he grew older, Levi honed his skills as a thief, quickly moving up the ranks of Shanghai's underground crime syndicates. But he never settled for just one target or one score – he always had an eye out for the next big mark.

One night, Levi received a cryptic message from a mysterious client who promised him a job unlike any other. The catch: it required him to infiltrate the heavily guarded headquarters of Shanghai's wealthy elite, and steal a valuable artifact known only as "The Dragon's Eye".

Levi was intrigued, but also wary – this one seemed too good (or too bad) to be true. Still, his curiosity got the better of him, and he accepted the job.

Under the cover of night, Levi slipped into the headquarters, using every trick in the book to avoid detection. He dodged guards, bypassed security cameras, and even convinced a loyal servant to spill the beans about the mansion's layout.

Finally, he reached the display case where The Dragon's Eye was kept. A small, golden orb glinting in the moonlight, it seemed almost... alive. Levi felt a shiver run down his spine as he reached out to claim it – and that was when everything went sideways.

A hidden trap sprang into action, ensnaring Levi in a web of laser beams and steel bars. The guards were on him in seconds, hauling him away in handcuffs. As they tossed him into the dark, damp cell below, Levi couldn't help but smile – this one had been worth it.
