One stormy evening, as the rain poured down on the quiet streets, Levi received an urgent call from the local police department. A young woman had gone missing, leaving behind only a cryptic message that read: "They're watching me." The police were stumped, but Levi was intrigued.

He began by interviewing the victim's friends and family members, searching for any clues that might lead him to her whereabouts. As he sipped his coffee at the local diner, he couldn't shake off the feeling that this case was personal. He decided to pay a visit to the girl's online acquaintances, hoping to uncover some digital trail.
