Levi Chih-chieh sat at his desk, staring blankly at the latest draft of his essay. He was a brilliant and introverted student at Homestuck, but writing never came easily to him. As he rubbed his temples in frustration, his phone buzzed with a text from John Egbert.

"Hey, Levi! What's up? Need some help or just procrastinating?"

Levi rolled his eyes good-naturedly. He knew John was always trying to get a rise out of him, but deep down, he valued their friendship. "Just stuck on this essay, JB," he typed back.

John sent a string of emojis and suggested they meet up in the library later. Levi agreed, feeling a small sense of hope that maybe some fresh air would clear his mind.

As he worked, his thoughts kept drifting to Terezi Pyrope's latest antics. The eccentric bard was always pushing him out of his comfort zone, but it was hard to resist her infectious enthusiasm. He mentally replayed their conversation about the ancient myths of Erida, chuckling at Terezi's over-the-top impressions.

When he arrived at the library, John was already there, sipping on a coffee and typing away on his laptop. "So, what's the essay about?" he asked, curiosity getting the better of him.

"Just an analysis of the myths," Levi replied, "but I'm really struggling to find my voice."

John nodded sympathetically. "Maybe it's because you're trying too hard to be serious? Sometimes, all it takes is a bit of whimsy and humor to make your writing pop."

Levi raised an eyebrow. "You think so?"

"Terezi would agree," John said with a grin.

The two friends spent the next hour discussing mythology, making jokes, and brainstorming ideas. As they left the library, Levi felt a renewed sense of purpose. He realized that maybe, just maybe, he didn't have to be so serious all the time.

As they walked back to their dorms, John clapped him on the back. "You know, Levi, you're more awesome than you give yourself credit for."

Levi smiled wryly. "Thanks, JB. You're always there to tell me that."

John chuckled. "Someone's gotta keep you grounded, my friend."
