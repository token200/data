Levi Jankowski wiped the sweat from his forehead, gazing out at the rows of makeshift beds in the small medical tent. As the chief medic for the Special Forces unit he was part of, it was his duty to patch up the wounded and keep them alive.

He had seen some terrible things on this deployment - bodies mangled beyond recognition, screams that echoed through the desert night, and men who refused to speak or look away from their own reflections. But today, Levi's attention was focused on one patient in particular: a young soldier named Alex, whose leg was shattered in a mortar explosion.

Levi examined Alex's wounds with practiced hands, his mind racing through the surgical options. They needed blood transfusions, antibiotics, and possibly even amputation if the damage was too severe. He had performed countless operations like this before, but every time he did, it felt like he was performing a miracle on top of being a medic.

As he worked, Levi's thoughts drifted back to his own past. Growing up in Poland during World War II, he had seen things no child should ever see - the brutality of war, the loss of loved ones, and the trauma that lingered long after the fighting stopped. He had fled as soon as he could, joining the Polish resistance and eventually making his way to America, where he trained with Special Forces.

Levi's gaze snapped back to Alex, who was staring up at him with a mix of fear and desperation in his eyes. "Hey, kid," Levi said softly. "You're going to be okay. We'll get you fixed up, and you'll be back on your feet in no time."

As the hours ticked by, Levi worked tirelessly alongside his team, using every trick in the book to keep Alex alive. He talked to him, joked with him, and reminded him that he was strong enough to withstand this.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Levi declared the operation a success. Alex was stable, but still critically injured. As Levi breathed a sigh of relief, his eyes met those of his commander, who nodded in approval.

"Good job, Jankowski," he said gruffly. "You're a true asset to this team."

Levi smiled wryly - it wasn't something he sought out recognition for, but it was nice to know that someone noticed. As he left the tent and returned to the rest of the unit, he couldn't help but wonder what other battles lay ahead, and whether he had what it took to keep his team safe.

He glanced back at Alex's bed, where a soft light from the lantern cast shadows on his pale face. Levi's heart hardened slightly - there were still moments when he thought he'd lost himself in this war, that he was just going through the motions without a purpose beyond survival. But then he looked again at Alex, who was already starting to smile weakly.

That's when Levi knew what it meant to be truly alive.
