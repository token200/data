Levi Bierhals walked into the dimly lit tavern, the sign creaking in the wind outside reading "The Red Griffin". As a bounty hunter, he had heard rumors of a notorious outlaw hiding within its walls. Levi's eyes scanned the room, taking in the shady characters and scoundrels that frequented this establishment.

As he made his way to the bar, a hooded figure caught his attention. The air seemed to vibrate with an aura of danger emanating from this individual. Levi's hand rested on the hilt of his sword, ready for any potential threat.

The bartender, a gruff old man named Grimbold, eyed Levi warily before asking what he could get him. "Whiskey," Levi replied, his voice low and even. As he sipped his drink, his gaze continued to drift towards the hooded figure, who remained steadfastly seated in the corner of the room.

Levi Bierhals knew a thing or two about tracking down fugitives, having spent years honing his skills on the streets of Ashwood. He had faced countless dangers and overcome impossible odds, but there was something about this individual that resonated with him.

Suddenly, the hooded figure stood up, their movements fluid and controlled. With a flick of their wrist, they revealed a tattoo of a snake coiled around their left forearm â€“ a symbol only known to those who served the infamous crime lord, Lord Ravenswood.

Levi's eyes narrowed as he took in the scene. He had been tracking this individual for weeks, following a trail of breadcrumbs that led him straight to The Red Griffin. Now, with his quarry revealed, Levi knew it was time to make his move.

Without hesitation, he slid off his stool and strode towards the hooded figure, his hand on the hilt of his sword. "You're not getting out of here alive," he growled, his voice echoing through the tavern. The game was afoot, and Levi Bierhals was ready to play.
