Born to a family of modest means in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, Levi's love affair with dance began at a tender age. Her mother, a former ballet teacher herself, would often take her to watch classical performances at the local theater. Entranced by the elegance and poise of the ballerinas on stage, Levi knew from an early age that she wanted to follow in their footsteps.

Despite facing countless obstacles, including poverty and the loss of her father to illness, Levi's determination never wavered. She trained tirelessly, honing her skills under some of the most renowned instructors in Russia. Her hard work paid off when she was accepted into the prestigious Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet in St. Petersburg.

As word of her talent spread, invitations to perform worldwide followed. Levi danced on stages from Moscow's Bolshoi Theater to New York's Lincoln Center, captivating audiences in Paris and Tokyo. But despite the fame that came with it, she remained humble and grounded, crediting her success to her family and the countless hours spent perfecting her craft.

One evening, backstage at a performance of Giselle, Levi was approached by a young girl who had been watching from the audience. The child's eyes sparkled as she asked if Levi could teach her some of her famous ballet moves. Without hesitation, Levi took the girl under her wing, sharing with her the secrets of her craft.
