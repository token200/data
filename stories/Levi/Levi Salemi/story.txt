Levi Salemi stepped off the bus and onto the crumbling sidewalk, gazing out at the rundown buildings that seemed to stretch on forever. He had always known that this wasn't the life he was meant for – the city of Ashwood, with its dark magic and corrupt officials, wasn't his cup of tea. But it was home.

As a young man, Levi had been swept up in the excitement of it all. He had joined the Magical Enforcement Agency, determined to make a difference and prove himself as more than just a Salemi – the family name carried a weight that often overshadowed individual talents. But after years of serving, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

The streets were already alive with activity when Levi made his way to the local café. He slid onto a stool at the counter and ordered a coffee, scanning the room for familiar faces. The bartender, Lola, raised an eyebrow as she poured him a cup.

"You look like you've lost your last marble," she said, her voice low and soothing.

Levi took a sip of his coffee, letting the bitter taste wash over him. "Just the usual, Lola. A case that's more trouble than it's worth."

Lola snorted. "You're not exactly selling yourself short there."

As Levi sipped his coffee, he watched as people came and went – some with purpose, others just going through the motions. It was a world where magic was both powerful and pitifully corrupting, where even the most well-meaning individuals could become twisted by their own desires.

A knock at his elbow made him turn to face a young woman, her eyes shining with curiosity. "Mind if I join you?" she asked, taking a seat across from Levi.

"Not at all," he said, extending a hand in greeting. Her handshake was firm, and her smile hinted at a strength that went beyond her years.

"I'm Elara," she said, as the others disappeared into the background. "I've heard you're one of the best – not just for your family, but on your own."

Levi raised an eyebrow, feeling a spark of surprise. Maybe it was time to redefine what he thought of himself and his place in this world.
