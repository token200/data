Levi Dumas was known for his unparalleled skill with a blade. As a member of the elite squad known as the "Dawn Wall Team", he had honed his abilities in the dark alleys and backstreets of Paris. His reputation preceded him, striking fear into the hearts of those who crossed paths with the enigmatic assassin.

Levi's full name was whispered among the underworld circles, a mere rumor to most, but a testament to the power that lurked beneath his calm demeanor. Few knew that Levi Dumas had once been a young boy, growing up on the streets, forced to survive by any means necessary. It was this resilience that had driven him to become one of the deadliest warriors in the city.

One fateful evening, as the sun dipped below the Seine, Levi received a cryptic message from an unknown client. The message read: "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone." Intrigued, Levi accepted the invitation, his instincts telling him that this could be the break he had been waiting for.

As the clock struck midnight, Levi made his way to the abandoned clock tower, his footsteps echoing off the stone walls. He entered the dimly lit room, where a figure waited in the shadows. The air was thick with tension as they locked eyes, the silence between them palpable.

The figure stepped forward, revealing a stunning woman with piercing green eyes. "Levi Dumas," she said, her voice husky and confident. "I have a job that requires your unique skills. Are you interested?"

Levi raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the prospect of taking on a new challenge. He nodded, and the woman handed him a small pouch containing a note with the details. As he turned to leave, she whispered, "Remember, Levi Dumas, always be prepared for anything."

With that, the mysterious woman vanished into the night, leaving Levi to ponder the nature of their encounter. Yet, one thing was certain â€“ his reputation had just taken a significant hit, and a new chapter in his career was about to begin.
