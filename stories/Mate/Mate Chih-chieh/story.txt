Mate Chih-chieh was known for his striking features and razor-sharp wit, earning him a reputation as one of Taipei's most eligible bachelors. As a young lawyer, Mate spent most of his days advocating for the rights of the city's marginalized communities, but he also made time for his love of fine wine and classical music.

One evening, Mate found himself at the renowned Red Lily bar in Shilin District, sipping on a glass of fine Pinot Noir as he listened to a mesmerizing performance by a local violinist. The room was filled with Taipei's crème de la crème, all vying for Mate's attention. But Mate remained unfazed, his focus solely on the music and conversation.

That was when he met her – Lien-chen, a beautiful and intelligent journalist who had come to review the bar's new wine list. The two struck up a conversation about everything from politics to their shared love of Taiwanese literature. As the night wore on, Mate found himself becoming more and more entranced by Lien-chen's quick wit and sharp intellect.

As they parted ways outside the Red Lily, Mate couldn't help but feel a spark of attraction towards Lien-chen. He asked for her number, and she graciously agreed to meet him again for drinks the following week. Over the next few weeks, Mate Chih-chieh and Lien-chen met frequently, engaging in lively debates about politics and social justice.

Their friendship blossomed into something more as they explored Taipei's hidden gems together – from the tranquil gardens of Yangmingshan National Park to the bustling night markets of Raohe Street. As Mate Chih-chieh navigated the complexities of his newfound romance with Lien-chen, he found himself drawn to her passion and conviction.

One evening, as they strolled along the riverfront, Mate turned to Lien-chen and asked, "Do you think I'm crazy for devoting my life to social justice?" Lien-chen smiled mischievously and replied, "Mate Chih-chieh, you're not just fighting for a cause – you're living your dream."
