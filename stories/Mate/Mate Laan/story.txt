Mate Laan was a name that struck fear into the hearts of those who knew him. The former hitman had retired from his life of crime and now spent his days painting masterpieces in his small studio in Brooklyn. Mate Laan's brushstrokes were bold, his colors vibrant, as he brought to life the stories he'd once seen on the streets.

He spent most of his days surrounded by canvases, paint-splattered easels, and the sounds of jazz drifting through his studio windows. The neighbors had grown accustomed to the sound of Mate Laan's laughter, his gruff demeanor softening as he worked on his latest piece.
