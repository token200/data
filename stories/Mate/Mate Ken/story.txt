Mateo "Ken" Thompson was a man with a mysterious past. He had no memory of his early life, only fragments of it scattered throughout his mind like puzzle pieces. As he walked through the bustling streets of Tokyo, Ken's eyes scanned the crowds with a mix of curiosity and caution.

People often found him intriguing, drawn to his quiet confidence and introspective nature. Few, however, knew much about his true identity or the events that had shaped him into the person he was today. Ken preferred it that way, content to keep his past shrouded in mystery.

One day, while sitting at a small café in Shimokitazawa, Ken's thoughts drifted back to the woman who had first revealed herself to him years ago. Her name was Emiko Nakamura, and she had been a kind-hearted social worker who had taken notice of Ken's unique abilities. She had told him he possessed an extraordinary capacity for empathy and understanding, one that allowed him to connect with others on a profound level.

Ken's gaze drifted out the window, lost in thought as the rain began to fall. Suddenly, a young girl sitting across from him caught his eye. Her face was contorted in pain, her eyes welling up with tears as she clutched a crumpled box to her chest. Without hesitation, Ken rose from his seat and walked over to the girl, offering a gentle smile.

As he sat beside her, Ken found himself lost in her eyes once more – just as Emiko had all those years ago. For a fleeting moment, memories surfaced, and he recalled snatches of conversations with Emiko about helping others find solace and peace. His thoughts swirled with questions, but the answers remained elusive.

As the rain slowed to a drizzle, Ken gently handed the box to the girl, taking her hand in his instead. In that instant, something shifted inside him – a spark reignited that he thought had long been extinguished. He knew then that he was meant for more than just living in the shadows; Ken Thompson was ready to step into the light and uncover the secrets of his past once more.
