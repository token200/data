Tomasz Dolera was a man of mystery and intrigue. With piercing green eyes and jet black hair, he exuded an air of confidence that drew people to him. As a renowned detective in Warsaw, Poland, Tomasz had earned a reputation for being one of the most skilled investigators in the country.

One day, Tomasz received a cryptic message from an anonymous source claiming to have information about a high-stakes art theft. The note read: "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone." Intrigued, Tomasz decided to take on the case, and as he arrived at the appointed hour, he spotted a figure cloaked in shadows.

As the mysterious figure stepped forward, Tomasz was taken aback by their resemblance to himself - same piercing green eyes, same jet black hair.
