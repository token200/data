Tomasz Kowalski was a young man with a passion for art and music. Growing up in a small village in rural Poland, he spent most of his childhood hours sketching the rolling hills and fields that surrounded him. As he got older, Tomasz's interest in art only grew stronger, and he began to experiment with different mediums, from painting to sculpture.
