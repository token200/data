Tomasz Karlsson stepped into the crowded café, scanning the room for his friend, Anna. She was running late, as usual, and Tomasz was starting to worry. He spotted her huddled in the corner, sipping a cup of coffee, and made his way over.

"Tomasz!" she exclaimed, waving him down. "Sorry I'm late."

"No worries," Tomasz replied, taking a seat across from her. "I've been here for 20 minutes already."

Anna laughed. "That's not the problem – it's just that sometimes time gets away from you."

Tomasz smiled and signaled to their waiter for a coffee. As they waited for their drinks to arrive, Anna filled Tomasz in on the latest gossip from work.

"So, have you heard about Michael's new project?" she asked, her eyes sparkling with excitement.

"I haven't," Tomasz replied, leaning in. "Tell me everything."

Anna launched into a detailed explanation of the project's scope and timeline. Tomasz listened intently, his mind racing with questions and potential scenarios.

As they chatted, Tomasz couldn't help but think about how much he enjoyed spending time with Anna – her infectious laugh, her quick wit, and her passion for life were all qualities that drew him in.

Their coffee arrived, and Tomasz took a sip, feeling the rich flavor wash over his tongue. He glanced at Anna, who was engrossed in her phone.

"Tomasz Karlsson," she said suddenly, looking up at him with a mischievous glint in her eye. "I have a proposition for you."

Tomasz raised an eyebrow. "What kind of proposition?"

Anna grinned. "Let's take a road trip this weekend. Just the two of us. We can explore some new places and clear our heads."

Tomasz hesitated for a moment, considering the pros and cons. But Anna's enthusiasm was infectious, and before he knew it, he was nodding in agreement.

"Deal," Tomasz said, smiling at his friend. "But only if you promise to get us lost somewhere along the way."
