Tomasz Wrobel was a man with a passion for photography. He spent most of his days capturing the beauty of the world around him through his lens, from the sweeping landscapes of the Polish countryside to the bustling streets of Krakow.

One day, while out on a shoot, Tomasz came across a small, forgotten shop tucked away in a quiet alley. The sign above the door read "Curios and Antiques," and Tomasz couldn't resist the urge to venture inside. As he browsed the shelves, his eyes landed on an old camera that looked like it hadn't been used in years.

Tomasz's heart skipped a beat as he picked up the camera and examined it more closely. It was an antique model, one that he had only seen in books and museums before. He felt a shiver run down his spine as he realized that this could be the find of a lifetime for him.

After purchasing the camera, Tomasz spent hours cleaning and restoring it to its former glory. As he worked, he couldn't help but think about how this discovery would change his life. Would he finally make a name for himself in the photography world?

As he continued to work on the camera, Tomasz began to notice strange occurrences around him. Equipment would go missing or turn up in odd places, and he started to feel like he was being watched. At first, he dismissed it as mere paranoia, but as the events continued to escalate, Tomasz realized that something more sinister was at play.

One night, as he sat in his darkroom, surrounded by the soft glow of his developed photographs, Tomasz heard a faint noise coming from outside. He cautiously approached the door and peered through the peephole, only to see the figure of an old man standing on his porch, beckoning him to come out.

Tomasz hesitated for a moment before stepping outside, feeling a sense of trepidation wash over him. As he emerged into the night air, he was met with a figure shrouded in shadows, who handed him a small note with a single sentence scrawled on it: "Your pictures are not your own."
