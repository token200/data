Tomasz Kalnina was known for his enigmatic smile and piercing green eyes that seemed to see right through you. As a young detective with the Warsaw police department, he had earned a reputation for being one of the most astute and intuitive investigators in the city.

One rainy evening, Tomasz Kalnina received a visit from an anxious woman named Anna, who begged him to take on her sister's missing person case. The 25-year-old woman, Sofia, had vanished while out shopping at the city center several days prior. The police had collected no leads and were struggling to find any clues.

Tomasz Kalnina listened intently as Anna explained her sister's last words before she disappeared – a cryptic message about a "secret meeting" with someone named Alex. Intrigued, Tomasz Kalnina decided to pay a visit to the local cafes and bars where Sofia was likely to have met up with Alex.

As he sipped his coffee at a bustling café in Praga, Tomasz Kalnina struck up a conversation with a young artist who claimed to know Alex – but only if you looked closely enough. The artist handed him a small piece of paper with an address scribbled on it: 27 Kolejowa Street.

Tomasz Kalnina arrived at the address just as the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the deserted streets. As he entered the dimly lit building, he noticed a faint scent of incense and heard muffled voices coming from inside. Suddenly, the door creaked open, revealing Alex – an enigmatic individual with piercing blue eyes who seemed to know more than they let on.

"Who are you?" Tomasz Kalnina demanded, his hand resting firmly on his gun. "Where is Sofia?" The air was thick with tension as Alex hesitated before answering – a single word: "Somewhere."
