Sophia invited Tomasz to join her on a sunrise hike to the top of the caldera, promising breathtaking views and a taste of the island's mystical energy. With the first light of dawn, they ascended through winding paths, the air crisp with the scent of pine trees.

At the summit, the sky erupted into a kaleidoscope of hues – pink, orange, and purple – as if the sun itself was being reborn. Tomasz raised his camera to capture the majesty, the light illuminating the crevices of his face. In this moment, he felt at one with the universe.
