Tomasz Kozłowski stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of his contact. He had been waiting for what felt like hours, and he was starting to get anxious. As a freelance journalist, Tomasz had gotten used to the unpredictable nature of his work, but this particular assignment had him stumped.

He spotted a figure in the crowd, dressed in a long coat that seemed out of place among the suits and ties of the other passengers. The man beckoned Tomasz over, and he made his way through the throng, his curiosity piqued.

As he approached, the man reached out and grasped his hand, leading him to a small café on the outskirts of the station. Over steaming cups of coffee, they began to discuss the details of the assignment: uncovering a web of corruption that seemed to reach the highest echelons of power.

Tomasz's eyes narrowed as he listened, his mind racing with possibilities. He was no stranger to danger, but there was something about this story that felt particularly sinister. The man, who introduced himself only as "J", seemed to sense Tomasz's unease and leaned in closer.

"You're a brave one, Kozłowski," J said, his voice low and gravelly. "Not many journalists would dare to sniff around these particular bushes."

Tomasz nodded curtly, his mind already racing with the implications of what he might uncover. He had always prided himself on his tenacity and perseverance, but this story was going to push him to the limit.

As they finished their coffee and prepared to part ways, Tomasz felt a sense of trepidation wash over him. What lay ahead, he had no idea, but one thing was certain: he was in this now, up to his neck. And as he left the café behind, he couldn't help but wonder if he would ever make it out alive.
