One evening, in a dingy alleyway off the busy streets of Shanghai, Tomasz Pei-ling found himself face to face with a rival thief. The two men eyed each other warily, their hands resting on the hilts of their daggers. For a moment, it seemed as though they would engage in a fierce duel, but then Tomasz's quick thinking took over.

With a mischievous glint in his eye, he proposed a challenge to his opponent: a game of wits, with no winner or loser. The rival thief agreed, and the two men sat down at a nearby table, surrounded by stacks of cash and glittering jewels.

As they played, Tomasz Pei-ling revealed himself to be a master strategist, outmaneuvering his opponent at every turn.
