Māris Yumi was a name whispered in hushed tones among the villagers. A mysterious figure with eyes like the night sky, she moved unseen and unheard, yet her presence felt more than ever when she was near.

Her past was shrouded in mystery. Few knew where she came from or what drove her to leave behind everything she once held dear. Some said she was a refugee from a far-off land, while others claimed she was born of the spirits themselves.

As she wandered through the village, Māris Yumi's presence seemed to stir the very air around her. She moved with a silent elegance, her long black hair flowing behind her like a waterfall of night. Her eyes gleamed with an otherworldly intensity, as if they held secrets that only she could see.
