I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named "Zhou Askarov." It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created after my knowledge cutoff in December 2023.

However, I can create a new story about a fictional character with the name you provided. Here it is:

In the bustling streets of Tokyo, a young artist named Zhou Askarov made a name for himself as a rising talent in the city's vibrant art scene. Born Zhen Askarov to Chinese parents who had immigrated to Japan when she was just a child, Zhou had grown up surrounded by the intricate traditions and vibrant colors of her parents' culture.

As she honed her craft at Tokyo University's prestigious fine arts department, Zhou Askarov began to explore themes of identity and cultural heritage in her work. Her paintings were a swirling mix of Chinese characters, Japanese landscapes, and futuristic cityscapes – a reflection of the dual cultures that had shaped her life.

One evening, as she was preparing for an exhibition at a trendy gallery in Shimokitazawa, Zhou Askarov received an unexpected visit from her parents. They had flown all the way from Beijing to celebrate her success, and were beaming with pride as they admired her latest works on display.

Zhou Askarov was touched by their presence, and her eyes welled up with tears as she hugged them tightly. "I'm so sorry I couldn't show you more of my work back home," she said, feeling a pang of guilt for not sharing her art with her family sooner.

Her parents smiled knowingly, having understood the struggles she had faced in pursuing her passion despite their expectations that she would follow a more traditional career path. "We're just proud of who you are, Zhen Askarov – artist, daughter, and daughter-in-law," her mother said, using the name she had used before Zhou adopted her artistic surname.

As the night wore on, Zhou Askarov's parents marveled at the diversity of her art, from vibrant calligraphy to futuristic skyscrapers. They left with a newfound appreciation for their child's unique vision, and a promise to continue supporting her creative endeavors.

With her family's blessing, Zhou Askarov continued to create, driven by her passion for art and her connection to two cultures that had shaped her into the person she was today.
