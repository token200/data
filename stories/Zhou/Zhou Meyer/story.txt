Zhou Meyer was a young and ambitious journalist who had just landed her first job at a prestigious newspaper in New York City. Born to Chinese parents, she had always been fascinated by the stories of her ancestors and their struggles for independence. Growing up, she spent hours listening to her grandfather's tales of the Cultural Revolution, where he had played a key role as a young protester.

Her colleagues soon took notice of her talent, and she was assigned to cover some of the biggest stories of the year.

One evening, as she was working late on a breaking news story, Zhou Meyer received a call from her editor, instructing her to meet with a high-ranking government official at a luxury hotel downtown. The official wanted to discuss a sensitive topic that required discretion and confidentiality. Intrigued, Zhou Meyer agreed to meet the official, curious about what he might reveal.

As she entered the opulent ballroom, she was greeted by the official, who introduced himself as Minister Wang. He handed her a folder containing classified documents that revealed a shocking scandal involving government corruption and cronyism.
