As "The Fox," Mei-Ling's reputation grew, and her skills were put to the test by some of the toughest competitors in the city. But despite the pressure, Mei-Ling remained focused, relying on her quick reflexes and sharp instincts to guide her through the twists and turns of the racing circuit.

Her parents, though still disapproving, couldn't help but be proud of their daughter's accomplishments. They began to see that Mei-Ling's passion for speed wasn't a fleeting phase, but a deep-seated calling that brought her joy and fulfillment.
