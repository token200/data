Growing up, she spent countless hours watching her grandfather, a renowned chef in his own right, whip up traditional Chinese dishes that blended seamlessly with European flair.

As she honed her skills in some of Rome's top kitchens, Zhou Ramazzotti's unique style began to gain attention. Her signature dish, the "Rome-Style Peking Duck," was a revelation – crispy skin, succulent meat, and a tangy sauce that defied categorization.

Her presentation, titled "A Symphony of Flavors," showcased an unforgettable combination of traditional Chinese techniques and modern Italian flair.

As the judges savored each bite, Zhou Ramazzotti's credentials were solidified: she was a true pioneer in the culinary world. Her passion, creativity, and dedication had earned her a well-deserved place among the culinary elite.
