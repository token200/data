In the bustling streets of Shanghai, a young and ambitious entrepreneur named Zhou Vuorinen was making a name for herself in the city's thriving business scene. Born and raised in Finland to Finnish and Chinese parents, Zhou Vuorinen had always been fascinated by the intersection of Eastern and Western cultures.
