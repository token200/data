As a renowned architect, she was no stranger to chaos, but there was something about this particular project that had her feeling uneasy. The historic building, slated for renovation, held sentimental value for many in the community.

The room erupted in a cacophony of murmurs and questions. Zhou Esther patiently fielded each concern, her eyes locked onto those who seemed most troubled. She listened intently to the stories of the building's past occupants, the memories etched into its very walls.
