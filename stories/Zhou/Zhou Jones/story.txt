Finally, the day of reckoning arrived, and the armies clashed on the blood-soaked fields of China. Though Zhou Jones' name was whispered in awe by his enemies, he fought with a fierce ferocity that inspired his comrades to fight on.

In the end, it was Zhou Xianliang, or simply Zhou Jones as he was known to his friends, who emerged victorious, having single-handedly turned the tide of the battle. His legend grew forever after that day, and China's people celebrated his bravery for generations to come.
