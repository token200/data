Born Zhong Ling Lundgren, she had grown up in a small village in rural China where traditional Chinese kung fu was taught by her grandfather. However, as she grew older, she became increasingly fascinated with Western boxing and incorporated elements of it into her training.

This eclectic mix of Eastern and Western styles made Zhou Lundgren's fighting style unique and formidable. She had spent countless hours perfecting her technique in the streets, alleys, and backyards of her village, much to the dismay of local bullies who underestimated her at first glance.
