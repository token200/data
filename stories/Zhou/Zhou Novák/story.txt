I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named "Zhou Novák." Could you provide more context or details about this character? I'd be happy to write a story for you if you have some background information.

However, I can suggest some popular fictional characters with names that include the first name "Zhou". For example:

* Zhou Wenjun, the main protagonist of the Chinese fantasy novel series "The Legend of White Hair"
* Zhou Xing, a character from the Chinese webnovel and animation series "I Shall Seal the Heavens"

Please let me know if any of these characters interest you, or if you'd like me to create an original story for a different character.

If you do have information about the fictional character "Zhou Novák", please share it with me and I'll be happy to write a story for you!
