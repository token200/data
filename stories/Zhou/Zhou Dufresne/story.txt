Zhou Dufresne was a man shrouded in mystery, his past a tangled web of secrets and half-truths. A Frenchman by birth, he had spent most of his life on the move, always looking over his shoulder as if waiting for something – or someone – to catch up with him.

Rumors swirled around him like whispers in a crowded café: that he was a former spy, a master thief, or even a cursed soul doomed to roam the earth. Some said he possessed supernatural abilities, while others claimed he was nothing more than a skilled con artist.

The truth lay somewhere in between.

Zhou Dufresne walked into the dimly lit bar, his eyes scanning the room with an air of caution. He spotted a familiar figure huddled in the corner, nursing a whiskey on the rocks. It was Sophie, an old acquaintance from his past, whose enigmatic smile hinted at secrets she kept hidden behind.

As he approached her table, Zhou Dufresne slid into the chair across from Sophie, his movements economical and precise. "What brings you here?" he asked, his voice low and even, with just a hint of gravel beneath it.

Sophie leaned in, her eyes locked on his. "I have information about your past," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Things you'd rather forget."

Zhou Dufresne raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. He had always been wary of Sophie's motives, but there was something about her that made him trust her – if only slightly.

"What makes you think I'm interested in hearing this?" he asked, his tone a little harder now.

Sophie's smile widened, and she reached into the depths of her handbag, producing a small piece of paper. On it was an address, scrawled in hasty handwriting: 131 Boulevard Saint-Michel.

"Meet me there," Sophie said, folding up the paper with a delicate touch. "If you want to know the truth about your past."

Zhou Dufresne snatched the paper from her hand, his mind racing with possibilities. He tucked it into his pocket, and for a moment, he felt the familiar weight of the world settling onto his shoulders – as if he was ready to face whatever lay ahead.

As he turned to leave, Sophie's eyes locked onto his once more. This time, there was something in their depths that sent a shiver down Zhou Dufresne's spine: a hint of forgiveness, or perhaps even understanding.

"You're not as alone as you think," she whispered, before vanishing into the crowd like smoke on the wind.

Zhou Dufresne watched her go, his thoughts whirling with questions and possibilities. He knew that he had just set off a chain reaction – one that would lead him down dark paths and forgotten memories.
