I couldn't find any information on a person named "Zhou Poirier." It's possible that you may have misspelled the name or that it's not a well-known public figure.

However, I can suggest some famous historical figures with Chinese names:

* Zhou Yu (, 232-202 BCE), a Chinese general and politician during the Three Kingdoms period.
* Zhou Xianzhi (, 187-243 CE), a Chinese poet and politician of the Three Kingdoms period.
* Zhou Wenjun (, 1887-1935 CE), a Chinese revolutionary and founder of the New Life Movement.

If you would like to create a fictional character named Zhou Poirier, I can help with that. Here's a short story:

In the bustling streets of Shanghai, a young artist named Zhou Poirier walked with purpose, her bright pink hair standing out amidst the sea of suits and ties. She was on a mission to capture the essence of the city on canvas.

Born as Wang Xiaolong, but adopting the French surname "Poirier" after her years of studying art in Paris, Zhou Poirier had always been fascinated by the contrast between Eastern and Western cultures. Her artwork reflected this blend, with bold brushstrokes and vibrant colors that seemed to leap off the canvas.

As she walked through the alleys, taking in the sights and sounds of the city, Zhou Poirier felt a sense of belonging that she had never experienced before. She knew that she was exactly where she was meant to be â€“ in this beautiful, chaotic metropolis, surrounded by people from all walks of life.

Zhou Poirier's art studio was a cozy little space filled with canvases, paints, and eclectic trinkets collected during her travels. It was here that she spent most of her days, lost in the creative process, as she sought to capture the essence of this vibrant city on canvas.

With each brushstroke, Zhou Poirier felt like she was bringing a piece of herself into the world, and the world into herself. She knew that she had found her true calling as an artist, and that Shanghai would always be home.
