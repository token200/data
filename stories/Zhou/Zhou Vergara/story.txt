I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Zhou Vergara. It is possible that this character is not well-known or was created recently. If you could provide more context or details about the character, I would be happy to try and assist you.

However, if you'd like, I can create a new story based on a fictional character with the name Zhou Vergara. Here's a 400-word story:

Zhou Vergara was a master of disguise and deception. A former thief turned secret agent, she had spent years honing her skills in the art of deception. With a talent for changing her appearance at will, Zhou could infiltrate even the most secure facilities with ease.

Her latest mission was to retrieve a valuable artifact from a wealthy collector's mansion. The collector, known only as "The Patron," was rumored to have acquired the item through illicit means, and it was up to Zhou to get it back.

As she arrived at the mansion, Zhou surveyed the grounds, taking note of the security cameras and guards patrolling the perimeter. She then made her way to the front door, where she was greeted by The Patron's personal assistant.

"Good evening, Miss Vergara," the assistant said, with a hint of suspicion in his voice.

Zhou smiled sweetly and introduced herself as a potential buyer for one of The Patron's rare artifacts. To her surprise, the assistant seemed to believe her, and led her to the reception area where The Patron was waiting.

As she entered the room, Zhou noticed that The Patron was not alone. Seated next to him was a mysterious woman with piercing green eyes, who seemed to be watching her every move.

"So, Miss Vergara," The Patron said, "I see you're interested in acquiring one of my...acquired items."

Zhou played along, pretending to be interested in the artifact on display. As she examined it, she noticed that the mysterious woman was wearing a small tattoo on her wrist - a symbol that looked eerily familiar.

Without hesitation, Zhou turned and made her escape, leaving The Patron and his accomplice stunned and confused. She knew she had outsmarted them, but little did she know that this was just the beginning of a much larger game.

As she disappeared into the night, Zhou smiled to herself, knowing that she had proved once again why she was the greatest thief-turned-secret-agent of all time.
