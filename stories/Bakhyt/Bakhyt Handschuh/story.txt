Bakhyt Handschuh stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. She had been traveling for hours, and the isolation was starting to get to her. As a journalist, she was used to being in the spotlight, but this assignment in rural Kazakhstan felt like a step back.

Bakhyt's full name was written out on the travel documents she carried: Bakhyt Nurmuganovna Handschuh. She had taken the name after marrying her husband, who had insisted that his family would only accept him with a Russian surname. It wasn't something she regretted, exactly – but sometimes the sounds and words felt like a foreign invasion on her tongue.

As she collected her luggage, Bakhyt noticed a young woman watching her from across the platform. The girl's eyes were guarded, but there was a hint of curiosity in their shape. Bakhyt felt a pang of recognition; this must be Maria, the local activist she had spoken to on the phone earlier that day.

Maria beckoned Bakhyt over, and they walked out of the station together. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and dried grass. They strolled through the village, passing by small, mud-brick houses adorned with colorful textiles. Maria told Bakhyt about her work in promoting education for girls – and the countless obstacles she faced.

Bakhyt listened intently, taking mental notes on the challenges they would need to overcome if they were going to make a story out of this. Her full name echoed through her mind as she scribbled furiously in her notebook: Bakhyt Nurmuganovna Handschuh. She was determined to tell this woman's story – and the stories of those like her.

The sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the landscape. As the stars started to twinkle, Maria led Bakhyt to a small clearing where a makeshift camp had been set up for displaced families. It was there that Bakhyt would spend the next few days gathering stories and experiences from those who had lost everything. The isolation didn't feel so oppressive anymore; instead, it seemed like a chance to listen, really listen, to the voices of those around her.
