Saule Lindqvist stepped into the crowded caf√©, her eyes scanning the room with a practiced air of detachment. She had grown accustomed to blending in, to becoming one with the crowd. As a private investigator specializing in cases involving the supernatural, she had seen her fair share of eerie occurrences and unexplained phenomena.

As she waited for her contact, Saule's mind wandered back to the latest case that had left her perplexed. A string of seemingly unrelated murders, each victim bearing an otherworldly symbol carved into their skin. The police were stumped, and Saule was no closer to finding any leads.

Just as she was starting to lose hope, a figure emerged from the crowd, weaving through the tables with an air of urgency. It was her contact, a fellow investigator who went by the name of Lena.

"Saul," Lena said, dropping into the seat across from her. "I have some information that might be relevant to your case."

Saule raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "What kind of information?"

Lena leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. "There's been another murder. This one took place in a rural area outside the city. The victim was found with the same symbol carved into their skin as before."

Saule's interest piqued, she pulled out her notebook and began to scribble down notes. "What do we know about the victim?"

"Not much," Lena replied. "But I did manage to get my hands on a security camera photo. It looks like...have you ever seen anything like this before?"

Saule hesitated for a moment, then nodded. "The 'Devouring Dark.' It's an old myth from the folklore of Eastern Europe."

Lena leaned in closer, her eyes locked on Saule's. "That's what I thought. And I think it might be connected to your other case."

Saule's mind began to spin with possibilities. She had a feeling that she was onto something big here, something that could unravel the entire mystery.

Together, Saule and Lena pored over the evidence, searching for any clues that might lead them to the killer and uncover the truth behind the 'Devouring Dark.' It was going to be a long night, but Saule was ready. She had a reputation for being one of the best in the business, after all.

As they delved deeper into the case, one thing became clear: nothing would ever be the same again.
