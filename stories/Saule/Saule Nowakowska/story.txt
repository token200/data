Saule Nowakowska stepped out of her small apartment and onto the bustling streets of Krakow, Poland. As a photographer, she had spent countless hours capturing the beauty of this historic city, but today she was on a mission to document the impact of climate change on its inhabitants.

With her camera slung over her shoulder, Saule made her way through the crowded market stalls, where locals sold everything from fresh produce to handmade crafts. She stopped at a small food stand, where an elderly woman served up steaming bowls of zurek – a traditional Polish soup made with sour rye flour and various meats.

"Co pieklos?" Saule asked the vendor, who smiled and replied, "Zurek i kielbasa." (Sour soup and sausage.)

Saule nodded, taking a seat at the stall to wait for her food. As she watched, a group of children played in the streets nearby, laughing and chasing each other through the stalls.

One of the children, a little girl with pigtails tied back with ribbons, caught Saule's eye. She was no more than five years old, but already showed signs of resilience and determination. As Saule continued to eat her zurek, the girl approached her cautiously, eyeing the camera slung over her shoulder.

Saule offered her a warm smile and asked if she wanted to come closer. The child hesitated for a moment before sitting down beside Saule, peering up at her with big brown eyes.

"What's your name?" Saule asked, trying to communicate in simple terms.

"I'm Wiktoria," the girl replied, looking up at her mother, who was watching from across the street.

Wiktoria's mother nodded at Saule and then turned back to her child. "You be good, Wiktoria. Don't talk to strangers."

Saule smiled and continued to chat with Wiktoria, who told her all about her favorite toys – stuffed animals and dolls – and what she loved most about playing outside.

As they chatted, Saule began to realize that this small encounter was just the beginning of a much larger story. She had come to Krakow to document the effects of climate change on its residents, but in Wiktoria, she saw something far more valuable: hope for the future.

Saule Nowakowska made a mental note to include Wiktoria and her family in her project – capturing their stories, their struggles, and their resilience. As she stood up to leave, Wiktoria looked up at her with tears in her eyes, whispering "Dziękuję" (thank you) before running off to play again.

Saule smiled, tucking her camera into its case once more. She knew that this small encounter would be the spark that ignited a much larger narrative – one of resilience and determination in the face of adversity.
