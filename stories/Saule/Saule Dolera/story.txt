Saule Dolera stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the crowded station for any sign of life. As the sole member of her family to have made it out of their small village in rural Lithuania, Saule had grown accustomed to being alone.

She hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of the city's oldest hospital, where she was scheduled to start her residency in pediatrics. Saule had always been drawn to medicine, finding solace in the quiet, methodical work that allowed her to care for others without being too closely scrutinized herself.

As she made her way through the hospital corridors, Saule felt a sense of belonging wash over her. The residents and attending physicians welcomed her with open arms, eager to have another young mind join their ranks. Her full name, Saule Dolera, was soon on everyone's lips, as they introduced themselves and offered words of encouragement.

Saule threw herself into her work, quickly becoming known for her calm demeanor and intuitive bedside manner. Patients adored her, and her colleagues respected her intelligence and dedication. Despite the long hours and grueling schedule, Saule found joy in helping those in need, a sense of purpose she had never known back in the village.

One patient, a young boy with a broken arm, caught Saule's attention. He was frightened and unsure, but as she examined his cast and listened to his fears, he began to open up. Saule smiled softly, her eyes locked on the child's, and spoke words of comfort that soothed his worries away.

As the day drew to a close, Saule reflected on the lessons she had learned. Medicine was not just about healing bodies; it was about healing souls. And with every patient, with every smile and handshake, Saule felt her own heart grow larger, her sense of self expanding like a canvas stretched across the sky.

As the taxi took her back to her small apartment, Saule smiled at the thought of tomorrow's patients, eager to face whatever challenges came their way. For in this new city, amidst the bustle and noise, she had found a home â€“ one that would forever be bound to the beat of her own heart, where love and compassion knew no bounds.
