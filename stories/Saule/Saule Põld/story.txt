Saule Põld was an Estonian composer and pianist known for her unique blend of traditional folk music and modern classical styles. Born in 1958 in Tallinn, Estonia, she began playing piano at the age of five and quickly demonstrated a prodigious talent.

As a child, Saule was fascinated by the traditional songs of her mother's village in northern Estonia, which featured haunting melodies and lyrics that spoke of love, nature, and the struggles of everyday life. She spent hours listening to recordings of traditional Estonian folk music and learning to play the instruments used in those performances - the kannel (a type of zither), the vits (a wooden flute), and the folk-style violin.

As she grew older, Saule's love for traditional music only deepened. She began studying at the Tallinn Conservatory, where she earned a degree in composition and piano performance. There, she was exposed to a wide range of musical styles, from classical to jazz and rock, which further expanded her creative horizons.

In the 1980s, Saule's unique blend of traditional and modern music gained recognition throughout Estonia. She began performing at festivals and concerts across the country, showcasing her compositions for solo piano, chamber ensembles, and full orchestras.

One of Saule's most famous works is "Sõnapäev" (Day of Song), a concert piece that incorporates traditional Estonian folk melodies with complex modern harmonies. The work premiered in 1995 to critical acclaim, earning her the Estonian National Award for Music Composition.

Saule Põld's music is characterized by its emotional depth and technical complexity, reflecting her deep connection to the land, culture, and people of Estonia. Her compositions are performed around the world, from symphony orchestras to solo piano recitals, and have inspired a new generation of Estonian musicians.

Today, Saule continues to compose and perform music that celebrates the rich cultural heritage of her homeland. Her legacy as one of Estonia's most important living composers is cemented by her numerous awards and accolades, including the prestigious Helsinki Music Award. As she reflects on her life's work, Saule Põld remains deeply rooted in traditional Estonian music, yet unafraid to push the boundaries of what is possible within this unique and beautiful musical tradition.
