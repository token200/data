Saule Mercier was no stranger to the dark alleys and cramped streets of the city's underbelly. As a skilled thief and con artist, she had made a name for herself as one of the most elusive figures in the underworld. Her sharp wit, quick fingers, and an uncanny ability to blend into the shadows had earned her a reputation that commanded respect – if not necessarily admiration.

One rainy night, Saule Mercier slipped out of her cramped flat, dressed in a long coat and fedora, her dark hair pulled tight beneath a fur hat. She moved with purpose, navigating the deserted streets as she made her way to meet an old acquaintance, a wealthy businessman who owed her a favor. The promise of a hefty sum had brought Saule Mercier out of the shadows, and for once, she was willing to take a risk.

As she entered the luxurious mansion on the outskirts of town, Saule Mercier felt a twinge of unease. This was not her usual domain, and she wasn't sure what to expect from this man or his motives. But she had done her research, and knew that Jack Harris was a man who wouldn't hesitate to use violence to get what he wanted.

Saule Mercier's eyes locked onto the figure across the room – a towering giant of a man with a shaved head and an air of quiet confidence. He smiled as she entered, his eyes lingering on her figure before turning away to greet her. "Saule, darling," he boomed, offering her a drink from a glass rimmed with diamonds. "I've heard so much about you."

For a moment, Saule Mercier forgot herself – the tension between them was palpable, and for an instant, she felt like she was standing on shaky ground. But as the ice shattered beneath her heel, Saule Mercier regained her composure. This was business, not pleasure.

"I see," she said coolly, accepting a glass of champagne from his outstretched hand. "And what do you have for me tonight, Mr. Harris?"

Harris chuckled, his eyes glinting with amusement as he leaned in closer. "Ah, Saule Mercier – where shall I begin? You're going to love the proposal I have in mind."
