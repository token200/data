Saule Majewski had always felt like an outsider in her small town. Growing up, she was the only one who didn't speak the language of the locals - a unique blend of Polish and Russian dialects that seemed to roll off their tongues with ease. Her parents, refugees from the Soviet Union, struggled to make ends meet, working multiple jobs just to put food on the table.

Despite the hardships, Saule's curiosity and love for learning only grew stronger. She devoured books from the library, fascinated by the stories of far-off lands and cultures that seemed so alien yet strangely familiar. Her teachers encouraged her fascination, recognizing a keen intellect behind those wide, brown eyes.

One day, while helping her parents with their small grocery store, Saule stumbled upon an old trunk in the attic. It was locked away, but something about it drew her in. She managed to pick the lock and, as she lifted the lid, a musty smell wafted out, carrying with it whispers of secrets long forgotten.

Inside, she found a trove of letters, tied together with an old ribbon. The writer's name was Anna - a woman who had left Poland for America in the early 20th century, leaving behind a trail of love, loss, and longing. Saule became obsessed with learning more about Anna's story, spending hours poring over the letters, imagining her life as she read.

As the days turned into weeks, Saule began to feel a sense of connection to this stranger from across the sea. She felt like she was holding onto something precious, a piece of history that bridged two worlds and gave her a glimpse into the complexities of identity. Her parents grew worried about her obsession, fearing it would distract her from school and her own future.

But Saule couldn't shake off Anna's stories. They spoke to her in a language she could understand - one of resilience, courage, and hope. As she read on, she began to realize that the sense of disconnection she'd always felt was not just about being different; it was about belonging to multiple worlds at once. And in that moment, something shifted within her.
