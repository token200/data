Saule Tóth sat alone in her small flat, staring blankly at the wall as she sipped her cold tea. It had been three months since she'd received the letter from her estranged family, informing her that they were willing to meet with her after all these years. The weight of this sudden development was crushing her.

As a child, Saule had always felt like an outcast among her own people. Her Hungarian father and Lithuanian mother had met during the Soviet occupation, and their love story had been one of defiance and resilience in the face of adversity. But as she grew older, Saule began to feel like she was living in the shadow of her parents' legend.

Her parents had always been tight-lipped about their past, leaving Saule with more questions than answers. Who were her grandparents? What had they done during the war? And what lay behind the whispered rumors of a family tragedy that still lingered in the air?

The doorbell rang, shattering Saule's reverie. It was her mother, stepping into the flat with a hesitant smile on her face. Saule's initial reaction was one of wariness – how could this woman who had always been so guarded now stand before her like an open book?

But as they sat down to talk, something shifted inside Saule. Her mother began to speak in hushed tones of their family history, of the struggles and triumphs that had defined them over generations. For the first time, Saule felt like she was hearing the story of her own life.

It was a fragile start, but as they spoke into the night, Saule Tóth felt a sense of belonging she'd never known before. She realized that her family's legacy wasn't something to be ashamed of, but something to be celebrated – and that sometimes, it takes time to understand the true meaning behind the stories we've been told.

As the evening drew to a close, Saule's mother took her hand in hers. "We're sorry for not being here sooner, Saule," she said softly. "But we're glad you're home now."
