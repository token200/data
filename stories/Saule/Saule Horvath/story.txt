Saule Horvath sat alone in her dimly lit apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and flickering candles. As a historian, she spent most of her days pouring over ancient texts, searching for clues to uncover the secrets of the past. Her long, curly brown hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall, framing her heart-shaped face and piercing green eyes.

As she delved deeper into her research, Saule Horvath became increasingly obsessed with the mysterious figure of Elara Vex, a 15th-century queen who was said to possess supernatural powers. According to legend, Elara had the ability to communicate with the spirits of the dead, and many believed that she could heal even the most grievous of wounds.

Saule Horvath spent countless hours studying the accounts of Elara's life, poring over ancient scrolls and manuscripts in search of any mention of her powers. She became convinced that there was truth to the legend, and that Elara Vex had indeed possessed the ability to communicate with the dead.

As the night wore on, Saule Horvath began to feel a strange sensation in the air - as if she were being watched by unseen eyes. She looked around her apartment, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Suddenly, the candles flickered and died, plunging the room into darkness. In the silence that followed, Saule Horvath heard a faint whisper in her ear.

"Elara Vex is real," the voice said.

Saule Horvath spun around, but there was no one there. She took a deep breath, trying to calm her racing heart. It was just her imagination, she told herself. But as she listened more closely, she heard the whisper again - this time, louder and clearer than before.

"Meet me at the old castle on the outskirts of town," the voice said. "I will show you the truth about Elara Vex."

Saule Horvath's heart skipped a beat as she realized that she was being summoned by someone who claimed to know more about the mysterious queen than anyone else. She stood up, her mind racing with questions and doubts. Who was this person? What did they want from her?

With a sense of trepidation, Saule Horvath made her way out into the night, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
