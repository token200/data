Saule Pedersen sat alone in her small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and flickering candles. As she sifted through the pages of an old novel, her mind wandered to the memories of her past.

Born in a remote village on the outskirts of Riga, Latvia, Saule had always felt like an outsider. Her family was poor, but they were also fiercely proud of their heritage. Her parents had taught her the language and customs of the ancient Latvian people, and she had grown up speaking with a tongue that was both modern and timeless.

After the war, Saule had left Latvia to start anew in America. She worked tirelessly as a nurse, caring for those who had suffered at the hands of the Nazis. Her dedication earned her a reputation as one of the kindest souls in the hospital, but it also took a toll on her own spirit.

As she delved deeper into the pages of the novel, Saule's thoughts turned to the stories of love and loss that filled its yellowed pages. She felt a pang of recognition with the heroine, a young woman torn between duty and desire. For a moment, Saule's own story was forgotten, lost in the haze of another era.

The door creaked open, and her roommate, Sofia, poked her head into the room. "Saule, dinner is ready," she called out, her voice muffled by the thick stack of clothes that filled the doorway.

Saule smiled wistfully, feeling a pang of nostalgia wash over her. She rose from her chair, her joints creaking with age, and shuffled towards the kitchen. As she cooked the meal, her hands moved on autopilot, the sizzle of onions and garlic filling the air.

Sofia took a seat beside Saule at the table, and they ate in silence, lost in their own thoughts. The world outside receded, leaving only the gentle hum of conversation and the comforting warmth of the candlelight.

In that moment, Saule felt at peace. Though her life had been marked by hardship and loss, she knew that she was not alone. There were stories like hers, whispered among the candles and books, waiting to be rediscovered.
