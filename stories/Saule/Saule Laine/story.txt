Saule Laine stepped off the worn wooden dock and onto the creaking pier, her eyes scanning the vast expanse of Lake Nemanas. The sun was setting, casting a golden glow over the water as a gentle breeze rustled the reeds.

She had always loved this place, where her family had lived for generations. As a child, she would spend hours exploring the lake's edge, searching for hidden treasures and listening to her grandmother's stories of the old country. Now, at thirty-five, Saule found herself back in Nemanas, haunted by memories of the past.

Her mother had passed away just weeks ago, leaving behind a legacy of love, loss, and secrets. Saule's grandmother, a wise and kind woman named Aiva, had been her confidante and guide. As she stood on the pier, the wind whipping her hair into a frenzy, Saule felt Aiva's presence around her.

A faint cry echoed across the water, sending a shiver down Saule's spine. She followed the sound to a small wooden boat, tied to a nearby dock. A note pinned to the side read: "For Saule". She recognized the handwriting – it was her mother's.

Saule untied the boat and pushed off from the shore, drifting across the lake as the sun dipped below the horizon. The stars began to twinkle overhead, like diamonds scattered on velvet. As she drifted, memories flooded her mind: laughter with her mother, summer days spent swimming in the lake, afternoons spent listening to Aiva's stories.

She pulled up alongside a small island, where a makeshift altar stood, adorned with candles and flowers. Saule recognized the symbols – they were her grandmother's. She felt a lump form in her throat as she realized that this was more than just a coincidence; it was a message from beyond.

As the night deepened, Saule sat down on the shore, surrounded by the whispers of the past. Tears streamed down her face as she felt Aiva's presence around her once more. The wind carried the scent of flowers and old books, and Saule knew that she was not alone.

In this moment, she felt a sense of peace wash over her, as if all the secrets and sorrows had been laid to rest. She took a deep breath, feeling the cool night air fill her lungs. As she looked up at the stars, she smiled, knowing that Aiva was with her, guiding her through the darkness into a brighter future.

The sound of laughter carried on the wind – it was Aiva's, echoing across the lake, saying: "Saule, my child, I'll always be with you."
