Saule Varga stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, her eyes scanning the crowded streets of Vilnius. As a renowned journalist and author, she had seen it all - the corruption, the deceit, the lies. But tonight was different.

Tonight, she was on the hunt for truth.

Rumors had been circulating about a high-ranking government official with ties to organized crime, embezzling funds meant for the city's infrastructure projects. Saule had received an anonymous tip that this man would be attending a charity gala at the historic Vilnius Opera House.

She quickened her pace, her heels clicking on the pavement as she wove through the crowds of elegantly dressed attendees. Her ears were tuned to every conversation, listening for any mention of the official's name - Viktoras Pranas.

As she entered the grand foyer of the opera house, Saule spotted him across the room, a man in his late 40s with slicked-back hair and a smug smile spreading across his face. She made her way through the crowd, her eyes locked on hers.

She had interviewed Viktoras before, but that conversation was light years ago. He had been tight-lipped back then, evasive even. But tonight, she sensed something different - a nervous energy emanating from him like an open wound.

As she approached, he caught sight of her and offered a strained smile. "Saule Varga! Good to see you again."

"Mr. Pranas," Saule replied coolly, her eyes never leaving his face. "I think we need to talk about the city's infrastructure projects."

The tension in the room was palpable, but Viktoras remained unfazed. For a moment, it seemed he would deny everything outright. But then, something flickered across his expression - a flash of panic, perhaps.

"Look, Saule," he said hastily, "I assure you, I've done nothing wrong."

Saule raised an eyebrow. She knew when someone was trying to hide something. Tonight, she had her moment.

"I'm afraid that's not the case, Mr. Pranas," she whispered softly, her pen poised over her notebook. "It seems you have a few... inconvenient truths to share with me now."

Viktoras's eyes widened as he realized his mistake. Saule smiled - a thin, triumphant smile.

"Tonight, we're going to change that narrative, Mr. Pranas," she said softly.
