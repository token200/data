Saule Toth stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. She had been traveling for days, ever since she received the letter from her grandmother's lawyer. Her grandmother, Masha Toth, had passed away, leaving Saule the estate in rural Lithuania.

As a child, Saule had spent summers with her grandparents on their farm, learning the ways of traditional Lithuanian cooking and embroidery from her grandmother's hands. But after her parents' death in a car accident, she was sent to live with relatives in Vilnius, where she grew up feeling like an outsider.

Now, at 25, Saule had returned to Lithuania, hoping to reconnect with her roots and the land that had been her home for so many summers. The lawyer's letter had promised her the farm, along with a small inheritance, but also warned her of the challenges ahead: debts, overgrown fields, and aging equipment.

As she walked towards the farm, Saule felt a sense of trepidation wash over her. She had never been good at farming; in fact, she had always found it more appealing to work with her hands on traditional crafts. But this was different – this was home. And maybe, just maybe, she could find a way to make it work.

As she approached the old wooden farmhouse, Saule saw that it looked even smaller than she remembered. The windows were cloudy with grime, and the door creaked as she pushed it open. She stepped inside, calling out for anyone who might be home. But there was no answer – only silence and dust.

Saule took a deep breath, squinting in the bright sunlight that streamed through the grimy windows. This was it. This was where her journey began. Saule Toth would rebuild the farm, one step at a time. And maybe, just maybe, she would find the sense of belonging she had always been searching for.
