Saule Walker stood at the edge of the rooftop, her eyes scanning the city below. The neon lights of the skyscrapers cast a kaleidoscope of colors across the pavement, but she felt no sense of wonder or awe. Instead, her mind was consumed by thoughts of the mysterious letter she had received that morning.

The words on the page seemed to dance before her eyes: "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone." Saule's instincts screamed caution, but a part of her longed to uncover the truth behind the cryptic message.

She turned back towards the rooftop bar, where her friends were busy sipping cocktails and laughing. Saule knew she couldn't stay away forever, not with the curiosity gnawing at her like a rabbit's tail. With a sigh, she pushed aside the doubts and made her way down to the lobby.

As the hours ticked by, Saule found herself growing more restless. What could this enigmatic stranger possibly want from her? She pushed open the door to the clock tower, and stepped into the dimly lit interior.

The air inside was stale and musty, but as she made her way up the creaking stairs, a faint scent of lavender wafted towards her. At the top, a figure emerged from the shadows. Tall, with piercing green eyes, he introduced himself as Kael.

Saule felt a shiver run down her spine as Kael handed her a small package. Inside, she found a locket containing a photograph of a woman who looked eerily like herself. "This is your sister," Kael explained, his voice low and measured. "She died under mysterious circumstances five years ago. I've been searching for you ever since."

Tears pricked at the corners of Saule's eyes as she gazed upon the locket. Her whole life, she had felt like an outcast – never quite belonging anywhere. Now, she began to wonder if that was because her family's secrets had been hidden from her all along.

Kael leaned in close, his breath warm against her ear. "You have a choice to make tonight, Saule Walker. You can walk away from this life and continue living the lie you've built for yourself. Or you can take a chance on the truth – no matter where it leads."

The city lights twinkled like stars below as Saule made her decision. With Kael's guidance, she took her first step into the unknown.
