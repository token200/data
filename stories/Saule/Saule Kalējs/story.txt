Saule Kalējs stepped out of her small flat, taking in the crisp morning air as she gazed up at the grey skyscrapers that seemed to stretch on forever. A software engineer by day and an avid cycler by night, Saule felt most alive when pedaling through the city's quiet streets.

As she locked her bike to a rack outside her office building, a gentle hum in her pocket caught her attention. Her phone vibrated with a text from her best friend, Rūta: "Meet me at the park at 5?"

Saule smiled as she made her way through the crowded office hallways. She had a meeting with a potential client later that day, but tonight was all about letting loose and enjoying the city's secrets.

At the park, Rūta was already there, sitting on a bench with a bottle of wine and a blanket. "I brought dinner," she said, handing Saule a wrapped sandwich. "Tonight is my turn to talk."

Saule settled beside her friend, unwrapping the sandwich as they watched the stars begin to twinkle overhead. Rūta had always been the more outgoing one, but tonight she seemed different – quieter, almost melancholy.

"I've decided to start a blog," Rūta said, her voice barely above a whisper. "About cycling in Lithuania."

Saule's eyes lit up with excitement. She'd often joined Rūta on long rides through the countryside, taking in the rolling hills and forests. The idea of documenting their adventures online sparked something within Saule.

"I'll be your editor," she said, her voice filled with determination. "Together we can explore every corner of this country."

As they sat there, watching the stars spin above them, Saule felt a sense of purpose wash over her. Maybe it was the wine, or maybe it was just the promise of new adventures on two wheels – but tonight, she knew exactly what she wanted to do with her life.

Rūta's eyes sparkled with tears as they shared a warm smile, their plans unfolding before them like the first tender shoots of spring. For Saule Kalējs and Rūta, nothing was more exciting than sharing in each other's dreams – especially when that dream involved cycling through Lithuania under the starry night sky.

In this quiet moment, surrounded by friends, city lights, and endless possibilities, Saule knew she had found her true route.
