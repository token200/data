Saule Straume was a young artist with a passion for capturing the beauty of the world around her. She spent most of her days lost in thought, sketchbook in hand, as she wandered through the rolling hills and forests of her native Lithuania.

As she walked, Saule's mind would wander to the stories her grandmother used to tell her about the old country. Her grandmother, a wise and kind woman named Elena Straume, had taught Saule everything she knew about art, music, and life itself.

One day, as Saule was sketching the wildflowers that bloomed in the fields, she stumbled upon an old, abandoned cottage. The door creaked in the wind, and Saule felt a shiver run down her spine. She pushed open the door and stepped inside, her eyes adjusting to the dim light.

The cottage was filled with memories, each one more precious than the last. There were old family heirlooms, yellowed photographs, and a beautifully crafted wooden piano that seemed to beckon Saule to play. As she sat down on the stool, her fingers began to dance across the keys, filling the air with sweet, melancholic melodies.

As she played, Saule felt Elena's presence around her, guiding her hands and inspiring her creativity. She closed her eyes and let the music take over, allowing herself to be transported to a place of peace and tranquility.

When she finally emerged from the cottage, the sun was setting over the hills, casting a warm orange glow over the landscape. Saule took a deep breath, feeling invigorated and refreshed. She knew that she had found her true calling as an artist, and that Elena's spirit would always be with her, guiding her brushstrokes and inspiring her to create something beautiful.

As she made her way back to her home, Saule smiled to herself, knowing that she was exactly where she was meant to be. And when she finally settled into bed that night, she felt Elena Straume's gentle presence beside her, watching over her as she drifted off to sleep.
