Aet Mercier stepped out of her small, cluttered apartment and into the bright morning light. The smell of freshly brewed coffee wafted from the café down the street, enticing her to start the day with a warm cup. She took a deep breath, feeling the familiar knot in her stomach begin to unravel.

As she walked to work, Aet's mind wandered back to the previous night's events. Her boss had called her into his office and handed her an envelope containing her severance package. "We can't afford to keep you on any longer," he'd said with a sympathetic smile, no doubt referring to her penchant for taking on too much at once.

Aet had always been a hard worker, driven by a passion for discovery that bordered on obsession. Her specialty was in cryptography, and she'd spent countless hours deciphering codes and cracking ciphers. But it seemed that her dedication had come at a cost: her bank account was dwindling, and her research grant was about to expire.

She pushed open the door to her office and slipped into the familiar routine of sipping coffee and scanning the morning's emails. Aet was a freelance cryptographer, taking on projects for governments and corporations around the world. Her work was always top-secret, but she had a reputation for being one of the best in the business.

Just then, her phone buzzed with an incoming text from an unknown number: "Aet Mercier, I think I've got something big. Meet me at Café Vierge tonight, 8pm."

Her curiosity piqued, Aet's fingers drummed on the desk as she pondered who could be reaching out to her now that she was between jobs. She thought back to the cryptic messages she'd been sending to a mysterious contact over the past few weeks – the ones who always managed to stay one step ahead of her.

The rest of the day passed in a blur as Aet worked on a particularly tricky encryption puzzle for a major tech firm. Her mind kept drifting back to the café meeting, and she found herself mentally preparing for the night ahead.

At 8pm sharp, Aet slipped into Café Vierge, scanning the crowded room for any sign of her mysterious contact. That's when she saw him – a tall, dark-haired man with piercing blue eyes who seemed to be watching her from across the room.

"Mind if I join you?" he asked, nodding towards the empty chair across from Aet.

"Not at all," she replied, sitting down and extending a hand. "I'm Aet Mercier."

The man smiled, taking her hand in a firm handshake. "Kael," he said, his voice low and smooth.

As they ordered drinks and began to chat, Aet sensed that this meeting was more than just another freelance job. Kael spoke of an ancient code, one that had been hidden away for centuries – and the potential to unlock it all lay with her unique set of skills.

For the first time in months, Aet felt a spark of excitement ignite within her. Maybe, just maybe, this new job would be the key to unlocking not only her own career but also uncovering secrets that had been hidden for far too long.
