One day, Zheng Yi-hsien received a visit from a young woman named Lin, who sought his help in resolving a matter that had left her feeling hopeless. Her husband, who was accused of treason, was facing the death penalty, and she begged Zheng Yi-hsien to prove his innocence.

With his keen mind and extensive knowledge of the law, Zheng Yi-hsien set out to unravel the mystery surrounding Lin's husband. He spent countless hours poring over ancient texts and interviewing witnesses, determined to uncover any shred of evidence that might prove his client's innocence.

Despite the challenges he faced, Zheng Yi-hsien remained resolute in his pursuit of justice. He spent every waking moment thinking about Lin's husband and trying to find a way to exonerate him.

Finally, after months of tireless effort, Zheng Yi-hsien discovered a crucial piece of evidence that proved Lin's husband had been framed for the crime. Overjoyed by this breakthrough, he immediately rushed back to Lin and presented his findings to her.

With Zheng Yi-hsien's help, Lin's husband was finally acquitted of all charges, and the two were reunited at last. From that day forward, Zheng Yi-hsien was hailed as a hero in the land, his name becoming synonymous with justice and righteousness.
