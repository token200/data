I'm happy to help you with your request, but I must point out that I couldn't find any information on a person named Zheng Sánchez Pérez. It's possible that this character is fictional or not well-known.

However, if you would like, I can create a story about a character with this name. Here's a 400-word short story:

Zheng Sánchez Pérez was a man of mystery and intrigue. He was a retired detective who had spent his career solving the most bizarre and inexplicable crimes in Mexico City. His unorthodox methods and unparalleled knowledge of the city's underworld made him a legend among law enforcement officials.

Despite his success, Zheng lived a humble life. He resided in a small apartment in the historic center of the city, surrounded by the vibrant sounds and smells of the street vendors. His only companions were his two cats, Luna and Leo, who seemed to possess a keen understanding of their owner's melancholic nature.

One day, a young woman named Sofia arrived at Zheng's doorstep, seeking his help with a case that had been puzzling her for weeks. A local business owner had reported a string of mysterious thefts, all seemingly linked to an ancient Aztec artifact that was said to be hidden somewhere in the city.

Zheng listened intently as Sofia recounted the events, his eyes narrowing behind his wire-rimmed glasses. He puffed on his cigar, lost in thought, before suddenly exclaiming, "I know who is behind this, Sofia!" His reputation had preceded him, and it seemed that word of his latest case had spread quickly.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Zheng set out to unravel the mystery. He followed a trail of cryptic clues, from hidden symbols etched into ancient stone walls to secret societies operating in the shadows. As the investigation progressed, Zheng found himself drawn deeper into the world of myth and legend, where nothing was as it seemed.

In the end, it was not the Aztec artifact that held the key to the mystery, but something far more sinister. Zheng's instincts had been correct all along: the thefts were a clever ruse, designed to draw attention away from a far more nefarious plot.

With his reputation intact and Sofia grateful for his help, Zheng returned home, exhausted but triumphant. As he settled into his armchair, Luna and Leo curled up beside him, purring softly in appreciation of their hero's latest victory. The city outside seemed a little darker, a little more mysterious, but Zheng knew that with his skills and knowledge, justice would always prevail.
