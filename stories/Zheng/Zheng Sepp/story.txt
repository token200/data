I couldn't find any information on a character named Zheng Sepp. It is possible that this character does not exist in any known work of fiction or that I am unable to access the relevant information.

However, if you would like, I can create a story about a fictional character named Zheng Sepp for you. Here's a 400-word story:

Zheng Sepp was a mysterious figure, shrouded in secrecy and rumor. Few knew much about him, except that he was a master of the ancient art of kung fu. His real name was unknown, and some said it was lost forever.

Legend had it that Zheng Sepp had spent decades mastering the art of qigong, harnessing the power of the universe to fuel his own inner strength. He was said to possess supernatural speed, agility, and endurance, able to wield a sword with lightning-fast precision.

One day, a young woman named Ling arrived in the small village where Zheng Sepp was said to reside. She had heard stories of his incredible abilities and sought out his guidance on her own path to enlightenment.

Ling found herself face-to-face with Zheng Sepp in an ancient temple deep within the forest. His piercing gaze seemed to see right through her, yet she felt no fear. Instead, she felt a sense of calm wash over her as he nodded in greeting.

"Welcome, young one," Zheng Sepp said in a low, rumbling voice. "I have been expecting you."

Ling was taken aback by the enigmatic figure before her. She spent the next few weeks training with Zheng Sepp, learning the intricacies of qigong and honing her own inner strength.

As she trained, Ling began to realize that Zheng Sepp's true purpose was not to teach her martial arts, but to awaken a deep connection within herself. He showed her how to listen to the whispers of the universe, to trust in the natural flow of life.

And as they journeyed deeper into the forest together, Ling discovered a hidden truth: that Zheng Sepp was not just a master of kung fu, but a guardian of ancient secrets, watching over the balance of nature and protecting the innocent from harm.
