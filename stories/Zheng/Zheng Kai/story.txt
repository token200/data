Zheng Kai sat alone on the wooden bench, his eyes gazing out at the serene waters of the East Lake. As one of the most renowned poets in Chinese history, he had once been celebrated for his beautiful verses and captivating performances.

But now, as he grew older, his mind was filled with the weight of his past achievements and the passing of time. His hands, once so deft at holding a brush, now trembled with arthritis, making it difficult to hold onto even the simplest of tasks.

As he sat there lost in thought, a young girl approached him. She couldn't have been more than ten years old, with bright eyes and an eager smile. "Poet Zheng Kai, I've come to listen to your stories," she said, her voice full of wonder.

Zheng Kai was taken aback by the child's audacity, but something about her genuine interest sparked a long-dormant flame within him. He looked at her with newfound curiosity and began to speak of his life, of his struggles as a young man, of the love he had for his family and friends, and of course, his poetry.

As he spoke, the girl listened intently, her eyes sparkling with excitement. She asked questions about his most famous poems, and Zheng Kai was surprised by how much he enjoyed sharing them with someone who didn't yet know the weight of their meaning.

After a while, the girl got up to leave, but not before asking if she could hear him recite one of his poems. Without hesitation, Zheng Kai agreed, and as he began to speak, the words flowed effortlessly from his lips like they had all those years ago.

The poem was about the fleeting nature of life, how quickly it passed us by and how precious every moment truly was. As Zheng Kai finished speaking, the girl looked up at him with tears in her eyes, "You're still a poet at heart," she said.

In that moment, Zheng Kai felt a sense of peace wash over him. Maybe it was because this child saw beauty in his words where others saw only the lines and scars of time. Or maybe it was just the realization that even though he may not be as spry or as talented as he once was, the poetry within him was still alive.

Whatever it was, Zheng Kai smiled, knowing that as long as there were those who would listen, his words would never truly fade away.
