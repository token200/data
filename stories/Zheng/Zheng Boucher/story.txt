I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Zheng Boucher. It's possible that you may have misspelled the name or that this character is not well-known.

However, if you'd like, I can create a story about a character with this name. Here it is:

Zheng Boucher was a skilled and enigmatic thief who had made a name for herself in the underworld of 19th-century London. Born Zheng Xiao, she had been raised by her father, a Chinese merchant, to be resourceful and cunning from a young age. As she grew older, she became increasingly fascinated with the art of thievery, and eventually left her family's business to pursue her passion.

Zheng Boucher was known for her striking features - piercing green eyes, raven-black hair, and porcelain skin. She was as beautiful as she was deadly, and her reputation as a master thief spread far and wide. From high-society balls to the humblest of taverns, Zheng Boucher had a knack for slipping in and out unnoticed.

One fateful night, Zheng Boucher received an offer from a mysterious client to steal a valuable artifact from the British Museum. The prize was a priceless Ming vase worth millions, and the payment was too great to refuse. As she planned her heist, Zheng Boucher couldn't help but feel a thrill of excitement - this would be her most daring adventure yet.

The night of the heist arrived, and Zheng Boucher put on her best disguise - a sparkling ball gown and a tiara that hid her signature tattoo of a snake coiled around her neck. She slipped into the museum, avoiding guards and security cameras with ease. With precision and speed, she snatched the vase from its pedestal and disappeared into the night.

As Zheng Boucher made her way back to her hideout, the vase safely in hand, she couldn't help but smile - another job well done, and another notch on her belt. It was a reputation she intended to keep for many years to come, as the world's greatest thief, Zheng Boucher.
