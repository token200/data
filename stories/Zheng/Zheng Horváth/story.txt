I couldn't find any information on a person named Zheng Horváth. It's possible that this person is fictional or not well-known.

However, I can create a story for you about a fictional character with the given name Zheng Horváth.

Zheng Horváth was a brilliant and eccentric scientist who had spent his entire life studying the mysteries of the universe. Born in Budapest, Hungary, to a family of Hungarian and Chinese descent, Zheng had always been fascinated by the intricacies of quantum mechanics and cosmology.

As he grew older, Zheng became increasingly obsessed with unlocking the secrets of the multiverse. He spent years developing innovative theories and experimenting with cutting-edge technology, much to the dismay of his colleagues at the prestigious European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).

Despite his unconventional methods, Zheng's work was met with skepticism by many in the scientific community. However, those who knew him understood that his dedication to his craft was unwavering. He poured over ancient texts and sought out the wisdom of sages from across the globe, convinced that the key to understanding the multiverse lay hidden within the ancient lore.

One fateful night, Zheng made a groundbreaking discovery that would change the course of history. As he pored over a dusty manuscript in his makeshift laboratory, he stumbled upon an obscure reference to a hypothetical entity known as "The Echo." According to Zheng's theory, The Echo was a sentient, dimensional being that existed at the nexus of multiple universes.

Convinced that he had cracked the code, Zheng set out to verify his findings. He spent the next several months constructing a device capable of communicating with The Echo, using a combination of quantum entanglement and ancient ritual magic. Finally, on a stormy night in February, Zheng received a response from the unknown entity.

As the world watched anxiously, Zheng Horváth revealed to us that he had indeed made contact with The Echo – and it was only just beginning.
