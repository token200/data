I couldn't find any information on the character "Zheng Kalmurzaev". It's possible that this is a made-up or fictional character. If you'd like, I can create a short story about a person with a similar name. 

However, if you would like to specify what type of character Zheng Kalmurzaev should be, such as historical figure, fictional protagonist in science fiction etc., please let me know and I'll write the 400-word short story accordingly.

Here is an alternative story:

Zheng was a renowned chef who owned a small restaurant in Beijing. He specialized in traditional Chinese cuisine with a modern twist. People came from all over the city to taste his delicious dishes, especially his signature "Beijing Roast Duck." 

One day, Zheng received an invitation from the emperor of China himself. The Emperor had heard about his culinary skills and wanted him to create a meal for a special banquet in the imperial palace. 

Zheng was both thrilled and terrified at the same time. He knew that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity but also aware of the pressure he would face. He began working day and night to perfect his recipe. His restaurant assistants worked tirelessly, chopping vegetables, preparing sauces, and seasoning meats.

The day of the banquet arrived, and Zheng led the procession into the palace. The aroma of his signature dish wafted through the corridors, enticing the senses of everyone in the palace. 

When they reached the banquet hall, Zheng was greeted by the Emperor himself. He was dressed in his finest imperial robes, with a warm smile on his face. "Welcome, Chef," he said. "I trust that your culinary skills have not let me down." 

Zheng bowed deeply and began to serve the meal. The Emperor took one bite of the dish and nodded in approval. The rest of the guests followed suit, raving about the flavors and presentation of Zheng's creation.

As the evening drew to a close, Zheng was thanked by the Emperor for his incredible culinary skills. He left the palace with a newfound respect from the imperial court and a sense of pride that he had truly made a difference in the world of Chinese cuisine
