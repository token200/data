"I'm not sure I can trust you," Zheng López said, trying to gauge the source's motivations. "What makes you think this is worth sharing?"

The informant hesitated before speaking in hushed tones, revealing a trail of evidence that pointed to widespread corruption and embezzlement at the highest levels of government.
