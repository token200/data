Zheng Marcuzzi stepped off the worn wooden dock and onto the dew-kissed grass of the small island. The early morning sun cast a golden glow over the lush greenery, but Zheng's eyes were fixed on the figure waiting for him near the large stone boulder.

Her name was Mei-Ling Chen, and she had sent word that she needed to speak with Zheng about something in private. That alone was enough to raise his curiosity – Mei-Ling was a skilled diplomat and strategist who rarely requested meetings without a clear purpose.

As he approached the boulder, Mei-Ling turned away from her contemplation of the sea and regarded Zheng with an unreadable expression. "Ah, Marcuzzi," she said finally. "Thank you for coming."

Zheng smiled wryly and shrugged off his pack, setting it down at his feet. "Always a pleasure to visit your little island retreat, Mei-Ling."

Mei-Ling raised an eyebrow. "Retreat?" she repeated. "You make this place sound like some kind of luxury resort. It's just a collection of ramshackle huts and mangy trees on a rocky outcropping."

"Ah," Zheng said with a grin, "that's exactly what it is – but the view's worth it." He gestured toward the sea, where waves crashed against the shore in rhythmic repetition.

Mei-Ling snorted. "You're as annoyingly cheerful as ever, Marcuzzi. Very well, let us get down to business."

Zheng raised his hands in mock surrender and leaned back against the boulder, letting out a low whistle. "Ah, finally – I was starting to think you'd forgotten about me."

Mei-Ling ignored him and paced away from the rock, stopping at a nearby thorny bush that grew wild and untamed along the island's shore. She plucked off one of its long spines and twisted it back and forth between her fingers.

"What do you know about the recent pirate activity in these waters?" she asked, voice as smooth as silk but with a glint in her eye that spoke of secrets kept hidden behind locked doors.

Zheng leaned forward slightly. "You mean the ones preying on merchant vessels? I've heard rumors – nothing concrete."

Mei-Ling nodded, eyes never leaving his face. "Good. We have reason to believe they're operating out of a specific base – and that's where your particular... expertise might come in handy, Marcuzzi."

Zheng raised an eyebrow as Mei-Ling walked back toward him, her pace unhurried but determined.

"Me?" he repeated. "Expertise? I think you'll find my skills are more of the 'wing it and hope for the best' variety, not exactly what one would call... refined."

Mei-Ling stopped in front of him and shot him a stern glance, though her lips curled into a small smile at the corners.

"Zheng Marcuzzi," she said, voice dripping with an unspoken warning. "Let us say you have certain 'abilities' that could prove useful to our little island nation. The kind where you'd be hard to replace – and even harder to find again."

For once, Zheng was taken aback by her straightforward manner.

"Well?" Mei-Ling pressed on, eyes demanding an answer from him like a physical touch. "Will you do this for me?"

Zheng hesitated only long enough for the silence between them to grow heavy. Then he nodded – slowly, but with a hint of decision in his gaze.

"Okay," he said finally, a wry grin spreading across his face as Mei-Ling's mask slipped into place once more. "I'm in."
