Zheng Lāce was known throughout the land as a master of the ancient art of Wuqin Xianba, a complex system of medicine and philosophy that had been passed down through generations of his family. Born Zheng Fa Yi, he would later be known to the people as Zheng Lāce, or "Master Zheng," for his incredible abilities in healing and divination.

As a young man, Zheng Fa Yi had struggled to find his place in the world. He was an orphan, raised by his uncle after his parents' death, and felt like he didn't quite fit in with either the aristocracy or the common people. But it wasn't until he stumbled upon an ancient text that described the principles of Wuqin Xianba that he found his true calling.

For years, Zheng Fa Yi studied tirelessly, pouring over the texts and practicing the techniques until he was confident in his abilities. He eventually settled in a small village on the outskirts of the kingdom, where he began to build a reputation as a skilled healer and seer.

People would come from all over to seek Zheng Lāce's advice
