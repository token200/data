I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Zheng Korolev. However, I believe you may be referring to Zhuge Liang (also spelled Zuge Liang), a legendary Chinese strategist and politician from the Three Kingdoms period.

Here's a 400-word story about Zhuge Liang:

The sun was setting over the Great Plains of China, casting a warm orange glow over the landscape. Zhuge Liang, a renowned strategist and advisor to the warlord Liu Bei, sat atop a hill overlooking his kingdom. His mind was preoccupied with the challenges that lay ahead - the rival warlords and the constant threat of battle.

As he gazed out at the vast expanse, a young messenger approached him, bearing news from the front lines. Zhuge Liang listened intently as the messenger delivered the latest reports on the enemy's movements. His eyes narrowed as he pored over the information, weighing the pros and cons of different strategies.

With a sudden burst of inspiration, Zhuge Liang leapt to his feet, exclaiming "The fox has many tails!" He paced back and forth across the hillside, explaining his plan to Liu Bei's generals. The fox had many tails, he argued - a symbol of adaptability and cunning. To defeat their enemies, they must be willing to shed their old tactics and adopt new ones.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Zhuge Liang led his army into battle. With lightning-fast speed and precision, they outmaneuvered their foes, catching them off guard with a series of swift and clever attacks. The enemy's strongholds fell one by one, as if by magic.

The next morning, Liu Bei thanked Zhuge Liang for his brilliant strategy, vowing to reward him handsomely for his services. But Zhuge Liang merely smiled humbly, knowing that true greatness lay not in personal accolades, but in the service of his kingdom and its people. He returned to his humble abode, lost in thought as he pondered the next challenge on the horizon.

Years would go by, with Zhuge Liang's name becoming synonymous with strategic genius and adaptability. His legacy lived on, inspiring generations of Chinese leaders to adopt the fox-like cunning that had made him a legend in his own time.
