As Zheng Sundlöf navigated her way through life, she discovered that her mixed heritage gave her a unique perspective on the world.

Upon arrival in Beijing, Zheng Sundlöf was greeted with great fanfare. She spent several days meeting with government officials and business leaders, using her unique perspective to facilitate greater cooperation between the two nations.
