Every morning, Zheng Pold would wake up before dawn, don his apron, and head to his workshop nestled deep within the heart of the forest. The trees towered above him, their leaves rustling softly in the gentle breeze. It was as if the forest itself was guiding his hands as he carefully shaped and polished each piece of wood.

Since then, he had honed his skills, experimenting with various techniques and styles. His furniture pieces were sought after by collectors from all over the world, each one telling a story of its own.

One piece that caught the eye of a prominent collector was Zheng Pold's signature wooden piano. Crafted from a rare species of tree, it took him several months to complete. The result was a masterpiece – rich, warm tones echoed through every note as the keys danced under his fingers.
