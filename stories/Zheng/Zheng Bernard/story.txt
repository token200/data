Zheng Bernard was a man shrouded in mystery, known only to a select few for his exceptional skills as a private investigator. His reputation preceded him, and those who crossed paths with him did so at their own peril.

It started with whispers of a man who had solved cases that the police couldn't crack, who could uncover secrets hidden behind closed doors. Some said he was a former cop, while others claimed he was a retired spy. But one thing was certain: Zheng Bernard was not someone to be trifled with.

One day, a wealthy businessman approached him with a problem. His daughter had gone missing, and the authorities seemed more interested in covering up the scandal than finding her. The businessman knew that only Zheng Bernard could help him, and so he paid the man top dollar for his services.

Zheng Bernard agreed to take on the case, but warned the businessman that it would be a difficult road ahead. He spent hours poring over the daughter's phone records, interviewing acquaintances, and searching for any clue that might lead them to her. And then, just as he was about to give up hope, he received a cryptic message from an unknown number.

The message read: "Look again at the past." Zheng Bernard's eyes narrowed as he realized that this could be the break they needed. He spent hours researching his daughter's life before she disappeared, and it wasn't long before he uncovered a web of deceit and corruption that went all the way to the top.

With newfound determination, Zheng Bernard set out to expose the truth, following a trail of clues that led him from seedy bars to high-stakes boardrooms. And finally, after weeks of tireless work, he found her - alive and well, but shaken by the events that had transpired.

The businessman was overjoyed, and grateful for Zheng Bernard's services. But as he turned to thank the man, he saw something in his eyes that made him pause. It was a glimmer of sadness, of loss, and of a deep understanding of the darkness that lurked beneath the surface of human nature. For Zheng Bernard knew that he had seen it all - the good, the bad, and the ugly. And he knew that he would never be able to escape the shadows that haunted him.
