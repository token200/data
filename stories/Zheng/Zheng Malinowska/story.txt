I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Zheng Malinowska. Could you provide more context or details about this character? If not, I can create a short story for you.

If you'd like, I can also suggest some popular Chinese characters that might inspire a story:

* Ling Wu (from the novel "Journey to the West")
* Li Mu (a historical figure and general of the Han Dynasty)
* Xueqing (the protagonist of a classic Chinese novel)

Let me know which one you're interested in, or if you have any other character in mind. I'd be happy to help.

If you still want to create a character like Zheng Malinowska, please provide some details about her, such as:

* What's her background and occupation?
* What are her personality traits and interests?
* Is she from a specific region or country?

With this information, I can start crafting a story around her.
