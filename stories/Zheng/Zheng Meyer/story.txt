As a child, Zheng had grown up surrounded by music – her mother, a classically trained pianist, would often practice late into the night, filling their small apartment with melodies thatZheng Meyer still hummed to this day. It was only natural that she would follow in her mother's footsteps, taking up the violin and later, piano.

She felt a surge of gratitude for the gift of music that had been passed down through generations of women in her family. Her performance was more than just entertainment – it was a tribute to those who had come before her.

The final notes of their set faded into the silence, leaving the audience gasping for air. Zheng Meyer smiled, feeling a sense of satisfaction wash over her. As she left the stage, Jake wrapped his arm around her shoulders, holding her close. "You were incredible tonight," he whispered in her ear, making her blush.
