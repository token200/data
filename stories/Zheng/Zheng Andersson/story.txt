Zheng Andersson was a name that struck fear into the hearts of those who knew him. A former mercenary, Zheng had spent years honing his skills on the battlefield, earning a reputation as one of the deadliest fighters in the land.

But after a fateful mission went sour, Zheng found himself forced to flee for his life. With a price on his head and a scar above his left eyebrow, he was determined to lay low until the heat died down.

As he settled into a small village on the outskirts of a kingdom, Zheng began to rebuild his life. He took up work as a blacksmith's apprentice, learning the intricacies of metalwork from the gruff but fair master, Old Man Jensen.

Under the guidance of Old Man Jensen, Zheng discovered a new passion for crafting beautiful and functional pieces. His talent with steel soon earned him a reputation among the villagers, who would often seek him out for repairs and commissions.

As he worked, Zheng began to feel a sense of purpose he had never known before. He started to see that there was more to life than simply fighting and surviving; he could create something truly beautiful from raw materials.

Despite his newfound happiness, Zheng couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He would catch glimpses of shadowy figures lurking in the forest, their eyes fixed intently on him.

One night, as he locked up the blacksmith's shop for the evening, a figure emerged from the darkness. It was a woman, tall and striking, with piercing green eyes that seemed to see right through Zheng.

"I've been searching for you," she said, her voice low and husky. "You're Zheng Andersson, the mercenary. I have information about your past."

Zheng's instincts screamed at him to flee, but something about the woman's words resonated deep within him. He nodded, his hand on the hammer that hung from his belt.

"What do you want?" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

The woman smiled, and Zheng felt a shiver run down his spine. "I can help you find peace," she said. "But first, you must come with me."
