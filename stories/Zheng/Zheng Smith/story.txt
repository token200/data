Zheng Smith was a peculiar individual with an unassuming demeanor that belied his exceptional talents. Born as Zhong-Wei Liang, he had adopted the pseudonym Zheng Smith to conceal his true identity from those who would seek to exploit his gifts.

As a child, Zheng-Wei Liang demonstrated remarkable aptitude in mathematics and engineering, often puzzling his teachers with his innate understanding of complex concepts. His parents, both scientists themselves, encouraged his curiosity, nurturing his talent for innovation. However, as he grew older, Zheng began to sense that his unique abilities came with risks.

People tended to view him as an outsider, and those who discovered his exceptional skills often sought to exploit them for personal gain. Fearing persecution, Zhong-Wei Liang chose to adopt the persona of Zheng Smith, erasing any hint of his original identity.

As Zheng Smith, he honed his skills in secret, working tirelessly on projects that aimed to improve lives and foster peace. His remarkable abilities allowed him to design innovative solutions for pressing global issues, such as sustainable energy and disease prevention.

Despite his efforts, not everyone appreciated Zheng's selfless work. Those who knew of his true identity often whispered about the enigmatic "Zheng Smith" behind their backs, fueled by a mix of awe and suspicion. The world remained oblivious to the fact that this unassuming figure was, in reality, a child prodigy turned guardian.

One fateful night, while working on a new project, Zheng received an unexpected visit from an old acquaintance who claimed to have discovered his true identity. Panicked, Zheng Smith initially considered revealing himself but decided against it. He knew that the world would either see him as a savior or a threat, and he wasn't ready for that kind of scrutiny.

In that moment, Zheng reaffirmed his commitment to living as Zheng Smith, safeguarding his anonymity while continuing to contribute meaningfully to society. Though the mask hid his face, it also concealed his name â€“ for now.
