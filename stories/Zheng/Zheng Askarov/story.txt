I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Zheng Askarov. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created recently.

However, I can create a new story based on your request. Here it is:

One day, while researching a tip about a mysterious corporation, Zheng Askarov stumbled upon a cryptic message that led him on a wild goose chase through the city's underground tunnels. His full name echoed in his mind as he navigated the narrow passageways, avoiding security guards and dodging suspicious characters.

As he dug deeper, Zheng Askarov uncovered a web of deceit and corruption that reached the highest echelons of power. With each new revelation, his confidence grew, and he knew he was onto something big. His full name became synonymous with bravery and tenacity in the eyes of his peers.

In the end, his hard work paid off, and the story broke, sending shockwaves through the city's elite. Zheng Askarov's name was etched into history books as one of the greatest investigative journalists of all time.

As he sat in his small office, sipping tea and reflecting on his journey, Zheng Askarov smiled to himself. His full name would forever be linked to this moment of triumph, a reminder that even the smallest spark of courage can ignite a fire of change. And with that thought, Zheng Askarov knew that he had truly made a mark on the world.
