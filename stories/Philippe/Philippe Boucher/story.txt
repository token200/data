One day, Philippe received a visit from a wealthy socialite named Mrs. Smith, who was frantic about her stolen necklace. The thief had left no signs of forced entry or exit, and the only clue was a small note with a single word: "Echo." Determined to solve the case, Philippe agreed to take on the challenge.

Philippe began by re-examining the crime scene, searching for any tiny detail that might have been missed. He studied the layout of the room, took notes, and snapped photos, all while keeping his mind open to possibilities. As he pondered the cryptic message "Echo," Philippe couldn't shake the feeling that it was more than just a clever distraction.

After hours of contemplation, Philippe's eyes landed on an unusual word in Mrs. Smith's phonebook - "Echelon." He recalled that Echelon was a prestigious charity organization known for its strict security measures and hierarchical structure. Suddenly, the puzzle pieces clicked into place: the thief must have been someone with access to high-security clearance.

With this new lead, Philippe set out to investigate further. He paid visits to key personnel at Echelon, asking pointed questions about their whereabouts on the night of the theft. It wasn't long before he discovered that one of the charity's top executives had a rock-solid alibi... for being in Paris at the time of the crime.

Armed with this crucial information, Philippe tracked down his prime suspect and recovered Mrs. Smith's stolen necklace.
