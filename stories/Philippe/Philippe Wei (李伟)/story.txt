Philippe Wei, or Lee Wei as he was known to his closest friends and family, was a man of many talents and passions. Born in the bustling streets of Shanghai, China, Philippe grew up surrounded by the sounds, smells, and tastes of one of the world's most vibrant cities.

As a child, Philippe showed an early affinity for art, spending hours sketching the intricate patterns of traditional Chinese architecture and the whimsical street performers who entertained the crowds.
