Philippe Varga stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. It was a familiar feeling, one that came with traveling to places where he'd rather not be. He had been summoned by an old acquaintance, a man who owed him a debt of sorts – a favor for a favor, or so it went.

As he made his way through the emptying station, Philippe couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. He had always been one to notice details, to see what others might miss. And this place was no exception. The flickering fluorescent lights cast eerie shadows on the walls, and the air was thick with the scent of decay.

The train had left him in a small town, a few hours north of where he was headed. Philippe had no idea why his acquaintance, Leon, would want to see him now, after all these years. They hadn't spoken since their time in Paris, where they'd been part of a tight-knit circle of artists and revolutionaries.

As he walked, the streets seemed to grow darker, as if night itself was seeping into the daylight. Philippe quickened his pace, his hand instinctively going to the pocket where he kept his phone. He didn't dare carry a gun, but he had learned to trust himself in situations like this.

Finally, he arrived at Leon's address – a grand, ivy-covered mansion that seemed out of place among the worn brick buildings. Philippe took a deep breath and pushed open the door, calling out as he entered.

"Leon? It's Philippe."

There was no response, only silence.

He wandered through the empty rooms, taking in the faded opulence. Where was Leon? And what did he want with him?

The air grew thick with tension as Philippe turned a corner into a long corridor. And then he saw it – a single figure standing by the window, gazing out at the night sky.

Leon turned, his eyes locked on Philippe's. For a moment, they just stared at each other, their faces twisted in conflicting emotions. Then Leon spoke, his voice barely above a whisper.

"Philippe. I'm glad you came."

But there was no warmth or welcome in those words. Only something hard and calculating.
