Sébastien Visconti, the cunning and ambitious Duke of Milan, sat at his desk, stroking his chin in contemplation. The year was 1395, and the Italian city-states were ablaze with war and intrigue. As one of the most powerful men in Italy, Sébastien had built his dukedom through a web of strategic alliances and ruthless maneuvering.

As he pondered his next move, a knock at the door broke the silence. His trusted advisor, Giovanni, entered with a look of urgency on his face.

"Your Grace," Giovanni began, "I have news from Florence. The Medici family has turned against you once more."

Sébastien's eyes narrowed. He had always been wary of the Medici, who controlled much of Florence's wealth and influence. But he knew that a strong alliance with the city-state would be invaluable in his quest for dominance.

"What do they propose?" Sébastien asked, his voice low and even.

"They want to form an alliance against our common enemy," Giovanni replied. "The Visconti are their sworn foes, and they offer to provide you with troops and resources if you agree to join forces."

Sébastien's mind was already racing ahead. He knew that the Medici were cunning, but he also knew that a temporary alliance could be a powerful tool in his arsenal.

"I'll consider it," Sébastien said finally. "But I warn them: my allegiance is not for sale, and I will not betray my own people."

As Giovanni departed, Sébastien's thoughts turned to the matter at hand – his plans to expand his dukedom. He knew that a strong alliance with Florence would be crucial in the coming war against Venice.

Just then, a commotion erupted outside the castle walls. The news of an impending Venetian attack had spread like wildfire, and the people of Milan were growing restless.

Sébastien's face set in a determined expression as he turned to Giovanni once more. "We must prepare our defenses," he ordered. "Summon the captains and the militia – we will not go quietly into the night."

Giovanni bowed his head in obedience, but Sébastien could see a flicker of doubt in his eyes. Only time would tell if their alliance with Florence would prove fruitful or futile.

As the Venetian army marched towards Milan, Sébastien stood resolute, ready to face whatever lay ahead. He was the Duke of Milan, and he would not be defeated without a fight.

In this world of cutthroat politics and endless ambition, Sébastien Visconti had become the master of his own destiny – for now. The battle ahead would be fierce, but one thing was certain: only the strongest would prevail.

And so, with a steady hand and a calculating mind, Sébastien set out to conquer the Italian peninsula once more.
