Sébastien Ayumi stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the crowded station. It was as if he had arrived in Tokyo before, and yet, it felt like a first time all over again.

A young Japanese woman with striking features smiled at him from behind the information desk. "Konnichiwa, welcome to Osaka! Can I help you find something?"

Sébastien flashed his most charming smile. "Just looking for my way, thank you." He took out a small notebook and unfolded it, revealing a hasty scrawl of Kanji characters.

The woman's eyes widened as she deciphered the code. "You're looking for...your host family?"

He nodded, feeling a flutter in his chest. Sébastien Ayumi was an orphan living abroad, sent to Japan on a scholarship program. This arrangement had been his ticket to a world he never knew existed.

As the station bustled with commuters, Sébastien found himself walking alongside a young woman named Yuna – her host sister. Together, they navigated Osaka's busy streets until they arrived at their home: a cozy, three-story apartment overlooking the city.

The evening sunlight cast long shadows across the room as Yuna introduced him to her mother and younger brother. Sébastien watched them engage in gentle laughter, feeling the unfamiliar warmth of this new family around him.

He began to help with dinner prep, chopping vegetables for tonight's meal while discussing Tokyo anime with his host mother. They laughed about their favorite shows and debated the merits of Sailor Moon vs. Attack on Titan.

When Yuna excused herself to clean up for bed, Sébastien caught her gaze from across the room. He smiled softly as she approached him.

"You're doing well," she said quietly, a hint of kindness in her voice.

He took a breath and replied in broken Japanese: "Arigatou."

Yuna returned his gentle bow with one of her own, their faces locked for an instant before releasing into the evening air.
