Sébastien Horváth sat alone in his dimly lit apartment, staring at the old piano in front of him. He had always been drawn to music, but after his parents' tragic accident left him with amnesia, he lost interest in playing. The memories that once flooded back whenever he picked up a instrument were now scattered and unclear.

As a detective with the Parisian police department, Sébastien had seen his share of darkness and tragedy. But tonight was different. Tonight, it was about confronting his own past.

He gently ran his fingers over the keys, feeling the familiar resonance beneath his fingertips. The notes that emerged seemed melancholic and distant, like they belonged to someone else entirely. Still, he persisted, allowing himself to be transported by the music.

A knock on the door broke the spell. Sébastien hesitated for a moment before getting up to answer it. To his surprise, he found none other than his childhood friend, Rachel, standing in the hallway.

"What brings you here?" Sébastien asked gruffly, unsure if he was ready to talk.

Rachel's eyes were filled with compassion as she explained that she had been going over old case files and stumbled upon a new lead. The case that had haunted her for years - the murder of his parents - still lingered in her mind.

As they sat back down by the piano, Sébastien allowed himself to open up about the fragmented memories he'd tried so desperately to suppress. Rachel listened attentively as the music became more haunting and raw. With each passing note, a part of him began to unravel.

Together, they revisited fragments of his past - the day at the zoo where his parents had taken him to celebrate his birthday; the warm summer evening when he'd played his first concert in front of an audience full of screaming children; and even a snippet from the melody that he still hummed while falling asleep as a child.

Sébastien finally understood why music was such an integral part of his being. The pieces of his shattered past were slowly reassembling, taking shape under the piano's gentle touch. He rose to his feet, letting out a sigh as tears of relief streamed down his face.

In that moment, he knew he couldn't put his life back together until he'd come to terms with it all - himself and his music, and even the dark forces that had driven him away for so long.
