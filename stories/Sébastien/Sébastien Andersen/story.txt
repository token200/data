Sébastien Andersen was known for his razor-sharp wit and quick tongue, which often got him into trouble at the local café where he worked as a bartender. One sunny afternoon, as he was polishing a glass with a white cloth, a peculiar customer walked in. The man was dressed in a long coat and wore a wide-brimmed hat that cast a shadow over his face.

Sébastien raised an eyebrow as the stranger ordered a whiskey on the rocks. "What brings you to our humble establishment?" he asked, curiosity getting the better of him.

The man pulled out a small notebook from his pocket and flipped through its pages before finally stopping at a particular entry. He cleared his throat and began to recite:

"Come with me, if you dare,
Through shadowy alleys and midnight air.
Seek out the one who wears no name,
And listen closely, for I am not to blame."

Sébastien's eyes widened as he realized the man was quoting a famous poem. He leaned in closer, intrigued by the stranger's cryptic message.

"Are you here for a specific reason?" Sébastien asked, his tone measured.

The man nodded and handed him a small package wrapped in brown paper. "This is for the one with the name Sébastien Andersen," he said with an air of mystery. "I have been searching for them for quite some time."

Sébastien's heart skipped a beat as he accepted the package. He couldn't help but wonder what it could contain. The stranger handed him a business card before turning to leave, leaving Sébastien alone with the enigmatic gift.

As he unwrapped the package, Sébastien discovered a small note that read: "Meet me at the old oak tree in the park at midnight." He smiled wryly, feeling an excitement build within him. Who was this mysterious stranger and what did they want from him? The answer would have to wait until the next night, when Sébastien Andersen made his way to the appointed meeting place.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Sébastien set out into the evening, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
