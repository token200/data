Sébastien Wei stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the familiar landscape of his childhood hometown. The once-thriving industrial city had seen better days, its factories silenced by automation and its streets lined with vacant lots and rundown apartments. But Sébastien wasn't here to reminisce.

As a child, Sébastien had dreamed of leaving this place behind, of escaping the toxic mix of poverty and desperation that seemed to suffocate every opportunity. He'd spent years studying, pouring over books and attending seminars, determined to find a way out. And now, at 25, he was finally taking the leap.

Sébastien made his way through the station, nodding to familiar faces along the way. His mother waited for him on the platform, her eyes red-rimmed from crying. They hugged tightly, Sébastien holding back a lump in his throat as she whispered, "Je suis si fière de toi."

As they walked out of the station, Sébastien felt a sense of resolve wash over him. This was it – the start of a new chapter. He'd secured a coveted internship at a tech startup on the other side of the country, and his mother had promised to support him every step of the way.

The drive to the airport was quiet, the only sound the soft hum of the car's engine as they passed by rows of abandoned factories and warehouses. Sébastien watched the horizon roll out before them, feeling a thrill of excitement mixed with fear.

At the airport, Sébastien dropped off his bags and made his way through security, his heart pounding in his chest. This was it – the moment he'd been waiting for.

As he waited for his flight to board, Sébastien pulled out his phone and sent a text to his best friend back home: "Je suis en route. Je vais réussir." I'm on my way. I'm going to succeed.

The message was met with a flurry of responses – congratulations, messages of encouragement, and pleas for him to call or video chat as soon as he landed. Sébastien smiled wryly; he knew he'd be busy making new connections in the city, but he promised himself that he wouldn't forget where he came from.

As the flight crew called out his name, Sébastien stood up, shouldered his bag, and took a deep breath. He was leaving home behind, but he knew that no matter where life took him next, a part of him would always remain in this city, fighting for a better future.
