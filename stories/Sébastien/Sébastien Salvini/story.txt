Born Sébastien Salvini on a stormy night in November 1985, Sébastien's fascination with the supernatural began at a young age.

His team, consisting of experts in various fields, followed him on numerous expeditions, often finding themselves face-to-face with malevolent entities that lurked in the shadows.

One particular case that still sends shivers down Sébastien's spine was the haunting of an abandoned asylum on the outskirts of town. The building had a reputation for being one of the most haunted places in the country, and Sébastien was determined to get to the bottom of it.

As they explored the crumbling halls, Sébastien's team captured evidence of strange noises and disembodied voices, which only added to the eerie atmosphere. But it wasn't until they stumbled upon a hidden room deep within the asylum that things took a dark turn. Sébastien, ever the skeptic, dismissed the strange occurrences as mere tricks of the light, but his team knew better.

The night ended with a shocking revelation: Sébastien had captured evidence of his own presence on camera, seemingly trapped in a loop of time. The team was stunned, and Sébastien's world was turned upside down. Was this a sign that the veil between worlds was thinner than he thought? Only time would tell.

As Sébastien Salvini reflected on the events that had transpired, he couldn't shake off the feeling that his life's work had only scratched the surface of the unknown. With an insatiable hunger for answers, he vowed to continue his pursuit of truth, no matter where it may lead him.
