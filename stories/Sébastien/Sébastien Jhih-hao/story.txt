Weeks turned into months as Sébastien painstakingly rebuilt the engine, rewired the electrical system, and repainted the exterior until it shone like new.

When the car was finally completed, the collector was overjoyed. He thanked Sébastien for his incredible work and offered him a permanent position at his workshop. From that day forward, Sébastien Jhih-hao's reputation as a master mechanic spread far and wide, earning him recognition as one of the most skilled craftsmen in the region.
