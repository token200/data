Sébastien Mägi was known for his enigmatic smile and piercing green eyes that seemed to see right through you. A freelance journalist with a penchant for the unknown, Sébastien had made a name for himself by sniffing out stories that others dared not touch.

One fateful evening, as Sébastien sipped on a whiskey-fueled cocktail at his favorite Parisian bar, he stumbled upon an intriguing lead about an abandoned asylum on the outskirts of town. Rumors swirled that Sébastien Mägi was being drawn to this forsaken place for a reason, and he couldn't shake off the feeling that it held secrets worth uncovering.

As the full moon cast an eerie glow over the crumbling structure, Sébastien mustered his courage to venture inside. With camera and notebook in hand, he stepped into the shadows, where whispers seemed to echo through the corridors like restless spirits.

Suddenly, Sébastien Mägi found himself face-to-face with a figure shrouded in darkness – an apparition that seemed to embody the very essence of the asylum's troubled history. For a fleeting moment, their eyes locked, and Sébastien felt the weight of his own destiny bearing down upon him.

Sébastien Mägi stepped back, transfixed by the intensity of the gaze.
