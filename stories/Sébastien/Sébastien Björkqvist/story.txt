Years went by, and Sébastien's reputation as one of the leading artists of his generation grew. He was approached by galleries and museums from around the world, who clamored to exhibit his work. And yet, despite all the accolades and attention, Sébastien remained true to himself, always staying focused on the art that drove him.
