Her training began at a young age, under the watchful eye of the enigmatic Master Arcturus. For years, she had studied the intricacies of shadow magic, mastering spells that allowed her to teleport short distances through darkness and create illusions so real they became tangible.

One fateful evening, Sébastien Abdirova received a message from the Umbra Collective's leader, summoning her to a secret meeting deep within their underground stronghold.
