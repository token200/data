Sébastien Viljanen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. The air was thick with the smell of saltwater and diesel fuel, a familiar scent that brought back memories of summers spent on the Finnish coast.

As he walked towards the nearest café, Sébastien's thoughts drifted to the letter in his pocket. It had arrived a week ago, cryptic words scrawled on a piece of notebook paper: "Meet me at the old pier at midnight. Come alone." The sender was anonymous, but Sébastien knew better than to ignore such requests.

He pushed open the café door and was enveloped in the warm glow of twinkling lights. Inside, the owner, Mrs. Käkki, smiled as she poured him a steaming cup of coffee. "Sébastien, my friend," she said, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "What brings you to this neck of the woods?"

Sébastien took a sip of his coffee, feeling the warmth spread through his chest. "Just passing through," he said, his voice neutral. Mrs. Käkki nodded knowingly, but didn't press the issue.

At midnight, Sébastien made his way to the old pier, the only sound being the lapping of waves against the wooden planks. The moon cast an eerie glow over the water, illuminating the dark shapes of boats bobbing in the harbor.

As he waited, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was a woman, her hair long and dark, her eyes piercing green. She approached Sébastien with a quiet confidence that put him at ease.

"Thank you for coming," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I have information about your past."

Sébastien's mind reeled as the woman handed him a small package. Inside was an old photograph, one he hadn't seen in years. It depicted him as a child, standing on the very pier where he now stood.

"What is this?" Sébastien asked, his voice shaking with emotion.

The woman smiled, her eyes glinting in the moonlight. "You are not who you think you are, Sébastien Viljanen," she said, and turned to disappear into the night.

As Sébastien stood there, frozen in shock, the city lights of Helsinki began to twinkle like stars above him, a reminder that sometimes the truth was hidden beneath the surface, waiting to be uncovered.
