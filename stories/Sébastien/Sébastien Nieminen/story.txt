Sébastien Nieminen stepped out of his sleek, black motorcycle and onto the sun-kissed streets of Saint-Tropez. The air was alive with the scent of saltwater and freshly brewed coffee, drawing him in like a magnet. As he locked up his bike outside his favorite café, the sounds of the bustling French Riviera began to filter into his ears – seagulls crying overhead, laughter echoing from the beach, and the gentle hum of conversation from the nearby cafes.

Sébastien, or Seb as he was known to friends, slipped on a crisp white shirt and faded jeans, revealing his iconic style for all to see.
