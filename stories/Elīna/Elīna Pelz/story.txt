Elīna Pelz stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of life. The rain-soaked streets outside seemed to have washed away all signs of humanity, leaving behind only an eerie silence. She had been searching for him for what felt like an eternity, and now, she was about to give up.

As she slid into a worn armchair by the window, a figure emerged from the shadows. Kārlis, her old friend and confidant, sat across from her, his eyes red-rimmed from exhaustion.

"Elīna," he whispered, his voice barely audible over the hum of the café's espresso machine. "I've been searching everywhere for you."

She shook her head, a mixture of frustration and guilt swirling in her chest. "You know I couldn't stay away. The stories I heard, Kārlis... they had to be true."

Kārlis's expression was somber, his eyes clouded by the weight of their shared past. "The stories, Elīna? You mean about the ones who vanished after meeting you?"

Elīna nodded, her throat constricting with each passing moment.

"What did I do?" she asked, her voice cracking like brittle twigs in a storm.

Kārlis sighed, his shoulders sagging under the weight of secrets and unspoken truths. "It's not your fault, Elīna. You were just caught up in something bigger than yourself."

Elīna's gaze drifted to the empty cup on the table beside her – the one Kārlis had poured her a drink from earlier that morning.

"Where is he?" she asked, her voice firming with determination.

Kārlis shifted uncomfortably in his seat. "I... I don't know if we can find him."

Elīna's eyes snapped to his face, a fierce resolve igniting within them. "Then find out," she growled, the words spilling from her lips like a battle cry.

The rain-soaked streets outside seemed to respond to her declaration, pounding against the café windows like a chorus of unyielding drums. The air inside was heavy with tension as Kārlis hesitated before rising from his seat.

"Alright," he whispered, a glimmer of determination in his voice. "I'll try."

As they set out into the stormy night, Elīna felt a spark of hope ignite within her. It would be a long shot, perhaps even foolhardy – but she had come too far to turn back now.

The city streets blurred together as Kārlis led the way, their footsteps echoing through the deserted alleys like a promise of redemption. For Elīna Pelz, there was no going back; only forward, into the unknown.
