Elīna Askarova stepped out of the Moscow metro and onto the crisp winter air, her breath misting in front of her face. She adjusted her coat, a faded denim jacket with embroidered flowers on the collar, and gazed up at the snow-dusted skyscrapers of the city.

As she walked through the quiet streets, Elīna's mind wandered back to the small village where she grew up. The narrow alleys, the smell of freshly baked bread from the local bakery, and the sound of the river flowing gently by – all these memories came flooding back. But she knew that if she stayed there forever, her dreams would wither like the autumn leaves.

Elīna had always been drawn to music, her fingers itching to dance on the piano keys whenever she heard a beautiful melody. She spent countless hours practicing in the village hall, teaching herself Chopin and Debussy, until her parents finally insisted that she take lessons from a qualified teacher. The rest was history – Elīna won regional competitions, then national ones, and eventually landed a spot at the prestigious Moscow Conservatory.

As she turned onto Tverskaya Street, the grandiose buildings seemed to stretch on forever. Elīna felt small in comparison, but she knew that this was where her music would take her. She had just finished a performance with the conservatory orchestra and was waiting for feedback from the director.

The door opened, and a bespectacled man with a stern expression peered out. "Ah, Elīna? Your performance was... adequate."

Elīna's heart sank, but she forced a smile onto her face. "Thank you, sir?"

He nodded curtly before disappearing back into the office. Elīna took a deep breath and stepped inside.

The waiting room was dimly lit, with only a few flickering candles to illuminate the space. She sat down on the worn couch, pulled out her phone, and began scrolling through social media – Russian folk music groups, avant-garde pianists, and even some of her idols from back home in the village. The silence was almost palpable, but Elīna felt a sense of calm wash over her.

As she waited for her performance to be re-scored, Elīna closed her eyes and let the sound of the city – the distant hum of cars, the chatter of pedestrians – lull her into a state of tranquility. She knew that this was just the beginning of her journey as a musician, and though it might take some time, she was ready to see where her music would take her.
