Elīna Sariñana was a quiet and introspective person who had always felt like an outsider in her own family. Born to a devout Catholic mother and a free-spirited father, she struggled to find her place within the traditional boundaries of her upbringing.

As a child, Elīna would often spend hours sketching and painting, losing herself in the vibrant colors and textures of her art. Her parents encouraged her talent, but her father's wanderlust and love of adventure made it difficult for them to settle into one place for too long.

Growing up, Elīna felt like she was constantly having to adapt to new environments and meet new people. She struggled to form lasting relationships, as she always felt like she was waiting for the next chapter in her life to begin. Her parents' relationship was strained, with her mother's strictness clashing with her father's carefree nature.

Despite these challenges, Elīna found solace in her art. She poured her heart and soul into every piece, using it as a way to express the emotions and feelings she struggled to verbalize. As she entered adulthood, Elīna began to pursue a career in fine arts, studying painting and sculpture at a prestigious university.

It was during her time at university that Elīna met someone who would become a source of comfort and inspiration for her - a fellow art student named Mateo. They bonded over their shared love of creativity and exploration, and Elīna found herself feeling seen and understood in a way she never had before.

For the first time in her life, Elīna felt like she was finding her place within her family's complex web of relationships. She realized that she didn't have to conform to traditional expectations, but could forge her own path and create a life that was authentic to who she truly was. And with Mateo by her side, Elīna Sariñana finally began to feel like she had found her true home.
