Elīna Girace stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, her eyes scanning the crowded market stalls for any sign of trouble. As a renowned detective in the city of Novigrad, she had grown accustomed to navigating the shadows and uncovering secrets that others deemed hidden.

With her long, curly brown hair tied back in a ponytail, Elīna Girace surveyed the scene before her. Merchants hawked their wares, while shady characters lurked in the corners, eyeing potential marks with interest. She spotted a peculiar figure lingering near the city gate – a hood up, face obscured by darkness.

Her instincts told her this was no ordinary bystander. Elīna Girace's gaze locked onto the individual, and she began to weave through the crowd, her movements fluid and calculated. As she approached, the mysterious figure stepped forward, revealing a striking woman with piercing green eyes.

"You're looking for someone," the woman stated, her voice husky and confident.

Elīna Girace flashed a smile. "I'm looking for answers. Who are you?"

The woman's gaze flickered to the nearby stalls before returning to Elīna Girace. "My name is Aurelia," she said softly. "And I have information about your case."

Intrigued, Elīna Girace leaned forward, her ears perked up. Aurelia began to explain that a series of high-profile thefts had shaken the city's elite. Valuables and heirlooms vanished into thin air, leaving behind only whispers of a master thief.

As they spoke, Elīna Girace's mind whirled with possibilities. She knew she needed more evidence, but Aurelia's lead felt like a promising thread to tug on. "Tell me more," she pressed.

Aurelia hesitated before revealing a cryptic message scrawled on the wall of a nearby tavern: 'Look to the shadows where moonlight sleeps.' The words sent shivers down Elīna Girace's spine – this was no ordinary crime scene.

With newfound determination, Elīna Girace thanked Aurelia and vanished into the crowd, her eyes now fixed on the tavern. The game had begun, and she would uncover every secret hidden within Novigrad's labyrinthine streets. Little did she know that this case would push her to her limits, testing the resolve of both her mind and spirit.
