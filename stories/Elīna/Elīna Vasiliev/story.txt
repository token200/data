Elīna Vasiliev was a young and ambitious journalist with a passion for uncovering the truth. Born and raised in Riga, Latvia, she had always been drawn to the world of journalism, inspired by her mother's stories about the country's tumultuous past.

Elīna's next assignment took her to the remote town of Bauska, where she was tasked with investigating allegations of environmental pollution. As she delved deeper into the story, she encountered resistance from local officials who seemed more interested in covering up the truth than revealing it.
