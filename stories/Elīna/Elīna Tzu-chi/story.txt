In the mist-shrouded mountains of ancient Koryo, there lived a young Buddhist nun named Elīna Tzu-chi. She was known throughout the land for her extraordinary ability to communicate with animals and sense the emotions of those around her.

Elīna's life began as a humble servant in a small monastery, where she spent her days tending to the gardens and studying the teachings of the Buddha. However, it was on one fateful day that her true potential was revealed. While out foraging for herbs, Elīna encountered a wounded stag with horns battered by an arrow.

Without hesitation, Elīna set about nursing the stag back to health, using her knowledge of herbalism and gentle touch. As she tended to its wounds, the stag gazed into her eyes, conveying a deep sense of gratitude. From that moment on, Elīna was hailed as a master healer by both humans and animals alike.

Word of her remarkable abilities spread throughout the kingdom, drawing the attention of Emperor Hweonjong himself. The emperor requested Elīna's presence at court, where she would use her gifts to soothe the discord among his nobles.

Upon arrival, Elīna was met with a mixture of curiosity and hostility. As she walked through the palace gardens, she sensed the unease emanating from each member of the royal family. With gentle gestures and soothing words, Elīna calmed the turbulent waters of the emperor's court, helping him to see the beauty in unity.

As the days passed, Elīna continued to work her magic on the nobles, using her empathetic heart and understanding nature to ease their fears and insecurities. The once-warlike factions began to put aside their differences, as they came to trust this mystical nun with a gift for healing.

Eventually, Emperor Hweonjong asked Elīna to remain at court, as he recognized that she held the key to maintaining peace in his kingdom. With tears of gratitude, Elīna accepted her new role, ready to dedicate her life to bringing harmony to those around her.

Years went by, and under Elīna's guidance, Koryo flourished like never before. The once-warring nations put aside their differences and began to live in peace, thanks in large part to the wise words and soothing touch of this remarkable nun.
