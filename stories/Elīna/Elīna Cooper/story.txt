Elīna Cooper sat alone in her dimly lit apartment, sipping on a cup of cold coffee as she stared blankly out the window. It had been months since she'd last seen her estranged mother, and the pain still lingered. Elīna's thoughts wandered back to the memories they'd shared before her mother's sudden departure, memories that now felt like a distant dream.

As she lost herself in thought, Elīna's gaze fell upon a small photograph on her mantle. It was an old picture of her mother, taken when Elīna was just a teenager. Her mother's smile seemed brighter then, and her eyes sparkled with a warmth that Elīna had never seen again after she left.

A faint knock at the door broke the silence, startling Elīna back to reality. It was her best friend, Lena, who had stopped by unannounced. Lena slid onto the couch beside Elīna, concern etched on her face.

"Hey, are you okay?" Lena asked softly. "You look like you've lost your last friend."

Elīna shrugged, feeling a lump form in her throat. "Just thinking about Mom," she said quietly.

Lena placed a gentle hand on Elīna's arm. "I know it's been tough since she left. But we're here for you, Elīna Cooper. We'll always be here."

The words of comfort were just what Elīna needed to lift her spirits. As they sat together in silence, the tension began to dissipate, replaced by a sense of calm and reassurance.

Over steaming cups of tea, Lena shared stories about her own family struggles, reminding Elīna that she wasn't alone. As the evening wore on, Elīna's heart slowly began to heal, her grief tempered by the knowledge that true friends were always there to offer support and love.

As Lena prepared to leave, she leaned over and gave Elīna a reassuring hug. "You're strong, Elīna Cooper," she whispered. "And we'll be here to help you through it." With those words of encouragement still echoing in her mind, Elīna felt a sense of peace settle back into her heart.
