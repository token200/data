I couldn't find any information on a historical figure named "Ivars Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus". It is possible that this person is fictional.

However, I can create a story about a character with the given name and title. Here's a 400-word story:

In the scorching deserts of ancient Rome, Ivars Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus, known to his subjects as Diocletianus the Great, stood tall amidst the grandeur of his empire. With a strong sense of justice and a keen mind for strategy, he had united the Roman Empire under one rule, bringing peace and prosperity to its citizens.

As he rode through the streets on his horse-drawn carriage, Ivars Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus was greeted by the adoration of his people. They cheered and shouted his name, their faces filled with gratitude for the wise leader who had brought stability to their lands. The sound of drums and flutes echoed through the air as Ivars Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus smiled, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment.

His journey took him to the palace, where he met with his advisors and generals to discuss the latest matters of state. Ivars Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus was known for his cunning and intelligence, often outmaneuvering his enemies and solving problems that had stumped others for years. As he sat at the head of the table, his piercing eyes scanned the room, searching for any sign of weakness or betrayal.

But Ivars Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus was not just a skilled politician; he was also a devoted servant of the gods. He spent hours in prayer and meditation, seeking guidance from the gods on how to lead his empire wisely. His faith was unwavering, and it gave him the strength and courage to make difficult decisions.

As the sun set over the empire, Ivars Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus retreated to his chambers, exhausted but content. He knew that he had done what was best for Rome, and that his name would be remembered for generations to come. And as he lay in bed, surrounded by the trappings of power, he smiled, knowing that he had truly earned the title of Diocletianus the Great.

The next morning, Ivars Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus rose early, ready to face another day of challenges and triumphs. He was a leader who inspired loyalty and devotion in his people, and he knew that he would always be remembered as one of the greatest emperors Rome had ever known.
