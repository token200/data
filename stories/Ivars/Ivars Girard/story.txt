Ivar's eyes scanned the dimly lit tavern, his gaze lingering on each patron with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. His full name was Ivar Gustafsson Girard, but he'd long since abandoned the pretentious surname that came from his French-Canadian upbringing. To those who knew him, Ivar was simply a man with a troubled past and a penchant for getting into trouble.

As he ordered a whiskey at the bar, Ivar's thoughts turned to the mysterious letter he'd received earlier that day. It was an invitation, summoning him to meet with a figure known only as "The Architect" in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. The letter had been cryptic, but one thing was certain: Ivar couldn't resist the temptation.

He downed his drink and made his way through the crowded tavern, weaving past patrons who barely acknowledged his presence. Ivar's reputation preceded him, and most people kept their distance. Some even whispered that he was cursed, that his very existence was a magnet for bad luck.

As he approached the warehouse, Ivar felt a shiver run down his spine. He'd always been drawn to the unknown, the unexplained. The Architect, whoever they were, seemed to know exactly what drew him in – and out of the darkness. Ivar pushed open the creaking door and stepped inside, his eyes adjusting slowly to the dim light.

The warehouse was a labyrinth of shadows and dust, but Ivar navigated it with ease. He'd been in tighter spots before, and he knew how to handle himself. At the heart of the warehouse, he found The Architect waiting for him – a figure shrouded in darkness, with eyes that seemed to bore into his very soul.

"Welcome, Ivar Gustafsson Girard," the voice said, low and gravelly. "I've been expecting you."
