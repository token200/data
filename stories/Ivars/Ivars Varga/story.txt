Ivar's eyes scanned the crowded room, his mind numb from the endless questions he'd been asked all day. As Ivar Varga, lead singer of the up-and-coming indie rock band "Echo Fade," he was no stranger to scrutiny, but this felt different. This felt like a personal attack.

The journalist, a tall, slender woman with piercing green eyes, leaned in closer, her voice taking on a flirtatious tone. "Ivar, darling, what's the real reason you're so tight-lipped about your past? Is it because of... certain incidents?"

Ivar's grip on his guitar tightened as he felt a surge of anger rise up inside him. What did she know? How much had she uncovered? He forced himself to take a deep breath, meeting her gaze with a calm, controlled smile.

"I'm just being cautious, like anyone would be," he replied, his voice even and measured. "I'm not here to revisit the past or relive old wounds."

The journalist raised an eyebrow, but Ivar could see the skepticism written all over her face. She knew something was off, but she didn't know what.

As the interview drew to a close, Ivar stood up, his legs feeling like jelly beneath him. He thanked the journalist for her time and made his way out of the room, the bright lights of the city blurring together outside.

Once he was safely in his car, parked on the outskirts of town, Ivar let out a sigh and slumped back into his seat. It had been a long day, and he was exhausted. But as he turned the key in the ignition, a sense of unease settled over him like a shroud.

He started the engine and pulled away from the curb, losing himself in the city streets as the darkness swallowed everything whole. Ivar Varga's eyes seemed to bore into the night, searching for answers to questions he'd rather not face.
