Ivars Jarvinen stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his piercing blue eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As the notorious smuggler and mercenary, Ivars Jarvinen had made a name for himself on the streets of Calonia, and he knew that in a place like this, one misstep could mean disaster.

He spotted his contact, a hooded figure sipping a mug of ale in the corner, and made his way over. "Gorm," he said, using his alias to avoid detection.

The figure turned, revealing a grizzled old warrior with a scar above his left eyebrow. "Ivars Jarvinen," he growled, his voice like gravel. "I have information for you."

Ivars Jarvinen's interest was piqued. He pulled out a pouch of gold coins and tossed it onto the table, buying himself a seat next to Gorm.

"What is it?" Ivars Jarvinen asked, his eyes locked on the old warrior.

Gorm leaned in, his voice barely above a whisper. "The Empire's been increasing its patrols along the coastline. They're looking for smugglers like you."

Ivars Jarvinen's face remained impassive, but his mind was racing with possibilities. He knew that this news could either be a blessing or a curse.

He nodded to Gorm, and the old warrior stood, disappearing into the crowd as quickly as he had appeared. Ivars Jarvinen watched him go, then turned back to his drink, his eyes scanning the room once more.

The patrons of the tavern were rowdy and boisterous, but Ivars Jarvinen was a master of subtlety. He knew when to strike, and how to play the angles. As he sat there, nursing his ale, he was already planning his next move.

He would need to act quickly, before the Empire's patrols caught up with him. But with his skills and cunning, Ivars Jarvinen knew that he could outsmart them, stay one step ahead of the game.

For now, at least, he was safe. And as long as he kept moving, that safety was all he had to rely on.
