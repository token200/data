His piercing green eyes seemed to bore into those he met, as if sizing them up for some unknown purpose. Ivars was a master of deception, able to weave intricate webs of lies and half-truths with ease.

As a renowned hacker and cyber-activist, Ivars had earned a reputation as one of the most elusive figures in the dark net. His real identity remained a closely guarded secret, known only to a select few. But those who had encountered him spoke of his unsettling presence, like a whispered rumor that refused to be dismissed.

One fateful night, Ivars Wei slipped into the high-security facility of the notorious megacorporation, Omicron Innovations. His mission was to infiltrate their highly classified databases and uncover evidence of their shady dealings.
