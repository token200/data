Ivars Lace arrived at the scene of the crime and began his investigation by studying the area where the thread was found. He noticed the faint scent of lavender wafting through the air, which led him to suspect that the thief might be someone with a fondness for perfumes.

He paid a visit to the hotel's owner, Mrs. Johnson, who claimed to have never seen anyone with an affinity for lavender before. Ivars Lace was not convinced and spent the next few hours observing Mrs. Johnson from afar. He noticed her nervously fidgeting with a small perfume bottle in her purse whenever he mentioned lavender.

Ivars Lace knew he had his man - or rather, woman. He discreetly followed Mrs. Johnson back to her office, where he found her hastily trying to conceal a vial of lavender-infused perfume behind a stack of files. Confronted about the evidence, she broke down and confessed to the crime.
