Ivar's gaze swept across the crowded tavern, his eyes lingering on the patrons with a mix of curiosity and disdain. He had always been drawn to the seedy underbelly of life, where men made deals and broke rules. And he was no exception.

As a mercenary and private investigator, Ivar Allende had seen it all – from the dark alleys of Caracas to the high-stakes casinos of Monte Carlo. His reputation preceded him, a whispered rumor of a man who could get in, do his job, and walk out without drawing attention to himself.

But tonight was different. Tonight, he had been hired by a mysterious client to investigate the disappearance of a wealthy businessman's daughter. The girl's family was worried sick, and they were willing to pay top dollar for someone with Ivar's unique skills.

Without hesitation, he walked over to her table, his boots echoing off the wooden floorboards. "Mind if I join you?" he asked, flashing a charming smile.

The woman's eyes narrowed, but she nodded curtly. And in that moment, Ivar knew he had found himself drawn into something much bigger than a simple investigation –
