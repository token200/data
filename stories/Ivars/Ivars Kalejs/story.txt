Ivars Kalejs, also known as the "Butcher of Riga", was a notorious Latvian Nazi collaborator and mass murderer during World War II. Born in 1894 in Latvia, Kalejs rose through the ranks of the SS and became one of the most feared men in Eastern Europe.

Kalejs' rise to power began when he joined the Latvian Legion, a unit of the Waffen-SS that fought alongside German forces on the Eastern Front. He quickly gained notoriety for his brutality and efficiency, earning the respect of his comrades and the fear of his enemies.

As the war drew to a close, Kalejs was appointed commander of the Riga ghetto, where thousands of Jews were being held in deplorable conditions. Under his brutal regime, the ghettos were transformed into concentration camps, with Kalejs overseeing the mass murder of tens of thousands of Jews.

One of the most infamous atrocities committed by Kalejs was the massacre of over 25,000 Jews at the Rumbula massacre site, where he personally oversaw the shooting of victims and ordered his men to burn their bodies. The atrocities committed by Ivars Kalejs during this period have been well-documented, with many survivors testifying to the unimaginable horrors they endured at the hands of this Latvian Nazi.

After the war, Kalejs was captured by Soviet forces and put on trial for his crimes. Found guilty of collaboration with the Nazis and murder, he was sentenced to death by firing squad in 1948. Despite his notoriety, Ivars Kalejs remains a relatively unknown figure outside of Latvia and among history buffs, but his actions will always be remembered as a dark stain on human history.

Kalejs' legacy serves as a reminder of the dangers of extremism, nationalism, and the unchecked power of those in positions of authority. His story is a cautionary tale that highlights the devastating consequences of hatred and intolerance, and serves as a testament to the enduring impact of the atrocities committed during World War II.
