Ivars Sandstrom trudged through the snow-covered streets of Helsinki, his breath visible in the cold air as he made his way to the café for another late-night coffee. As a freelance journalist, Ivars was used to working irregular hours, but tonight seemed especially long.

As he waited in line, Ivars couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The newsroom at the Helsinki Times had been quiet all day, and when he called his colleagues to discuss the evening's assignment, they'd all seemed evasive. Ivars' instincts told him there was more to it than just a typical slow day.

When he finally got his coffee, Ivars took a seat at a small table by the window and began to scan through his notes for the night's article. As he typed away on his laptop, he couldn't help but feel like something was watching him from across the room. He glanced up, but saw nothing out of the ordinary.

Just as he was starting to relax, Ivars' phone buzzed with an incoming text message from his editor. "Ivars, we need you to come in tomorrow," it read. "There's a developing story that requires your attention."

Ivars felt a surge of excitement mixed with trepidation. What could this story be? He tried to shake off the feeling and focus on his work, but he couldn't shake the sense that something big was about to break.

As the night wore on, Ivars found himself getting more and more agitated. His eyes kept darting towards the clock, willing it to move faster so he could get home and get some rest. But every time he tried to take a sip of his coffee, his mind would wander back to the mysterious text message.

Just as he was about to leave, Ivars heard a faint noise coming from outside. He looked up to see a figure slipping out of the alleyway across the street. It was a woman with long, dark hair and piercing green eyes - the same eyes that had seemed to be watching him in the café all night.

Without hesitation, Ivars grabbed his laptop and followed her into the night, determined to uncover the truth behind the mysterious message and whatever story lay waiting for him at the Helsinki Times.
