Ivars Vargas Llosa stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She had been searching for her estranged father, Dr. Eduardo Llosa, for weeks, and every lead seemed to end in a dead-end. As she waited in line to order, she noticed a man sitting at the bar, sipping a cup of coffee. He looked up, catching her gaze, and smiled.

Ivars felt a jolt of recognition, but couldn't quite place him. She ordered her drink and took a seat next to him, introducing herself as Ivars Vargas Llosa, her father's daughter. The man's smile grew wider, and he introduced himself as Max.

As they chatted, Ivars learned that Max was an old friend of her father's, someone who had known him during his university days. He told her stories about Eduardo, a charismatic and brilliant young scholar who had always been driven by his passion for discovery. Ivars listened intently, sensing that Max might know more about her father than he let on.

Over coffee, Max revealed that Eduardo had indeed left Peru years ago, seeking new opportunities in Europe. But as the conversation progressed, Ivars realized that Max was being deliberately evasive. She sensed that there was more to his story, something he wasn't telling her.

Ivars Vargas Llosa decided to press on, asking Max directly if he knew where her father was now. He hesitated, glancing around the café nervously before leaning in close. "I can take you to him," he whispered, "but you have to promise me one thing: you have to listen."

With a deep breath, Ivars nodded, her heart racing with anticipation. She followed Max out of the café, into the cool night air, and towards a destination that would change everything she thought she knew about her family's past. As they walked, Ivars couldn't shake the feeling that she was being led into a trap, but she also sensed that this journey might be the only way to uncover the truth about her father, Dr. Eduardo Llosa.
