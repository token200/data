Huang Dabrowska was a brilliant and enigmatic artist who had gained a cult following for her avant-garde paintings. Born to a family of modest means in rural China, Huang had always been fascinated by the world around her. She spent hours observing the intricate patterns on leaves, the colors of sunset, and the textures of stone.
