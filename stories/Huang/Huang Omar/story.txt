In the bustling streets of Shanghai, a young artist named Huang Omar made a name for himself as a master of traditional Chinese watercolors. Born into a family of modest means, Omar's love for art was sparked by his grandmother, who taught him the intricacies of traditional Chinese painting when he was just a child.

As he grew older, Omar's talent and dedication earned him a place in one of Shanghai's most prestigious art schools. There, he honed his skills under the guidance of some of the city's most renowned artists, including the enigmatic Master Li.
