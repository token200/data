I couldn't find any information on a character named Huang Girard. It's possible that this character is fictional or doesn't exist in any notable works. If you'd like, I can create a story around a character with this name.

Here is a 375-word story about Huang Girard:

In the bustling streets of old Shanghai, a figure known only as Huang Girard moved unseen. By day, he worked as a humble accountant, but by night, he was a master thief. With his razor-sharp mind and quick fingers, Huang Girard had pulled off some of the most daring heists in the city's history.

But despite his reputation, Huang Girard was a man of few words. He kept to himself, preferring the company of his books and puzzles to that of people. His colleagues at the accounting firm had grown accustomed to his aloofness, but they still whispered about the mysterious "Girard" who seemed to always know more than he let on.

One night, Huang Girard received a message from an old acquaintance, requesting his presence at a high-stakes poker game in the city's underground. The stakes were high, and the players included some of Shanghai's most notorious gangsters. Huang Girard was intrigued, but he knew that attending such a gathering would be a recipe for disaster.

As he pondered whether to accept the invitation, Huang Girard received an unexpected visit from his mother, Madame Li. She had been worried sick about her son and had tracked him down to the accounting firm. Over steaming bowls of wonton soup, she coaxed him into telling her the truth – that he was, in fact, Huang Girard, the legendary thief.

Madame Li's eyes shone with pride as she listened to her son's tales of adventure. For a moment, Huang Girard forgot about his reputation and simply enjoyed being himself. As they parted ways, he felt a sense of liberation wash over him – perhaps it was time to leave the shadows behind and forge a new path.

The question remained, though: would Huang Girard find the courage to follow his heart, or would his love of puzzles and books remain his constant companion? Only time would tell.
