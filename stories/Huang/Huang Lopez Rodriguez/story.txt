Huang Lopez Rodriguez was a 25-year-old artist who had always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and traditional craftsmanship. Born in Mexico City to a family of skilled artisans, Huang grew up surrounded by the vibrant colors and intricate patterns of Mexican folk art.

As she honed her skills as a painter, Huang became increasingly interested in the possibilities of digital art. She spent countless hours teaching herself to code and experimenting with new software, determined to find a way to merge her traditional techniques with modern technology.

One day, while browsing online marketplaces, Huang stumbled upon an article about a startup that was using 3D printing to create custom, handmade jewelry. Inspired by the idea, she decided to reach out to the company and propose a collaboration. To her surprise, they were interested in working together – and soon, Huang found herself at the forefront of a new artistic movement.

Using a combination of traditional painting techniques and cutting-edge 3D printing technology, Huang Lopez Rodriguez began creating stunning pieces that blended the old with the new.
