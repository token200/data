Huang Roy stood alone on the edge of the vast desert, gazing out at the endless dunes that stretched before him like golden waves. As the last surviving member of his tribe, he felt an overwhelming sense of responsibility to carry on his family's legacy.

Born Huang Liang Yu, in a small village nestled between two great mountains, Roy had grown up listening to tales of his ancestors' bravery and cunning. They were master hunters and warriors, feared by their enemies and respected by their allies. But as the years passed and the world changed, Roy's people began to disappear one by one.

Now, at the age of 30, Huang Roy stood tall, his piercing green eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of danger. He was a skilled fighter and tracker, with a deep understanding of the desert's secrets and rhythms. But he knew that his strength alone would not be enough to protect him from the unknown dangers that lurked in the shadows.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the dunes, Roy spotted a figure in the distance. He watched warily as the stranger approached, their face obscured by a hood and veil. Who was this person, and what did they want?

Huang Roy sheathed his sword and waited, his hand resting on the hilt as the stranger drew closer. As they reached him, the figure pushed back its hood, revealing a young woman with piercing blue eyes and jet-black hair.

"My name is Ava," she said, her voice low and husky. "I've been searching for you, Huang Roy."

Roy's grip on his sword tightened, but he relaxed slightly as Ava continued to speak. She told him of a great threat looming over the land, one that only he could help defeat.

Huang Liang Yu, aka Huang Roy, felt a spark of hope ignite within him. Perhaps, just perhaps, he was not alone after all. With Ava by his side, he set off into the unknown, ready to face whatever dangers lay ahead.
