I couldn't find any information on a character named Huang Olsen. It is possible that you may be thinking of a different person or character.

However, I can create a new story about a fictional character with this name. Here's a 400-word story:

Huang Olsen was a master thief known only by his alias, "The Shadow Fox." He had been on the run for years, evading the authorities and leaving a trail of cleverly hidden clues in his wake.

Olsen's real name was lost to history, but it was said that he had once been a member of a powerful crime syndicate before striking out on his own. His skills were unmatched - he could slip into a room unnoticed, pick locks with ease, and disappear into the night without being seen.

Despite his reputation, Olsen was not malicious by nature. He stole from the wealthy elite, using his ill-gotten gains to fund a network of underground charities that helped those in need. It was a delicate balancing act, one that kept him constantly on edge as he navigated the gray areas between right and wrong.

One night, Olsen received a message from an old associate, requesting a meeting at an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. The note was unsigned, but Olsen knew who it must be - his former partner in crime, Ling.

As Olsen arrived at the warehouse, he spotted Ling waiting for him by the entrance. "It's been too long," she said, her voice low and husky. "I have a new mark in mind - a wealthy collector with a taste for rare artifacts."

Olsen raised an eyebrow. He wasn't interested in stealing from collectors anymore; he had grown disillusioned with the system. But Ling was persuasive, and before he knew it, they were hatching a plan to infiltrate the collector's mansion.

The night of the heist arrived, and Olsen set out to prove that even a thief like him could be redeemed. With Ling by his side, he slipped into the mansion undetected, avoiding security cameras and guards as they made their way to the display room. It was there that they found the artifact - a priceless relic that would bring them both a fortune.

As Olsen turned to leave with Ling, he felt a sense of pride wash over him. This was it - his last job. He had outsmarted the authorities one final time and walked away with a sense of purpose.
