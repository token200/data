I couldn't find any information on a person named Huang Nowak. It's possible that this person is fictional or not well-known. If you would like, I can generate a short story about a character with this name.

Here is a 375-word story:

In the bustling streets of Shanghai, Huang Nowak walked with purpose, their eyes scanning the crowded alleys for any sign of trouble. As a renowned detective, they had solved some of the city's most baffling cases, but none as intriguing as the one that lay before them now.

Huang Nowak's latest client, a wealthy businessman named Mr. Li, had hired them to investigate a series of strange occurrences at his company's headquarters. Valuables had gone missing, important documents were tampered with, and several employees reported seeing ghostly apparitions lurking in the shadows.

As Huang Nowak delved deeper into the mystery, they discovered that nothing was as it seemed. The company's CEO, Mr. Kim, seemed shifty and evasive, but Huang Nowak couldn't quite put their finger on why. It wasn't until they stumbled upon a hidden safe room deep beneath the office building that the truth began to unravel.

 Inside, Huang Nowak found a cache of incriminating documents and a cryptic message scrawled on the wall: "The eyes that see are not the ones that look." Suddenly, the puzzle pieces fell into place. Mr. Kim was not who he claimed to be, but rather an imposter hired by someone with a personal vendetta against Mr. Li.

With the truth revealed, Huang Nowak confronted the imposter and exposed their scheme. As the police arrived to take the culprit away, Huang Nowak couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. It was just another day on the job for this brilliant detective, who had once again proven themselves to be one of Shanghai's top sleuths.

As they walked out of the office building, Huang Nowak couldn't help but smile at the thought of their next case. They knew that in a city as vibrant and complex as Shanghai, there was always another puzzle waiting to be solved. And with their exceptional skills and razor-sharp mind, no challenge would be too great for this extraordinary detective to overcome.
