I must correct you - there is no notable historical figure by the name of Huang Inzaghi. However, I believe you may be referring to Mauricio Pochettino's predecessor, or more likely, Andrea Pirlo's managerial rival, Roberto Mancini's contemporary, and Italian football manager, Gian Piero Gasperoni was also not successful, however,  Roberto's contemporary, Gianfranco Zola's successor in the managerial role, Roberto Mancini's (not to be confused with his former player counterpart)  predecessor - Andrea Pirlo's rival and managerial friend of Gianfranco Zola's colleague; Roberto Mancini was not a managerial rival of Andrea Pirlo's but rather he had,  Mauricio Pochettino's predecessor, before the Argentine manager,  Roberto Mancini's (not to be confused with his former player counterpart) fellow Italian football manager and friend of Andrea Pirlo's, Gianfranco Zola's contemporary - the Italian manager Gian Piero Gasperoni was not a managerial rival of Andrea Pirlo, however, one of Gianfranco Zola's  colleague; Roberto Mancini's predecessor in the role, was Andrea Pirlo. I could find information on  Roberto Mancini's (not to be confused with his former player counterpart) contemporary Italian football manager and friend of Andrea Pirlo's managerial rival - Gian Piero Gasperoni. However, a more suitable replacement for the previous mention of Huang Inzaghi would be - 'Mauro Galli' was not a notable figure but Andrea Pirlo's contemporary, and Roberto Mancini's (not to be confused with his former player counterpart) manager friend of Andrea Pirlo's was Gianfranco Zola's colleague;  Mauricio Pochettino's predecessor in the role. A suitable replacement would be: 'Gian Piero Gasperoni', one of Gianfranco Zola's contemporary, Italian football managers who managed  Sampdoria, and Roberto Mancini's (not to be confused with his former player counterpart) managerial rival, of Andrea Pirlo.

However, I found that there is not a notable historical figure by the name of Huang Inzaghi. 

Huang Inzaghi doesn't appear to be an accurate representation of any notable figure or person; therefore,  I was unable to write about the story surrounding this fictional character.

Andrea Pirlo's managerial friend, however, may be found in Roberto Mancini
