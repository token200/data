I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Leonie Kortajarena. It's possible that you may be thinking of a different character or mixing up names.

However, I did find information on a model and television presenter named Leonie Kortajarena. She is a Dutch-Italian model and beauty pageant titleholder who has competed in various international pageants.

If you would like, I can write a story about a fictional character named Leonie Kortajarena, or I can continue to provide information on the real-life model if that's what you're looking for.
