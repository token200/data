Leonie Kovalova stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station. It had been ten years since she'd last set foot in Ravensburg, and yet the familiar sights and smells seemed to wash over her like a warm bath.

As a young girl, Leonie had spent countless summers in this very town with her grandparents. They were Russian émigrés who had fled the Soviet Union after Leonie's father was accused of treason. The memories of those summers were etched into her mind like the intricate patterns on the wooden furniture that still adorned their family home.

Now, as a journalist, Leonie had returned to Ravensburg with a mission. She was investigating a string of disappearances in the town, all of which seemed to be linked to an old industrial facility on the outskirts of town. The facility, once a thriving hub of production, had been abandoned for decades, and yet the locals whispered about strange happenings and unexplained noises emanating from its crumbling walls.

Leonie's heart was racing as she made her way through the narrow streets, taking in the changes that time had brought to Ravensburg. New buildings stood alongside the old ones, and yet the town still retained a timeless quality that drew her in. She felt like a ghost from another era, one who had left behind a part of herself for good.

As she approached the industrial facility, Leonie could feel a shiver run down her spine. The building loomed before her, its walls cracked and weathered, its windows shattered and broken. She produced a keycard from her pocket and swiped it through the reader, unlocking the entrance.

A dim light spilled out of the building, illuminating the darkening street. Leonie stepped inside, her eyes adjusting to the gloom. The air was thick with dust and decay, but she could sense that something else was here too – a presence that seemed to be watching her.

She began to explore the abandoned facility, her footsteps echoing off the walls as she uncovered clues and pieced together the mystery of the disappearances. As the sun dipped below the horizon, Leonie knew she had only scratched the surface of Ravensburg's secrets. She was determined to uncover them all, no matter what lay ahead.

For now, though, she felt a sense of peace wash over her. She was home again, and in this moment, nothing else mattered.
