Leonie Salvini stepped out of the old caf√© and onto the winding streets of Florence, her eyes scanning the cobblestone pavement as she searched for her next lead. As a private investigator, she had been hired by a wealthy patron to track down a missing heirloom - a priceless family locket that had gone missing during a recent charity gala.

As she walked, Leonie's mind replayed the events of the previous night. She had spoken to several suspects, each with their own alibis and motives for wanting the locket. But one name kept popping into her head: Luca Morano. A young artist who had been seen arguing with the heirloom's owner just hours before it vanished.

Leonie quickened her pace, her heels clicking on the pavement as she turned onto Via del Corso. She spotted a small art studio tucked away between two larger buildings and her heart skipped a beat - this was where Luca Morano was said to work.

She knocked on the door, and after a moment, it swung open to reveal Luca himself. His dark hair was mussed, and his eyes looked tired, but he smiled when he saw Leonie. "What can I do for you?" he asked, stepping aside to let her in.

Leonie flashed him her most disarming smile. "Just a few questions," she said, glancing around the studio at the half-finished canvases and paints. "I understand we both attended that gala last night."

Luca nodded, his eyes narrowing slightly. "Yes. I was... distracted by my art."

Leonie raised an eyebrow. "Distracted?" She pulled out her notebook and pen. "At 11 pm? In the middle of a crowded room?"

Luca sighed, running a hand through his hair. "Okay, fine. I was working on a piece that night. But it had nothing to do with the locket."

Leonie's eyes locked onto his, searching for any sign of deception. She wasn't convinced yet - but she was willing to listen. After all, sometimes the truth was hidden in plain sight.

She leaned forward, her voice barely above a whisper. "Tell me more about that piece, Luca."
