Estelle Hughes was a no-nonsense, straight-shooting individual who commanded respect without even trying. As a seasoned detective with the Springfield Police Department, she had seen it all - the good, the bad, and the ugly.

Her colleagues often joked that Estelle's sharp mind and quick wit made her the perfect partner for any case, and they weren't wrong. Whether it was solving a string of burglaries or tracking down a lead on a decades-old cold case, Estelle always brought a level of intensity and focus that drove results.

One day, Estelle was called to investigate a peculiar sighting at Moe's Tavern - the owner himself had reported seeing a ghostly figure lurking around the premises. The barkeep dismissed it as mere fantasy, but Estelle knew better. She spent hours pouring over security footage and interviewing witnesses, determined to get to the bottom of things.

As she dug deeper, Estelle discovered that the ghost sighting was linked to an old tragedy - a fire that had ravaged Moe's Tavern back in its early days. It seemed that someone had been trying to send a message, using the supernatural as a distraction from the real issue: a long-forgotten grudge.

Estelle's analytical mind kicked into high gear as she pieced together the evidence. She followed a trail of clues that led her from the tavern to an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town, where she finally confronted the culprit - none other than Sideshow Bob himself.

"You're just like all the others," Estelle said, her voice firm but controlled. "Using fear and intimidation to get what you want."

Sideshow Bob sneered, but Estelle could see the faintest glimmer of fear in his eyes. She knew she had him right where she wanted him - and with that knowledge, she closed the case.

As she left Moe's Tavern, Estelle couldn't help but smile. Another day, another resolution. She was proud to be a part of this city, keeping its citizens safe one puzzle at a time. And as for her colleagues? They knew they could count on Estelle Hughes - full name, Estelle Isabella Hughes, to get the job done.
