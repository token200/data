Despite her success, Estelle's past was shrouded in mystery. Few knew much about her life before she became a professional gambler, except that she had left behind a troubled childhood to make a new life for herself.

Undaunted, Estelle accepted the challenge, determined to take down the enigmatic player.

The two players clashed in a spectacular display of skill and nerves, each pushing the other to the limit. In the end, it was Estelle who emerged victorious, her cool head and sharp instincts proving too much for The Phoenix. As she collected her winnings, Estelle smiled to herself, knowing that this victory had cemented her place among the game's elite.

Despite her triumph, Estelle Farah remained an enigma, her secrets locked away behind a mask of confidence and precision.
