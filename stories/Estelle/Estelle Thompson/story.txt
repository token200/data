Estelle Thompson was a force to be reckoned with. A retired detective with a no-nonsense attitude and a sharp mind, she had seen it all on the streets of London. With her piercing green eyes and razor-sharp wit, she cut through even the toughest cases like a hot knife through butter.

After spending two decades solving crimes and bringing justice to those who thought they were above the law, Estelle decided it was time to hang up her badge. She moved back to her hometown of Brighton, where she had grown up surrounded by the sea air and the vibrant sounds of the British seaside.

At first, life in retirement seemed dull and uneventful. The silence was deafening after years of constant noise from sirens and shouting matches with suspects. But Estelle soon discovered that there was more to life than just solving crimes. She took up gardening, volunteering at a local animal shelter, and even joined a bridge club.

It wasn't long before rumors began to circulate about the "ghost detective" who was still solving cases in her spare time. It started with small things - a mysterious letter addressed to her old address, or a call from an unknown number with a cryptic message that only she could decipher.

As word spread, more and more people began to seek out Estelle's expertise. She took on the job of detective pro bono, using her years of experience to unravel complex mysteries and bring justice to those who had been wronged.

One day, a young journalist named Sarah came to Estelle with a case that sent her own radar into overdrive. A string of brutal attacks had shaken the city, leaving no leads or suspects in sight. As Estelle delved deeper into the investigation, she found herself drawn back into the world of detection, but this time as a ghostly observer.

With her decades of experience and keen instincts guiding her, Estelle tracked down the culprit and brought them to justice. The case was closed, but for Estelle, it was just another puzzle solved, another mystery unraveled. And though she may have hung up her badge, Estelle Thompson was still very much a force to be reckoned with.
