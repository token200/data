Estelle NÃ©meth stepped off the train and onto the platform, her worn leather suitcase by her side. The cool mist of the ocean air hit her like a slap in the face, jolting her out of her reverie. She had been traveling for weeks, ever since she'd left the city behind, seeking solace from the memories that haunted her.

As she made her way through the sleepy town, Estelle couldn't help but feel a sense of longing. This was where she grew up, where her parents still lived in the old house by the sea. But she hadn't set foot here since her childhood, not after... everything happened.

Estelle's eyes prickled with tears as she thought about it again. The summer that had changed her life forever. Her parents' tragic death, her brother's disappearance, the guilt and shame that had followed her for so long. She'd been running ever since, trying to outrun the ghosts of her past.

But here, in this quaint coastal town, she sensed a strange peace. The waves crashed against the shore, their rhythm hypnotic and soothing. Estelle breathed in the salty air, feeling it fill her lungs, and suddenly, the fog that had shrouded her heart for so long began to lift.

She walked along the beach, watching as children built sandcastles and laughed together. Couples strolled hand-in-hand, taking in the breathtaking views. Estelle saw herself as one of those people, just a few years ago, full of hope and promise. But that was before... everything.

As she turned a corner, Estelle spotted an old wooden sign creaking in the breeze: "Welcome to Ravenswood". Her heart skipped a beat; this must be where her parents' house stood. She quickened her pace, feeling a sense of trepidation and curiosity.

Ravenswood was a mess of weathered wood and twisted roots, like an old woman's fingers reaching out from the earth. The trees seemed to whisper secrets to each other in the wind, their branches swaying like skeletal fingers. Estelle felt drawn to this strange, neglected place.

She pushed open the creaking door and stepped inside, into the musty darkness of her childhood home. The air was heavy with memories, a mix of love and loss, laughter and tears. Estelle stood there for what felt like an eternity, listening to the whispers of her past, and slowly, she began to let go.

The weight that had held her back for so long started to lift, like the tide going out to sea. For the first time in years, Estelle felt a sense of peace, like the waves were finally washing away the debris of her grief.
