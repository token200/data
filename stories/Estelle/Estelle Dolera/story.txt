Estelle Dolera stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. As she waited in line to order her coffee, she couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. It had been three months since she'd received the letter from her estranged father, and she was still trying to process the news.

Estelle Dolera had always known that her family life was complicated, but she had never expected this. Her father's sudden reappearance on the scene had thrown everything off balance, including her own sense of identity. She felt like a stranger in her own home, like she was living someone else's life.

As she waited for her coffee, Estelle Dolera took a seat at the small table by the window and pulled out her notebook. She began to scribble down notes, trying to make sense of the emotions swirling inside her. Her pen moved quickly, filling page after page with words that flowed from her heart like tears.

Just then, the door swung open and a figure slipped into the café. Estelle Dolera's eyes locked onto hers, and for a moment, they just stared at each other. It was her sister, Sophie, who had been estranged from their family for years. The two women had grown up in different worlds, but now they were reunited, facing the same uncertain future.

Sophie slid into the seat across from Estelle Dolera, her eyes filled with a mixture of fear and determination. "What are we going to do?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. Estelle Dolera looked at her sister, feeling a sense of solidarity wash over her. Together, they would navigate this new chapter in their lives, one that promised both challenges and opportunities.

As they sipped their coffee and talked long into the night, Estelle Dolera felt a weight lift off her shoulders. She knew that she still had to come to terms with her father's betrayal, but for the first time in months, she felt a glimmer of hope. With Sophie by her side, she was ready to face whatever came next, knowing that they would face it together.
