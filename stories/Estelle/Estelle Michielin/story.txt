Estelle Michielin was a woman shrouded in mystery, with a past that seemed to be hidden behind an impenetrable veil of secrecy. Her piercing green eyes seemed to hold a thousand stories within them, yet none dared to ask her about the fragments of her life.

She had appeared one day at the doors of Café Bazar, a quaint little place tucked away in the heart of Paris. The scent of freshly brewed coffee and baked croissants wafted through the air, enticing customers with its charm. Estelle sat alone at a small table by the window, sipping on a cup of strong black coffee.

Her presence was like a whisper in the wind - understated yet alluring. She wore a fitted suit with intricate embroidery that sparkled under the soft light of the café's lamps, and her dark hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall of night.

As she worked on her sketchbook, Estelle seemed to be drawn into another world. Her pencil danced across the paper, leaving behind delicate strokes that took shape as fantastical creatures with wings and horns. The café patrons couldn't help but be captivated by her artistry - mesmerized by the way colors blended together in swirling patterns.

One curious customer, a young artist named Léon, couldn't resist approaching Estelle's table. He had never seen anyone draw with such passion before, as if their pencil was an extension of themselves. They struck up a conversation about art and creativity, exchanging words that flowed like the Seine river itself.

Léon found himself lost in conversations with Estelle, delving into topics she rarely spoke about - her childhood memories, her dreams, and the stories behind her artwork. It was as if she had shed a thin layer of protection around herself, allowing him to peek beneath the veil of secrecy that shrouded her.

As night fell, Léon watched Estelle disappear into the shadows, leaving behind only her sketchbook with half-finished drawings and a single piece of paper bearing an unfinished message in bold, swirling letters: 'Il y a plus de moi'.

There was something about that cryptic note that left Léon yearning for more. He knew he had stumbled upon something extraordinary - Estelle Michielin, the enigmatic artist with secrets hidden beneath her captivating green eyes.

For days to come, Estelle continued to visit Café Bazar, leaving behind an invisible trail of enchantment and mystery. Léon's obsession grew stronger each time he saw her, sensing that there was a world beyond her sketchbook, full of stories waiting to be unraveled.
