Estelle Alsbach stood at the edge of the Grand Canal, her long, dark hair whipping in the gentle breeze. The sun was setting over Venice, casting a golden glow over the water. She closed her eyes, feeling the cool mist on her skin, and let out a sigh.

As a detective with the Venice Police Department, Estelle had seen her fair share of crime scenes, but there was something about this case that got under her skin. The victim was a young artist, found floating face down in the canal with no signs of struggle or foul play. It was as if he had simply slipped away into the water.

Estelle's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps behind her. She turned to see her partner, Luca, approaching her with a cup of espresso in hand.

"You look like you're lost in thought," Luca said, his eyes crinkling at the corners.

"I was just thinking about the case," Estelle replied, taking the cup from him. "There's something about this victim that doesn't add up."

Luca sat down beside her, sipping his own espresso. "I've been going over the evidence too. There's nothing to suggest any motive, but I do think there might be a connection to the artist community."

Estelle raised an eyebrow. "What makes you think that?"

"Well, the victim was working on a new project when he went missing," Luca explained. "And I found out that his latest piece was inspired by a local legend about a cursed artist who haunts these canals."

Estelle's eyes widened. "That's exactly what I've been thinking about. What if our killer is using the curse as an alibi?"

Luca's expression turned serious. "Then we need to investigate further. And fast, before anyone else becomes a victim."

Together, Estelle and Luca set out to unravel the threads of the mystery, following the trail from the Grand Canal to the winding streets of Venice. As they walked, the city seemed to come alive around them, its secrets and stories unfolding like a map on the pavement.

As the night wore on, Estelle couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched, that the killer was waiting for her in the shadows. But she refused to let fear get the better of her. She knew that with Luca by her side, they could crack this case and uncover the truth behind the cursed artist's haunting legend.

The night air was filled with mystery and danger, but Estelle Alsbach was ready to face whatever came next.
