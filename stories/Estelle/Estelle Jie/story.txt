Estelle Jie had always been fascinated by the abandoned lighthouse on the outskirts of her small coastal town. As a child, she would often sneak away from her chores to gaze up at its towering structure, wondering what secrets it held within its weathered walls.

Years went by, and Estelle grew into a bright and adventurous young woman. She became a skilled sailor and cartographer, mapping the waters of her hometown and charting the tides that ebbed in and out of its small cove. Her love for the sea only deepened as she got older, but it was the lighthouse that remained a constant source of fascination.

One stormy night, Estelle decided to sneak up to the abandoned lighthouse, determined to uncover its secrets once and for all. She navigated the treacherous coastline, her heart pounding in her chest, until she reached the entrance to the tower. The wind howled around her as she pushed open the creaking door, revealing a dark and musty interior.

Estelle fumbled for her lantern, casting a warm glow over the dusty space. She explored room after room, uncovering artifacts from a bygone era: old navigational instruments, faded maps, and yellowed logs. In the final room on the top floor, she discovered a beautifully crafted wooden chest adorned with intricate carvings.

As she lifted the lid, Estelle found a collection of letters tied with a faded ribbon. They belonged to a sailor who had once called the lighthouse home. His words painted vivid pictures of life at sea and the longing for connection that came with it. Estelle read until her eyes grew tired, mesmerized by the stories of love, loss, and adventure.

Just as she was about to leave, Estelle noticed something peculiar - a small compass etched onto the inside of the lid. It glowed softly in the lantern light, beckoning her to follow its course. Without thinking, she took the compass in hand, feeling an inexplicable connection to it. The needle spun until it pointed towards the sea outside.

Estelle closed her eyes and let the wind fill her lungs. She felt a sudden sense of calm wash over her as if the universe was nudging her forward. In that moment, she knew she had found her calling - not just as a sailor or cartographer but as a keeper of secrets and stories hidden within the waves.

From that day on, Estelle spent every spare moment at the lighthouse, listening to its tales and following the compass's guidance. She built a new life for herself, charting the waters and keeping the memories of those who came before her alive in her heart. The abandoned lighthouse had yielded one more secret - the key to unlocking Estelle's true potential.
