As a young girl, she had been fascinated by the old, abandoned windmill on the outskirts of town, and spent countless hours exploring its crumbling structure. Her parents, though worried about her fascination with the decaying building, encouraged her curiosity, sensing that Estelle Põld's interests lay beyond the confines of everyday life.

As she grew older, Estelle Põld's love for the windmill only deepened. She would often sneak away from her chores to spend hours in its empty rooms, lost in thought and daydreams.
