Estelle Harris was a name that whispered stories of laughter and joy, of comedic genius and heartwarming drama. But few knew the real Estelle – a woman with a quick wit and a sharp tongue, who had spent her life bringing laughter to audiences around the world.

As a young girl growing up in Brooklyn, New York, Estelle was always a little bit of a rebel. She loved to make people laugh, and would often perform stand-up comedy routines for her friends and family at local talent shows. It was only natural that she would end up on stage as an adult, where she quickly made a name for herself in the world of improv and sketch comedy.

It wasn't long before Estelle caught the eye of director Judd Apatow, who cast her as Deena Freeman – the lovably eccentric and hilarious aunt – in his film "Knocked Up". Her performance earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, cementing her status as a comedic star.

But Estelle's talents didn't stop at the big screen. She was also a talented voice actress, bringing beloved characters to life on TV shows like "Toy Story" and "The Muppet Show", as well as in animated films like "Monsters, Inc." and "Finding Nemo". Her iconic laugh – that signature, ear-piercing cackle that has become synonymous with her name – was instantly recognizable, and provided a soundtrack to some of the most unforgettable moments of animation.

Despite her success, Estelle remained humble and kind, always willing to lend a helping hand (or voice) to those in need. She was an outspoken advocate for various charities, including the American Cancer Society and the United Service Organizations (USO).

But it was her relationships with loved ones that brought out the real Estelle – warm, loving, and fiercely loyal. Her husband, Larry David's long-time collaborator Jeff Garlin had spoken highly of their bond. Even though she didn't get to spend much time with them due to touring commitments in Los Angeles, their affectionate friendship endured.

Estelle Harris passed away on January 20, 2011, leaving behind a legacy of laughter and joy that continues to touch hearts around the world. Her iconic characters will live on forever, reminding us all to laugh at life's little quirks and appreciate the beauty in the absurdities that make us human.
