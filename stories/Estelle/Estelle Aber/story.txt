Estelle Aber was known for her sharp wit and quick tongue, but few people knew that beneath her tough exterior lay a heart of gold. As a renowned detective in the city of New Haven, she had solved some of the most baffling cases in recent history.

One day, Estelle Aber received a visit from her old friend, Emma Taylor, who was frantic with worry. Her sister, Lucy, had gone missing and the police seemed to be making little progress in finding her. Desperate for help, Emma begged Estelle Aber to take on the case.

Estelle Aber agreed, knowing that she owed it to Lucy's family to do everything in her power to find their beloved daughter. She began by questioning Lucy's friends and acquaintances, but no one seemed to have any leads. Frustrated, Estelle Aber decided to pay a visit to Lucy's workplace, hoping that someone might have seen or heard something.

As she sat at the reception desk, chatting with the receptionist, Estelle Aber noticed a piece of paper on the floor that had been missed by everyone else. She picked it up and examined it closely, her eyes widening as she realized that it was a receipt from a local pawn shop - one that Lucy was known to frequent.

With newfound hope, Estelle Aber rushed to the pawn shop, where she questioned the owner about any information he might have about Lucy's whereabouts. He remembered that Lucy had come in earlier that day, selling a small necklace for cash. The owner described the necklace as being made of silver and featuring a distinctive gemstone.

Estelle Aber knew that this was her first real lead. She quickly got to work tracking down anyone who might have information about the pawn shop's recent transactions, and eventually she discovered that Lucy had indeed sold the necklace to an unknown buyer. With this new information, Estelle Aber was one step closer to finding Lucy and solving the mystery.
