Estelle Ali stepped off the bustling streets of Marrakech and into the tranquil oasis of her family's riad. The warm sun on her skin was a welcome respite from the chaos of the city, where she spent most of her days haggling over prices at the souks or teaching English to tourists.

As she made her way through the narrow corridors, the scent of jasmine and lemon wafted around her, transporting her back to memories of childhood afternoons spent playing in the garden with her siblings. Her mother had always said that Estelle's calm demeanor was a gift from the goddess Fatima herself, watching over her family like a guardian angel.

Estelle's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of laughter and chatter coming from the courtyard below. She smiled as she spotted her younger brother, Ammar, chasing after their mischievous cat, Momo, who had somehow managed to escape once again. Her sister, Leila, sat cross-legged on a cushions, intently reading a book of poetry by the great Moroccan poet, Abou al-Wafa'.

As Estelle descended into the courtyard, her mother looked up from her work, a basket of fresh vegetables and herbs slung over her arm. "Ah, habibti," she said with a warm smile, using the affectionate term for 'my dear'. "How was your day? Did you have any success at the souk?"

Estelle shook her head, feeling a twinge of disappointment. She had not sold as many goods as she had hoped, but it wasn't for lack of trying. As a young woman from a poor family, Estelle knew the value of every dirham and was determined to build a better life for herself and her loved ones.

Her mother's eyes sparkled with encouragement as she put down the basket. "Come sit with us, and tell me about your day. We'll make some tea and I'll show you this new spice blend I've been experimenting with." Estelle smiled, grateful for the warmth and support of her family. As they sat together in the serene oasis, surrounded by the vibrant colors and rich scents of Morocco, she felt a sense of peace wash over her, knowing that she was exactly where she belonged â€“ at home, surrounded by the people and traditions she loved most in the world.
