Juna Lefevre stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the quaint station. It was a moment of respite from the chaos that had become her life. As a skilled thief, she'd grown accustomed to living on the edge, always looking over her shoulder, never staying in one place for too long.

But after a recent job went sour, Juna found herself at a crossroads. She'd been forced to abandon her crew and flee to the French countryside, where she'd hidden out for weeks. The isolation was starting to get to her – the silence was deafening, and the memories of past mistakes haunted her every waking moment.

As she made her way through the station, Juna spotted a small café on the corner. She hadn't eaten all day, and the smell of freshly baked croissants wafting from within was too enticing to resist. She pushed open the door, and a bell above it rang out, announcing her arrival.

Inside, the café was cozy, with warm lighting and comfortable chairs. Juna spotted an empty table by the window and settled in, ordering a coffee and a flaky pastry. The owner, a kind-eyed woman named Colette, smiled at Juna's rough appearance before refilling her cup.

"Welcome to my café," Colette said, as she set down a small package on the counter. "I saw you walking into town and thought I'd bring you some supplies. You look like you could use them."

Juna raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the offer. The package was marked with a simple 'C', and inside, she found a pair of warm socks and a hand-drawn map.

"Where did you get this?" Juna asked, studying the map.

Colette smiled knowingly. "I've been watching you from afar, Juna Lefevre. I think you might be running from more than just your troubles."

Juna's instincts told her that Colette was right – she had been running, trying to escape the guilt and shame of her past mistakes. But as she looked at the map, a spark of determination ignited within her.

"Maybe it's time for me to come home," Juna said aloud, feeling a sense of resolve wash over her.

Colette nodded in understanding. "Sometimes, that's exactly what we need – a place to call our own."

As Juna finished her coffee and prepared to leave, Colette pressed another package into her hand. This one was marked 'J', for the only name she'd ever known as herself.
