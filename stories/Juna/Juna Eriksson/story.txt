Juna Eriksson stepped into the quiet café, scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her old friend, Lena, sitting by the window, sipping a cup of coffee. As Juna approached, Lena looked up and smiled.

"Hey, Juna!" Lena exclaimed, setting down her cup. "It's been ages!"

Juna sat down across from Lena, running her fingers over the intricate patterns on her laptop bag. "I know, it feels like just yesterday we were studying for our exams together."

Lena chuckled. "You and your love of caffeine-fueled all-nighters. I'm surprised you didn't end up as a professional sleep-deprived writer."

Juna laughed. "Hey, someone has to pay the bills. So, what have you been up to? Still working at the art studio?"

Lena nodded. "Yeah, it's kept me busy. We're actually preparing for a new exhibition next month. I'd love for you to come and check it out."

Juna's eyes lit up. "That sounds amazing! When and where should I come?"

The two friends made plans, catching up on each other's lives as they chatted. Juna told Lena about her latest design project, a sustainable fashion line she was working on with a small startup.

As the afternoon wore on, Juna realized just how much she had missed her friend. They reminisced about old times and shared stories about their respective passions. The quiet café became a haven for them to reconnect and recapture the laughter they once shared.

As the sun began to set outside, Lena stood up, brushing off her jeans. "I should get going soon. But Juna Eriksson, can I ask you something?"

"Of course," Juna replied, curious.

Lena hesitated before speaking. "Do you ever think about what could have been? The paths we didn't take, the choices we made?"

Juna's expression turned thoughtful. "Sometimes, yeah. But life is full of detours and surprises. I'm just grateful for this moment with you now."

The two friends shared a warm smile as Lena left the café, Juna feeling rejuvenated and ready to face whatever came next.
