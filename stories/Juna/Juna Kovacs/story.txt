Juna Kovacs stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar landscape of Budapest's Gellert Hill district. As an ex-CIA operative turned freelance security consultant, she had seen her fair share of cities, but there was something about this one that always drew her back.

She made her way to the café where she had agreed to meet with her client, a wealthy businessman named Viktor. Juna Kovacs ordered a strong coffee and waited for him to arrive, her eyes taking in the eclectic mix of locals and tourists milling about.

Viktor burst through the door, a manic energy radiating from his very presence. "Juna, I'm so glad you could make it," he exclaimed, shaking her hand firmly. "I have a situation that requires your unique... skills."

Juna raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite herself. "What's the job?" she asked, pulling out her notebook and pen.

Viktor hesitated, glancing around the café nervously before leaning in close. "I've been receiving threatening messages from a rival businessman," he whispered. "I need someone to... investigate."

Juna nodded, already thinking several steps ahead. She had dealt with her fair share of corporate espionage, and this seemed like just another case. But as she listened to Viktor's concerns and began asking questions, she sensed that there was more to it than met the eye.

"Tell me," she pressed, "who is your rival?"

Viktor's expression turned guarded, but Juna Kovacs could see a flicker of fear in his eyes. She knew when someone was hiding something. And as they parted ways and she began her investigation, Juna couldn't shake the feeling that this job was going to be more complicated - and potentially deadlier - than she had initially thought.

As she walked away from the café, Juna Kovacs lit a cigarette and took a long drag, letting the city's energy wash over her. She knew that Budapest would always hold a piece of her heart, but it also held secrets - and sometimes, those were the things that needed to be uncovered.
