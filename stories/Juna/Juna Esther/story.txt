Juna Esther had always been fascinated by the ancient art of astrology. As a young girl, she spent hours poring over dusty tomes in her father's library, learning about the intricate movements of the stars and planets. Her parents, both astronomers themselves, encouraged her curiosity, and Juna Esther soon found herself captivated by the secrets of the universe.

As she grew older, Juna Esther's passion for astrology only intensified. She began attending seminars and workshops, honing her skills and learning from renowned experts in the field.
