As a journalist, Juna had always been drawn to the darker side of life, seeking out stories that exposed the truth and shed light on social injustices.

One day, while working on a investigative piece about corruption in the government, Juna received a cryptic message from an anonymous source. The note read: "Meet me at the old warehouse at midnight. Come alone." Despite her reservations, Juna's curiosity got the better of her, and she decided to take a chance.
