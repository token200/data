Álvaro Dufresne was known for his sharp wit and quick tongue in the high-stakes world of underground poker games. His nickname "The Fox" had earned him a reputation as a player who could outmaneuver even the most seasoned opponents.

One night, Álvaro Dufresne walked into the dimly lit club, his eyes scanning the room for the familiar faces of his fellow players. He spotted Juan and made his way over to their table, exchanging warm smiles with his friends. As they settled in for a long evening of cards, Álvaro Dufresne couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement – he was on a hot streak, and he knew it.

The game began, and the players quickly fell into a rhythm. Juan made some bold bets, but Álvaro Dufresne remained calm, his mind working overtime to outthink each opponent. As the night wore on, he found himself in a heated game against a new player, a woman with piercing green eyes who seemed almost as skilled as he was.

The two of them went head-to-head for hours, the tension building with each hand. Álvaro Dufresne knew he had to keep his cool if he wanted to come out on top. He took a deep breath and focused on the game, letting his instincts guide him rather than his emotions.

In the end, it was just Álvaro Dufresne against the woman, with the pot hanging precariously in the balance. He raised her by a small margin, and she hesitated for a moment before calling. The cards were dealt, and Álvaro Dufresne let out a triumphant whoop as he saw his hand take down the game.

As they packed up to leave, Juan turned to him with a grin. "You're on fire tonight, Álvaro Dufresne," he said. Álvaro Dufresne just chuckled and shook his head – but deep down, he knew that tonight had been something special. He was indeed The Fox, and no one could outsmart him when it came to cards.
