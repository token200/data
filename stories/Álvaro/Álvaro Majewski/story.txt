Álvaro Majewski stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. The small town of San Rafael lay before him like a ghost town, its main street lined with crumbling buildings that seemed to lean in as if sharing a secret.

As he made his way through the quiet streets, Álvaro felt a sense of unease settle over him. He had left his home in Buenos Aires a year ago, seeking solace from the memories that haunted him. But now, as he approached his family's old estate on the outskirts of town, he wondered if he was running from the past or towards it.

Álvaro's parents had been killed in a car accident when he was just a teenager, and their deaths had left him with a void that could never be filled. He had always felt like an outsider in his own community, as if his grief made him invisible to those around him. But the further away from Buenos Aires he got, the more he began to realize that his sense of identity was tied to the memories of his family.

As he pushed open the creaky gate and stepped onto the overgrown lawn, Álvaro felt a pang in his chest. The once-grand mansion stood before him, its windows shattered, its paint peeling like worn skin. He walked through the empty halls, his footsteps echoing off the walls as if they were trying to shake loose some hidden truth.

Álvaro's eyes landed on a faded photograph hanging on the wall - an old family portrait, taken when he was just a boy. His parents sat beside him, their faces warm and smiling, while Álvaro himself looked like a child lost in their gaze. He remembered that day, the way his mother had told him to smile for the camera, how his father's eyes crinkled at the corners as he ruffled his hair.

For a moment, Álvaro forgot about the ghosts of San Rafael, and let himself get lost in the familiar rhythms of his childhood. But as the light began to set, casting long shadows across the room, he knew that some wounds would never fully heal. He took one last look at the photograph, then turned away from it, leaving the past to its secrets once more.

As he walked back through the gate, Álvaro felt a sense of uncertainty settle over him like a shroud. Would he ever find a way to forgive himself for being alive while his parents were gone? Or would this place remain forever trapped between memories and longing?
