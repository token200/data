The team that had accompanied him on this expedition had been dwindling all week, but Álvaro Ozols remained steadfast, driven by an insatiable curiosity about the culture that once thrived here.

The locals called him "El Misionero", or The Missionary, due to his tireless efforts to unravel the mysteries of their own history.
