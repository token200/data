In the bustling streets of Barcelona, a young and enigmatic figure named Álvaro Salonen emerged from the shadows. With an air of mystery surrounding him, Álvaro's piercing green eyes seemed to hold secrets that only he knew.

Born Álvaro Salonen, the son of a family of modest means, had always felt like an outsider in his own city. Growing up, he was drawn to the works of Gaudí and Miró, finding solace in their surreal landscapes.
