Álvaro López sat at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of papers in front of him. As a successful businessman, he had it all: wealth, influence, and a reputation for being ruthless in the boardroom. But lately, he'd been feeling empty inside.

Just yesterday, Álvaro had received an unexpected visit from his old friend, Sofía, who had grown up on the streets of Buenos Aires. She had spent years working as a nurse, dedicating her life to helping others, and yet Álvaro couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy.

"Sofía, what's your secret?" he asked, sipping his coffee.

"I don't have one," she replied with a smile. "I just do what feels right."

Álvaro sighed and rubbed his temples. He had always put business first, never considering the impact it had on those around him. But now, as he approached his 40th birthday, he was starting to wonder if there was more to life than closing deals and making money.

As he sat at his desk, staring blankly at his papers, Álvaro's mind began to wander. He thought about all the times he had prioritized profits over people, sacrificing his relationships and reputation for the sake of success.

Just then, his phone rang. It was Sofía, calling to check in on him. "Álvaro, I know you're busy," she said, "but I want to talk to you about something."

Álvaro's heart skipped a beat as he listened to her words. Sofía had decided to start a new charity, one that aimed to provide medical care to underprivileged children in Argentina.

"I want you to be my partner, Álvaro," she said. "I know we can make a difference together."

Álvaro's eyes welled up with tears as he listened to Sofía's words. He knew it was time for him to change. It was time for him to start putting people before profits.

With newfound determination, Álvaro hung up the phone and began making calls of his own. He started working on a new business model, one that prioritized social responsibility over profit margins.

As he looked at the papers in front of him, Álvaro felt a sense of excitement wash over him. For the first time in years, he felt like he was doing something meaningful.
