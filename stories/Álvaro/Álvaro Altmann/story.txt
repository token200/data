Álvaro Altmann stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, his eyes scanning the rooftops for any sign of life. As a private investigator in the city's seedy underbelly, he had seen it all before. But tonight was different. Tonight, he had received a cryptic message from an old acquaintance, claiming to have information about his sister's disappearance.

Álvaro's sister, Sofía, had vanished five years ago, leaving behind only a whispered rumor of kidnapping and extortion. The police had given up on the case, but Álvaro refused to let go. He spent countless nights scouring the city for clues, talking to anyone who might have seen or heard something.

As he walked down the alleyway, the flickering streetlights casting eerie shadows on the walls, Álvaro noticed a figure watching him from across the street. The figure nodded once, before melting into the darkness. Álvaro quickened his pace, following the signal to a dilapidated bar on the outskirts of town.

 Inside, the air reeked of stale beer and desperation. Álvaro spotted his acquaintance, a grizzled old hacker named Rigo, hunched over a computer terminal. "Álvaro," Rigo said without looking up, "I've been digging through some old files."

Álvaro took a seat next to Rigo, his eyes scanning the screen as Rigo revealed the shocking truth: Sofía's disappearance was just the tip of the iceberg. The case was linked to a powerful corporation that had infiltrated every level of the city's government.

"You're saying they kidnapped her?" Álvaro asked, his anger boiling over.

Rigo nodded grimly. "The corporation is involved in some shady dealings, Álvaro. And Sofía stumbled into something she shouldn't have."

Álvaro felt a surge of determination course through his veins. He would find out the truth about his sister's disappearance, no matter what it took. As he stood to leave, Rigo handed him a small USB drive.

"This is all I could find," Rigo said quietly. "Be careful, Álvaro. You're playing with fire."

With the USB drive safely in hand, Álvaro stepped back into the night, ready to take on whatever lay ahead. The game had changed – he was now a pawn in a much larger battle for truth and justice.
