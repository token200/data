Álvaro Saldaña stepped out into the warm Spanish sunlight, his eyes scanning the bustling streets of Granada. A young man with a quick wit and sharp tongue, he navigated the narrow alleys with ease, weaving past the vendors and shoppers.

As a member of the royal guard, Álvaro had seen it all - from grand ceremonies to private executions. But despite the dangers that came with his job, he loved the sense of purpose that came with serving as a protector of the realm.

Álvaro's thoughts turned to the upcoming tournament, where the greatest knights in the land would gather to compete for the favor of their lord. He had spent weeks training, honing his skills on the jousting field and perfecting his swordplay.

As he walked, Álvaro noticed a group of travelers huddled together at a street corner, speaking in hushed tones. They glanced nervously at him as he approached, but Álvaro merely nodded in greeting before continuing on his way.

He couldn't help but wonder what had brought these strangers to Granada - were they seeking refuge or hiding from something? Whatever their story, Álvaro was determined to remain vigilant, for in the world of politics and intrigue, loyalty was a luxury few could afford.

As he made his way back to the palace, Álvaro's thoughts turned to his own uncertain future. His father, a humble blacksmith, had died when Álvaro was just a boy - a tragic accident that had left him with no inheritance and a sense of purposelessness.

But service in the royal guard had given Álvaro a new lease on life. For the first time since his father's passing, he felt like he had a true calling, something that set him apart from the common folk.

Álvaro pushed open the door to the palace and strode into the great hall, where his fellow guardsmen were gathered around a roaring fire. The evening meal was already underway, with plates of steaming paella filling the air.

As Álvaro took his seat at the table, he felt a sense of belonging that went beyond mere duty - it was as if he had finally found his place in the world. And for tonight, at least, all was right with the world.
