One evening, Álvaro Liepiņš found himself at a high-stakes poker game in a luxurious hotel. The room was filled with wealthy businessmen and socialites, all vying for a chance to win big. Álvaro Liepiņš was there on a mission to steal a valuable gemstone from one of the players.

As he sat down at the table, his eyes scanned the room, searching for the perfect mark. He noticed a wealthy businessman named Marcus, who seemed oblivious to the risks around him. Álvaro Liepiņš made his move, feigning defeat and gaining Marcus's trust.
