One such day took Álvaro Jansone to a small village nestled in the heart of rural Estonia. The villagers had long abandoned their ancient church, leaving it to crumble into the mist-shrouded woods. But Álvaro saw potential. With his team of skilled artisans, he set out to restore the wooden pews and intricately carved altar.
