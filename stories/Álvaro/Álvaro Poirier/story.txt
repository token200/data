Álvaro Poirier was a man of contradictions. By day, he worked as an accountant in a small firm in Montreal, surrounded by spreadsheets and tax returns that would put even the most devoted spreadsheet enthusiasts to sleep. But by night, he donned a different persona: a skilled saxophonist who jammed with his friends at underground clubs around the city.

Álvaro's love affair with jazz began when he was just a teenager, sneaking into Montreal's iconic Cabaret du Mile End to listen to impromptu sets by local musicians. As he grew older, his passion for the music only intensified, and he spent countless hours practicing on his alto saxophone, trying to perfect the soulful sounds of John Coltrane and Charlie Parker.

Despite his success as a musician, Álvaro felt stuck in his life. He was good at accounting, but it wasn't fulfilling. He longed for the freedom and creativity that came with playing music. One night, after a particularly grueling workweek, he decided to take a leap of faith: he quit his job and began performing at local clubs under his own name.

At first, it was tough. Álvaro's accounting skills didn't translate well to managing finances for a band, and the constant uncertainty of being paid or not was stressful. But as word spread about the talented saxophonist with the " secret life," he found himself playing sold-out shows at Montreal's most exclusive venues.

As his confidence grew, so did his artistry. Álvaro began to experiment with new sounds, incorporating elements of Latin music and African rhythms into his playing style. The result was a unique fusion that captivated audiences and earned him critical acclaim from local music critics.

Years later, when asked about the turning point in his life, Álvaro would smile wistfully and say, "It was that one night when I realized that life is full of unexpected turns and twists – sometimes you have to take a leap of faith just to find your true path." He glanced at his saxophone, tucked away in its case, and began to play the opening notes of "Meditation" – a song he wrote on the day he made the decision to pursue music full-time.
