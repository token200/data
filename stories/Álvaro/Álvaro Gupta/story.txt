Álvaro Enrique González de la Fuente was known to his friends and family as Álvaro, but he preferred to be addressed by his full name whenever possible. To him, being remembered by one's entire identity was a matter of personal pride.

As a young man growing up in Buenos Aires, Álvaro had always felt like an outsider. His parents, though loving, were from different worlds – his mother a wealthy socialite and his father a humble street vendor. This dichotomy often led to feelings of disconnection within himself.

However, as he matured, Álvaro began to find solace in his art. He became enamored with the works of the great Argentine painters, particularly Fernando Faderio – who shared his passion for bold colors and expressive brushstrokes. It was during a visit to the Faderio Museum that Álvaro discovered his true calling: capturing the beauty of Buenos Aires through his own lens.

Years went by, and Álvaro's talent flourished. His paintings adorned galleries across Argentina, earning him recognition both domestically and internationally. People marveled at his unique perspective on the city he loved so deeply. Though his style diverged from Faderio's, Álvaro felt an undeniable connection to the master – as if a piece of Faderio himself had been passed down through generations.

One evening, Álvaro received an invitation to showcase his work at the prestigious Galería Nacional. Overwhelmed with excitement, he couldn't help but think back to the countless hours spent as a young boy watching Faderio's works come alive before him. As he set up his paintings in preparation for the exhibition, he whispered a silent prayer – hoping that this moment would be enough to prove himself worthy of being remembered by more than just his full name.

The night of the exhibition arrived, and Álvaro stood nervously beside his art pieces, awaiting the arrival of his friends, family, and strangers alike. The room filled with an air of anticipation as people began to explore the vibrant works on display. And in that moment, Álvaro knew he had finally found a sense of belonging – not just because of his paintings but also due to the recognition of being remembered for who he truly was: Álvaro Enrique González de la Fuente.
