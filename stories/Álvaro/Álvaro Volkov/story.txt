Álvaro Volkov stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the familiar streets of Budapest. The city was always a haven for him, its winding alleys and grand architecture a reminder of the Europe he had once called home.

It had been years since Álvaro's last visit to this place, but the memories still lingered in his mind like a ghostly presence. He thought back to his life before, the one he had left behind when he'd been forced to flee Russia.

As he walked through the city, Álvaro felt a sense of disconnection from the world around him. He was no longer part of it, not anymore. His past was a weight that he carried with him always, a constant reminder of what he'd lost and what he could never have again.

He stopped at a small café on the edge of the city, ordering a cup of black coffee as he took a seat at the bar. The bartender, a gruff but kind-eyed man named József, recognized Álvaro immediately.

"Welcome back, Álvaro," József said, his voice low and gravelly. "It's been too long."

Álvaro smiled wryly. "Too long indeed, József. I've missed this city."

József chuckled. "You always were a man of the streets, Álvaro. Even in exile, you can't shake off the call of home."

As they talked, Álvaro felt a sense of peace wash over him. He had been running for so long, always looking over his shoulder, waiting for the other shoe to drop. But today, he felt like he could finally breathe.

The sun was setting as Álvaro left the café, the sky ablaze with color. He walked slowly through the streets, taking in the sights and sounds of a city that still held a piece of his heart.

Eventually, he found himself back at the station, where a train was waiting for him. This one was bound for Moscow, and Álvaro knew it would be his last stop before he disappeared into the shadows once more.

As he boarded the train, he felt a sense of resolve settle over him. He had a past to outrun, but he also had a future to build. The journey ahead of him would be fraught with danger and uncertainty, but for the first time in years, Álvarov Volkov felt like he was ready.
