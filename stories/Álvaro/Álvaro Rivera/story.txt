He spent hours exploring the rolling hills and forests surrounding his home, imagining structures that would blend seamlessly into their natural surroundings.

As he grew older, Álvaro's fascination with architecture only deepened. He pursued a degree in architecture, honing his skills and learning from some of the best minds in the field.
