Natalia Gonz√°lez sat alone in her small apartment, staring out the window at the grey city sky. She had just received an email from her old university, inviting her to return for her alma mater's 10-year reunion. The thought sent a pang of anxiety through her chest.

It had been a decade since Natalia graduated with honors in literature, full of hope and dreams for a future in publishing. But life had taken a different turn. She had struggled to find stable employment, working a series of part-time jobs while trying to make ends meet. Her passion for writing had never fully waned, but the doubts and fears that crept in with every failed submission or rejection letter had become overwhelming.

As she gazed out at the bustling streets below, Natalia couldn't help but think about what could have been. Would she be a published author by now? Was her dream of working in publishing nothing more than a pipe dream?

The doorbell rang, breaking the silence. It was her best friend from college, Maria, who had come to surprise her with lunch and some much-needed company. Over sandwiches and coffee, Maria asked Natalia about the reunion invitation.

At first, Natalia hesitated, not wanting to burden Maria with her fears and doubts. But as they talked, she began to open up. Maria listened attentively, nodding along as Natalia shared stories of her writing struggles and self-doubt. When Natalia finished speaking, Maria took a deep breath and said, "You know, Natalia, your passion for writing is still here, it's just been put on hold."

Maria reminded Natalia of the countless times she had praised her writing skills during their university days, saying that Natalia was one of the most talented writers they had ever met. "Your stories are full of life and emotion," Maria said. "You have a gift, and I truly believe you can make it work."

Natalia felt a weight lift off her shoulders as she listened to Maria's words. Maybe this reunion wasn't about what could have been, but about where she was now and what lay ahead. She realized that she didn't need to have it all figured out; she just needed to take the next step.

With renewed determination, Natalia picked up her pen and began writing once more. The words flowed effortlessly onto the page, carrying with them a message of hope and resilience.
