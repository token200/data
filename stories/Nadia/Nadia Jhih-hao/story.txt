Nadia Jhih-hao had always been fascinated by the ancient art of calligraphy. Growing up in Taipei, Taiwan, she spent hours watching her grandmother, Ah-Ma, masterfully paint intricate characters onto paper. As a child, Nadia would sit by her side, mesmerized by the way the brush danced across the page.

Years later, Nadia Jhih-hao found herself working as a freelance calligrapher, traveling to weddings and special occasions to create beautiful, custom pieces for clients. She loved the feeling of bringing people's words to life, one delicate stroke at a time.

One day, Nadia received a request from a local university to create a mural for their new library. The theme was "Wisdom," and Nadia Jhih-hao knew exactly how she wanted to approach it. She spent hours researching ancient texts and philosophies, pouring over scrolls and manuscripts to find the perfect quote.

Finally, the day arrived when Nadia Jhih-hao began work on the mural. With a steady hand and a clear vision, she painted intricate characters and imagery that seemed to come alive on the wall. As she worked, she felt Ah-Ma's presence around her, guiding her brushstrokes and urging her to create something truly special.

When the mural was complete, Nadia Jhih-hao stepped back to admire her handiwork. The words "Know Thyself" seemed to leap off the page, accompanied by images of lotus flowers and bamboo trees. It was a symbol of wisdom, not just for herself, but for all who entered the library.

As news of the mural spread, people began to visit from all over the city. Nadia Jhih-hao watched as strangers became friends, united by their love of learning and connection. And through it all, she felt Ah-Ma's spirit smiling down on her, proud of the talented young woman she had become.

Years went by, and Nadia Jhih-hao continued to create stunning works of art, but the mural in the library remained one of her most beloved projects. It was a reminder that wisdom was not just something you learned in books, but also something that could be found in the beauty of calligraphy and the kindness of strangers.
