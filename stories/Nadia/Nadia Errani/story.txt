I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Nadia Errani. It's possible that you meant to ask for a story about a different character or provided incorrect information.

However, I can suggest a few alternatives:

1. If you're looking for a story about a real-life tennis player named Nadia Errani, I can try to find information on her and write a story based on her actual experiences.
2. Alternatively, I can create a fictional character named Nadia Errani and write a story around her.

Please let me know which option you prefer, or provide more context about the character you have in mind.
