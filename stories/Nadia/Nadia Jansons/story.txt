Nadia Jansons stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar streets of Stockholm. It had been five years since she'd last set foot in her hometown, and yet, the city felt like a second home.

As a young journalist, Nadia had made a name for herself investigating corruption and crime on both sides of the border. Her fearless reporting had earned her a reputation as one of the most tenacious reporters in the business.

But when her sister, a Swedish citizen living abroad, had gone missing, Nadia's priorities had shifted. She'd left her lucrative job at a major newspaper to track down her family member and uncover the truth about her disappearance.

Now, five years later, Nadia stood outside the small café where she'd agreed to meet an anonymous source who claimed to have information on her sister's whereabouts. The sun was setting over the city, casting long shadows across the deserted streets.

Nadia took a deep breath, pushed open the door and stepped inside. The air was thick with the smell of freshly brewed coffee and worn furniture. She spotted a figure in the corner, hood up and face obscured.

"Who are you?" Nadia demanded, her voice firm but controlled.

The figure slowly stood up, revealing a woman with piercing green eyes and a messy bob. "I'm someone who's been watching you," she said, her accent unmistakably Swedish. "You're searching for answers, aren't you?"

Nadia nodded, her heart racing. "Yes. My sister went missing five years ago. I need to know what happened to her."

The woman leaned in close, her voice barely above a whisper. "Your sister was involved in something big," she said. "Something that could put your entire family at risk. But I can help you get closer to the truth."

Nadia's eyes locked onto the woman's, a spark of hope igniting within her. This could be it – the break she'd been searching for. She leaned forward, ready to listen and uncover the secrets that had been hidden in plain sight.

As they sat down at a small table by the window, Nadia felt a sense of determination wash over her. Five years later, she was closer than ever to finding out what had happened to her sister – and she wasn't going to let anything stand in her way.
