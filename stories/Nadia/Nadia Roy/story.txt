Nadia Aisha Roy was a free-spirited artist, known for her vibrant paintings and infectious smile. Growing up in Mumbai, India, Nadia's creativity was nurtured by her parents, who encouraged her to explore her passion for art from a young age.

As she grew older, Nadia became increasingly fascinated with the stories of her ancestors, who had migrated to India from Bangladesh during the Partition.
