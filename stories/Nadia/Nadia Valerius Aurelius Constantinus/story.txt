As she pored over ancient texts and observed the celestial ballet, Nadia began to make groundbreaking discoveries that would shake the foundations of Egyptology. Her fascination with the movements of the planets led her to develop innovative theories about the nature of the universe.

Imhotep, impressed by Nadia's intellect and dedication, took her under his wing and mentored her in the art of divination. Together, they deciphered the secrets of the stars, using the positions of the planets to predict celestial events and guide the pharaohs' decisions.
