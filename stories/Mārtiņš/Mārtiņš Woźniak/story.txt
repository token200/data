I couldn't find any information on a person named Mārtiņš Woźniak. It's possible that this person is fictional or not well-known. 

However, I can create a story about a character with the given name:

In the heart of Riga, Latvia, lived Mārtiņš Woźniak, a young and talented musician. He spent most of his days practicing the violin and perfecting his compositions. With a passion that rivaled his love for traditional Latvian folk music, he sought to create something unique – a blend of classical and modern sounds.

One day, while exploring the city's art scene, Mārtiņš Woźniak stumbled upon a small, quirky café that became his new haven. The owner, an eccentric artist named Jānis, took notice of Mārtiņš Woźniak's exceptional talent and offered him a spot at one of the café's weekly music nights.

Mārtiņš Woźniak's performance was met with thunderous applause. The crowd was captivated by his emotive playing style and original compositions, which seamlessly wove together traditional Latvian melodies with contemporary themes. Word spread quickly about the young virtuoso, and soon he found himself performing at various venues across Riga.

As Mārtiņš Woźniak's career took off, he never forgot his humble beginnings in that small café. He remained true to his art, constantly pushing the boundaries of what was possible with the violin. His music became a reflection of his unique perspective, born from his experiences growing up in Latvia.

Years later, when Mārtiņš Woźniak looked back on his journey, he knew that it was Jānis' chance encounter that had set him on the path to success. The café, once a refuge, now served as a reminder of where his passion for music began. With every note, Mārtiņš Woźniak transported himself and others back to those early days in Riga, his violin singing with a voice that was both nostalgic and timeless.
