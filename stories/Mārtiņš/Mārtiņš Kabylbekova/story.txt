Mārtiņš Kabylbekova was a brilliant and resourceful young scientist who had always been fascinated by the mysteries of the natural world. Growing up in a small village in Latvia, she spent countless hours exploring the forests and meadows around her home, collecting leaves and rocks, and observing the behavior of the local wildlife.

As she grew older, Mārtiņš Kabylbekova became increasingly interested in botany and ecology, and she spent many years studying at some of the top universities in Europe.
