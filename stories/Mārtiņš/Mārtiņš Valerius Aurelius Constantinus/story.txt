In the quaint village of Riga, Latvia, a young boy named Mārtiņš Valerius Aurelius Constantinus was born with a heart full of wonder and a mind full of curiosity. His parents, both historians and archaeologists, had always instilled in him a love for the past, and Mārtiņš was no exception.

As he grew older, Mārtiņš became fascinated with the stories of his ancestors, who had fought bravely against the invaders of Livonia. He spent hours poring over dusty tomes in the village library, devouring tales of battles won and lost, and the legendary leaders who had shaped the fate of Latvia.
