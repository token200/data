Harley Järv stood at the edge of the frozen lake, her breath visible in the frigid air. She was a loner, content to spend her days exploring the vast wilderness of northern Finland. Few people knew much about her past, and she liked it that way.

As a child, Harley had been forced to move from place to place, never staying in one spot for too long. Her parents had been refugees, fleeing war-torn Europe with nothing but the clothes on their backs. They'd settled briefly in this very region, where Harley's father had found work as a logger. But even that was short-lived – her parents had grown tired of the harsh winters and the endless struggle to make ends meet.

One night, they vanished.

Harley woke up alone, with no memory of what had happened to them. The authorities searched for them, but there were no leads, no clues. Some said she'd been abandoned by her parents, while others whispered that she was a product of some sinister government experiment. Whatever the truth was, Harley knew one thing – she was on her own.

She'd spent years honing her survival skills, learning to navigate the treacherous forests and ice-covered lakes with ease. She'd built a small cabin on the outskirts of a remote village, where she kept a fire burning and a pot of tea simmering. It was a simple life, but it was hers.

As she gazed out across the frozen expanse, Harley felt a sense of peace wash over her. This was her home – cold, unforgiving, and beautiful in its own way. She knew every rock, every tree, every patch of ice that formed on the surface of the lake. She knew where to find game, where to avoid danger.

A faint rustling sound broke the silence – a moose, perhaps, or a rabbit? Harley's eyes scanned the horizon, her hand instinctively reaching for the knife she kept at her belt. But as she watched, a figure emerged from the trees – an old man, dressed in worn leather and wool.

"Kakun, you're a hard woman to find," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "I've been searching for you for years."

Harley raised an eyebrow. "Who are you?" she asked, her tone neutral.

"My name is Soini," the old man replied, with a slight bow. "And I'm here to tell you that it's time to come home – not just home to this place, but home to yourself. You've been running for so long, Harley Järv – maybe it's time to stop."

Harley hesitated, unsure what to make of Soini's words. But as she looked out across the frozen lake, she felt a spark of curiosity ignite within her. Maybe, just maybe, it was time to uncover the secrets of her past and learn who this old man claimed to be.
