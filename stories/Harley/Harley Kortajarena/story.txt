Harley Kortajarena was not your typical supermodel. With her fierce and unapologetic attitude, she turned heads wherever she walked onto the catwalk. Born in Los Angeles to Filipino parents, Harley's parents instilled in her a strong sense of self-worth and confidence that served her well in the cutthroat world of modeling.

As a teenager, Harley began working as a waitress and a part-time model, but it wasn't until she was discovered by a prominent fashion designer at a local mall that her career really took off. Her unique look - a blend of Asian features, piercing brown eyes, and raven-black hair - caught the eye of top designers and photographers worldwide.

But Harley's success came with a price. She faced racism, sexism, and body shaming from some corners of the industry, and struggled to reconcile her tough exterior with the pressures of being a model. Despite this, she persevered, using her platform to speak out against social injustices and support causes close to her heart.

As her fame grew, so did her personal style. Harley became known for her bold fashion choices - think chunky boots, crop tops, and ripped jeans - which some critics called attention-seeking, but fans adored as a reflection of her fearless attitude.

One of the most iconic moments in Harley's career came when she landed the cover shoot for "Vogue" at 25. Her edgy, avant-garde look caught the eye of photographer Annie Leibovitz and catapulted her to international stardom. Suddenly, she was on every fashion magazine cover, gracing runways from Paris to New York.

Throughout her journey, Harley remained fiercely loyal to her roots, frequently returning to Los Angeles for family gatherings and working with Filipino brands and designers. She became a role model for many young women of color, proof that with hard work and determination, they too could achieve their dreams.

Years later, when asked about the secret to her success, Harley smiled wickedly: "It's not about being perfect - it's about being unapologetically yourself."
