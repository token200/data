It was a grassroots effort, but one that brought about significant change. For the first time in years, local politicians began to listen to the voices of those they had long ignored.

As Harley's star continued to rise, she remained humble and grounded. She continued to work tirelessly behind the scenes, building coalitions and mobilizing her community. And though she faced setbacks and obstacles along the way, she never wavered in her commitment to justice.
