Harley Clarke stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. The mist-shrouded streets of Ravenswood seemed to whisper secrets to each other as she walked through the deserted town. She had come seeking answers, but so far, only questions.

As a private investigator, Harley had solved her fair share of cases, but this one was different. A local businessman, wealthy and influential, had gone missing, leaving behind only a cryptic message: "The Devil's in the Details."

Harley had always been fascinated by the enigmatic note, and now she found herself on the trail once more, determined to uncover the truth. She hailed a cab and headed to the mansion where the businessman had last been seen.

The driver dropped her off at the entrance, where a stern-looking butler stood guarding the door. "Can I help you?" he asked, eyeing Harley's worn leather jacket and battered fedora.

"I'm here for Mr. Harrington," she said, flashing a smile that seemed to unsettle the butler.

The man hesitated before stepping aside, revealing a cavernous hallway lined with portraits of Harrington ancestors. Harley followed him through the labyrinthine corridors, her mind whirling with theories and possibilities.

As they reached the study where Harrington had been last seen, Harley noticed something peculiar: a faint scratch on the doorframe that looked almost...artistic. She knelt to examine it closer, her eyes locking onto a tiny detail she'd missed before – a sketch of a skull with a single word etched beneath it: "Paz".

A shiver ran down her spine as Harley realized that this was no ordinary case. The missing businessman's disappearance was linked to an unsolved art theft a decade ago. She made a mental note to investigate further.

As she stood up, the butler appeared at her side once more. "You're quite...enthusiastic," he said dryly, leading Harley into the study.

Harrington lay on the floor, his eyes frozen in terror. On his chest was an open book with a single passage highlighted: "A devil lies in the details."

Harley knew that this was it – she had finally found the missing piece of the puzzle. But as she took in the scene before her, she couldn't shake off the feeling that she'd only scratched the surface of something far darker, far more sinister.

And then she heard a faint whisper from the shadows: "You'll never be able to leave Ravenswood."

Harley Clarke's eyes narrowed. The game had just begun.
