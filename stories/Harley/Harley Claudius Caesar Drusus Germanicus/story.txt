As the sun beat down upon her back, Harley spotted a figure on the horizon. She quickened her pace, her hand instinctively reaching for the dagger at her belt. It was her loyal companion, a battle-hardened soldier named Marcus.

"Hail, Harley," Marcus called out as she approached him. "I see you're as determined as ever."
