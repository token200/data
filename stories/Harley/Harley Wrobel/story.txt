One sunny afternoon, Harley Wrobel welcomed a nervous new client into her colorful studio. Emily had always dreamed of trying a bold, edgy style, but was terrified of messing it up. Harley Wrobel listened attentively as Emily described her vision: a vibrant, asymmetrical look that would make her stand out in a crowd.

Without hesitation, Harley Wrobel got to work. She snipped and styled with precision, her scissors flying through the air like a dancer's fingers on a piano.
