I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Harley Saldana. It's possible that this is a new or made-up character.

However, I can create a new story for you with a different character named Harley Quinn, who is a popular DC Comics villain and has been portrayed by actress Margot Robbie in various films, including "Suicide Squad" (2016) and "Birds of Prey" (2020). If you'd like, I can write a story featuring Harley Quinn instead.

Alternatively, if you'd like to create your own character named Harley Saldana, I can help you with that as well!
