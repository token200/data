Harley Koskinen walked into the dimly lit jazz club, scanning the crowded room for a familiar face. The saxophonist's fingers danced across the keys as he led the band through a soulful rendition of Miles Davis' "So What." Harley spotted her friend, Jack, sitting at the bar and made her way over.

As she approached, Jack looked up and flashed a smile. "Harley Koskinen, always a pleasure to see you here," he said, holding out his hand for a handshake.

Harley laughed and took a seat beside him. "Hey, it's not often I get to escape the studio and just enjoy some music," she replied, ordering a whiskey as they chatted about everything from the latest art exhibit to their shared love of obscure folk songs.

As they sipped their drinks, the band launched into an upbeat tune that had everyone in the room tapping their feet. Harley found herself drawn into the music, feeling her worries and cares melting away with each lively chord.

The night wore on, with Jack regaling her with tales of his latest adventures as a travel writer. Harley listened intently, offering words of encouragement when needed. As they laughed together, she couldn't help but feel grateful for this friendship that had stood the test of time.

As the clock struck midnight, the band slowed their tempo and launched into a haunting ballad that sent shivers down Harley's spine. She closed her eyes, letting the music wash over her like a balm to her soul. In these moments, with Jack by her side and the sweet sounds of jazz swirling around them, she felt at peace.

As they left the club an hour later, arms slung over each other's shoulders, Harley smiled up at Jack. "Thanks for tonight," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "It was just what I needed."

Jack grinned back down at her. "Anytime, Koskinen. We'll be here whenever you need it."
