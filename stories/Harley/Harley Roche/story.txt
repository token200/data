Harley Roche was known for being one step ahead of her adversaries, and she reveled in the notoriety that came with it. A master thief and con artist, she had a knack for slipping in and out of tight spots unnoticed. Her exploits had earned her a place in the annals of local legend, with some even whispering that she was more than just a skilled crook.

Harley's latest target was the prestigious Bellvue Museum, where an esteemed collection of rare artifacts hung precariously on display. She spent weeks casing the joint, studying the security guards' schedules and timing the museum's evening events to plan her heist.

As the night of the museum visit arrived, Harley slipped into a tailored black dress and sashayed through the crowded gala, all the while keeping an eye on the prized items she sought.

Whatever the truth may have been, Harley knew that her reputation had been cemented. As word spread of her daring heist, collectors and connoisseurs from around the world clamored for a glimpse of her next move. She smiled inwardly at their attention, knowing she would be back, leaving a trail of breadcrumbs in her wake.
