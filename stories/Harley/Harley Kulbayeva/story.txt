Harley Kulbayeva was a force to be reckoned with. A former professional ice skater, she had traded in her blades for a life of crime and chaos. With her razor-sharp wit, quick reflexes, and unparalleled agility, she had built a reputation as one of the most elusive and feared thieves in the city.

Harley's latest mark was the priceless Starlight Diamond Necklace, valued at millions on the black market.
