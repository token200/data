One evening, Harley's latest installation caught the attention of local authorities. Her mural, titled "Revolution in Progress," depicted a city in chaos, with flames and debris scattered everywhere. The officials deemed it an affront to public order, but Harley saw it as a call to action – a reminder that change was necessary.
