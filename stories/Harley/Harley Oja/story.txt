Harley Oja stepped into the dimly lit room, her eyes scanning the space with a mixture of curiosity and wariness. The air was thick with the smell of old books and stale coffee, and Harley's stomach growled in response. She had been on the run for days, ever since that fateful night at the warehouse.

As she made her way to the bar, a figure emerged from the shadows. "Harley," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "I've been expecting you."

Harley's instincts flared, but she kept her cool, sipping on the whiskey as the stranger slid onto the stool beside her. He was an old acquaintance, one who owed her a favor - or so Harley thought.

"You're looking for answers," the stranger said, his eyes glinting in the dim light. "But what you really want is revenge."

Harley's grip on her glass tightened, but she forced herself to take a deep breath. She knew better than to let her emotions get the better of her. The last time that happened...the consequences were still fresh in her mind.

"I'm not here for answers," Harley said, trying to sound nonchalant despite the thrumming tension inside her. "I just want justice."

The stranger raised an eyebrow. "Justice? You call what happened at the warehouse 'justice'?"

Harley's eyes flashed with anger, but she bit back a retort. She had already made enemies out of the wrong people; she didn't need to make more.

"Tell me," Harley said instead, her voice steady and even. "What do you know about what really happened that night?"

The stranger hesitated, his eyes darting around the room before coming back to hers. "I may have...acquired some information," he said slowly.

Harley leaned in, her heart pounding with excitement. What secrets lay hidden behind those enigmatic words? And more importantly, was this guy telling the truth?

As they sipped their drinks and traded small talk, Harley's mind whirled with possibilities. Could she trust this stranger? Or was he just playing her like a fiddle? She made a mental note to keep him close - at least for now.

One thing was certain: Harley Oja would not rest until she got the truth about that night. And if it took every ounce of skill and cunning she possessed, she'd make sure those responsible paid in full.
