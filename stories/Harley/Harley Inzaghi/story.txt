One day, while on a solo journey through the ancient city of Petra, Harley stumbled upon an old, mysterious-looking parchment buried deep within a dusty tomb. As she carefully unfolded it, she discovered that it was an original map created by the infamous explorer, Marco Polo, himself.

Harley's eyes widened with excitement as she realized the significance of her discovery. She spent the next few weeks studying the map, poring over every detail and making meticulous notes about its contents. Her dedication to understanding the map led her to create a new, more accurate version, which she titled "Inzaghi's Petra Map".
