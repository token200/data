Samuel Jhih-hao was known for his unorthodox approach to life. As a free-spirited individual, he had no qualms about taking the road less traveled. Growing up in a traditional Taiwanese family, Samuel's parents often found himself at odds with their son's unconventional lifestyle.

Despite their disapproval, Samuel Jhih-hao persevered, following his passions and interests wherever they led him. He spent most of his days exploring the city, discovering hidden gems and secret spots that only a true local would know. His friends affectionately referred to him as "JJ" – a nickname that stuck like glue.

One fateful evening, Samuel Jhih-hao stumbled upon a small, quirky cafe tucked away in a quiet alley. The sign above the door read "Moonlight Serenade," and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted out into the street, enticing passersby to come inside. Intrigued, Samuel pushed open the door and stepped across the threshold.

Inside, he found a cozy haven filled with plush armchairs, vintage instruments, and an eclectic assortment of artwork. A lone pianist sat at the center of it all, her fingers dancing across the keys as she played a haunting melody that seemed to capture the very essence of the night air. Samuel Jhih-hao was captivated, his senses transported to a world beyond his wildest dreams.

For hours, he sat in silence, mesmerized by the music and the atmosphere. The pianist, noticing him for the first time, smiled warmly and introduced herself as Luna. As they talked, Samuel discovered that Luna shared his passion for life's simple pleasures – good food, great company, and the beauty of the unknown.

As the night wore on, Samuel Jhih-hao found himself drawn into a sense of belonging he had never experienced before. Luna welcomed him with open arms, and together they explored the city, seeking out new experiences and making memories that would last a lifetime. And though his parents still disapproved of his unconventional lifestyle, Samuel knew he had finally found a tribe that accepted him for who he was – Samuel Jhih-hao, the free-spirited wanderer with a heart full of wonder.
