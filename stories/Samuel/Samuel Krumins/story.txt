As a child, Samuel's parents had encouraged his individuality by buying him bright pink and electric blue socks to match his vibrant personality. Even as an adult, this quirk remained constant, a comforting ritual amidst the chaos of everyday life.

Samuel's love for odd socks also led him to explore other unconventional fashion choices. He sported striped shirts on Wednesdays and bold patterned pants on Fridays. His eccentric style became legendary among his friends, who affectionately referred to him as "Sock Sam."

He even began crafting bespoke timepieces for his clients, who raved about their precision and beauty. As word spread about the talented "Clock King," people started seeking out Samuel Krumins' expertise, both for practical purposes and as a connoisseur of fine craftsmanship.
