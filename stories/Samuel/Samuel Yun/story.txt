Samuel Yun stepped off the crowded bus and onto the worn sidewalk, his eyes scanning the unfamiliar streets of Seoul. As an American expat living in South Korea for five years, he knew every nook and cranny of the city like the back of his hand – but today, something felt different.

He hailed a taxi and gave the driver an address: 32 Bukchonhan-ro. The old-fashioned wooden buildings seemed to lean in, as if sharing a secret, as they sped through the narrow streets. Samuel's thoughts turned to his estranged grandmother, whom he'd visited briefly during his summer vacation.

As the taxi pulled up in front of a small, serene tea house, Samuel took a deep breath and stepped out onto the quiet alleyway. The owner, Mrs. Kim, looked up from her steaming pot with a warm smile. "Samuel! You're here."

Inside the cozy space, his grandmother sat with her eyes closed, surrounded by the gentle rustle of paper lanterns and the scent of incense. She opened her eyes to Samuel's face and nodded, as if expecting him all along.

"Hello, baji," she whispered, using a term of affection that only she called him.

Over steaming bowls of kimchi stew, they talked about everything: school days, Korean dramas, his life in Seoul. His grandmother listened attentively, her eyes sparkling with understanding and love.

Samuel told her about the job he'd applied for – but hadn't heard back on yet – and the lonely nights spent writing short stories instead of working late shifts. She listened without judgment, as if every thought, worry, or hope that crossed his mind was sacred.

As the evening sun set over the city, Mrs. Kim gently nudged Samuel to hand her a photograph. It was an old family picture – him and his grandmother, taken when he was just a child, at their ancestral home in New Jersey. Tears welled up as she held it close to her heart, holding his gaze.

"You're still my son," she whispered.

"Always have been, baji," Samuel replied softly, letting the familiar words of comfort wrap around him like a warm blanket.

As the night drew to a close, with Mrs. Kim guiding Samuel out into the cool evening air, he felt the weariness lift from his shoulders. Maybe this was what he'd needed all along – not just a job or a destination, but the memories and love that tied him to where he came from.

With a smile on her face, as if she knew the truth he didn't yet see for himself: "You are home now, Samuel."
