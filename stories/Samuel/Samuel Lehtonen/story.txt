Samuel Lehtonen trudged through the snow-covered streets, his eyes fixed on the small café ahead. He had been walking for hours, lost in thought as the biting wind cut through his parka. As he pushed open the door and stepped inside, a warm wave of coffee scented air enveloped him.

Lena, the owner, smiled from behind the counter. "Hey, Sammi! Come to drown your sorrows?" She knew better than to pry when Samuel's eyes clouded over like that.

He took a seat by the window and signaled for his usual. As he sipped his black coffee, memories of his wife, Maria, flooded back. They had been high school sweethearts, and their love had only grown stronger with each passing year. But life had other plans, and Maria's illness had torn them apart.

Samuel let out a deep sigh as the barista asked if he wanted any pastry to go with it. He shook his head, not needing anything more than his coffee to numb the ache in his chest. Lena slipped him an extra shot of espresso, a silent gesture of support.

As he sat there, watching the snow fall outside like tears from the sky, Samuel thought about all the times Maria had been by his side – her laughter echoing through the halls of their old high school, her bright smile lighting up the darkness of winter nights. He recalled the countless afternoons they spent in this very café, sharing stories and dreams over steaming cups.

Samuel's eyes drifted to a framed photo on the counter. Lena had put it there after Maria passed away, knowing how much it brought him comfort. Samuel's gaze lingered on his late wife's bright blue eyes, her long brown hair framing her heart-shaped face. He felt a lump form in his throat as memories of their wedding day and anniversaries came flooding back.

With a quiet thank you to Lena, Samuel left the café and walked into the snowy night once more. Though the pain never truly faded, he knew that by keeping Maria's memory close, the ache would be less overwhelming. And when the world outside seemed too cold, as it often did, Samuel could step into this cozy corner of his heart – where love remained, warm and unwavering.
