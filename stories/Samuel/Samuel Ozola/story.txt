As a child, Samuel Ozola had been fascinated by the ancient tomes hidden away in dusty libraries and forgotten corners of the city.

Years went by, and Samuel Ozola's reputation grew. People whispered about the enigmatic figure who seemed to possess an uncanny understanding of the mystical forces that governed the world. Some claimed he was a sorcerer, while others believed him to be something far more sinister.

Samuel Ozola remained elusive, always staying one step ahead of those who sought to claim his powers for themselves. He walked among them, unseen and unheard, observing the world with an air of detachment. His silence belied a deep empathy, however; he saw beyond the facades that hid people's true nature.

One day, a young woman named Aria stumbled upon Samuel Ozola in a crowded marketplace. She felt an inexplicable jolt, as if she had known him before.
