With the help of László and his fellow artists, Chen Molnár managed to expose the corruption and bring about justice to the people of Budapest. Her bravery and tenacity had earned her a reputation as a fearless journalist, and she was hailed as a hero by the public.

As Chen Molnár stood on the steps of the city hall, accepting an award for her reporting, László slipped up behind her and whispered in her ear, "You're not just a journalist, Chen Molnár. You're a true champion of justice." Chen Molnár smiled, feeling proud to have made a difference in the world.
