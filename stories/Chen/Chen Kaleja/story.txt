Chen Kaleja walked into the dimly lit art gallery, her eyes scanning the room with a mix of curiosity and disdain. As a renowned artist herself, she had seen her fair share of mediocre works, but there was something about this exhibit that caught her attention.

The curator, a man named Mr. Tan, approached her with a warm smile. "Ah, Chen Kaleja, it's an honor to have you here tonight. I've heard great things about your work."

Chen Kaleja raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the curator's familiarity with her name. She had been told that he was a fan of her art, but she had never met him before.

As she made her way through the gallery, Chen Kaleja noticed a series of paintings on display that seemed to be paying homage to her own style. The colors, the brushstrokes, the themes – it all felt eerily familiar. She approached one of the pieces, and as she examined it closer, she saw her own name scribbled in the corner.

"Who created this?" Chen Kaleja asked Mr. Tan, her voice firm but curious.

He hesitated for a moment before responding, "I'm afraid I don't know. The artist wished to remain anonymous."

Chen Kaleja's eyes narrowed, and she turned to leave. She couldn't shake off the feeling that something was amiss. As she walked out of the gallery, she noticed a figure lurking in the shadows – a woman with a striking resemblance to herself.

"Can I help you?" Chen Kaleja asked the woman, her voice firm but wary.

The woman smiled, and Chen Kaleja saw a glimmer of recognition in her eyes. "I'm your doppelganger," she said. "My name is also Chen Kaleja."

Chen Kaleja's mind reeled as she tried to process this revelation. Who was this imposter, and what did she want? She knew one thing for sure – she would get to the bottom of this mystery, no matter what it took.

As she walked away from the gallery, Chen Kaleja couldn't help but wonder if she had created a monster.
