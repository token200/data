She had always dreamed of making a similar impact on her own field, and after completing her Ph.D., she set out to prove herself as one of the leading minds in her field.

Chen's research focused on developing new technologies for harnessing solar and wind energy, with the goal of creating sustainable power sources that could be used by communities around the world.
