Chen Bergström stepped out into the cold Swedish morning, the grey sky mirroring his own mood. He was a man haunted by his past, and today was no exception. The memories of that fateful night still lingered in his mind like an open wound.

It had been five years since he'd fled Shanghai, leaving behind everything he once knew and loved. Five years since his sister's death had shaken him to his core. He'd thought he could escape the pain, but it seemed to follow him wherever he went.

As a renowned detective in Stockholm, Chen had seen his fair share of dark cases, but nothing could have prepared him for what happened that night. The case still lingered in his mind like an unfinished puzzle, and he was determined to find closure.

He walked to the small café on the corner, ordering a black coffee as he sat down at a table by the window. His eyes wandered out into the foggy streets of Stockholm, feeling lost and disconnected from the world around him.

Suddenly, his phone rang, breaking the silence. He hesitated for a moment before answering it, his heart sinking when he heard the familiar voice on the other end – that of Detective Inspector Lina Jensen.

"Chen, I need your help," she said, her tone urgent. "We have a new case, and I think you're the only one who can crack it."

Chen's curiosity was piqued. He agreed to meet her at the station later that day, his mind already racing with possibilities.

The meeting with Lina was brief but intense. She handed him a file containing details of a young woman found dead in an alleyway, with no leads or witnesses in sight.

As Chen delved into the case, something sparked within him – a flame of determination and purpose that he hadn't felt in years. This time, it wasn't just about solving a mystery; it was personal. He needed to find justice for the victim, and for his own lost loved ones.

The fog outside seemed to clear as Chen settled into the case, his eyes narrowing as he began to piece together the puzzle. It would be a long shot, but he was ready to dig deep and confront the darkness head-on. This time, he wouldn't run from it; this time, he'd face it with courage and conviction.

With renewed purpose, Chen Bergström stood up, his eyes locked on the city outside, ready to take on whatever lay ahead.
