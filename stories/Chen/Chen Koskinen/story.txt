Chen Koskinen sat in his dimly lit study, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and papers that held secrets to centuries past. The Finnish detective's mind was consumed by a particularly puzzling case: the disappearance of a prominent business magnate from Helsinki.

As he poured over the files, Chen's thoughts drifted back to his own past - one marked by tragedy and loss. His brother had died in a car accident when Chen was just a teenager, an event that drove him to dedicate his life to solving crimes like this one.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was Maria, Chen's trusted colleague from the Homicide Department. She carried a cup of steaming coffee and a determined look on her face.

"Koskinen, we've got something," she said, dropping into the chair across from him. "A security camera caught the businessman's car leaving his office building last night at exactly 9 pm. But when he failed to return home... well, you can imagine our concern."

Chen set down his pen and rubbed his tired eyes. This case was getting more complicated by the minute.

Maria handed him a photograph of the business magnate's car, parked outside his building on the outskirts of Helsinki. Chen studied it carefully before glancing up at Maria.

"This doesn't look right," he said, his mind racing with possibilities. "Our victim is known for his ruthless business tactics. I think we have to consider foul play."

Maria nodded in agreement. "We've got a list of potential suspects lined up, but nothing concrete yet."

Chen stood up, pacing around the room as he tried to piece together the evidence. He knew that every minute counted - the longer they took to solve this case, the more likely it was that the businessman would be found dead.

Just then, Chen's phone rang. It was an unknown number, but his instincts told him it might be relevant. "Hello?" he answered, listening intently as someone on the other end began speaking in a low, gravelly voice.

For a moment, Chen listened, his eyes locked onto Maria, who seemed to sense something was amiss. Then, without warning, the line went dead.
