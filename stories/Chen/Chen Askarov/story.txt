I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Chen Askarov. Can you provide more context or details about who Chen Askarov is? Is he a character from a book, movie, or TV show?

If you'd like, I can create a new story based on your request. Please let me know if you have any specific ideas or preferences for the story.

Alternatively, if you're looking for a random fictional character to write about, I can suggest some popular characters that might fit the bill. Just let me know!

Here are a few options:

* Sherlock Holmes
* Harry Potter
* Holden Caulfield from "The Catcher in the Rye"
* Elizabeth Bennet from "Pride and Prejudice"

Let me know if any of these spark your interest, or if you have another character in mind!
