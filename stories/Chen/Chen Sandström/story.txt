Chen Sandstr√∂m stepped off the crowded train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the sea of strangers as they rushed to catch their next connections. A traveler, not a resident, she was a ghost haunting the city's stations, always on the move, never staying long enough to make connections.

Born in Beijing, China, Chen had been raised by a Swedish family who'd adopted her after her parents were killed in a bombing that targeted expats and foreigners alike. Her adoptive father, a scientist named Lars, had told her stories of his homeland - of forests as green as jade, lakes that shone like diamonds, and cities built on islands that seemed to defy gravity.

As she made her way through the airport-like terminals, Chen felt an itch in her palm where her Chinese heritage badge once resided. She'd left it behind, along with her memories of childhood birthdays celebrated around a traditional dinner table, or New Year's Eve fireworks lighting up the night sky like fireflies on a summer evening.

Her thoughts were interrupted by the electronic voice of a digital signboard as it flashed ' Arrival Gate 13 '. Chen took the signs and instructions to navigate through the airport seriously. She'd studied the maps extensively but this was a new airport. The signs could be in error, after all, especially for someone who only spoke three languages.

Chen moved swiftly towards gate thirteen with her suitcases slung over her shoulders. There was no time to lose; she had an early flight and still needed to check-in online before that took off. Her phone beeped as she approached the terminal. She pulled it out of her bag, smiled at a text from an old friend - 'Catch you later, see you soon' . 

Once inside the airport, Chen located her gate quickly and walked through security checkpoints without much fuss. As she boarded the plane, Chen's thoughts returned to Lars and his stories of Sweden. Her life had always been on the move, but in that moment, something inside of her longed to be rooted.

She settled into a seat by the window as takeoff approached. The city below grew smaller until nothing was left but a vast expanse of blue-green water as far as the eye could see.
