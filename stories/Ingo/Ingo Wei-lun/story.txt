The tourists listened intently, asking questions and offering words of encouragement. Ingo's confidence grew with each passing minute, and he felt a sense of connection to these strangers who were appreciating his work.

As the day drew to a close, Ingo packed up his easel and thanked the tourists for their support. He couldn't wait to see where his art would take him next. As he walked away from the market, he felt a sense of pride in his full name, Ingo Wei-lun, knowing that he was not just an artist, but a representative of Taiwanese culture.

Over the coming weeks and months, Ingo's fame continued to grow. His paintings were featured in galleries and exhibitions around the world, and he received commissions from collectors and museums.
