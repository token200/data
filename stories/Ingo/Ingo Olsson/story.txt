Ingo Olsson stepped off the stage, his eyes scanning the crowded auditorium for a glimpse of his parents. They were supposed to be in the front row, but as he scanned the sea of faces, he couldn't find them anywhere.

He had always been told that he was a prodigy, a child genius who could speak five languages and solve complex mathematical equations by the age of six. But at 17, Ingo felt suffocated by his own talents. He longed to be just another kid, with normal worries and struggles.

As he made his way through the crowd, hands outstretched for autographs and selfies, Ingo's mind wandered back to his childhood. His parents had always been incredibly supportive, but they also expected him to excel in every area of his life. He felt like a scientist experimenting on himself, always pushing himself to be better.

Ingo spotted a group of teenagers from his old school, staring at him with a mix of admiration and envy. They asked for a selfie, and he smiled, trying to blend in. But as the photo was taken, Ingo caught sight of a girl across the room - an artist, sketching furiously on her pad.

For the first time in months, Ingo felt a spark of excitement. Not about being famous or admired, but about something entirely different. He excused himself from his entourage and made his way to the girl's table.

"Hi," he said, handing over his phone for a selfie with the artist. "I love your sketchbook."

The artist looked up, startled, and Ingo was struck by her intensity, her passion. She told him about her art, about how it helped her cope with anxiety and stress. For the first time in years, Ingo felt seen.

As they talked, he realized that his parents had been wrong all along. He wasn't a prodigy, but just a kid trying to figure things out. His talents were just one part of who he was, not everything.

Ingo's newfound connection with the artist marked a turning point for him. He began to explore other passions, new outlets for creativity and expression. And though his parents still expected him to excel in academics, Ingo knew that there was more to life than just being good at math.

For the first time in years, he felt like himself - fragile, imperfect, but alive.
