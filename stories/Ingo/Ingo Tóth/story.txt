Ingo Tóth was no stranger to the streets of Budapest. As a former member of the Hungarian Special Forces, he had spent years navigating the city's underbelly, always keeping a watchful eye out for potential threats.

It was on one such night that Ingo Tóth received a cryptic message from an old acquaintance, beckoning him to a dingy tavern on the outskirts of town. As he pushed open the door, a bell above it let out a tired clang, and the patrons turned to regard him with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion.

Ingo Tóth scanned the room, his trained eyes scanning for any signs of trouble. The air was thick with smoke and the stench of cheap ale, but he spotted nothing out of the ordinary - just the usual assortment of shady characters and desperate souls.

He made his way to the bar, nodding at the bartender as he took a seat on a stool. His acquaintance, a thin-lipped woman named Szilvia, sat across from him, her eyes darting nervously around the room before settling back on Ingo Tóth's face.

"Ingo Tóth," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I have information. Information that could put you in harm's way."

Ingo Tóth raised an eyebrow, his hand drifting to the knife at his belt. He had dealt with his fair share of threats and charlatans over the years, but there was something about Szilvia's tone that told him this might be different.

"What kind of information?" he asked, his voice low and even.

Szilvia hesitated, glancing around the room once more before leaning in close. "A mole within the Hungarian government," she whispered. "Someone is selling state secrets to the highest bidder."

Ingo Tóth's eyes narrowed, his mind racing with possibilities. He knew that if true, this could be a game-changer for the country - and potentially put him right back in the crosshairs.

As he sat there, sipping his ale and weighing his options, Ingo Tóth couldn't help but think that Szilvia had brought him full circle once again. The streets of Budapest had always been his home, and now they seemed to be calling him back with a message that could change everything.
