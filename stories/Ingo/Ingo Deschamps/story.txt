Ingo Deschamps stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the sleepy station with a mixture of familiarity and disdain. It was a ritual he had performed countless times before, yet one that never lost its potency.

As a retired detective from Paris, Ingo had grown accustomed to the quiet rhythms of provincial life. He had come to this small town in the French countryside to escape the noise and chaos of his past, to leave behind the memories that still lingered like old scars on his skin.

Ingo's eyes settled on the sign above the station entrance – "Le Vieux-Four" – a name that brought back a flood of memories. He had solved cases here, in this very town, years ago. It was where he had first met his partner, Jacques, and together they had unraveled some of the most puzzling mysteries of their careers.

But those days were behind him now. Ingo's eyes felt tired, his joints creaked with a familiar ache, and his mind wandered to the comforts of home – his garden, his books, his silence. He had left it all behind, along with the demons that haunted him still.

As he walked through the streets, taking in the sights and smells of this place he knew so well, Ingo couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. His instincts were screaming at him to be cautious, to trust no one. He had lived a life of quiet obsession, fueled by his own private obsessions – people, crimes, theories.

The streets grew quieter as night fell, casting long shadows across the pavement. Ingo quickened his pace, his eyes scanning the buildings for any sign of movement. This was his place now – Le Vieux-Four – and he would not be intimidated.

He stopped outside the local café, where Jacques had once sat beside him, sipping coffee and sharing stories. The door creaked as Ingo pushed it open, and a bell above it chimed softly in greeting.

 Inside, the atmosphere was cozy and familiar. Regulars nodded or smiled at him, acknowledging his presence with a quiet respect. It was a place where time stood still, where people kept their secrets locked away behind masks of kindness and curiosity.

Ingo took a seat at his favorite table by the window, and for a moment, he closed his eyes, letting the silence wash over him like a soothing balm. This was home – or what passed for it in this strange, quiet world.
