Ingo Szabó was known for his exceptional talent as a jazz pianist. Born in Budapest, Hungary, he had grown up surrounded by music, with his father, a musician himself, teaching him the basics of piano playing from a young age. As Ingo grew older, his passion for jazz only intensified, and he began to study the greats - Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Bill Evans.

After completing his studies in Budapest, Ingo decided to pursue a career in music, relocating to Paris, where he immersed himself in the city's vibrant jazz scene. It was there that he met his mentor, the renowned French pianist, Michel Legrand. Under Michel's guidance, Ingo honed his craft, refining his technique and developing his unique style.

Years went by, and Ingo's reputation as a talented young pianist spread far and wide. He began to receive offers from top jazz clubs and festivals around the world, and soon found himself performing alongside some of his musical heroes. Despite his success, however, Ingo remained humble and true to his roots, always mindful of the influence that his father had on his early development as a musician.

One evening, while performing at the famous Blue Note club in New York City, Ingo was approached by a young woman who claimed to be a huge fan of his music. She introduced herself as Sophie, and spent the next hour discussing everything from jazz history to their shared love of Eastern European cuisine. It was clear that Sophie was a kindred spirit, and Ingo found himself enjoying her company immensely.

As the night drew to a close, Sophie turned to Ingo and asked if she could meet him again soon. Ingo, taken aback by her forwardness, smiled warmly and agreed. He handed her his business card, which read "Ingo Szabó - Jazz Pianist" in elegant cursive script. Little did he know that this chance encounter would mark the beginning of a beautiful friendship and perhaps even something more.
