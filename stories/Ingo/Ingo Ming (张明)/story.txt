In the mist-shrouded alleys of ancient Hangzhou, a legend whispered among the locals spoke of a man named Ingo Ming. Few had seen him, but his presence was felt in every corner of the city.

Ingo Ming was a master thief, known for stealing not gold or jewels, but memories. He would infiltrate the dreams of the wealthy and powerful, siphoning off their most treasured recollections. His targets were often those who held sway over the city's politics and trade.

One evening, a young merchant named Li approached Ingo Ming with an offer he couldn't refuse. Li had lost his beloved sister to a tragic accident just days before, and her memory still lingered in his mind like an open wound. He begged Ingo Ming to steal her memory from him, to erase the pain that threatened to consume him.

Ingo Ming agreed, but at a steep price. He demanded a share of Li's most prized possession: a rare, hand-painted silk embroidered with the symbol of good fortune. The merchant hesitated, but his desperation won out in the end. Ingo Ming accepted the fabric and vanished into the night, leaving Li to ponder the cost of his memories.

The next morning, Li found himself walking through the city with a sense of detachment he had never experienced before. His thoughts were no longer mired in grief; instead, he felt a newfound appreciation for life's simple joys. He began to see the world around him with fresh eyes, and his business flourished as a result.

However, as time passed, Li started to notice that something was amiss. People would stop him on the street, reminiscing about memories they claimed were theirs but didn't seem familiar to Li. It dawned on him that Ingo Ming had not only stolen his sister's memory but also those of others he had never met.

The people of Hangzhou began to whisper that Ingo Ming was more than just a thief â€“ he was a weaver of fates, a collector of experiences that shaped the lives of others. Some said he was a trickster god, playing on humanity's deepest desires and fears. Others believed he was a cursed soul, doomed to walk the earth in search of his next victim.

Ingo Ming remained elusive, always one step ahead of those who sought to catch him. He vanished into the mist, leaving behind a trail of whispered tales and forgotten memories that would haunt the city for generations to come.
