Ingo Perin stepped out of his small flat, taking a deep breath of the damp London air. He gazed up at the grey sky, feeling the weight of another drizzly day ahead. A former detective turned private investigator, Ingo's life was one of quiet desperation. His wife had left him six months ago, citing his lack of emotional support and constant snooping around her business dealings.

Ingo shivered, despite the thickness of his jacket. He lit a cigarette, feeling the familiar burn in his lungs as he walked down to the office. The rain-soaked streets reflected off the neon lights of the city's bars and clubs, casting an eerie glow over the deserted sidewalks.

As he entered his office, Ingo was greeted by the familiar scent of stale coffee and worn leather. His assistant, Rachel, looked up from her desk with a tired smile. "Morning, boss," she said, offering him a steaming cup of coffee. Ingo took it gratefully, feeling a small spark of warmth in the cold morning air.

The phone on his desk rang, breaking the silence. Ingo answered, listening to the hesitant voice on the other end before hanging up and turning to Rachel. "New client," he said, tossing his cigarette into the trash can. A middle-aged woman sat across from him now, fidgeting with her hands as she explained that her sister had gone missing three days ago.

Ingo listened attentively, his trained ears picking up on every detail – the nervous tic in her jaw, the way she hesitated over a word. He pulled out a notebook and began to scribble notes as Rachel discreetly backed away, leaving Ingo to work his magic. The rain poured down outside, but inside, Ingo's mind was already racing with theories and suspects.

As he left the office that evening, Ingo felt a small glimmer of purpose. He might not have his wife back, but he still had a job to do – to find her sister and bring closure to this troubled woman. The rain-soaked streets seemed less daunting now, as if even they were conspiring to help him uncover the truth.

Ingo's thoughts swirled with images of his wife's business dealings, the way she had always been secretive about them. He made a mental note to investigate further, knowing that the key to finding her sister might lie in the same tangled web of deceit and lies that had driven them apart.
