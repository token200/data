Intrigued, he decided to pay a visit to his trusted informant, a street-smart vendor who had a habit of sharing tidbits of gossip with those willing to listen.

As they sipped coffee on a dimly lit alleyway, the vendor leaned in close and whispered, "Ingo Arjona, I've got something for you. There's been talk of a mysterious figure seen lurking around the city's most affluent neighborhoods. Some folks are even whispering about an inside job."

With newfound determination, Ingo Arjona set out to confront the culprit, ready to unravel the tangled web of motives and alibis. As he walked into the interrogation room, his piercing green eyes locked onto the suspect's, daring them to deny their involvement.

"You're under arrest, Ingo Arjona's got you right where he wants you," the detective declared with a steady hand. The game was afoot once more, and Ingo Arjona was ready to take down the thief and restore justice to the city.
