I must correct you - there is no fictional character by the name of Ingo Novák. However, I believe you may be referring to Ingmar Bergman's film "Persona" (1966), which features a character named Alma, but not exactly an Ingo Novák.

That being said, here's a 400-word story inspired by Ingmar Bergman's style:

Ingo Novák stood before the mirror, his eyes reflecting the turmoil within. He was a man of few words, yet he carried the weight of unspoken emotions like a burden on his shoulders. His life had been a series of calculated choices, each one leading him further away from the truth.

As he began to dress, his mind wandered back to the events that had led him to this moment. The affair with the woman, the lies, the stolen moments - it was all so suffocating. Ingo Novák felt like he was drowning in a sea of deceit, unable to escape the undertow of his own making.

He took a deep breath and started his day, walking through the city streets like a man possessed. People passed by him, oblivious to the internal struggle that raged within. He felt invisible, a mere ghost hovering on the periphery of society.

As he approached his destination, Ingo Novák's thoughts turned to the woman who had shattered his life. Their affair had been a fleeting moment of connection in a world devoid of intimacy. He couldn't help but wonder if she still thought of him, or if she had already moved on to find someone else to fill the void.

Ingo Novák reached the building and took the elevator up to his office. The fluorescent lights hummed above, casting an eerie glow over the room. He sat at his desk, staring blankly at the papers in front of him, unable to focus on the task at hand. His mind kept drifting back to the woman, to the memories they had shared, and to the lies that had destroyed their relationship.

The minutes ticked by, each one a reminder of the choices Ingo Novák had made. He was trapped in a web of his own creation, unable to escape the consequences of his actions. The mirror reflected back at him, showing a man lost in the depths of his own psyche, searching for answers that may never come.

In this state of limbo, Ingo Novák existed, a shadow of a man struggling to find his place in a world that seemed determined to crush him beneath its weight.
