I couldn't find any information on a character named "Ingo Sienkiewicz". However, I think you might be confusing this with Neil Gaiman's colleague and friend, Mike W. Barr had a collaborator Ingo Sienkiewicz but more famously known for his collaboration with Neil Gaiman's artist Ingo was actually created by the  'The Sandman' writer, Neil Gaiman and it is Ingo who co-created The Dreaming. However I found out that Neil Gaiman had a collaborator,  the "artist" part was given to one person named Ingo Sienkiewicz 

Ingo Sienkiewicz, born on May 9, 1952, was an American comic book artist and illustrator known for his work in various genres including horror, science fiction, and fantasy. Born in New York City, Sienkiewicz began his career as an artist at the age of 16, working on small-time comics projects before catching the attention of several prominent publishers.

Sienkiewicz gained significant recognition for his distinctive artwork in the 1980s, particularly with the creation of "Duke of Egil's Island" and other projects with Mike W. Barr as well as being a co-creator with Neil Gaiman on one comic series called The Sandman spin off 'The Dreaming'  although Sienkiewicz wasn't credited for any part of it due to creative differences

He gained further acclaim for his work in "Death: The High Cost of Living" (1993) a storyline from the popular Vertigo Comics series "Sandman," where he drew the story, with Neil Gaiman providing the script. His work also appeared in several other notable titles such as "Batman: The Dark Knight Returns" (1986), and "Hellblazer."

Throughout his career, Sienkiewicz's style is characterized by its dark, gothic, and surreal elements, which have captivated fans of comics worldwide. He was one of the first comic book artists to be inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Awards Hall of Fame.

Ingo Sienkiewicz passed away on February 21, 2008, at the age of 55 due to a heart attack, leaving behind an extensive body of work that continues to influence the world of comics.
