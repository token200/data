I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Martina Hébert. Could you provide more context or details about this character? I'd be happy to help write a story based on your request.

If not, I can still suggest some options:

1. Create a new character: If you'd like, we can start from scratch and create a new character together.
2. Use a different name: You could give me a different name for the character and I can come up with a story around that person.
3. Provide inspiration: If you have any ideas or themes in mind for Martina Hébert's character, feel free to share them and I'll try to craft a story around it.

Please let me know which option works best for you!
