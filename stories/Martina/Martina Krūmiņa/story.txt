Martina Krūmiņa stood at the edge of the forest, her eyes fixed on the old wooden gate that led to the abandoned asylum. The wind rustled through the trees, carrying with it whispers of the past. As a child, she had heard tales of the asylum's dark history: of the patients who were never seen again, of the doctors who performed unspeakable experiments.

As a young adult, Martina had always been drawn to the mysterious and the unknown. She was a historian, fascinated by the stories that lay hidden in the margins of society. And so, she had dedicated herself to uncovering the truth about the asylum.

Tonight, under the light of a full moon, Martina felt an inexplicable pull towards the abandoned building. She had been warned not to come here alone, but she couldn't shake the feeling that this was her destiny.

As she pushed open the creaking gate, a chill ran down her spine. The air inside was heavy with the scent of decay and rot. Martina fumbled for her flashlight and began to make her way deeper into the asylum.

The corridors were long and dark, lined with flickering fluorescent lights that cast eerie shadows on the walls. She walked slowly, her heart pounding in her chest. Suddenly, a door slammed shut behind her, making her jump.

She spun around, shining her light down the corridor. The words "Patient 314" were scrawled on the wall in bold letters. A shiver ran down Martina's spine as she realized that this must be where it all began – with the asylum's darkest secrets.

As she turned back towards the entrance, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was an old woman, her eyes sunken and her skin pale. She beckoned to Martina, and the historian felt an overwhelming sense of recognition.

"Welcome, Martina," the old woman whispered. "I have been waiting for you. The stories you've heard are true – but they're only half the tale."

And with that, the old woman reached out a bony hand and took Martina's. Together, they stepped into the darkness, ready to unravel the secrets of the abandoned asylum and uncover the truth about Patient 314.
