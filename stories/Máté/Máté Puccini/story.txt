Máté Puccini stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the small station with a mixture of curiosity and trepidation. He had been drawn to this tiny town in Hungary by rumors of a long-abandoned family mansion, hidden away in the rolling hills just outside the village. The Puccini family, Máté's ancestors, had once been prominent landowners here, but their fortunes had declined with the passage of time.

As he made his way through the station, Máté noticed the locals eyeing him warily. He was a stranger, after all – a young man from Budapest with no connection to this place other than a vague memory of his grandmother's stories about their family's history. But there was something about the air here that seemed to draw him in, like a moth to a flame.

Máté followed the signs pointing towards the village, where he found a small café serving coffee and pastries to the townsfolk. He took a seat at a table by the window, watching as people went about their daily business. The owner, an elderly woman with a kind face, noticed his gaze and nodded in recognition.

"You're here for the Puccini estate, I suppose?" she said, pouring him a cup of strong coffee.

Máté's eyes widened in surprise – how did she know? But before he could ask any questions, she continued, "I used to work there as a girl. Your family had a reputation for being... complicated."

The words sent shivers down Máté's spine. His grandmother had told him stories of their family's triumphs and failures, but she had never spoken about the darker aspects. As he sipped his coffee, Máté felt a sense of determination rising within him – he was here to uncover the truth about his family's past, no matter what secrets lay hidden in that abandoned mansion.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Máté set off towards the hills, ready to face whatever lay ahead. The village receded into the distance as he walked, leaving behind the coffee-scented air and the warm smiles of the locals. All he could think about was what he would find when he finally reached the Puccini estate – and whether it would change him forever.
