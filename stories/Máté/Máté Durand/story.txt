Máté Durand stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It had been years since he'd set foot in this forgotten corner of France, but the memories still lingered.

As a young man, Máté had fled to this rural town after a scandal in his family's wine business back home in Bordeaux. He'd hoped to escape the whispers and judgments of those who knew him as the son of a failed entrepreneur. But the past has a way of catching up, and now, with his family on the brink of financial collapse, Máté had returned to find that things were no better than he'd left them.

As he made his way through the station, Máté was greeted by a figure in a worn denim jacket and scuffed boots. The woman's eyes narrowed as she took in Máté's tailored suit and the air of superiority that clung to him like a shroud.

"Bonjour, Máté," she said, her voice dripping with disdain. "Welcome back to your family's old haunts."

Máté's eyes flashed with anger, but he bit it back, aware that this woman was the key to unlocking the secrets of his family's downfall. Sophie, his cousin and former flame, had always been a thorn in his side, her sharp tongue and quick wit making her a formidable opponent.

But as they walked through the town, Máté began to see the world through Sophie's eyes. He saw the struggles of the people who worked on his family's vineyard, the long hours and low wages that had driven many to seek better opportunities elsewhere. And he realized that his own mistakes had contributed to the chaos.

As the sun dipped below the rolling hills, Máté and Sophie arrived at the vineyard, a sprawling estate that seemed to lean drunkenly in the direction of collapse. The air was thick with the scent of rotting grapes and decaying dreams.

"I'm sorry," Máté said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Sophie turned to him, her eyes flashing with anger and hurt. "Sorry isn't enough, Máté."

And with that, the two old enemies locked eyes, the tension between them palpable as they stood there, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
