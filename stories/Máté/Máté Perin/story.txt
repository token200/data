Máté Perin stepped into the dimly lit café, scanning the room for a familiar face. It had been months since he'd last set foot in Budapest, and yet the memories still lingered in his mind like old friends. As he waited in line to order, he couldn't help but think of his childhood days spent playing in the city's parks with his best friend, Lili.

After exchanging a warm smile with the barista, Máté made his way to a small table by the window, where he spotted an old acquaintance typing away on her laptop. It was Szofi, the owner of the quaint bookstore nearby. She caught his eye and beckoned him over.

"Ah, Máté Perin! Come give me a hug!" she exclaimed, rising from her seat to envelop him in a warm embrace.

Máté felt a sudden pang of nostalgia as he hugged Szofi back, memories flooding his mind like a tidal wave. He had spent countless afternoons browsing through the shelves of her store with Lili, discovering new authors and stories that would shape their youth.

As they caught up on old times, Máté learned that Szofi had recently taken in a young poet named Ádám, who was working on his first collection. Intrigued, Máté asked if he could meet him, and Szofi agreed to set them up for coffee.

Over the next few weeks, Máté met with Ádám at the bookstore, listening intently as the younger man recited his poetry to a crowd of enthralled onlookers. Máté was struck by the raw emotion and vulnerability that poured from Ádám's words, a quality that resonated deeply within him.

As they parted ways after each meeting, Máté found himself drawn back to Szofi's store again and again, hoping to catch another glimpse of the young poet's talent. With every passing day, he felt his own connection to the city deepen, as if the memories he had uncovered were slowly weaving themselves into a tapestry that encompassed his entire life.

And so, Máté Perin found himself wandering Budapest once more, this time on foot and with heart, carrying with him the voices of Ádám and Szofi, their stories echoing through his mind like whispers from the past.
