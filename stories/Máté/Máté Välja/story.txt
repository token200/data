Máté Välja was a man of mystery, with an air of quiet confidence that commanded attention without requiring it. A renowned cartographer in the city of Tartu, Estonia, his maps were sought after by collectors and scholars alike for their unparalleled accuracy and beauty.

As he worked on a new commission, Máté's mind wandered to the tales of his ancestors, who had settled in this land centuries ago. He was proud to be carrying on a tradition that spanned generations, one that required not only skill but also a deep connection to the people and places they represented.
