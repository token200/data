Máté Omar's eyes scanned the crowded marketplace, his fingers instinctively twitching towards the hilt of his worn leather scabbard. As a skilled mercenary and treasure hunter, he'd grown accustomed to navigating the underworld of Marrakech's ancient medina.

A whispered rumor had drawn him to this particular stall – an elderly collector rumored to possess a map leading to a long-lost Golden Chalice, said to grant unimaginable wealth and power to its possessor. Máté's instincts told him it was worth the risk, but the risks were always high when dealing with those who sought to sell out to the highest bidder.

He spotted his contact, a wispy-haired old man named Hassan, haggling over price with a rival collector. Máté pushed through the throng, his hand resting on the grip of his sword, an expression of detached curiosity etched across his face.

Hassan caught his eye and beckoned him closer, his eyes darting nervously towards the other man's guards. "Ah, Máté Omar," he said, voice barely audible over the din of merchants hawking their wares. "I see you've heard about my little trinket."

Máté's gaze swept the stall, taking in the dusty artifacts and yellowed scrolls that lined its shelves. A map, indeed – beautifully rendered, with intricate symbols and markings that seemed to dance across its surface like celestial bodies.

"Tell me," Máté said, his tone smooth as silk, "what makes you think this is worth risking life and limb over?"

Hassan hesitated before speaking in hushed tones. "Let's just say I have... associates who've assured me of the map's authenticity. But at what price?"

Máté narrowed his eyes. He'd dealt with enough charlatans to recognize a seller desperate for cash. The question now was: did Hassan truly possess the treasure, or was it all a ruse?

Without hesitation, Máté reached into his pocket and produced a gold coin. "I'll take the map," he said, offering it to Hassan with an air of finality.

The old man took it, a faint glint in his eye as he handed over the map. As Máté tucked it into his belt pouch, he sensed a weight settling onto his shoulders – for in this game, some costs were never negotiable.
