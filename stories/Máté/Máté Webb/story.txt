Máté Webb stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the cool evening air enveloping him like a damp shroud. He had been traveling for days, ever since he'd received the letter from his great aunt, inviting him to her rural estate in the countryside.

As Máté Webb made his way through the deserted station, he felt a sense of unease settle over him. What would he find at the old homestead? His aunt's words had been vague, but the excitement in them was palpable. He couldn't shake the feeling that this journey was about more than just visiting an old relative.

The carriage ride to the estate took him through rolling hills and dense forests, the trees looming above like sentinels. Máté Webb felt small against their grandeur, his doubts growing with every step. What if he wasn't wanted here? What if this was all a mistake?

As the carriage rattled to a stop, a woman emerged from the doorway of the estate, her face creased by age and worry. "Ah, Máté Webb," she said, her voice softening as she saw him. "Welcome home."

Máté Webb's unease dissipated slightly as he rose from his seat. He had known that his great aunt would be here to greet him, but the sight of her was a comfort nonetheless. She took his hand and led him into the warm glow of the estate, where the fire crackled and the scent of cooking wafted through the air.

As they walked through the rooms, Máté Webb began to notice the changes that had been made over the years. His great aunt had added new furnishings, new decorations, but it was clear that she had done so with a sense of love and care. She showed him the garden, where his ancestors had once tended crops, and the orchard, where apples hung ripe in the trees.

As they sat down to dinner, Máté Webb felt a sense of peace settle over him. This was what he had been searching for – connection to his past, to his heritage. And as he looked at his great aunt, he knew that this journey had brought him exactly where he needed to be.
