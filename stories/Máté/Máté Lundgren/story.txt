Máté Lundgren stepped off the train and onto the platform, gazing out at the dimly lit station. It was late autumn in Budapest, and the chill of the air clung to him like a damp shroud. He breathed in deeply, letting the scent of coal smoke and damp earth fill his lungs.

Máté had grown up on these streets, his family's small café a hub for the local underworld. As a child, he'd watched with wide eyes as the shady characters came and went, exchanging secrets and deals over steaming cups of coffee. Now, at 25, Máté was one step away from taking over the family business.

He navigated the deserted platform, his footsteps echoing off the cold stone walls. His destination was a small, run-down bar on the outskirts of town, where his old friend and confidant, Áron, waited for him.

As he pushed open the door, a bell above it let out a tired clang, and Máté's eyes adjusted to the dim light within. The air reeked of stale beer and cigarette smoke, but Máté recognized the smell as a warm, familiar comfort. He spotted Áron at the bar, hunched over a whiskey-stained glass, his eyes red-rimmed from lack of sleep.

"Máté," Áron rasped, beckoning him closer with a gnarled hand. "Get in here and talk some sense into me."

Máté slid onto the stool beside Áron, taking a deep breath as he listened to his friend's troubles. The stories Máté had heard before – the lost bets, the broken deals, the whispered secrets that only came out at this late hour. It was all too familiar, and yet...and yet...

A nagging doubt began to tickle at the back of Máté's mind. Was this really where he wanted to end up? The shadows that danced across Áron's face seemed darker than usual, the corners of his eyes red and raw. What had driven them both down this path?

As they sipped their drinks in silence, a soft click echoed from outside – the sound of Máté's phone buzzing with an incoming message. He hesitated for a moment before answering, his heart beating faster with anticipation.

"Who is it?" Áron asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

Máté took another sip, his eyes locked on the figure standing in the shadows outside – a woman with piercing green eyes and skin as pale as alabaster. "Someone from back home," he said finally, his voice steady despite the trepidation creeping up his spine.
