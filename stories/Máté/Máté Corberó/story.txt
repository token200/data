Máté Corberó stepped out of the warm sunlight and into the dimly lit tavern, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a skilled thief and member of the infamous group known as "The Shadow Hands," Máté Corberó had seen his fair share of close calls and narrow escapes.

With his dark hair slicked back and his piercing green eyes scanning the crowd, Máté Corberó navigated through the tables with ease, dodging patrons and servants alike. He was on a mission to gather intel for an upcoming heist, one that would require all of his skills and cunning.

As he made his way to the bar, Máté Corberó's gaze locked onto a familiar figure - Elara, the tavern's proprietor and a longtime acquaintance of The Shadow Hands. She raised an eyebrow as Máté Corberó approached, her eyes sparkling with a mixture of curiosity and wariness.

"Máté Corberó," she purred, her voice husky from years of smoke and ale. "What brings you to our humble establishment tonight?"

Máté Corberó slid onto the stool beside Elara, his movements fluid and deliberate. "Just gathering information, my dear," he replied, his smile charming as ever. "I'm looking for a lead on a potential target - a wealthy merchant with a reputation for being quite... generous."

Elara's eyes narrowed, her gaze flicking between Máté Corberó and the crowd. She leaned in close, her voice barely above a whisper. "I might know something about that merchant, Máté Corberó. But it won't come cheaply."

Máté Corberó raised an eyebrow, his eyes glinting with intrigue. He knew that Elara was always worth the price - especially when it came to information. With a nod, he signaled the bartender for a drink, and the negotiations began.

As the night wore on, Máté Corberó listened intently to Elara's whispers, his mind racing with possibilities and plans. And though The Shadow Hands' next heist was still months away, Máté Corberó knew that this little chat would set him firmly on course for success - and fortune.
