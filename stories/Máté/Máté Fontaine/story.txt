Máté Fontaine stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the small station for any sign of familiarity. He had been on the move for weeks, trying to shake the memories that haunted him. As he made his way through the crowd, a sense of disorientation washed over him. Where was he?

Máté had always been a wanderer, never staying in one place for too long. But after the accident, everything felt different. He couldn't shake the feeling of being lost, not just physically, but also emotionally.

As he walked through the station, Máté noticed a woman watching him from across the way. She was beautiful, with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. There was something about her that drew him in, something that made him feel seen.

"Bonjour," she said, approaching him with a smile. "I'm Sophie. I couldn't help but notice you're new here."

Máté hesitated for a moment before responding. It had been years since he'd spoken to anyone about his past. But there was something about Sophie that made him feel like he could trust her.

"I'm Máté," he said finally, feeling a sense of relief wash over him. "I'm just passing through."

Sophie nodded sympathetically. "I know what it's like to be lost," she said. "But sometimes, getting lost is the only way to find yourself."

Máté raised an eyebrow, intrigued by her words. He had never thought about it that way before.

As they walked together, Sophie told Máté about her own story of loss and healing. She spoke of finding solace in the beauty of the world around her, and Máté found himself feeling a sense of peace he hadn't felt in years.

For the first time since the accident, Máté felt like he was home. It wasn't that he had arrived at a physical destination, but rather that he had finally found someone who understood him.

As they stood on the platform, watching the sun set behind the trees, Sophie turned to him and smiled. "Would you like to stay for a while?" she asked.

Máté hesitated for a moment before nodding his head. Maybe it was time to stop running and start facing the past. Maybe it was time to find himself again.
