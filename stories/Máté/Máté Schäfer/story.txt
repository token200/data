Máté Schäfer was known for his unorthodox approach to music, often incorporating found sounds and unconventional instruments into his compositions. A native of Berlin, Germany, he had grown up surrounded by the city's rich cultural landscape, which heavily influenced his unique style.

As a child, Máté would spend hours exploring the streets of Kreuzberg, collecting scraps of metal and wire to create makeshift percussion instruments. He would then return home, where his parents - both avid music lovers - encouraged him to hone his craft on the piano. It was there that he developed a deep appreciation for the works of John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen, whose experimental approaches inspired Máté's own creative path.

As he grew older, Máté's interest in sound art only deepened. He began attending concerts and workshops focused on experimental music, where he met like-minded individuals who shared his passion for pushing the boundaries of what was considered "music." It was during this time that he started to incorporate more found sounds into his work, often using materials like metal pipes, wooden spoons, and even household appliances.

One day, while rummaging through a thrift store in Neukölln, Máté stumbled upon an old gramophone. He was immediately drawn to its worn, retro aesthetic and the way it seemed to whisper secrets to him when he turned its crank. Inspired by this discovery, he began experimenting with the gramophone as a primary instrument, using its unique resonance to create haunting melodies that seemed to capture the essence of Berlin itself.

Years later, Máté Schäfer's innovative approach to music had earned him recognition both locally and internationally. His experimental soundscapes had captivated audiences at festivals and galleries alike, leaving them in awe of his creative vision. And yet, despite all the accolades, Máté remained true to his artistic roots, always seeking new ways to push the boundaries of what was possible with music.
