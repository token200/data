Máté Nowak stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. As he waited in line to order, he noticed a young artist sitting alone by the window, sketchbook open on her lap. Máté's gaze lingered, captivated by the delicate lines and colors that danced across the page.

When it was finally his turn to order, Máté opted for a strong coffee and took a seat at the bar. He pulled out his phone and began typing out a text message to his friend, Lilián: "Hey, I'm at Café Veritas. Meet me there in 20."

As he waited for Lilián's response, Máté couldn't help but feel drawn to the artist by the window. She seemed lost in her own world, oblivious to the bustling atmosphere around her. Curiosity got the better of him, and Máté decided to take a chance.

He walked over to the table, his eyes locking onto the artist's as she looked up from her sketchbook. For a moment, they simply stared at each other, the only sound the hum of the café's espresso machine. Then, in a gentle voice, Máté asked, "Mind if I join you?"

The artist smiled, her eyes sparkling with warmth. "Not at all," she replied.

As they introduced themselves – Máté Nowak and the artist, whose name was Sophia – they began to chat about art, music, and life. The connection was instant, like two puzzle pieces clicking into place.

Lilián arrived promptly at 20 minutes past the hour, apologizing for keeping Máté waiting. But Máté barely noticed, too engrossed in conversation with Sophia. As the afternoon wore on, they discovered shared passions and interests, their discussion flowing effortlessly from one topic to the next.

As the café began to close, Sophia glanced at her watch and exclaimed, "I'm so sorry, but I have to go!" Máté walked her out into the crisp evening air, feeling a sense of excitement and possibility. He knew that this chance encounter might just be the start of something special – something he was eager to explore further with Máté Nowak.
