While she might have been hesitant to trust someone with such a checkered past, Sophia found herself inexplicably drawn to Handschuh's roguish allure.

As they left the club together, Sophia asked Handschuar about his line of work. He smiled mischievously, saying that he only did jobs that required "a certain... finesse." Sophia laughed, intrigued by his enigmatic response.

Over the next few weeks, Sophia found herself entangled in Stanisław Handschuh's web of intrigue. She attended exclusive parties and high-society events, always on the lookout for her elusive beau to appear. When he finally did, she would follow him, mesmerized by his confidence and poise.
