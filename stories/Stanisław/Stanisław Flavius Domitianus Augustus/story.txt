In the sweltering summer of 135 CE, the Roman Empire was on the brink of collapse. But amidst the chaos and destruction, one man stood tall – Stanisław Flavius Domitianus Augustus, a name that would soon become synonymous with tyranny.

Born to a wealthy merchant family in modern-day Poland, Stanisław had always been driven by ambition. He rose through the ranks of the Roman legions, earning the respect and admiration of his peers. When the Roman Emperor Hadrian died under mysterious circumstances, the Senate saw an opportunity to legitimize a foreign-born leader.

And so, they chose Stanisław, a Polesk man with no discernible qualifications for power. He was named Domitianus Augustus, and at 25 years old, he became the youngest emperor in Roman history.

At first, Stanisław's rule seemed benevolent. He invested heavily in infrastructure projects, built grand temples, and hosted lavish feasts for his nobles. But as time passed, whispers of paranoia began to spread. Domitianus started to suspect that his advisors were plotting against him, and he became increasingly isolated.

One by one, high-ranking officials fell from favor. Some were exiled, while others met with gruesome ends – beheaded in the Forum Romanum or strangled in their own homes. Stanisław's obsession with conspiracy theories grew, and soon, everyone was a potential enemy.

The people of Rome began to tremble at the mention of his name. Markets closed early as families hid from fear of being accused of treason. Insurgents whispered of overthrowing the emperor, but their efforts were futile against the iron fist of Domitianus.

One fateful night, as Stanisław walked through the deserted streets of Rome, he spotted a lone figure watching him from the shadows. It was his most trusted advisor, a wise and loyal man named Marcus. But when Stanisław demanded to know who the spy was, Marcus hesitated – too late.

With a swift stroke of his sword, Domitianus ended the life of the one person who had stood by him through thick and thin. The last thing Marcus saw was the emperor's face contorted in rage, before darkness claimed him forever.

As the night wore on, Stanisław realized that he had lost himself to madness and paranoia. His reign would go down in history as one of the darkest periods in Roman Empire's past – a testament to the dangers of unchecked ambition and the fragility of human sanity.
