One fateful evening, Indrek Esquivel received a cryptic message from an unknown source, inviting him to meet at an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. The note read simply: "Come alone." Without hesitation, he accepted the challenge, his curiosity piqued.

As he entered the dimly lit warehouse, Indrek Esquivel's senses were on high alert. He scanned the area, his trained eyes taking in every detail. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows, their features obscured by a hoodie. The air was thick with tension as the two individuals faced off.
