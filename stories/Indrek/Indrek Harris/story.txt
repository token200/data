Indrek Harris stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the drizzly streets of Ravenshire. It had been years since he'd set foot in this town, and yet, the air still carried the same musty scent that clung to his clothes like a bad habit.

A former detective with the Ravenshire PD, Indrek had been forced into early retirement after a string of cases went sour. His obsessive pursuit of justice had put him at odds with the department's brass, and he'd eventually left the only life he'd ever known behind.

Now, Indrek was back in Ravenshire for old times' sake – or rather, for the sake of an old flame. He'd received a cryptic message from Lyra Flynn, the woman who'd broken his heart and left him shattered. The note hinted at a case she'd been working on, something big, and wanted Indrek's expertise to help crack it.

As he made his way through the fog-shrouded streets, memories came flooding back. Indrek had spent countless nights patrolling these same alleys with Lyra by his side, sharing whispers of secrets and fears over steaming cups of coffee at the local café. They'd been the golden couple of Ravenshire's law enforcement – young, idealistic, and hell-bent on making a difference.

Lyra waited for him outside the old station house where Indrek used to lock up with his colleagues. Her eyes still sparkled with mischief, but there was something new beneath the surface, something harder and older. She handed him a battered notebook filled with notes and photographs, her expression guarded.

"This is the one I'm working on," she said quietly. "It's connected to a string of murders that went unsolved years ago. I think it might be connected to your past, Indrek."

Indrek took the notebook, feeling the familiar ache in his chest as he began to flip through its pages. He recognized some of the names – faces from his own troubled history. This was no ordinary cold case; this was personal.

Together, they sat on a bench overlooking the mist-shrouded river, watching the rain fall like tears on their cheeks. Lyra's eyes locked onto Indrek's, and for an instant, he saw that look of old desire – the one that still burned beneath her tough exterior.
