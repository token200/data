Indrek Errani began to make his way down the mountain, his footsteps echoing off the stone walls as he delved deeper into the heart of Zerzura. He had assembled a team of experts to aid him in his research, but he knew that this was a journey best undertaken alone.

He knew that this discovery would cement his place in the annals of history – and he was grateful to have had the opportunity to share it with those he cared about most. And as he looked out at the stars twinkling above, he knew that Indrek Errani – the renowned archaeologist and explorer – had truly lived a life worth living.
