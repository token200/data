Indrek Pelz stood at the edge of the frozen lake, his eyes fixed on the dark silhouette of a lone figure walking towards him. The air was crisp and cold, with a hint of wood smoke carried on the wind. He wore a worn leather coat, clasped tightly around him, its frayed edges flapping in the gentle breeze.

As the figure drew closer, Indrek could see that it was Lyra, his childhood friend and confidant. She moved with an awkward gait, her boots sinking into the snow as she trudged through the drifts. Her eyes sparkled with a mix of determination and trepidation, and Indrek felt a pang of concern for her.

"What's wrong, Lyra?" he asked, his voice low and measured, as he gestured for her to join him by the lake's edge.

Lyra hesitated, then dropped down onto a nearby boulder, her hands clasped around two mugs filled with steaming hot tea. "I've been having these...dreams," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Indrek raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. Lyra was never one to share her thoughts easily, and he knew that when she did, it was always something significant. "What kind of dreams?"

Lyra took a deep breath before launching into a stream-of-consciousness account of dark forests, eerie whispers, and shadowy figures lurking just out of sight. Indrek listened attentively, his eyes never leaving her face.

As she spoke, the silence between them grew thicker, like the snowflakes that began to fall from the sky above. It was as if they were both suspended in a world beyond their own, one where the ordinary rules didn't apply.

When Lyra finally fell silent, Indrek nodded thoughtfully. "I think we need to get out of here," he said, his eyes drifting towards the dark expanse of the forest beyond the lake. "This place is starting to feel...off."

Lyra's gaze followed his, and for a moment, they both saw something that wasn't there â€“ a shadowy presence lurking just beyond the treeline, watching them with cold, calculating eyes.

Without a word, Indrek turned and started walking towards the forest, Lyra close behind. The snow crunched beneath their feet as they disappeared into the darkness, leaving the frozen lake and its secrets behind.
