Indrek Poirier stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, his eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of life. A seasoned mercenary, he had earned a reputation as one of the most skilled and ruthless fighters in the city's underworld.

As he waited, his earpiece crackled to life. "Indrek, we have a situation at the Black Swan Tavern," a voice whispered urgently. "The wealthy collector, Marcellus, has sent his personal guard to extract an artifact from the thief."

Poirier smiled to himself as he lit a cigarette. This was exactly the kind of job he had been waiting for – lucrative, high-stakes, and guaranteed to test his skills.

He slipped into the tavern, weaving through the crowd with ease. His trained eyes scanned the room, homing in on the Marcellus's guard. He was a burly man with a cruel face, but Poirier saw right through him. With a flick of his wrist, he dispatched the guard with swift efficiency.

A soft voice spoke in his earpiece again. "Indrek, you're clear to retrieve the artifact."

He moved swiftly towards Marcellus's table, where a small box sat unattended on the surface. As he reached for it, a figure emerged from the shadows – a striking woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair.

"Welcome, Indrek Poirier," she purred. "I see you're just in time to witness my departure."

Poirier narrowed his eyes, intrigued by the mysterious woman. "Who are you?" he demanded, but she simply laughed and turned to leave.

Without hesitation, he snatched up the box and tucked it into his waistcoat. He was about to make his escape when he caught a glimpse of himself in a nearby mirror – his rugged features etched with a mix of curiosity and caution.

For a moment, Poirier hesitated, wondering if this job was more than just another payday for him. But the thrill of the hunt had already taken hold, and he set off into the night, ready to face whatever lay ahead.

As he vanished into the darkness, the green-eyed woman watched from afar, a knowing smile spreading across her lips. The game had begun – Indrek Poirier was now in play, and nothing would ever be the same again.
