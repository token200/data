Indrek Corber贸 was known for his unorthodox methods in solving cases. As a detective with the Helsingborg Police Department, he often found himself at odds with his colleagues due to his unconventional approach.

One day, Indrek received a call from the chief about a string of burglaries in the affluent suburbs of Helsingborg. The victims all reported that the thief seemed to be always one step ahead, leaving no evidence behind. The chief asked Indrek to take on the case and put an end to the burglary spree.

Indrek Corber贸 accepted the challenge, beginning by studying the crime scenes and interviewing witnesses. He noticed a peculiar pattern - each of the burglaries occurred at exactly 3:47 AM, and the thief seemed to be targeting houses with specific architectural features, such as large windows or skylights.

Determined to crack the code, Indrek spent hours pouring over blueprints and surveillance footage, searching for any clues that might lead him to the culprit. He became obsessed with uncovering the identity of the mysterious burglar.

As the investigation progressed, Indrek discovered a surprising connection between the burglary locations - each house had once been owned by a prominent businessman in Helsingborg's industrial history. Intrigued, Indrek began digging deeper into the lives of these businessmen and their associates.

After weeks of tireless work, Indrek finally stumbled upon a breakthrough. He discovered that one of the businessmen was not only connected to several of the burglary locations but also had an alibi for each crime - they were all at home at 3:47 AM on the night of the burglary. The trail led him to a small, nondescript warehouse on the outskirts of town.

Indrek Corber贸 cautiously approached the warehouse and found it empty except for one person - the businessman's son, who had been using his father's connections and resources to fund his own illicit activities. Confronted with evidence, the young man eventually cracked under pressure and revealed himself as the mastermind behind the burglaries.

As Indrek closed the case file on the burglary spree, he couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction at having solved it through sheer determination and creative thinking. Despite his unorthodox methods, he had proven once again that Indrek Corber贸 was one of Helsingborg's most formidable detectives.
