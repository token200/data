Indrek Szabo was a man shrouded in mystery, his past a labyrinth of secrets and lies. A skilled thief and con artist, he had made a name for himself on the streets of Budapest, leaving a trail of disillusioned marks in his wake.

One fateful evening, Indrek Szabo slipped into the grand ballroom of the Imperial Palace, his eyes scanning the room for potential targets. The air was thick with the scent of perfume and cigar smoke, as the cream of Budapest's society gathered to celebrate the emperor's birthday.

As he wove through the crowd, Indrek Szabo's trained gaze locked onto a young noblewoman, her diamonds flashing in the candlelight. He smiled to himself, knowing that she would be an easy mark. With a few well-placed words and a confident smile, he worked his magic, convincing her to part with a small fortune.

But as he made his escape, Indrek Szabo felt a pang of guilt. He had always been driven by self-interest, but tonight something about the young woman's desperate eyes stayed with him. Maybe it was the memory of his own childhood, growing up on the streets alongside his cousin, Éva. Or maybe it was the whispered words of his mentor, Zoltán: "A good thief always has an exit plan."

Whatever the reason, Indrek Szabo found himself walking away from a fortune, leaving the palace and its lavish parties behind. He disappeared into the Budapest night, lost in thought.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. Indrek Szabo vanished from public view, his reputation growing as a ghostly figure. Some said he had been caught by the authorities, while others whispered that he had retired to a quiet life on the outskirts of town.

The truth lay somewhere in between. Indrek Szabo was still out there, watching and waiting, always looking for the next angle, the next score. But deep down, something had shifted inside him. He knew that his days as a master thief were numbered, and he was searching for a new path to follow.
