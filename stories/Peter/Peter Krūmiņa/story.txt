I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Peter Krūmiņa. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created recently.

However, I can create a new character and write a story about them. Here is a 400-word story about a fictional character named Peter Krūmiņa:

Peter Krūmiņa was a quiet and reserved individual who lived in the small town of Riga, Latvia. He was a skilled woodworker and spent most of his days in his small workshop, crafting beautiful pieces of furniture from the rich Latvian woods.

Despite his reclusive nature, Peter had a deep love for music. He would often play the traditional Latvian folk instrument, the krīzā, late into the night, its haunting melodies echoing through the streets of Riga.

One evening, as Peter was working on a particularly intricate piece of furniture, he heard a faint knock at his door. It was a young woman named Aiva, who had stumbled upon his workshop while exploring the town. She was fascinated by the beautiful woodwork and asked if she could help him finish a project.

Peter was taken aback by Aiva's boldness, but he was also intrigued by her passion for art. Together, they worked on the furniture piece, with Peter teaching Aiva the techniques of traditional Latvian woodworking. As they worked, their conversation flowed easily, and Peter found himself opening up to Aiva in ways he never had with anyone before.

As the days turned into weeks, Aiva returned to visit Peter frequently, and their friendship grew stronger. They would spend hours discussing music, art, and life, and Peter found himself feeling seen and heard in a way he never had before.

Despite his initial reserve, Peter Krūmiņa was a kind and generous soul, with a deep love for the beauty of Latvia's natural world. And through his friendship with Aiva, he discovered that there was more to life than just woodworking – though he would always cherish his craft as a source of joy and fulfillment.

I hope you enjoyed this story! Let me know if you have any other requests or questions.
