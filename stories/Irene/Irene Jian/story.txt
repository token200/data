Irene Jian sat alone in the dimly lit café, nursing a cup of cold coffee. She stared blankly at her phone, scrolling through social media feeds that seemed to highlight every moment of her ex's life without her. It had been months since they'd broken up, but the wound still felt raw.

As she scrolled, memories began to flood her mind - laughter-filled nights, spontaneous road trips, and late-night conversations that left her feeling seen and understood. Irene Jian's eyes drifted to a photo on her screen, taken during one of their last vacations together. The sun-kissed beach, the sound of waves crashing in the background, and the warmth of his hand wrapped around hers.

Just then, the café door creaked open, and Irene Jian looked up to see an old friend, Alex, walking towards her. They had been inseparable during college, bonding over their shared love of art and music. Irene Jian's face lit up as Alex slid into the seat across from her.

"How have you been?" Alex asked, genuinely interested in hearing about Irene Jian's life.

It had been a struggle, adjusting to life without the person who had once been her rock. But with Alex by her side, Irene Jian began to find solace. They spent hours talking, laughing, and sharing stories - stories that helped Irene Jian heal and rediscover herself.

As they sipped their coffee, Irene Jian realized that sometimes, it takes losing something precious to appreciate its true value. She thought about the memories she had made with her ex, but also acknowledged the growth she'd experienced during this period of solitude.

"I'm doing okay," Irene Jian said finally, smiling at Alex. "Just taking things one day at a time."

Alex smiled back, nodding in understanding. "That's exactly what you need to do, Ire." The nickname brought a warmth to her heart, reminding her that she wasn't alone in this journey of self-discovery.

As the sun began to set outside, casting a warm glow over the café, Irene Jian felt a sense of peace settle within her. It was a fragile thing, but it was hers now - and with Alex by her side, she knew she could face whatever came next.
