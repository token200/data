Irene Aber stepped into the crowded café, scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him at a corner table, nursing a cup of black coffee and staring intently at his laptop screen.

"Irene," he said without looking up as she slid into the seat across from him.

"Hey," she replied with a smile. "What's got you so captivated?"

He didn't bother answering, just keeping his focus on the screen. Irene knew better than to pry when Jack was in one of his work phases. She took a sip of her own coffee, trying to wait patiently.

As it turned out, waiting wasn't necessary. A few minutes later, he finally closed his laptop and pushed it away, revealing a worn notebook under the laptop stand.

"What's new?" Irene asked as he began flipping through the pages, stopping occasionally to scribble notes in the margins.

"Just some observations," Jack said with a small smile, "I've been studying human behavior for years now. And today was... enlightening."

"Try me," Irene said skeptically, intrigued by the mysterious allure of his work.

"Well," he began, "have you ever noticed how most people can't help but stare at their phones when they're in public?"

Irene chuckled. She'd noticed it too – friends, strangers, even complete strangers staring blankly into space, completely disconnected from their surroundings.

"And what about it?" she asked, curiosity getting the better of her.

Jack leaned forward, eyes sparkling with excitement. "That's because we've become addicted to the endless stream of information on our screens. We crave validation and distractions, and social media delivers both in spades."

Irene whistled softly. She'd always known that technology was eating away at human interaction, but she never thought Jack had figured out exactly why.

"What does this have to do with anything?" she asked, skeptical of the relevance.

Jack grinned mischievously. "Just this," he said and pulled out his phone – yes, actually put it down for once – and pointed to a single line on the café's display screen: "Live Music Tonight!"

"Irene Aber," Jack whispered seriously, "human beings have a very short attention span, but they can be incredibly captivated by fleeting experiences. What do you think about that?"

She raised an eyebrow at his poetic observation, feeling both impressed and uneasy.
