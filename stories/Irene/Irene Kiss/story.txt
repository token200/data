Irene Kiss was known for her razor-sharp wit and her ability to talk her way out of almost any situation. As a former con artist, she had honed her skills on the streets of New York City, where she had made a name for herself as a master thief.

But Irene's latest mark was different. She had set her sights on the wealthy businessman, Marcus Wellington, who was known for his ruthless tactics in the corporate world. Irene had been watching him for months, studying his every move and waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

That moment came when Marcus received an invitation to a charity gala at the luxurious Bellvue Manor. Irene knew that Marcus would be attending, and she saw this as her chance to get close to him and pilfer some of his valuable assets.

Irene arrived at the gala dressed to the nines in a stunning red gown, her hair styled perfectly and her makeup flawless. She blended seamlessly into the crowd of wealthy donors and celebrities, all vying for attention and admiration.

As she mingled with the guests, Irene made sure to keep a close eye on Marcus, who was sipping champagne and laughing with his colleagues. She knew that he was a man who didn't take kindly to strangers, so she had to be extra careful not to arouse his suspicion.

Irene made her move when she caught Marcus's attention by striking up a conversation about art. It turned out that Marcus was an avid collector, and Irene knew exactly which pieces to mention to get him talking. Before long, they were deep in conversation, with Irene expertly steering the discussion towards the wealthy businessman's most prized possessions.

As the night wore on, Irene found herself growing more and more entranced by Marcus's charisma and confidence. For the first time in her life, she felt like she was being seen for who she truly was â€“ a vulnerable and complex individual, rather than just a sly thief.

Marcus, too, had been drawn to Irene's intelligence and wit. He couldn't believe that this enigmatic woman, with eyes as green as emeralds, could be so charming and articulate. As they danced together under the stars, he felt like he was seeing her for the first time.

For a few magical hours, Irene and Marcus lost themselves in each other's company. They talked about art, politics, and philosophy, their conversation flowing effortlessly from one topic to another.

But as the night wore on, Irene knew that she had to pull back. She couldn't let herself get too close to this man, not when she was a thief and he was a businessman. Besides, her job was to steal from him, not fall in love with him.

As the gala drew to a close, Marcus walked Irene out into the cool night air, his arm around her shoulders. "Would you like to grab dinner sometime?" he asked, his eyes sparkling with hope.

Irene hesitated for just a moment before nodding, a smile spreading across her face. "Yes," she said, feeling a thrill of excitement. "I'd love to."

And so, Irene Kiss and Marcus Wellington embarked on a whirlwind romance, one that would change the course of their lives forever. Little did they know, however, that Irene's true intentions were still far from pure...
