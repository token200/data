Irene María had always been fascinated by the old, dusty bookstore on Main Street. The store was called "Page & Co." and it seemed to be frozen in time, with its worn wooden shelves and yellowed books that smelled of aged paper. Irene María spent most of her free time browsing through the shelves, running her fingers over the spines of the books, and imagining the stories they held within.

One day, as she was delving into a particularly thick tome, the store's owner, an elderly man named Mr. Jenkins, approached her. "Ah, Irene María, I see you're a bookworm," he said with a smile. "I've been watching you for weeks, and I must say, I'm impressed."

Irene María looked up, startled, and asked what he meant. "You have a way of connecting with the books that's rare," Mr. Jenkins explained. "Some people just skim the surface, but not you. You immerse yourself in their stories, their struggles, their triumphs."

As they talked, Irene María found herself opening up to Mr. Jenkins about her own passion for writing. She had always dreamed of publishing a novel, but lacked the confidence to take the leap. Mr. Jenkins listened intently, nodding his head and making supportive noises.

After hours of talking, Mr. Jenkins offered Irene María a proposal: he would let her sell her own books in the store, as long as she agreed to read them aloud to him every week. "I want to hear your stories," he said, his eyes sparkling with excitement.

Irene María accepted the offer, and over the next few weeks, she returned to Page & Co. with a small pile of typed pages each time. Mr. Jenkins listened with rapt attention as she read from her own writing, offering words of encouragement and advice whenever she needed it. And Irene María knew that with Mr. Jenkins' support, she was one step closer to achieving her dream of becoming a published author.
