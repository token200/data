Irene Simon stepped into the dimly lit room, her eyes scanning the space as she searched for any sign of life. As a renowned forensic psychologist, she had seen her fair share of crimes, but there was something about this case that didn't sit right with her.

The victim, a young woman named Sarah, lay motionless on the floor, a single bullet wound to the chest. The killer had left no fingerprints, no DNA, no motive - just a cryptic message scrawled on the wall in red ink: "You'll never find me."

Irene's mind began to spin with possibilities. She knew that this was more than just a random act of violence; there was an element of cunning and calculation at play here. Whoever had committed this crime was intelligent, resourceful, and meticulous.

As she delved deeper into the case, Irene found herself drawn to a peculiar detail: the way Sarah's phone had been left untouched on the bedside table. No calls, no texts - just an eerie silence. It was as if the killer wanted her to think that this was just another random murder, but Irene knew better.

She decided to pay a visit to Sarah's colleagues and friends, hoping to glean some insight into her last days. What she found was a complex web of relationships and rivalries, with more than one person having motive to want Sarah dead.

But it wasn't until she spoke with the phone company that the pieces began to fall into place. The woman on the other end revealed that Sarah had been in contact with an unknown number in the days leading up to her murder - a number that had been wiped clean of all records.

Irene's eyes narrowed as she realized what this meant. She was getting close, but she still wasn't there yet. This was a game of cat and mouse, with the killer always one step ahead. But Irene Simon was no stranger to games; she had spent her career outsmarting the most cunning perpetrators.

With newfound determination, Irene set her sights on tracking down the mysterious number, convinced that this would be the key to unraveling the entire case. As she left the phone company's office, she felt a thrill of excitement - she was closing in on the killer, and she knew that soon, justice would be served.
