Irene Kovalova's eyes scanned the crowded café, her gaze lingering on the familiar faces of Moscow's elite. She spotted her contact, Mikhail, sitting in the corner, sipping a cup of black coffee. Irene made her way over, weaving through the tables with practiced ease.

As she approached, Mikhail looked up, his eyes locking onto hers. He nodded subtly, and Irene took a seat across from him. The café's décor was unassuming, but the atmosphere was thick with tension. Irene had come to Moscow on a mission, one that required precision and stealth.

"What did you hear?" Irene asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Mikhail leaned in, his eyes darting around the café before responding. "The oligarch is planning a meeting with a Western investor," he said, his tone neutral. "I don't know what they're discussing, but it's definitely big."

Irene's mind was already racing with possibilities. The oligarch's interests could be a game-changer for her organization. She pulled out a small notebook and jotted down some notes.

As she worked, Irene couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. She glanced around the café again, this time noticing a pair of men sitting at a nearby table, their eyes fixed intently on her. Mikhail followed her gaze and raised an eyebrow.

"They're not regular customers," he whispered. "I think they're from your organization."

Irene's grip on her notebook tightened. She had been expecting some unwanted attention, but she hadn't anticipated this level of aggression. She signaled to Mikhail that it was time to leave.

As they departed the café, Irene couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. This mission had just become a lot more complicated. She pulled out her phone and dialed a number, her voice firm as she spoke.

"I need you to get me a team together," she said, her eyes scanning the crowded streets of Moscow. "We're going in now."

The line went dead, and Irene turned to Mikhail, her expression resolute. "It's time we took matters into our own hands."
