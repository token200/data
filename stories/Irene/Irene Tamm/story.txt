Irene Tamm sat at her desk, sipping her lukewarm coffee and staring blankly at the papers in front of her. As the lead detective on the department's cold case unit, she had seen her fair share of unsolved murders, but one case still lingered in her mind like an open wound.

It was a twenty-year-old murder, one that Irene had spent countless hours investigating to no avail. The victim was a young woman named Sarah, whose lifeless body had been found in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. The killer had left behind no DNA evidence, no witnesses, and no leads – nothing but a cryptic note that read: "You'll never find her."

Irene's mind wandered back to the first time she'd interviewed Sarah's family. They were shattered by their loss, and Irene had promised them justice would be served. But as she delved deeper into the case, she realized that Sarah was more than just a victim – she was a puzzle piece in a much larger picture.

As Irene sorted through her notes and files, a memory popped up on her mind like a flickering photograph. She recalled talking to an old man named Jacob who had claimed to have seen something on that fateful night. His words were cryptic, but Irene remembered the look of genuine fear in his eyes – a look that told her he was telling the truth.

With newfound determination, Irene picked up her phone and dialed Jacob's number. This time, when she spoke with him, she asked about the warehouse and what he'd seen on that night. His voice hesitated before spilling out the details of a stranger in black clothes who had lurked around the area around 11 PM.

Irene's eyes widened as the pieces began to fall into place. The cryptic note now made sense – it was a red herring meant to throw her off the scent. She thanked Jacob for his bravery and promised to follow up on every lead, no matter how small.

For the first time in years, Irene felt a glimmer of hope that she might finally find Sarah's killer. It was going to be a long shot, but with Jacob's testimony and some old-fashioned detective work, Irene was ready to take on the challenge once again. As she closed her laptop and packed up her things, she whispered a silent promise to Sarah: justice would come, and it would come soon.
