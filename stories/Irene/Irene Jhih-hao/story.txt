Irene Jhih-hao was known for her striking features and sharp wit, often leaving those who met her in awe. As a renowned geologist, she had spent years studying the ancient formations of Taiwan's rugged terrain. Her extensive knowledge of the island's geological history made her an expert in her field.

One sunny afternoon, Irene Jhih-hao found herself standing at the edge of a vast, sprawling lake, its surface reflecting the vibrant hues of the sky above. She was on a mission to uncover the secrets of the lake's unique formations, which she believed held the key to understanding Taiwan's geological past.

As she began to survey the area, Irene Jhih-hao noticed something peculiar - a small, almost imperceptible ridge running along the lake's edge. Intrigued, she carefully made her way towards it, her eyes scanning the ground for any signs of disturbance. Suddenly, her foot caught on a hidden boulder, causing her to stumble.

Irene Jhih-hao quickly regained her balance, dusting off her trousers and surveying the area once more. This time, however, she noticed something that made her heart skip a beat - a small inscription etched into the side of the ridge, barely visible to the naked eye.

Excited by her discovery, Irene Jhih-hao carefully transcribed the inscription onto her notebook, making sure to note every detail. As she delved deeper into the message, she realized that it was an ancient warning - one that spoke of a long-forgotten catastrophe that had shaped Taiwan's landscape centuries ago.

Irene Jhih-hao felt a thrill run through her veins as she pieced together the clues, her mind racing with the implications. This discovery could be the breakthrough she had been searching for, one that would rewrite the history books and cement her place in the annals of geological history. As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the lake, Irene Jhih-hao knew that she had stumbled upon something truly remarkable - and she was determined to uncover its secrets.
