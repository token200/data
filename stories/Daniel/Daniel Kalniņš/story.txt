I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Daniel Kalniņš. It's possible that this character is not well-known or doesn't exist in any notable stories.

However, I can suggest an alternative story about Daniel Kaluza, a German mathematician who made significant contributions to the field of differential geometry.

Daniel Theodor Mayr-Heymann Kaluza was born on September 25, 1857, in Königsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). He grew up in a family of modest means and was largely self-taught, developing a passion for mathematics from an early age. After studying at the University of Göttingen, Kaluza went on to become one of the most prominent mathematicians of his time.

Kaluza's most notable contribution to mathematics came in 1919 when he proposed the idea that gravity is not a fundamental force of nature, but rather a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of matter and energy. This concept, now known as Kaluza-Klein theory, revolutionized our understanding of the universe and paved the way for further research into the mysteries of gravity and cosmology.

Throughout his life, Kaluza was driven by a desire to understand the fundamental laws of nature. He spent countless hours working on mathematical problems and collaborating with other leading minds in the field. Despite facing significant challenges and setbacks, Kaluza persevered and continued to make groundbreaking contributions to mathematics and physics.

Today, Daniel Theodor Mayr-Heymann Kaluza is remembered as one of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th century. His work continues to shape our understanding of the universe and inspire new generations of scientists and mathematicians. Despite his passing in 1954, Kaluza's legacy lives on through his timeless contributions to the field of mathematics and physics.
