Born Daniel Michielin, the son of a wealthy family, he had grown up with a sense of entitlement and a taste for adventure. But as he delved deeper into the world of high-stakes thievery, he realized that true power lay not in wealth or status, but in the art of deception itself.

As the search for the Starlight Seren continued, one thing was certain: Daniel Michielin would remain an enigma, always staying one step ahead of those who sought to bring him down. The game of cat and mouse had only just begun, with the stakes higher than ever before.
