Daniel Alsbach stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of saltwater and seaweed enveloping him like an old friend. It had been years since he'd returned to Ravenscar, the small coastal town where his childhood dreams were forged in the rough and tumble world of sailing.

As he made his way through the quiet station, Daniel's mind wandered back to the events that had brought him back to Ravenscar. His ship, the "Maverick's Revenge", had been wrecked on the rocky shores just outside town, taking with it his reputation as one of the most daring sailors on the high seas.

The townsfolk, who had once celebrated Daniel's exploits, now whispered behind his back. Some said he was cursed, that the sea itself had exacted its revenge for all the risks he'd taken. Others claimed he was a ghost, a shadow of his former self, haunted by the memories of what could never be regained.

Daniel smiled wryly to himself as he walked into the local pub, where the fire crackled and spat, casting flickering shadows on the walls. It had been too long since he'd set foot in this place, but it still felt like home.

As he took a seat at the bar, the bartender – an old mate named Tom – eyed him warily before nodding in recognition. "The ghost of Ravenscar, I see," he said, with a hint of sarcasm. Daniel chuckled and signaled for a pint, his eyes scanning the familiar faces around him.

The night wore on, filled with laughter and stories of past adventures, as Daniel slowly began to shake off the weight of his exile. He remembered the thrill of competition, the camaraderie with his crewmates, and the rush of adrenaline that came with navigating the unknown.

But there was something else, too – a nagging sense of unease, a feeling that he'd been running from more than just the town's scorn. As the shadows deepened outside, Daniel leaned in closer to Tom, his voice barely above a whisper. "Tom, what's going on? I've got a job coming up – a private charter, supposed to be worth a pretty penny...but I need someone with my expertise. Who are they?"

Tom hesitated before answering, his eyes darting around the room as if he expected the ghost of Ravenscar to appear at any moment. "Word is," he said, his voice barely audible, "that an old acquaintance has returned to town – one who might just have what you're looking for."
