Daniel Poirier stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, his eyes scanning the rooftops for any sign of movement. As a private investigator, he had seen it all - from cheating spouses to embezzled CEOs. But tonight was different. Tonight, he was on the hunt for a missing person.

The client, a young woman named Sarah, sat across from him in the cramped office, her eyes red-rimmed with worry. "Please, Daniel Poirier," she implored, "you have to find my sister. She was supposed to meet me at the park last night, but she never showed up."

Daniel nodded sympathetically, his mind already racing with theories and leads. He made a few notes on his pad, then set out into the rain-soaked streets of Montreal.

As he walked, Daniel's thoughts turned to Sarah, whose full name was Sophia Poirier - he remembered that much about her from their initial meeting. She had mentioned it in passing, along with her love of hiking and French literature. Now, as he navigated the city's underbelly, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

He stopped at a dingy diner on Rue Sainte-Catherine, ordering a cup of black coffee and striking up a conversation with the bartender, a gruff but kind-eyed man named Marcel. Daniel flashed his PI badge and asked if anyone had mentioned Sophia or her sister in recent days. Marcel's expression turned serious, and he leaned in close.

"Actually, I heard something," Marcel said quietly. "A guy was asking about someone named Poirier - Sophia, I think? He seemed nervous, kept looking over his shoulder."

Daniel's ears perked up. This could be the break he needed. He thanked Marcel and continued on his way, following a trail of leads that eventually led him to an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town.

As he entered the dimly lit building, Daniel felt a shiver run down his spine. Something was very wrong here. Suddenly, he heard footsteps echoing through the halls - and then, a faint cry for help. With his heart pounding in his chest, Daniel Poirier set off to find Sophia Poirier, wherever she might be hiding.
