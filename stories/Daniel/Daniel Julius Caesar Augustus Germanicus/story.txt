His famous Edict of Alexandria, which protected the rights of Jews throughout the empire, cemented his reputation as a champion of tolerance and inclusivity.

As the years passed, Daniel's legend grew, and he became known as one of Rome's greatest emperors. He outlived several family members, including his mother, Agrippina the Younger, and his stepmother, Livia Drusilla, to name a few.
