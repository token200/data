Despite her success, Pawel remained humble and dedicated to her craft. She spent countless hours honing her skills, experimenting with new techniques and mediums, always pushing herself to innovate. Her studio in Hackney was a testament to her creativity, filled with canvases, paint-splattered easels, and half-finished projects.

The collector, impressed by Pawel's work, offered her a lucrative commission to create a series of murals for a high-end hotel in Dubai.
