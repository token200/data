His reputation preceded him, striking fear into the hearts of wealthy merchants and nobles alike. With his quick wit and agility, Pawel could slip in and out of the most secure locations unnoticed.

One fateful evening, Pawel Sundlof received an offer from a mysterious client to steal a priceless artifact from the esteemed collector, Lord Harrington. The artifact, a rare gemstone known as the Starlight Seren, was said to grant immense power to its owner. Intrigued by the challenge and the promise of a substantial reward, Pawel accepted the task.

Under the cover of night, Pawel Sundlof set out for Lord Harrington's mansion, his eyes scanning the perimeter for any signs of security. He dodged guards and scaled walls with ease, his long fingers finding holds in the stone fa√ßade.
