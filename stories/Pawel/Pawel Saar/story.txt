As a renowned archaeologist, he had spent years searching for the lost city of Zerzura, a fabled metropolis hidden deep within the Egyptian desert. Pawel Saar's obsession with the city had become all-consuming, driving him to risk everything in his pursuit.

One day, while pouring over ancient texts and scouring the desert floor for clues, Pawel Saar stumbled upon an obscure reference that seemed to point directly to Zerzura's location.
