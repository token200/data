As the final notes of the performance faded into silence, Pawel took his bow, exhausted but exhilarated by the experience. He knew that this was what it meant to be a musician, to create and share beauty with others. And as he walked off stage, he smiled, knowing that he had done exactly what he set out to do â€“ bring people joy through the power of music.
