Their collaboration was one that had developed over years, fueled by mutual respect and trust. They worked seamlessly together, each knowing exactly when to push boundaries and when to hold back.

As the sun began to set on Helsinki, casting a golden glow over the city's skyline, Pekka leaned back in his chair, feeling a sense of satisfaction wash over him.
