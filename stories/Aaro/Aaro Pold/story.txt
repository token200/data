Aaro Pold stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. She had been on the move for weeks, ever since she'd received that cryptic message from her estranged father. The one who'd abandoned her as a child.

As she made her way through the deserted town, Aaro couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness. It was as if she was searching for something – or someone. She had always been drawn to the unknown, and this little town seemed like the perfect place to start her search.

Aaro's full name was Aaro Pold, and she'd grown up with a sense of uncertainty about her family's past. Her father, Kalle Pold, had left when she was just a child, taking his secrets and lies with him. But Aaro was determined to uncover the truth, no matter what it took.

As she walked through the town, Aaro noticed a small café tucked away on a side street. She pushed open the door and was enveloped in the warm scent of freshly brewed coffee. The owner, an elderly woman named Maria, looked up from behind the counter and smiled at her.

"Welcome to our little corner of the world," Maria said, wiping her hands on a worn apron. "What can I get for you?"

Aaro ordered a cup of black coffee and sat down at a small table by the window. As she sipped her drink, she noticed a piece of paper on the counter – a note, scribbled in hasty handwriting.

"To Aaro Pold," it read. "Meet me at the old windmill on the outskirts of town at midnight. Come alone."

Aaro's heart skipped a beat as she recognized the handwriting. It was her father's, or at least, someone who knew his writing style. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she realized that this could be the start of something big – something that would change everything she thought she knew about herself and her family.

With a sense of trepidation, Aaro folded up the note and tucked it into her pocket, feeling like she was taking her first step towards uncovering the secrets of her past.
