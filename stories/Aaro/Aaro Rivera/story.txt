Aaro Rivera stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, her eyes scanning the crowded streets of Barcelona for any sign of her missing sister, Sofia. As a journalist, she had been investigating a string of high-profile disappearances in the city, and Sofia's case was one of the most puzzling.

Aaro's phone buzzed in her pocket, breaking her concentration. She pulled it out to see a text from an anonymous source: "Meet me at La Boqueria Market at midnight. Come alone." Aaro's gut told her this was the break she had been waiting for.

She made her way to La Boqueria, weaving through the crowds of shoppers and tourists. At midnight, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was an old man with a kind face and a twinkle in his eye.

"Who are you?" Aaro asked, her hand on her phone's camera app.

"I'm someone who knows what happened to Sofia," the old man replied, his voice low and gravelly. "Her name was not Rivero, but Rivera. And I think I can help you find her."

Aaro's heart skipped a beat. "What do you mean?"

The old man handed her a folder filled with documents and photographs. As she flipped through them, Aaro saw evidence of Sofia's involvement in an undercover operation to expose corruption in the city's government.

"This is it," Aaro said, her eyes shining with determination. "This is the lead I've been waiting for."

The old man nodded, a small smile on his face. "I knew you'd be smart enough to see through the deception. Now, go find your sister and bring justice to those who have wronged her."

Aaro took the folder and turned to leave, but not before the old man whispered one final word: " Rivera."
