Aaro Mercier stepped into the dimly lit tavern, the smell of smoke and ale enveloping her like a warm hug. As a skilled thief, she knew how to blend in with the shadows, but tonight was different. Tonight, Aaro Mercier had come seeking answers.

Her eyes scanned the room, searching for a familiar face. She spotted him across the way, leaning against the bar, his piercing blue eyes locked onto hers. Ryker, her former partner in crime, now the one person she couldn't seem to avoid.

Their history was complicated. Aaro Mercier had been drawn into Ryker's world of high-stakes heists and cat-and-mouse chases with him at its center. But after a job gone wrong, she'd realized she needed out. Ryker, however, refused to let her go.

As she made her way over, the bartender raised an eyebrow but said nothing. Aaro Mercier knew better than to draw attention to herself in places like this.

"Ryker," she said, her voice low and husky. "We need to talk."

He nodded, pushing off from the bar. The two of them slipped into a corner table, the sound of laughter and clinking glasses muffled by the heavy curtains.

"Aaro Mercier's got a problem," Ryker said, his eyes glinting in the candlelight. "I've gotten myself entangled with someone – someone I shouldn't be with."

Aaro's brow arched. "Who is it?"

Ryker hesitated before answering. "The daughter of one of our most powerful clients. She wants to join us on a job, and... well, she's got skills."

Aaro Mercier raised an eyebrow. This was the kind of trouble they used to avoid – not the kind they should be seeking out.

"Tell me more," Aaro said, her interest piqued despite herself.

As Ryker spilled his tale, Aaro Mercier's mind whirled with possibilities and pitfalls. But one thing was certain: she'd be right by Ryker's side, Aaro Mercier style – ready to adapt, manipulate, and steal the show once again.
