As a child, he would spend hours exploring the frozen tundra, camera in hand, capturing the stunning vistas and wildlife.

As he grew older, Aaro's passion for photography only intensified, leading him to study fine art at the University of Lapland. After completing his degree, he embarked on a journey to document the world's most remote and breathtaking destinations. From the snow-capped peaks of Mount Everest to the ancient ruins of Easter Island, Aaro's camera captured it all.

His latest project, a photographic series on the indigenous peoples of Siberia, had garnered international attention and accolades.

One of Aaro's most striking images was of a nomadic family in the Altai Mountains, their faces illuminated by the warm light of a setting sun. The photo, titled "Golden Hour," had become an iconic representation of his work and a testament to his dedication to telling the stories of those who lived on the fringes of society.
