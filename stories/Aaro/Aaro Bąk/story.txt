Aaro Bāks was an Estonian sailor and explorer who lived in the 16th century. He is best known for being the first European to navigate the coast of eastern Siberia, where he mapped the region's many rivers and inlets.

Born in 1504 in Tartu, Estonia, Aaro was raised by his father, a fisherman, in a small coastal town. From a young age, he showed a keen interest in sailing and navigation. As soon as he came of age, he set sail on the Baltic Sea, working as an apprentice on various merchant ships.

In 1530, Aaro received a commission from the Hanseatic League, a powerful trading federation, to lead an expedition up the Volga River to establish trade relations with the local tribes. The journey was fraught with danger, but Aaro proved himself to be a skilled and fearless navigator. He expertly navigated the treacherous waters of the Volga Delta and established contact with the Mansi people.

Over the next several years, Aaro continued to explore the region, mapping many of its rivers and inlets. His reports back to Europe helped to establish trade routes between Russia and Western Europe, which had a profound impact on the development of European colonization in Asia.

Despite his many achievements, Aaro's life was not without danger. He faced hostility from local tribes, harsh weather conditions, and the risk of disease. In 1555, he contracted malaria while on an expedition to explore the Ob River, but he persevered and continued to lead expeditions throughout Siberia.

Aaro returned to Europe in 1560, his reputation as a skilled navigator and explorer cemented. He wrote several accounts of his journeys, including "The Voyage to the East", which became a bestseller among European sailors and traders. His stories of the vast, untamed wilderness of eastern Siberia inspired many young adventurers to set out on their own journeys of discovery.

Aaro Bāks is remembered today as one of the most important figures in the history of Estonian exploration. His bravery and skill helped to open up new trade routes between Europe and Asia, paving the way for centuries of European colonization in the region.
