Born and raised in the heart of Denmark, Nielsen's love affair with jazz began at an early age, inspired by the sounds of Bill Evans and Keith Jarrett. He spent countless hours listening to records, mastering the nuances of each piece, before attempting to recreate them on his own piano. As he honed his craft, Nielsen's unique voice emerged – a blend of Scandinavian simplicity and American spontaneity.
