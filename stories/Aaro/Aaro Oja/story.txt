Aaro Oja stepped out of his small, wooden cottage and onto the frost-covered porch. The crisp winter air bit at his nose as he took a deep breath, filling his lungs with the scent of pine and snow. It was days like this that made him grateful for the solitude of his remote cabin in the Finnish woods.

As a skilled hunting guide, Aaro had spent countless winters exploring these same woods, tracking down game and honing his skills to survive off the land. But it wasn't just the wilderness that drew him here; it was the memories, too. His late wife, Maria, had passed away a year ago, leaving him alone with only their young son, Jari, to share in his grief.

Aaro's thoughts drifted back to the past as he began his daily routine: checking traps, tending to the garden, and starting a fire for the day's meals. His son was sleeping, safe and warm in his small bed inside the cottage. He smiled, remembering the countless times Jari had begged to come hunting with him.

Just then, the crackle of a snowmobile echoed through the forest as Aaro's old friend, Pekka, pulled up at the cabin door. "Aaro, I brought food!" he called out, shoveling snow off his jacket. Aaro welcomed Pekka into the warmth of the cottage and together they broke bread, sharing stories of their hunting adventures.

As the evening drew in, Aaro sat by the fire with Pekka, watching Jari play outside in the fading light. He felt a sense of peace wash over him; it was as if Maria's presence still lingered around him, guiding him through these dark times. The fire crackled and spat, casting shadows on the walls as they talked long into the night.

Aaro glanced at Pekka, his eyes reflecting the weight of their shared friendship. "Thanks for being here for me," he said quietly, voice barely above a whisper. Pekka nodded, understanding in his expression. In this moment, Aaro felt the warmth and camaraderie that had been missing from his life since Maria's passing.

As the night deepened, Aaro lit another log onto the fire, watching as it grew higher into the darkness. The silence outside was broken only by the occasional howl of a wolf in the distance. He leaned back in his chair, feeling the comforting weight of friendship and solitude settle around him like a mantle.
