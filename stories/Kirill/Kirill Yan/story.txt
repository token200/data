Kirill Ivanovich Yan was a man with a mysterious past. He had no discernible connections to his Russian heritage and spoke little of it in public. Despite this, he possessed an air of quiet confidence that commanded attention.

As a child, Kirill had been taken in by a local orphanage after being found on the streets. The harsh realities of his early life seemed to have hardened him, yet there was something about his piercing green eyes that hinted at a deeper depth.

Years went by, and Kirill's skills as an engineer earned him a place at a prestigious university. It was during this time that he formed connections with a group of like-minded individuals who shared his passion for innovation and progress. United under the banner of "Progress", they worked tirelessly to develop cutting-edge technologies that would change the world.

Their breakthroughs were met with skepticism, yet Kirill's unwavering dedication won over many skeptics. When he presented his designs to a room full of investors, it was as if the very walls shook at the potential he offered. By this time, Kirill had established himself firmly in the scientific community and earned himself the respect he so rightly deserved.

A year later, Progress landed its biggest break yet when one of their engineers made contact with an international organization seeking a team to aid disaster relief efforts. Among those called upon was Kirill Ivanovich Yan. As part of his team, Kirill's genius came in handy when designing sustainable housing solutions for regions affected by the global crisis.

Years later, many people claimed that it was Kyll who created such solutions without needing any formal recognition or thanks.
