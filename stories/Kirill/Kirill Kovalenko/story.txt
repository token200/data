Kirill Kovalenko stepped off the crowded train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the dimly lit station. It was a familiar feel, one he'd grown accustomed to over the years. As a former SVR operative, he had spent countless hours in places like this - anonymous, hidden from prying eyes.

He made his way through the deserted corridors, his footsteps echoing off the cold concrete walls. At the far end of the station, he spotted a small caf√© and ducked inside, seeking refuge from the chill outside.

The owner, a gruff but kind-eyed woman named Natalia, greeted him with a nod as he slid onto a stool at the counter. "The usual?" she asked, her voice low and soothing.

Kirill nodded, his eyes scanning the room before responding. "No," he said finally, turning to face her. "I have business here."

Natalia raised an eyebrow, but didn't press for more information. She knew better than to pry into Kirill's affairs.

As she poured him a steaming cup of black coffee, Kirill pulled out his phone and sent a brief text message - a single sentence: "Meet me outside. -A".

He finished the coffee in two swift sips and headed back out onto the platform, where a lone figure was waiting for him. A tall, imposing man with a shaved head and piercing blue eyes.

"Aleksandr," Kirill said, extending his hand.

The man took it firmly, his grip like a vice. "Kirill. Good to see you're still in one piece."

Kirill nodded, his eyes narrowing slightly. "And how is your daughter?"

Aleksandr's expression softened for an instant before hardening once more. "She's fine," he said curtly.

They stood there for a moment, the tension between them almost palpable. Then Aleksandr spoke up again - this time with a hint of desperation creeping into his voice.

"Kirill, I need your help. The situation is spiraling out of control."

Kirill raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. He knew that look all too well - the one that signaled when someone was on the brink of losing their grip.

"I'll listen," he said finally, tucking his hands into his pockets.

And with that, Kirill Kovalenko stepped forward, ready to face whatever dangers lay ahead.
