Kirill Meinstein took a bow, his face flushed with emotion, as he smiled at the sea of adoring faces before him. It was moments like these that reminded him why he had dedicated his life to music - to share the beauty and pain of human experience with others.

After the concert, Kirill Ivanovich Meinstein made his way through the crowded hall, shaking hands and signing autographs for his fans.
