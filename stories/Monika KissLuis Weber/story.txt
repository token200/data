Monika Kiss was not an ordinary name, but it suited her perfectly. She had a unique kiss-shaped mark on her left cheekbone that she got from her mother when they were children. It was a token of love and a reminder to always be bold.

Born into a family of artists, Monika's creative soul was nurtured from a young age. Her father was a painter, and her mother was a sculptor. She grew up surrounded by canvases, paintbrushes, and clay. As a child, she would spend hours watching her parents work, mesmerized by the way colors blended together to create beautiful masterpieces.
