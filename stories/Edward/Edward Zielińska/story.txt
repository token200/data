When the broadcast finally ended, Edward let out a sigh of relief. It was over – but she knew that it was only just beginning. The fallout from her story would be intense, and she would need to be ready for anything.

Edward Zielińska smiled wryly to herself as she gathered up her notes. She had done it – she had brought the truth to light, no matter how difficult it might have been. Now all she could do was wait and see what happened next.
