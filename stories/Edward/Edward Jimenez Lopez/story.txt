He pushed open the door and was greeted by the warm smile of the baker's daughter, who offered him a free pastry in exchange for taking her picture.

Edward snapped away, capturing the sparkle in her eyes as she smiled for the camera. As he reviewed his shots on the bakery's old-fashioned camera, he felt a sense of satisfaction wash over him.
