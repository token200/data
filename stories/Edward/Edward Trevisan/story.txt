Edward Trevisan stood at the edge of the cliff, the wind whipping his dark hair into a frenzy as he gazed out at the stormy sea. It was a sight he'd grown accustomed to in these isolated islands, where the whispers of the past seemed to seep from every stone and wave.

As a young man, Edward had been drawn to this place by rumors of an ancient shipwreck, hidden beneath the waves for centuries.

Edward felt eyes upon him, watching from the darkness – and in that moment, he knew that he was no longer alone on these islands.
