Edward Olsen stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the cityscape below. As a renowned journalist and investigative reporter for the Daily Chronicle, he had seen his fair share of scandals and corruption. But nothing could have prepared him for the tip that had brought him here tonight.

"Edward Olsen, what are you doing up here?" A voice called from behind him, making him turn to face his colleague, Rachel Lee.

"Just taking a moment to clear my head," Olsen replied, eyes scanning the rooftops below. "I've got a story brewing in my mind, and I need to get it straight."

Rachel nodded sympathetically. "I know the feeling. Sometimes you just need to step back and take a fresh look."

Olsen snorted. "Easy for you to say, Rachel. You're not dealing with a lead that's been weeks in the making. This one's got all the makings of a Pulitzer."

Rachel smiled wryly. "Well, I'm sure it will be, Edward Olsen. When do we go live?"

Olsen hesitated, weighing his options. He knew Rachel was itching to get started on the story, but he wasn't ready yet. Not until he had uncovered every shred of evidence.

"I'll tell you when I'm good and ready," Olsen said finally, turning back to the city below.

Rachel raised an eyebrow, but nodded in understanding. "Suit yourself, Edward."

As she turned to leave, Olsen called out after her. "Hey, Rachel? One more thing."

She stopped, turning back to him. "What is it?"

"Keep this under your hat for now," Olsen said, eyes locked on hers. "But I think our source might be in danger."

Rachel's expression darkened, and she nodded tightly. "I'll keep quiet, Edward Olsen. But you'd better get moving fast. We can't afford to lose the source now."

Olsen nodded grimly, his mind already racing with possibilities. He knew that in this line of work, danger was always just around the corner. And when it came to a story like this, he had to be ready.

With newfound determination, Olsen turned and began to pace across the rooftop, lost in thought as the city lights twinkled below him.
