Edward Jing was a man with an extraordinary gift - the ability to see into people's pasts. As a child, he had always felt like there was something different about him, that he could sense things that others couldn't. It wasn't until his 25th birthday, however, that he discovered the full extent of his powers.

Edward was walking home from work one evening when he stumbled upon an old woman sitting on a bench. She was staring intently at him, her eyes filled with a deep sadness. As Edward approached, she looked up and spoke to him in a low, raspy voice. "You have a gift, boy," she said. "A gift of sight."

Over the next few weeks, Edward learned how to control his powers, honing them until he could see vivid images of people's pasts. He discovered that he could also sense their deepest desires and darkest fears.

As news of Edward's abilities spread, people began to seek him out for guidance. A young couple came to him seeking advice on whether to start a family, while a businessman sought his counsel on how to navigate the cutthroat world of finance.

Edward was happy to help, but he soon realized that his powers came with a steep price. Every time he used them, he felt a fragment of himself slipping away. He began to wonder if it was worth it - could he really make a difference in people's lives without losing himself in the process?

One day, Edward received a visit from an old friend who had been struggling to come to terms with his own past. The young man, Alex, had grown up on the wrong side of the tracks and had always felt like he didn't quite fit in. As they sat together, Edward could see the weight of his friend's burdens lifting off his shoulders.

For a moment, Edward forgot about his doubts and simply let himself feel the rush of connection that came with helping others. It was exhilarating - and terrifying. He knew that he couldn't keep doing this forever, but for now, he would continue to use his gift to bring light into the lives of those around him.

As the old woman on the bench had said all those years ago, Edward's gift was a double-edged sword. It could bring great joy or unspeakable pain - but it was up to him to wield it wisely.
