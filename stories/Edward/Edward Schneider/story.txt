Edward Schneider sat at his desk, staring blankly at the photograph in front of him. It was an old black-and-white picture, taken on what he thought might have been the day he died. The photo showed a group of people gathered around a grave, their faces somber and sorrowful. Among them was Edward, young and full of life, with a mischievous glint in his eye.

It had all happened twenty years ago, during a solo trip to Europe. Edward had been driving through the rolling hills of Tuscany when he got into a car accident. The police said it was no fault of his own, that another driver had failed to yield. But Edward knew better. He remembered the moment, like it was yesterday.

As he gazed at the photo, memories came flooding back. He recalled the way the sunlight danced across the cypress trees, the taste of freshly made espresso on the café patio, and the sound of Italian laughter carrying through the air. It was all so vivid, yet somehow disconnected from his own life now.

Edward's mind began to wander to what could have been. If he hadn't died that fateful day, would he still be traveling? Would he have found success in his photography career? Or would he have settled into a comfortable routine, content with the familiar?

A knock at the door broke Edward's reverie. His roommate, Tom, walked in with a cup of coffee and a sheepish grin on his face.

"Morning," Tom said, setting the cup down on the edge of the desk. "I saw you staring at that photo. You know I've been meaning to ask: what happened to you?"

Edward took a deep breath before speaking. He'd told this story many times before, but it never seemed to lose its power.

"I died," he said matter-of-factly. "In a car accident on my way home from Europe."

Tom's eyes widened in surprise, and Edward chuckled wryly. He had grown accustomed to this reaction over the years. People rarely believed him when he told them about his death – as if it was just another story he'd come up with.

But Tom looked at Edward differently now. There was a glimmer of understanding, perhaps even curiosity. For a moment, they sat in silence, both lost in their own thoughts.

Edward finished the coffee and stood up, dusting off his pants. "Time for work," he said, as if breaking some unspoken spell. Tom nodded, and the conversation moved on to more mundane topics.
