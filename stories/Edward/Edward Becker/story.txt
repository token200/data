Edward Becker sat in his cluttered, dimly lit office, surrounded by stacks of dusty files and faded photographs. As the lead detective with the Los Angeles Police Department's Cold Case Unit, he had spent countless hours pouring over the same old crimes, trying to crack the ones that had gone unsolved for decades.

But it was one case in particular that still haunted him - the murder of 20-year-old Sarah Jenkins, whose body had been found in a deserted alleyway five years ago. Edward's gut told him that he was close to solving it, but every lead ended in a dead end, and every suspect came with an airtight alibi.

Just as Edward was about to give up for the day, his phone rang. It was an anonymous caller, whispering a single phrase: "Look again at the eyewitness."

Edward's eyes narrowed as he scribbled down the words in his notebook. Who was behind this? Was it a genuine tip or just another prank? He knew that every tip no matter how small gave him hope that the case was finally going to crack.

The next day, Edward headed back to the Jenkins' case file, determined to see it through. The eyewitness testimony had been shaky at best - Sarah's best friend, Rachel, remembered seeing a figure lurking around the alleyway on the night of the murder, but the description was vague and inconsistent with any known suspects.

But as he dug deeper into the case, something caught his eye. A small notation in the margin of an old police report had been made by a rookie officer at the time: "Witness saw suspect wearing distinctive tattoo - resembles symbol of an ancient cult." The tattoo was unlike anything Edward had seen before, but it sparked a memory - he recalled a conversation with Rachel the previous day.

"Rachel, I know you said you didn't see much that night," Edward asked over the phone. "But did you notice anything unusual about the figure's hands? A tattoo?"

There was a pause on the other end of the line before Rachel stammered: "I remember now... it had a serpent coiled around his wrist."

Edward's eyes lit up as he jotted down the new information. It was all coming together - the symbol, the tattoo, and now the eyewitness description. He felt a sense of purpose wash over him, knowing that this could be the break they needed to finally solve Sarah's murder.

For the first time in years, Edward Becker felt hope for the case, and he knew that this might just be the end of an 11-year-long road of frustration and despair.
