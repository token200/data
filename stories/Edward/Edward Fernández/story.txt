Born in a small town in Spain, Edward's early life was marked by poverty and hardship. However, from a young age, he showed an uncanny talent for magic.

Edward spent countless hours practicing tricks and illusions in secret. He would sneak into the local theater at night to watch performances, studying every move of the actors and conjuring up new ideas. As he grew older, his passion for magic only intensified.
