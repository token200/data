Edward Thompson stepped into the dimly lit pub, his eyes scanning the room with an air of quiet confidence. A figure from his past had just walked in, and he needed to know what brought him here.

The man, dressed in worn leather, took a seat at the bar and ordered a whiskey. His eyes met Edward's across the room, a flicker of recognition sparking between them. It was Alex Chen, an old acquaintance from college days. They'd been inseparable, sharing late-night conversations about life, philosophy, and everything in between.

Edward made his way to the bar, sidestepping a group of rowdy patrons. As he approached, Alex looked up, his expression guarded.

"What brings you here?" Edward asked, taking a seat next to him.

Alex shrugged, sipping his drink. "I heard there was a job opening at the university. I thought it'd be worth investigating."

Edward raised an eyebrow. "You're not exactly known for your academic prowess, Alex. What made you think this would change anything?"

The air between them grew thick with tension. It had been years since they'd last spoken, and Edward wasn't sure he was ready to confront the past.

"I've changed, Ed," Alex said finally, his voice barely above a whisper. "I've grown. I want to make amends for what happened."

Edward's expression remained skeptical, but a spark of curiosity ignited within him. They'd been involved in a scandal during their senior year, one that had ruined reputations and damaged friendships.

"What are you talking about?" Edward asked, leaning forward.

"It was all a mistake, Ed," Alex continued. "I got caught up in the moment, and I let my emotions get the better of me. I've been carrying around the guilt ever since."

Edward's gaze narrowed. He wasn't convinced, but a part of him wanted to believe that Alex had finally found redemption.

The pub began to close, casting long shadows across the room. As they finished their drinks, Edward stood up, his mind racing with questions and doubts.

"I need some time to think," he said finally, extending a hand to Alex.

Alex took it firmly, but there was no sense of urgency in his grip. "I understand, Ed. Take all the time you need."

As they parted ways outside, Edward couldn't shake off the feeling that this was only the beginning of a complicated journey into the past.
