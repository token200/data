Zarina Ruiz García stepped off the plane in Santiago, Chile, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar landscape. She had spent years studying Spanish and saving up for this moment – to spend a year volunteering at a small school in rural Chile.

As she made her way through customs, Zarina felt a mix of emotions: excitement, nervousness, and a hint of homesickness. She was leaving behind her family, friends, and the comfort of home to immerse herself in a new culture.

Zarina's plan was to teach English to children in grades 6-8 at the school, where she would also help with homework and assist the teachers with their own classes. She had heard that the students were eager for language instruction, and she was determined to make a positive impact on their lives.

As she made her way to her new host family's house, Zarina couldn't help but feel a sense of trepidation. What if she struggled to communicate in Spanish? What if the children didn't respond well to her teaching style?

When she arrived at the cozy casa on the outskirts of town, Zarina was greeted with warm smiles and open arms by her host family, Carlos and Ana. Over a delicious dinner of pastel de choclo and empanadas, they welcomed her into their home and introduced themselves.

The next day, Zarina set off for the school, her backpack loaded with teaching materials and a determined spirit. She was greeted by the school's principal, Señorita Rodríguez, who showed her to her classroom.

As the days turned into weeks, Zarina settled into a routine of teaching English, playing soccer with the kids during recess, and helping with their homework. The children quickly warmed up to her, laughing at her attempts to speak Spanish and giggling when she tried to teach them jokes in English.

But it was one student, a shy and reserved girl named Sofía, who stole Zarina's heart. Sofía struggled to learn English, and Zarina worked tirelessly with her, using visual aids and gestures to help her grasp the language.

As the weeks turned into months, Zarina watched Sofía blossom into a confident and outgoing student. She saw the same spark in the other children, as they began to excel in their studies and make new friends.

For Zarina, this experience was more than just volunteering – it was about finding purpose and belonging in a foreign land. As she sat on her host family's couch one evening, watching the sunset over the Andes mountains, she knew that she had made the right decision.

"Gracias, Chile," she whispered to herself, smiling up at Carlos and Ana, who smiled back and wrapped her in a warm hug.
