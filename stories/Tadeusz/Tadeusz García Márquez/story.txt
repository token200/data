She was eager to showcase his work in an upcoming exhibition, but had one condition: that he create a new piece specifically for the event.

Tadeusz García Márquez accepted the challenge without hesitation. He spent the next few days pouring his heart and soul into the painting, which would eventually come to be known as "La Noche de Madrid."
