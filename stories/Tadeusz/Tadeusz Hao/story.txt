With precision and stealth, he bypassed security cameras and alarms, navigating through ventilation shafts and hidden passages. The final hurdle was a laser beam slicing across the floor; Tadeusz Hao simply smiled as he executed a flawless leap over it.

The artifact was his, and as he made his escape into the night, Tadeusz Hao couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. He had proven himself once again - Tadeusz Hao, the master thief, remained untouchable.
