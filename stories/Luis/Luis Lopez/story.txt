Luis Lopez had always been fascinated by the world of photography. Growing up in a small town in New Mexico, he spent most of his free time experimenting with cameras and developing film in his makeshift darkroom. As he honed his craft, Luis's passion for capturing moments and telling stories through images only grew stronger.

After high school, Luis decided to pursue a degree in fine arts, with a focus on photography. He worked tirelessly to build his portfolio, taking on freelance gigs and collaborating with local artists to hone his skills.
