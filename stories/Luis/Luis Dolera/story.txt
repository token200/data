Luis Dolera stepped into the dimly lit bar, his eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. As he made his way to the counter, the bartender greeted him with a nod and a smile. "The usual, Luis Dolera?"

He nodded, taking a seat on one of the stools. The bartender expertly mixed a drink, sliding it down the bar to him. Luis Dolera took a sip, feeling the familiar burn of tequila as he gazed out at the crowd.

As he sipped his drink, memories began to flood back. He thought about his childhood, growing up in the small town where everyone knew everyone's name. He remembered the time he and his friends had snuck into the local movie theater, laughing and joking as they watched the early morning showing of their favorite film. Luis Dolera chuckled to himself, feeling a pang of nostalgia wash over him.

Just then, the door swung open and his old friend, Carlos, walked in. "Luis Dolera!" he boomed, slapping him on the back. "Long time no see!"

The two men spent the next hour catching up, reminiscing about old times and sharing stories of their lives since moving away from home. Luis Dolera listened intently as Carlos spoke of his travels, his adventures taking him to far-flung corners of the world.

As the night wore on, the bar began to empty out, and the bartender started to clean up. "I should probably get going," Carlos said, finishing his drink. "But I'll see you around, Luis Dolera."

Luis Dolera nodded, watching as his friend walked out into the cool night air. He took one last sip of his drink, feeling a sense of contentment wash over him. It was moments like these that reminded him why he loved coming back to this bar â€“ it was a place where time stood still, and all that mattered was the present.

With a final nod, Luis Dolera pushed off from the stool and walked out into the night, leaving the memories of his youth behind him, but carrying them with him like a warm ember.
