Luis Totti was a man on a mission. A former professional soccer player turned entrepreneur, he had always been driven by a passion for innovation and community development. After hanging up his cleats following a storied career as a midfielder with Barcelona, Luis found himself in the bustling streets of Medellín, Colombia.

It was there that he discovered his true calling: creating a sustainable energy solution for underserved communities. With a keen eye for design and a knack for problem-solving, Luis co-founded EcoCycle, a company dedicated to harnessing the power of organic waste to generate electricity.

EcoCycle's flagship product, the BioBox, was a revolutionary recycling unit that converted food waste into clean energy. The units were designed to be compact, affordable, and easy to install, making them accessible to families in need.

One such family was the Muñozes, who lived on the outskirts of Medellín in a small rural town. For years, they struggled to find reliable electricity, relying on expensive generators that left their children with respiratory problems.

When Luis visited the Muñozes' farm, he was struck by the ingenuity and resilience of its inhabitants. He saw an opportunity to not only provide them with a sustainable energy solution but also to empower them as entrepreneurs themselves.

Luis offered the family a BioBox in exchange for a share of their organic waste. Within months, the Muñozes were generating enough electricity to power their entire home, complete with lights, fans, and even a small refrigerator.

Word spread quickly about EcoCycle's innovative approach, and soon Luis was receiving requests from all over Colombia. He assembled a team of passionate engineers, designers, and social workers to help him expand his operations.

Through hard work and dedication, EcoCycle began to transform communities across the country. The company became synonymous with sustainable development, innovation, and community empowerment. And at the heart of it all was Luis Totti, a man driven by a vision to illuminate the world – one BioBox at a time.
