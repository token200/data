One rainy evening, Luis Kovalenko received a visit from a nervous young woman named Sarah. Her sister, Emily, had gone missing three days ago, and the police seemed powerless to help her. Desperate for answers, Sarah begged Luis Kovalenko to take on the case.

As he listened to Sarah's story, Luis Kovalenko made a mental note of every detail. He was intrigued by the inconsistencies in the police report and suspected that something was amiss. With his vast network of contacts, he set out to dig deeper into Emily's disappearance.
