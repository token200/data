Inoue Kiss was a name whispered in hushed tones among the art world's elite. A mysterious figure, shrouded in secrecy, with an obsession for creating works that defied explanation. Some said he was a visionary, others a charlatan, but one thing was certain: his art was like nothing anyone had ever seen before.

Rumors swirled about Inoue Kiss's past – some claimed he was once a struggling artist from Tokyo, while others whispered he was a former scientist turned avant-garde genius. The truth remained elusive, adding to the enigma surrounding him.
