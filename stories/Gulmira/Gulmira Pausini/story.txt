I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Gulmira Pausini. It's possible that you may have misspelled the name or that Gulmira Pausini is not a well-known character.

However, I can suggest some popular authors who have written stories featuring female characters with similar names. For example, Anna Pausini is an Italian singer-songwriter who has also written several books of poetry and prose. If you'd like, I can try to write a story in the style of one of her books, but it would not be based on a specific character named Gulmira Pausini.

Alternatively, if you could provide more context or information about the character you are looking for, such as the genre or setting of the story, I may be able to help you better.
