Gulmira Kortajarena was a name whispered in awe by those who knew her. A skilled warrior from a distant land, she had earned a reputation for being nearly unbeatable on the battlefield. Her striking features and piercing green eyes seemed to mesmerize her enemies, giving them an unsettling feeling that they were about to meet their match.

Born into a tribe of fierce fighters, Gulmira was trained in the art of combat from a young age. She demonstrated a natural talent for swordplay and archery, quickly rising through the ranks of her tribe's warriors. As she grew older, however, it became clear that there was more to her than mere skill with a blade.

Gulmira's people believed that each warrior had a spirit guide – a mystical force that guided them in battle and helped them overcome even the most daunting challenges. For Gulmira, her spirit guide was said to be the ancient goddess of war, Shara-Beyit. She saw visions of battles fought and won by her ancestors, and heard the whispers of Shara-Beyit's wisdom.

As she grew into adulthood, Gulmira began to realize that her connection to Shara-Beyit went far beyond mere fantasy. During moments of great stress or uncertainty, she would experience vivid dreams and intuitions that seemed almost...divine. It was as if the goddess herself was guiding her towards victory, or warning her away from danger.

The stories of Gulmira's prowess spread quickly across the land, drawing the attention of rival tribes and powerful warlords. Some sought to challenge her, while others offered their allegiance in exchange for her protection. But one man remained immune to her allure – a young king named Arin who ruled over a distant kingdom.

King Arin was no fool. He knew that if he wanted to claim the throne for himself, he needed an ally of unparalleled strength and strategic prowess. And so, he set his sights on Gulmira Kortajarena, hoping to win her hand in marriage and secure a lifelong source of battle-hardened loyalty.

As the news of Arin's interest reached her people, the whispers began – about a young king seeking to capture the legendary warrior queen. But little did anyone know that Gulmira had already caught wind of Arin's proposal...
