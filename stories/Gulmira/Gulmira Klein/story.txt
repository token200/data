Gulmira Klein was an artist known for her thought-provoking and emotionally charged paintings that explored themes of identity, culture, and social justice. Her work often incorporated vibrant colors and striking imagery, drawing viewers into the depths of human experience.

Born to a refugee family who had fled war-torn Afghanistan, Gulmira's own experiences with displacement and belonging informed much of her art.

She had exhibited alongside some of the most renowned artists in the world, yet she never lost sight of her roots or the community that supported her.

Despite her success, Gulmira remained committed to using her art as a tool for social change. She worked tirelessly with organizations that supported refugees and immigrants, creating public installations and workshops that promoted empathy and understanding. Through her art, she aimed to humanize the statistics and news headlines that often dominated the media, revealing the beauty and complexity of people who were often overlooked.
