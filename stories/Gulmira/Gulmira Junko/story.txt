Gulmira Junko stood at the edge of the bustling market, her eyes scanning the vibrant stalls for any sign of what she was looking for. As a skilled thief and smuggler, she had earned a reputation for being able to get anything, no matter how rare or valuable.

Her gaze landed on a small, unassuming stall tucked away in a corner of the market. The vendor, an old man with a kind smile, beckoned her over. Gulmira's heart quickened as she approached the stall, her trained eyes scanning the array of goods on display.

"Welcome, my dear," the vendor said, his voice low and gravelly. "I have something special for you, if you're willing to take a risk."

Gulmira's curiosity was piqued. She reached out a hand and picked up a small, intricately carved box made of a wood she didn't recognize.

"Where did this come from?" she asked, her fingers tracing the intricate patterns etched into the surface of the box.

The vendor leaned in close, his voice barely above a whisper. "I acquired it from a wealthy collector in the city of Zorvath. He was looking to part with something truly unique and special."

Gulmira's eyes narrowed as she examined the box further. She could feel the weight of its history emanating from it, a story that only revealed itself to those who looked closely.

"What is this thing?" she asked, her voice firm but controlled.

The vendor smiled, his eyes glinting with amusement. "That, my dear, is a fragment of the Starheart Tree – a relic rumored to hold the secrets of the ancient gods themselves."

Gulmira's heart skipped a beat as she realized the true value of the box. She knew that if she could get her hands on it, she would be able to sell it for a fortune.

"I'll take it," she said finally, her voice firm.

The vendor nodded, a small smile playing on his lips. "I thought you might say that."

As Gulmira pocketed the box and turned to leave, the old man called out after her. "Be careful, my dear. The Starheart Tree is said to be cursed – not just by those who seek to possess it, but also by those who wield its power."

Gulmira's smile was cold and calculating as she disappeared into the crowd, the box safely tucked away in her pocket. She knew that she had just made herself a very powerful enemy indeed.
