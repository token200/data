Gulmira Askarova sat alone in her small, cluttered apartment, staring at the worn photograph on her mantle. The faded image showed her as a young girl, standing beside her father, who was smiling proudly at her. She hadn't seen him since she was a teenager.

Gulmira's eyes wandered to the stack of papers on her kitchen table. Notes from an old friend, research for a new book about Soviet-era espionage, and scribbled journals from her days as a journalist in Moscow. Her fingers drummed against the worn wooden surface, an anxious habit she'd developed since giving up her reporting job due to a series of uncomfortable close calls.

The doorbell rang, breaking the silence. Gulmira hesitated before answering it. She saw her old colleague, Viktor Kuznetsov, standing on her porch with a hesitant smile.

"You're back," he said, taking in the unfamiliar surroundings. "We didn't get your message."

Gulmira gestured for him to enter. As they sat down at her kitchen table, their conversation meandered between reminiscing about past escapades and discussing potential security threats from rogue Russian operatives.

Viktor leaned forward as she described a cryptic source tip on recent activities in Chechnya. Gulmira's mind flashed with possibilities, but also lingering doubts. This could be another false lead or an opportunity to rekindle her passion for investigative journalism. 

Her fingers began drumming again; this time at a more insistent pace.

"This could be big," Viktor said, observing the movement in her hands. "Are you thinking of taking on the story?"

Gulmira took a deep breath before shaking her head. 'Not yet,' she admitted quietly. She had made similar mistakes before and wasn't about to risk losing herself again.

Their conversation concluded as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the room in soft shadows. Gulmira walked Viktor to his car parked outside. Before parting ways, he handed her a small note tucked between pages of an old book.

"It's just something you should see," Viktor said softly. "If this feels right again."

As she watched him drive away into the fading light, Gulmira's fingers paused, hovering around the paper clutched in her hand. There was no message â€“ only those few words: 'Trust yourself.'
