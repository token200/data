Gulmira Gauthier stepped out of her small café, a haze of cigarette smoke swirling around her as she exhaled a sigh of frustration. It had been five years since she'd opened the Café au Ciel, and yet, it still felt like an uphill battle to make ends meet.

As she lit another cigarette, the sounds of the bustling streets of Montreal washed over her - the chatter of passersby, the wail of sirens in the distance. She watched a young couple laughing together, hands entwined as they walked down the sidewalk. Gulmira couldn't help but feel a pang of envy; she'd never known love like that.

Her thoughts drifted to her own life, spent in the service industry since her early twenties. A career change was long overdue, but what did she want to do instead? The fire that had once burned within her to write and create seemed to have fizzled out, extinguished by the harsh realities of adulthood.

Just then, a familiar figure appeared at the door of the café. It was Jean-Pierre, a regular who'd become like a surrogate brother over the years. He slid onto his usual stool, flashing that disarming smile as he greeted her with a kiss on each cheek.

"What's new?" Gulmira asked, trying to feign interest in his mundane tales of office politics and weekend getaways.

Jean-Pierre launched into a tale of his latest failed romance, exaggerating the details for comedic effect. Gulmira laughed along with him, feeling like she was a child again, carefree. But beneath the surface, her mind began to wander once more. What if she took a leap of faith? What if she invested in herself, and chased that elusive dream of hers?

A spark ignited within her as Jean-Pierre asked about her plans for the future. For a moment, their conversation stalled, like time itself had slowed down. Then, with a mischievous grin, Gulmira began to sketch out an idea on a napkin.

"I need to start writing," she declared, voice firm and resolute. "Even if it's just in the margins of my day job." Jean-Pierre raised an eyebrow but offered his support without question.

Gulmira took a long drag of her cigarette, feeling the first tentative stirrings of that fire she thought had been extinguished. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting Montreal in a warm golden light, Gulmira felt something shift within her - like a key turning in a rusty lock. For the first time in years, she saw a glimmer of hope on the horizon, and it was brighter than she'd ever imagined.
