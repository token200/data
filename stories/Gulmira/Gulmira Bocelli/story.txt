Born in Rome, Italy to a family of Italian-Pakistani descent, she began singing at the tender age of five, inspired by her grandmother's enchanting voice. She rose to fame with her powerful, soulful performances, captivating audiences worldwide.

Despite her meteoric rise to stardom, Gulmira remained humble and dedicated to her craft.

However, Gulmira's journey wasn't without its challenges. She faced intense scrutiny from the media and public, who often expected her to conform to traditional beauty standards.
