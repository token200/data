Halima Wei sat at her desk, staring blankly at the spreadsheet in front of her. As the CEO of her own tech firm, she was used to being in control, but today she felt like she was losing her grip.

It had been a year since she'd made the decision to leave her comfortable but unfulfilling job to start her own company. She'd poured all her savings into it, and now she was struggling to keep up with demand. Her team was working overtime, but Halima couldn't shake the feeling that they were all just winging it.

Just then, her assistant, Maria, poked her head into the room. "Halima, I need to talk to you about something," she said, looking nervous.

"What is it?" Halima asked, wiping her hands on a towel.

"It's about your dad," Maria said, hesitating. "He's been asking questions. About your company."

Halima felt a knot form in her stomach. Her father was always a bit of a meddler, and she knew he didn't understand the intricacies of running a business. But what really worried her was that he might be trying to sabotage her.

"Ask him not to," Halima said, trying to sound firm but failing miserably. Maria nodded, looking sympathetic.

Just then, Halima's phone rang. It was her father, calling to "just check in." Halima sighed, knowing she couldn't avoid him forever. She put on a bright smile and answered the call.

"Hey, Dad," she said, trying to sound cheerful. "What's up?"

"It's just that I want to help you with your business," he said, sounding sincere for once. "I know it can be tough starting something from scratch."

Halima felt her defenses go up. She knew her father meant well, but this was exactly what she'd been afraid of - him trying to take over.

"I appreciate the offer, Dad," she said, trying to keep her tone light. "But I've got everything under control. Really."

There was a pause on the other end of the line before Halima's father spoke up again. "Okay, sweetie. Just be careful. And don't hesitate to call if you need anything."

Halima felt a surge of frustration, but she knew better than to push him. She smiled and thanked him for checking in.

As she hung up the phone, Maria looked at her with concern. "Is everything okay?" she asked.

Halima shook her head, feeling a weight settle on her shoulders. She knew that with her father's interference, things were going to get a lot more complicated.
