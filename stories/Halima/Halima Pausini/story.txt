I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Halima Pausini. However, I believe you may be referring to Zucchero Fornaciari's song "Orlando" which features a female singer named Halima Pausini. 

If that's the case, here's a story based on that:

In the vibrant city of Bologna, Italy, there lived a young and talented singer named Halima Pausini. She was known for her powerful voice and captivating stage presence, often performing with the famous Italian rock musician Zucchero Fornaciari.

One sunny afternoon, Halima found herself backstage at one of their upcoming concerts. As she began to warm up her vocal cords, she noticed a young boy from the audience, who had been watching her perform for hours. The boy's eyes sparkled with admiration as he listened to her powerful rendition of "Baila" by Zucchero.

Feeling a sense of connection with the young fan, Halima decided to take a moment out of her busy schedule to meet him. She walked towards the stage door and, after some discreet inquiries, managed to find the boy's name: Luca. Overjoyed at the coincidence, Halima invited Luca backstage for an exclusive interview.

As they sat down in the dressing room, Halima shared stories about her journey from a young girl with a love for music to becoming one of Italy's most celebrated singers. She spoke candidly about Zucchero and their collaborative work on songs like "Orlando," which had become an anthem for many Italian fans.

Luca was amazed by Halima's humility, kindness, and generosity. The two quickly became close friends, bonding over their shared passion for music and life. As the evening came to a close, Halima gifted Luca with a rare CD signed by herself and Zucchero, ensuring that their unforgettable encounter would remain etched in his memory forever.

And so, Halima Pausini continued to inspire fans worldwide with her enchanting voice and captivating presence, leaving behind an indelible mark on the hearts of those who had the privilege of meeting this extraordinary artist.
