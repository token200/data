Years passed, and Halima Lāce honed her craft, experimenting with different patterns and techniques. Her creations were sought after by traders and merchants from far and wide, who would pay handsomely for a glimpse of her latest masterpiece.

One day, a wealthy patron approached Halima, requesting a commission to create a magnificent tapestry for his palace. The subject was to be a majestic lion, its mane a fiery halo against the dark blue sky. Halima Lāce accepted the challenge, pouring all her skill and passion into the project.

As she worked, the threads seemed to respond to her touch, weaving themselves together in a intricate dance of light and shadow. When the tapestry was complete, it shone like a beacon, its colors so vivid that they seemed to pulse with life.

The patron was overjoyed, and Halima Lāce's reputation spread far and wide. People came from all corners of the land to marvel at her creations, to bask in the radiance of her woven magic.
