Halima Ozoliņa stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar station. The sign above the entrance read "Riga" in flickering fluorescent lights, but it might as well have been anywhere else. She had no idea how she'd ended up here.

As a former refugee from Somalia, Halima was used to uncertainty. Her family had fled their home country after years of civil war and persecution, seeking safety in Europe. But this place – Riga – felt different. The air was thick with an otherworldly silence, like the city itself was holding its breath in anticipation.

Halima's thoughts turned to her past, to the life she'd left behind. Her parents had died in the conflict; she was one of the lucky ones who made it out. But what was "lucky" when your entire world was reduced to ash and dust? She thought of her friends, scattered across Europe like fragments of a shattered mirror.

As she gathered her belongings from the luggage rack, Halima spotted a figure watching her from across the platform. A young man with piercing blue eyes and messy brown hair – he looked eerily familiar. He smiled, and Halima felt a shiver run down her spine.

The stranger introduced himself as Mārtiņš, and offered to show Halima around the city. Over coffee at a quaint café in the Old Town, they talked of everything and nothing: life in Riga, the war in Somalia, the absurdities of language barriers. It was like old times, but with none of the tension or fear.

Mārtiņš spoke fluent Somali, Halima discovered – her native tongue rustling from his lips like a secret shared between friends. They laughed together at jokes she'd forgotten existed, and talked of music – Mārtiņš played the guitar in a local band, while Halima had once sang with a group in Mogadishu.

As night fell over Riga, they walked along the river, lost in conversation that ebbed and flowed like the waves. For the first time since arriving, Halima felt at home – not in some dreamland of safety, but in this strange, new world where she was no longer alone.

"I never thought I'd find someone who speaks my language," Mārtiņš said, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he smiled.

Halima smiled back. "I guess sometimes life takes us places we didn't think we'd end up."
