One fateful day, Liu Alsbach received a message from the tribe's leader, requesting his presence at an important gathering. The elder explained that their village was facing a severe drought, one that threatened to destroy their crops and homes. In response to this crisis, the tribe had decided to participate in a grand hunt, with the goal of bringing down a massive aurochs as a symbol of prosperity.

And then, like a ghost, the aurochs appeared â€“ great and powerful, with eyes that seemed to pierce through Liu Alsbach's very soul.

Taking aim with a steady hand, Liu Alsbach released the arrow in a smooth arc, watching as it struck true in the beast's side. The tribe erupted into cheers as their warriors surrounded the fallen creature, basking in the glory of their triumph. And for Liu Alsbach, that moment would forever be etched in his memory as a testament to his unwavering dedication and unshakeable skill with the bow and arrow.
