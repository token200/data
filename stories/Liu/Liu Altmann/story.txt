Liu Altmann's eyes scanned the dusty alleyway, his worn leather boots making barely a sound on the crumbling cobblestones. The air reeked of decay and desperation, a fitting backdrop for the life he'd built in this forsaken corner of the world.

A former member of the Imperial Guard, Altmann had once been bred for honor and duty. Now, his armor was scarred and rusty, his sword gathering dust in a long-abandoned armory. He wore a wide-brimmed hat to shield his face from the unforgiving sun, but it did little to hide the lines etched into his weathered skin.

As he walked, the silence was broken only by the soft clinking of coins being collected from the ground. A beggar's life, Altmann thought wryly. The irony stung – a man once sworn to protect the emperor now begged for scraps on the streets.

He stopped at a crumbling stall, where a wizened old man hawked his wares: faded silks, tattered scrolls, and shards of broken pottery. Altmann purchased a small candle, its wax melting into a warm, golden glow as he lit it. The flame cast flickering shadows on the walls, making him feel like a ghost haunting this forgotten place.

The old man's eyes sparkled with curiosity as Altmann handed over a few coppers. "A soldier once, I see," the vendor croaked, his voice dripping with knowing. "What brings you back to the streets, eh?"

Altmann hesitated, unsure if he should reveal the truth – that his past came flooding back when he stumbled upon an ancient scroll hidden within the armory's ruins? That it spoke of a forgotten empire, one he longed to reclaim? No, not here. Not now.

"Just searching for scraps," he muttered, the old man's gaze lingering on him like a cold breeze. Altmann turned and walked away, leaving behind the faint scent of his candle, a reminder that even in exile, some embers still glowed within.

The sun dipped lower, casting long shadows across the alleyway as Altmann vanished into the crowded streets. The city's sounds – merchants hawking their wares, children laughing – created a cacophony of forgetfulness, an aural shield against the memories he'd rather keep buried.

Yet, deep within him, the spark refused to die. Liu Altmann knew that, one day, his path would converge with the echoes of his past, and when it did, he'd be ready to reclaim what was lost – or forge a new destiny from the ashes of an empire long forgotten.
