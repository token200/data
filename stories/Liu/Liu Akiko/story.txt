Liu Akiko stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It had been months since she'd left Tokyo behind, seeking refuge from the memories that haunted her. The city's neon lights and bustling streets had always been a blur, but the faces – the ones she loved, the ones who loved her – still lingered in her mind like a ghostly presence.

She collected her suitcase and slung it over her shoulder, gazing out at the mist-shrouded mountains that rose up from the valley below. The air was crisp with a hint of pine and damp earth. It was a scent she'd missed since leaving Japan – a reminder of the land that had raised her, though not necessarily welcomed her.

Liu's eyes narrowed as she thought back to why she'd fled in the first place. It wasn't just the pain or the heartache; it was the secrets she'd uncovered, secrets that could get someone like her, who didn't belong anyway – dead. The weight of those secrets still lingered, a shadow following her wherever she went.

She took a deep breath and shouldered her suitcase once more, leaving the station behind as she walked into the misty valley. A small wooden sign caught her eye: "Sakura Village". It was a name that brought back memories – good ones. She smiled wistfully to herself, wondering if anyone still lived in this forgotten corner of Japan.

Liu continued on, winding through the narrow streets until she reached a familiar old house with weathered shutters and a garden full of cherry blossoms. The door creaked beneath her touch as she entered, the air thickening around her like a welcome blanket. She knew that within these walls was not only shelter but also a sense of home.

It had been years since she'd last been here. Yet the scent of the old wooden beams and the gentle rustle of silk hung heavy in the air, drawing her closer with each passing moment. A small wooden box on a side table caught her eye – one that once contained the most precious things of her past. Liu lifted it off, inhaling its worn wood and faded paper. Tears welled up at the edges of her eyes as memories long buried began to resurface.

The door creaked again behind her but this time she wasn't alone in it anymore. She looked over to see a young woman standing there – one who wore the same smile that had welcomed Liu all those years ago.
