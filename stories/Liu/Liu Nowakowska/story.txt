I couldn't find any information on a person named Liu Nowakowska. It is possible that this character is fictional. 

However, I can create a story based on your request.

Liu Nowakowska was a brilliant and fearless young archaeologist with a passion for uncovering the secrets of the past. Born in Warsaw, Poland, she had always been fascinated by history and culture, spending hours poring over dusty tomes and listening to tales from her grandmother about the old country.

As a child, Liu Nowakowska would often accompany her grandfather on digs, watching with wide eyes as he carefully excavated artifacts from the earth. It was there that she developed her own skills as an archaeologist, learning the intricacies of excavation techniques and developing a keen eye for spotting hidden treasures.

Years later, Liu Nowakowska had established herself as one of the leading experts in her field, with a string of successful digs under her belt. Her latest project, however, was perhaps her most ambitious yet: a deep dig into the ancient ruins of a lost city deep in the heart of Cambodia.

As she worked tirelessly to uncover the secrets of the site, Liu Nowakowska's colleagues began to notice a change in her demeanor. She had always been driven and focused, but now there seemed to be a sense of determination about her that bordered on obsession.

And then, one fateful day, it happened. Liu Nowakowska stumbled upon an ancient text etched into the wall of a hidden chamber deep within the ruins. The inscription was in a language she didn't recognize, but as she carefully transcribed it onto a piece of paper, her eyes widened with excitement.

It was a map, leading to a location that had been lost for centuries. Liu Nowakowska's heart racing with anticipation, she knew that this discovery would change the course of history forever.
