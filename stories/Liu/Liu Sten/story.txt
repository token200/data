Liu Sheng Sten was not exactly known for his diplomatic skills. As the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, he had a reputation for being blunt and straightforward, often speaking his mind without filtering his thoughts.

One sunny afternoon, as Liu Sheng Sten walked into the meeting room to discuss trade agreements with the ambassador from a neighboring country, everyone couldn't help but feel a sense of trepidation. They knew that Liu Sheng Sten's no-nonsense attitude would not make for an easy conversation.

The two ambassadors, Mr. Lee and Liu Sheng Sten, began their discussion by addressing some long-standing issues between their countries. But instead of trying to find common ground, they quickly dove into a heated debate on tariffs and subsidies. The room fell silent as the tension grew thicker, with neither side willing to give in.

Mr. Lee's face reddened with frustration, but Liu Sheng Sten remained composed, his eyes fixed firmly on his counterpart. "We've discussed this before," he said curtly. "Your country needs to open up its markets, and ours will follow suit."

The room was filled with uncomfortable silence as the other ambassadors exchanged nervous glances. It seemed as though time had stopped, leaving only Liu Sheng Sten and Mr. Lee staring each other down.

Just when it seemed like the meeting was going to devolve into chaos, something unexpected happened. Mr. Lee's demeanor shifted, his expression softening ever so slightly. "I see what you're saying, Minister," he said quietly. "Perhaps we can work on this together."

Liu Sheng Sten raised an eyebrow but didn't push the issue further. Instead, he nodded and began outlining a potential compromise. It was clear that Liu Sheng Sten's gruff exterior had given way to a more measured approach.

The meeting continued in a much more civil tone from then on, with both sides working together to find a mutually beneficial solution. And although it wasn't without its rough patches, the trade agreement ended up being a resounding success for both countries.

In the end, Mr. Lee approached Liu Sheng Sten after the meeting, smiling warmly. "I must say, Minister," he said, "your... straightforwardness caught me off guard. I think we make a good team."

Liu Sheng Sten smiled back, his face breaking into a rare smile. It was clear that beneath his tough exterior lay a more nuanced personality waiting to be explored.
