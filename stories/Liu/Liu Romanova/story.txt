Liu Romanova stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the desolate landscape before her. She had been running from her past for what felt like an eternity, but she knew it was only a matter of time before her pursuers caught up.

As she made her way through the crowded station, Liu Romanova's thoughts turned to the letter that had brought her here. It was from an old acquaintance, one who had promised to help her disappear and start anew. She had been skeptical at first, but desperation had driven her to take a chance.

Liu Romanova spotted a figure waiting for her by the exit and quickened her pace. The woman's eyes lit up as Liu Romanova approached, and she smiled warmly as they embraced.

"Welcome, Romanova," she said, using the name Liu preferred. "I'm glad you made it safely."

Liu Romanova returned the smile, feeling a sense of relief wash over her. She had been so scared for so long, but this woman seemed genuinely kind and understanding.

"My name is Liu," she corrected, feeling a little self-conscious about being referred to by an alias. "But please, call me Liu. It's easier that way."

The woman nodded, unfazed by the correction. "Of course, Liu. I'll make sure to use your real name from now on."

Together, they made their way through the city, finding a small apartment and beginning to settle in. It was a fragile start to a new life, but Liu Romanova felt a sense of hope for the first time in months.

As they explored their new surroundings, the woman – who introduced herself as Sofia – told Liu Romanova about her own story. She had been on the run from something similar to what Liu had escaped: a dark and complicated past that threatened to consume her at every turn.

Liu Romanova listened intently, feeling a deep connection to this stranger who understood her in a way few others did. For the first time in years, she felt like she was home.

As they settled into their new routine, Liu Romanova realized that Sofia's help came with a price: she had secrets of her own, ones that could put Liu Romanova in danger if revealed. But for now, she pushed those thoughts aside, focusing on the sense of belonging and security that Sofia offered.

Liu Romanova was finally starting to feel like herself again, and it felt amazing.
