Liu Wiśniewski stepped into the dimly lit bar, his piercing blue eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As a former mercenary and current private investigator, he had seen it all - from high-stakes heists to brutal gang wars.

His full name was Liu Weiwen, but few people knew that about him. He preferred to keep a low profile, using his adopted Chinese surname to blend in with the locals. It was a strategy that had served him well over the years.

Liu Wiśniewski made his way to the bar, nodding at the bartender as he took a seat at the counter. "Whiskey," he growled, tossing a few coins onto the counter.

The bartender raised an eyebrow but said nothing, expertly pouring Liu a generous shot of whiskey. As he downed it in one gulp, a tall, imposing figure strode into the bar - Victor Kuznetsov, a notorious Russian mafia boss.

Liu Wiśniewski's instincts went on high alert as Victor made his way to the bar, a calculating glint in his eye. "Liu Weiwen," he said, his deep voice dripping with menace. "I hear you're looking for work."

Liu Wiśniewski raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. "What kind of job?"

Victor smiled, revealing a gold-plated tooth. "A little retrieval mission. Package needs to be delivered to...a certain individual."

Liu Wiśniewski's gut told him this was trouble, but his curiosity got the better of him. "Name and details?"

Victor handed over a folder containing a photograph of a stunning woman with piercing green eyes. "Meet Sophia Patel. She'll know what you're talking about."

Liu Wiśniewski opened the folder, his gaze flicking to the photo before meeting Victor's. "I'm listening."

Without another word, Liu Weiwen accepted the mission, already mentally preparing himself for the dangers that lay ahead. As he downed another whiskey, a calculated grin spread across his face - it was going to be a long night.
