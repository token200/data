Liu Straume stepped into the dimly lit pub, her piercing green eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. A former member of an elite Norwegian special forces unit, Liu had traded in her combat boots for a more sedentary lifestyle as a freelance journalist.

As she made her way to the bar, Liu's thoughts drifted back to her childhood on the remote islands of Svalbard. Growing up, she had been drawn to the stories of her Tlingit mother, who spoke of the ancient traditions and myths that still lingered in the harsh Arctic landscape. Liu's name, which meant "Lion's Daughter" in the Tlingit language, was a constant reminder of her cultural heritage.

The bartender, a gruff but kind-hearted man named Kjetil, raised an eyebrow as Liu ordered a whiskey. "What brings you to town, Straume?" he asked, his voice low and gravelly.

Liu smiled wryly. "Just doing some research for my latest article. Nothing too exciting."

Kjetil nodded sympathetically. "Be careful out there, Liu. This city's got its dark corners."

Liu's gaze roamed the room, taking in the scattered patrons and the faint smell of cigarette smoke hanging in the air. She had heard whispers of a local crime lord who was rumored to be hiding in plain sight, using his charisma and wealth to manipulate those around him.

As she listened intently, Liu's ears picked up on the sound of muffled voices coming from the corner of the room. Her instincts kicked in, and she made her way over to investigate.

Behind a battered couch, a group of rough-looking men were huddled together, speaking in hushed tones. Liu's eyes locked onto one of them â€“ a burly man with a scar above his left eyebrow.

"Who are you?" Liu asked, her voice firm but even.

The man looked up, startled, before flashing a charming smile. "Just some friends having a drink, journalist lady."

Liu narrowed her eyes. She knew this guy was trouble, and she wasn't about to let him slip away without digging deeper. As she continued to observe the group, Liu Straume's sharp mind began to weave together clues and connections, preparing her for the next stage of her investigation.

For now, though, she simply nodded at the men and turned back to Kjetil, ordering another whiskey as she waited for her sources to reveal themselves.
