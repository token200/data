In ancient China, during the Three Kingdoms period, there lived a young and skilled warrior named Liu Yu, whose full name was Liu Dan's younger brother Liu Yu, son of Emperor Xian of Han.

Liu Yu was born into a family of great historical significance, being the younger brother of the warlord Liu Bei, who would one day unite the warring states of Shu, Wu, and Wei under his rule. As a child, Liu Yu had watched his older brother grow into a powerful leader, and he had always felt a sense of inadequacy in comparison.

Despite this, Liu Yu possessed a natural talent for martial arts and horsemanship that rivaled even the greatest warriors of his time. He spent countless hours training with some of the most skilled fighters of the era, honing his skills and developing a unique fighting style that blended speed, agility, and brute force.

As he grew older, Liu Yu became increasingly restless, feeling constrained by the limitations of his family's influence and power. He longed to forge his own path, to prove himself as a warrior in his own right, rather than simply following in his brother's footsteps.

One day, Liu Yu received a summons from the warlord Sun Quan, ruler of the eastern kingdom of Wu. Sun Quan sought Liu Yu's expertise in defending against a large army of enemy forces that threatened to invade his territory. Recognizing an opportunity to prove himself, Liu Yu accepted the challenge and set out with his men to defend Wu.

The battle was fierce and intense, but Liu Yu fought valiantly, using all of his skills and training to hold off the enemy hordes. In the end, he emerged victorious, having single-handedly repelled the invasion and earning the respect and gratitude of Sun Quan.

From that day forward, Liu Yu's reputation as a great warrior spread throughout the land, and he was hailed as one of the most skilled fighters of his time. His full name, Liu Dan's younger brother Liu Yu, son of Emperor Xian of Han, became synonymous with bravery and martial prowess.

Years later, when Liu Bei had united the Three Kingdoms under his rule, Liu Yu would serve as his trusted advisor and military commander, playing a key role in many battles and campaigns. Though he never attained the same level of power or fame as his brother, Liu Yu remained a respected and revered figure throughout Chinese history, known for his unwavering courage and unshakeable loyalty to those he called friend.
