Liu Jian stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the vast expanse of the city. As a detective with the Shanghai Police Department, he had seen his fair share of crime and corruption, but tonight felt different. Tonight, he was on the hunt for a lead that could change everything.

As he scanned the rooftops, his eyes landed on a figure huddled in the shadows. Liu Jian's instincts told him it was someone important, someone who could finally bring closure to a case that had been haunting him for years.

He crept closer, his footsteps light on the metal grating. The figure slowly raised its head, and Liu Jian saw a flash of recognition before it nodded in response.

"Qianqiu," he whispered, using the alias the informant had given him.

The young woman smiled, a mixture of fear and defiance etched on her face. "Jian, I know you've been looking for me."

Liu Jian nodded. "I have reason to believe that Qiao Ming's murder is connected to something much bigger than we initially thought."

Qianqiu took a deep breath before speaking. "It starts with the Red Phoenix gang," she began, her voice barely above a whisper. "They've been involved in everything from extortion to human trafficking. And at the top of it all is...your brother."

Liu Jian's heart sank. His younger brother, Wei, had always seemed like a good kid, but rumors had circulated about his involvement with the Red Phoenix gang.

"What do you know?" Liu Jian pressed, his mind racing with possibilities.

Qianqiu hesitated before continuing. "I've seen documents, evidence of Wei's dealings with the Red Phoenix. It seems he's been working to take them down from within."

Liu Jian felt a mix of emotions: shock, anger, and sadness. He had always thought his brother was innocent, but now...he wasn't so sure.

As Qianqiu finished speaking, Liu Jian knew that this case was far more complicated than he had ever imagined. The Red Phoenix gang, human trafficking, corruption â€“ the list went on. But one thing was certain: he would get to the bottom of it, no matter what it took.

With newfound determination, Liu Jian turned and walked away from the rooftop, ready to take on the challenges ahead and uncover the truth about his brother's involvement in the Red Phoenix gang.
