Ethan de' Medici was known for his striking features and enigmatic smile. As the heir to the ancient de' Medici family fortune, he had always been groomed to take the reins of the family's business empire. But Ethan had other plans.

Growing up in the grand estates of Florence, Italy, Ethan had always felt suffocated by the weight of his family's legacy. He longed for freedom and adventure, and spent most of his free time exploring the city's hidden alleys and secret gardens. His parents, the powerful and wealthy patriarch Giovanni de' Medici and matriarch Alessia de' Medici, disapproved of his wandering ways, but Ethan couldn't help himself.

One day, while browsing through an old bookstore in the Oltrarno district, Ethan stumbled upon a rare edition of Dante's Divine Comedy. The leather-bound book was adorned with intricate gold filigree and had a strange aura about it that drew him in. As he flipped through its yellowed pages, Ethan felt an inexplicable connection to the poem.

Intrigued, Ethan spent the next few weeks pouring over the Divine Comedy, studying the poet's themes of love, morality, and redemption. He became obsessed with the idea of exploring the world beyond Florence, to experience the beauty and cruelty that Dante had so eloquently described.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Ethan began to secretly plan his escape from the family estate. His parents would never approve, but he couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to life than the opulent halls and stifling traditions of the de' Medici dynasty.

Ethan's heart pounded as he made his move, slipping out of the mansion under the cover of night and setting off into the unknown. The wind whipped through his hair as he walked, the stars twinkling above like diamonds in the sky. For Ethan de' Medici, nothing would ever be the same again.
