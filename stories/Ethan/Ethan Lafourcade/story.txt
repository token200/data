Ethan Lafourcade stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit bar, shaking the water from his coat. He had just finished a long day of canvassing in the French Quarter, trying to drum up support for his opponent's mayoral campaign. As he took a seat at the bar, the bartender, a gruff but kind-hearted man named Jacques, raised an eyebrow.

"Rainy days like these are perfect for a good drink," Ethan said with a smile, signaling for a whiskey on the rocks.

Jacques nodded sympathetically. "You're running out of chances, ain't ya?"

Ethan took a sip of his drink, feeling the burn all the way down. He had been running for mayor since he was 25, and it seemed like every door he tried to open led to more rejection. But he refused to give up.

As he nursed his drink, Ethan watched as a young couple sat down at the next table over. They were laughing and smiling, completely carefree. He couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy. Why did they get to have all that happiness? Didn't he deserve it?

Ethan's mind began to wander back to his childhood in the Ninth Ward. Growing up, his family struggled to make ends meet, always just scraping by. But Ethan had always been driven to succeed. He worked multiple jobs as a teenager, saving every penny he could for college. And now, here he was, running for mayor.

Just then, Jacques leaned over and whispered something in his ear. "You got a message from your opponent's office," he said with a knowing look.

Ethan's eyes narrowed. What did they want? He finished his drink and headed out into the rain, the cold water soaking through his clothes as he made his way to City Hall.

When he arrived, he was met by the mayor-elect himself, who handed Ethan a letter. It was an offer - one that would change everything. The mayor-elect needed someone with Ethan's skills on his campaign team.

For the first time in months, Ethan felt like maybe, just maybe, this whole running-for-office thing was worth it after all. He smiled to himself as he walked back out into the rain-soaked night, feeling a glimmer of hope for the future.
