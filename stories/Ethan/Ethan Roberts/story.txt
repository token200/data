Ethan Roberts stared out at the grey, rain-soaked streets of Seattle, his eyes scanning the crowded sidewalks as if searching for someone. Or something. It had been three days since his sister's disappearance, and the police seemed no closer to finding any leads.

As a freelance journalist, Ethan was used to digging up secrets and uncovering the truth. But this case felt personal. His sister, Emma, had been a bright and ambitious young woman, full of life and laughter. She deserved to be found.

Ethan's thoughts drifted back to their last conversation before she vanished. They had been at a coffee shop in the University District, discussing her plans for the future. She had been working on a story about the city's growing tech industry, but seemed hesitant to share any details. Ethan had teased her about being too cautious, and now he wondered if his words had pushed her away.

A sudden jolt of determination coursed through him. He needed to get back into the field, to start asking questions again. The police might be stumped, but Ethan knew that's when the real work began.

He grabbed his umbrella and splashed out of the coffee shop, making his way to his small office in the Pioneer Square district. As he settled in, his phone rang. It was a text from an unknown number: "Meet me at the Space Needle at midnight. Come alone."

Ethan's instincts screamed warning, but something about the message resonated with him. He hesitated for a moment before typing out a reply: "I'll be there."

The hours ticked by, and Ethan found himself counting down the minutes until midnight. When he finally arrived at the Space Needle, a figure emerged from the shadows.

"Who are you?" Ethan demanded, his eyes narrowing.

The stranger handed him a small folder. Inside, a photograph of Emma stared back at him - taken just hours before her disappearance.

"This is all I have," the stranger whispered, before melting into the night.

Ethan's mind reeled as he pieced together the clues. The Space Needle was a hub for tech companies and startups, but what did this mean? Was his sister being used to uncover a deeper conspiracy?

Determined to follow every lead, no matter where it might take him, Ethan Roberts began his next investigation - one that would put everything on the line, but could also bring him closer to finding his sister.
