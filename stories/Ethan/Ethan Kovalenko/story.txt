Ethan Kovalenko stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the cityscape. As the lead investigator on the department's cold case team, he had seen his fair share of darkness and despair. But it was cases like this one that kept him up at night – a young woman's body found in an alleyway five years ago, with no leads or witnesses.

Kovalenko took a deep breath, feeling the cool breeze wash over him as he surveyed the city below. He had been working on this case for months, pouring over every shred of evidence, interviewing every potential witness. But so far, nothing had panned out.

As he turned to leave, his phone buzzed in his pocket. Kovalenko pulled it out, his eyes scanning the screen before coming to rest on a single text message from an unknown number: "Meet me at the old warehouse at midnight. Come alone."

Kovalenko's instincts told him to ignore it – this was probably just another crackpot tipster looking for attention. But something about the message resonated with him, and he found himself feeling drawn to it.

He decided to investigate further, and spent the next few hours researching the warehouse and its history. Finally, at midnight, he made his way there, his heart pounding in his chest.

As he entered the dimly lit building, a figure emerged from the shadows – a woman with piercing green eyes, who introduced herself only as "Sarah". She handed Kovalenko a small USB drive, which contained a single video file.

"This was taken by one of our team members five years ago," Sarah explained. "It shows you, Ethan Kovalenko. The same person they've been looking for."

Kovalenko's mind reeled as he watched the grainy footage on his phone – it was him, all right. But who had recorded this? And what did they want from him?

As he stood there, frozen in shock, Sarah vanished into the night, leaving Kovalenko with more questions than answers.
