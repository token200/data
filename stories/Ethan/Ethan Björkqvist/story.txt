Ethan Björkqvist was a name that echoed through the streets of Stockholm, Sweden, a city known for its vibrant cultural scene and rich history. Born to Swedish parents, Ethan grew up surrounded by the sounds and smells of traditional Nordic cuisine, his family's bakery being a staple in the community.
