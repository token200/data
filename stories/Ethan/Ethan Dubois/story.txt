Ethan Dubois walked into the old antique shop, the bell above the door jingling as he entered. He had been searching for this place for weeks, and finally, he had found it. The owner, an elderly man named Mr. Jenkins, looked up from behind the counter and smiled.

"Ah, Ethan Dubois! I've been expecting you," Mr. Jenkins said, his voice warm and familiar.

Ethan smiled back, feeling a sense of comfort in this place. He had always felt at home among the dusty old trinkets and forgotten treasures that lined the shelves.

"What brings you here today, Ethan Dubois?" Mr. Jenkins asked, his eyes twinkling with curiosity.

Ethan ran his hand over the intricate carvings on an old wooden cabinet. "I'm looking for something," he said, his voice low and thoughtful. "Something that will remind me of my childhood."

Mr. Jenkins nodded sympathetically. "Ah, I think I might have just the thing," he said, disappearing into the back room.

A few minutes later, he returned with a small, delicate music box. Ethan's eyes widened as he took it from Mr. Jenkins' hands.

"This is beautiful," he breathed, his fingers tracing the intricate patterns etched into the lid.

"Ah, yes," Mr. Jenkins said, his voice full of pride. "That was made by my grandfather, a skilled craftsman. I think it will bring back many fond memories for you, Ethan Dubois."

Ethan nodded, feeling a lump form in his throat as he wound the music box and listened to its soft, melancholy tune. It was like hearing a piece of himself from years ago.

As he left the shop, the music box safely tucked away in his pocket, Ethan felt a sense of peace wash over him. He knew that this small trinket would bring him joy for many years to come, and that Mr. Jenkins had played a part in reminding him of where he came from.

"Thank you, Mr. Jenkins," he said, turning back to smile at the old man.

Mr. Jenkins smiled back, his eyes shining with warmth. "Anytime, Ethan Dubois," he said.
