Ethan Koskinen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station. The worn wooden benches and faded signs seemed to blend seamlessly into the surrounding landscape, as if they had been there for decades. He breathed in deeply, taking in the scent of damp earth and decay.

It was a place Ethan knew all too well, a haven for outcasts and misfits. As a child, he had spent countless hours exploring these crumbling tunnels and forgotten buildings, his imagination running wild with tales of hidden treasures and secret societies.

Now, as a young adult, Ethan found himself drawn back to this place. He had left behind the sterile walls of the city, seeking a life that was more raw, more real. And so, he had come to the edges, where the world still held its breath in anticipation of something – anything – new and unexpected.

As he made his way through the station, Ethan noticed a figure watching him from across the platform. A woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair, her presence seeming to draw the air around her out. She was standing perfectly still, as if suspended in time, her gaze fixed on some invisible point beyond the horizon.

Ethan felt an inexplicable jolt of recognition, as if he had seen this woman before – though he knew that was impossible. He smiled, feeling a spark of curiosity ignite within him. Who was she? And what did she want?

The train rumbled and hissed in the distance, its wheels screeching against the tracks as it prepared to depart. Ethan watched as the woman began to move towards him, her pace deliberate and measured.

"Who are you?" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

"I'm someone who's been waiting for you," she replied, her eyes never leaving his face.

Ethan felt a shiver run down his spine as she reached out a hand, her fingers brushing against his. It was as if the entire world had come to a standstill – and in that moment, Ethan knew he was exactly where he belonged.

The woman's grip was like a key turning in a lock, unlocking a door within him that had been hidden for years. As they stood there, suspended between worlds, Ethan felt his heart begin to beat with a new rhythm, one that was wilder and freer than anything he could have ever imagined.

And so, with the woman by his side, Ethan stepped into the unknown, ready to explore the secrets of this forgotten world – and to discover what lay within.
