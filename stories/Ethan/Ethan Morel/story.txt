Ethan Morel stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station. He had been away for weeks, traveling to distant corners of the world in search of answers. The memories he'd left behind still lingered, a constant reminder of what he was running from.

As he walked through the crowded streets, Ethan's gaze met that of familiar faces. Friends and acquaintances nodded in greeting, their expressions a mix of curiosity and concern. He knew they wanted to talk, but Ethan had grown wary of getting too close.

He'd always been an outsider, even among those closest to him. His family had moved from one place to another as a child, never staying in one spot long enough for anyone to get attached. It was this nomadic lifestyle that had instilled in Ethan a sense of restlessness, a feeling that there must be more to life than the constant moving.

Now, after years of searching, Ethan felt like he was finally on the right track. His latest destination was a small town in the mountains, where an old friend lived who claimed to have information about his family's past. The truth about Ethan's parents had always been shrouded in mystery, and it was this lack of answers that drove him forward.

As he made his way up the winding mountain road, the air grew cooler and the trees seemed to close in around him. Ethan felt a sense of peace settle over him, like the weight of his journey was slowly lifting. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched, but whenever he turned to look, there was no one there.

The old friend's cabin came into view, smoke drifting lazily from the chimney. Ethan smiled as he approached the door and knocked. It swung open to reveal a warm, fire-lit interior and a face he hadn't seen in years.

"Ethan!" his friend exclaimed, embracing him tightly. "I've been waiting for you."

For a moment, Ethan forgot about all the questions and doubts that had plagued him for so long. All he saw was the familiar smile, the kind eyes that had once made him feel like home. Maybe, just maybe, this was where his journey would finally come to an end.
