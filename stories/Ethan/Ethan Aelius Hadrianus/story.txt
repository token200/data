Ethan Aelius Hadrianus stood atop the battlements, his eyes scanning the horizon as the sun dipped below the distant mountains. He was a man out of time, an archaeologist who had spent years searching for the lost city of Aquae Sulis, hidden deep in the heart of Britain.

As a Roman, Ethan had been born into a world of grandeur and conquest, but he had always felt a sense of restlessness, a desire to uncover the secrets of his ancestors' past. He had followed in the footsteps of countless others before him, delving into dusty libraries and crumbling ruins, searching for any hint of the lost city.

And then, finally, it had happened – a cryptic inscription on an ancient Roman tablet, speaking of Aquae Sulis as a place of healing and worship. Ethan's heart had skipped a beat as he deciphered the words, his mind racing with possibilities.

Now, as he gazed out at the rolling hills below, he could hardly believe that he was finally within reach of his dream. His team, a ragtag group of archaeologists and historians, bustled around him, setting up equipment and making final preparations for the night's expedition.

Ethan's thoughts turned to his wife, Lucilla – she had always been skeptical of his quest, but he knew that she was proud of him, even if she didn't understand why. He smiled to himself as he thought of her bright smile and sparkling eyes, and pushed on with renewed determination.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the landscape, Ethan gave the order for the team to move out. They descended into the darkness, their headlamps casting eerie shadows on the walls as they made their way deeper into the unknown.

And then, suddenly, they were there – the gates of Aquae Sulis, standing before them like an ancient gateway to the afterlife. Ethan's heart pounded in his chest as he stepped forward, his eyes drinking in the sight before him.

For a moment, he forgot that he was a man out of time, lost in a world of the past. He was one with the gods, one with the people who had come before him. And in that instant, Ethan Aelius Hadrianus knew that he would never be the same again.
