Ethan Bernard stood at the edge of the rooftop, the city lights twinkling like diamonds below him. He took a deep breath, feeling the cool breeze fill his lungs as he gazed out at the endless expanse of concrete and steel.

It had been five years since he'd lost his sister to cancer. Five years since his world had shattered into a million pieces. Ethan's life had been forever changed that day. He'd dedicated himself to finding a cure, pouring every ounce of energy into researching the disease.

As he looked out at the city, Ethan felt a sense of determination wash over him. He was close. He could feel it in his bones. The breakthrough he'd been working towards for months was just around the corner.

Ethan's eyes drifted to the small notebook on his lap, filled with scribbled notes and equations that made no sense to anyone but him. His mind was always racing with ideas, but sometimes they were just too far out there, too wild, to be taken seriously.

He chuckled wryly as he thought about his colleagues at the research facility. They'd all but given up on him years ago, relegating him to a corner of the lab where he could experiment without bothering anyone else. But Ethan knew that with one more breakthrough, they'd all forget why they'd ever doubted him.

A sudden movement caught his eye - a young woman standing at the edge of the rooftop, her eyes fixed intently on Ethan. He felt a jolt of surprise as she stepped forward, her long brown hair blowing in the wind.

"Hey," she said, breaking into his reverie. "I've been looking for you."

Ethan raised an eyebrow, intrigued. Who was this mysterious woman? And what did she want with him?

But before he could ask any questions, she pulled out a folder from her bag and handed it to him. Inside was a photograph of Ethan's sister, taken on one of their countless adventures together.

"This was found on the beach where you two used to go," she explained, her voice barely above a whisper. "I think it might be important."

Ethan took the photograph, his heart pounding in his chest. Could this really be the break he'd been waiting for? He looked up at the woman, his eyes locking onto hers.

"Thank you," he said, his voice low and rough.

And in that moment, Ethan felt a sense of hope that he hadn't felt in years. Maybe, just maybe, he was on the right path after all.
