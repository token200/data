Ethan Ángel Silvestre was a man of mystery, with an air of quiet confidence that commanded attention without demanding it. As he walked into the dimly lit café, his piercing green eyes scanned the room, taking in every detail. His dark hair was messy, as if he had just rolled out of bed, but his sharp jawline and chiseled features made him look like a man who could stop time with a single glance.

Ethan Ángel Silvestre took a seat at the bar, ordering a whiskey on the rocks without looking up. The bartender raised an eyebrow, clearly impressed by the stranger's poise. As he sipped his drink, Ethan Ángel Silvestre noticed a young woman sitting in the corner, nursing a cup of coffee. Her eyes were sunken, her skin pale, and her dark hair was matted with dirt.

Despite their differences, there was something about the woman that drew Ethan Ángel Silvestre in. Perhaps it was the way she seemed to be hiding behind a mask of despair, or maybe it was the way her eyes sparkled when she smiled, even if it was just for herself. Whatever it was, Ethan Ángel Silvestre felt an inexplicable connection to this stranger, and he found himself getting up from his seat and walking over to her table.

"Mind if I join you?" he asked, his deep voice low and smooth. The woman looked up, startled, but then nodded almost imperceptibly. As they struck up a conversation, Ethan Ángel Silvestre realized that this mysterious stranger was not just anyone – she was a fellow outsider, someone who had been wounded by the world and was struggling to find her way back.

As the night wore on, Ethan Ángel Silvestre found himself opening up to this woman in ways he never thought possible. He told her about his own struggles, his own demons, and to his surprise, she listened without judgment or pity. For the first time in a long while, Ethan Ángel Silvestre felt seen, truly seen, by another human being.
