Oskar Thompson stood at the edge of the ocean, the salty air whipping his dark hair into a frenzy as he gazed out at the waves. It was a familiar sight, one that had become both comforting and suffocating over the years.

As a child, Oskar had spent countless hours on these shores, exploring the tide pools and building sandcastles with his sister. His parents had always been there to lend a helping hand, but as he grew older, their presence began to feel like a constant weight.

After his mother passed away in a car accident when Oskar was 16, the pain of losing her seemed to seep into every pore of his being. He dropped out of college and left home, unable to bear the thought of facing another day without her by his side.

For years, he wandered from town to town, taking on odd jobs and trying to fill the void within him. But nothing seemed to stick, and he found himself drawn back to this spot, like a moth to a flame.

Now, as he stood at the edge of the ocean, Oskar felt the familiar tug of nostalgia and regret. He thought about his parents, and how they had always been there for him, even when he didn't want them to be. He thought about his sister, who had long since moved away to start her own life.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the waves, Oskar felt a sense of peace wash over him. It was as if the ocean was trying to tell him something - that it too knew what it was like to be lost and alone.

He took a deep breath, feeling the cool air fill his lungs, and began to walk along the shore. The sand crunched beneath his feet as he walked, the sound echoing out across the water. Oskar felt a sense of freedom with each step, as if he was finally starting to move forward, rather than just drifting through life.

As the stars began to twinkle in the night sky, Oskar stopped at a small rocky outcropping and sat down, his feet dangling over the edge. He watched the waves roll in, feeling a sense of connection to the vast and mysterious universe beyond his own troubles.

For the first time in years, he felt like he might finally be starting to find himself again - on the ocean's terms, rather than his own. And as the darkness closed in around him, Oskar smiled, knowing that tomorrow would bring its own set of challenges, but also its own opportunities for growth and discovery.
