One rainy evening, Oskar Hiroki received a cryptic phone call from an anonymous source claiming to have information about a high-profile murder case. The caller hinted at a shocking twist that could upend the entire investigation. Intrigued, Oskar Hiroki decided to pay the caller a visit, hoping to uncover more details.

Upon arrival at the agreed-upon location, a rundown alleyway in the heart of Tokyo's Shinjuku district, Oskar Hiroki spotted a figure shrouded in shadows. The figure handed him a small USB drive containing a series of cryptic emails and photographs. As Oskar Hiroki examined the contents, his mind began to piece together the puzzle.

Without hesitation, Oskar Hiroki set out to track down his contact, now known as "Ryo" after a chance encounter several years ago. Ryo led him on a wild goose chase through the city streets before finally revealing themselves at a quaint teahouse in the Shibuya ward.

As they sat amidst the tranquil atmosphere, sipping green tea and exchanging stories of their past adventures, Oskar Hiroki couldn't help but feel a sense of camaraderie with this enigmatic individual.

With renewed determination, Oskar Hiroki set his sights on unraveling the truth behind the murder case. As he poured over the evidence once again, a startling revelation emerged – a connection to an old adversary from his past that threatened to upend everything he thought he knew about justice and morality.

The game was far from over, but with Oskar Hiroki's unwavering determination and sharp instincts guiding him, it was clear that truth would eventually prevail. And as the Tokyo night unfolded its secrets before him, one thing became certain: Oskar Hiroki would leave no stone unturned in his pursuit of justice.
