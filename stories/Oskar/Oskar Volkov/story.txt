Oskar Volkov stepped out of his sleek, black sedan and onto the rain-soaked streets of downtown Moscow. The neon lights of the city's skyscrapers reflected off the wet pavement like diamonds, casting a gaudy glow over the deserted sidewalks.

As a member of Russia's elite oligarchy, Oskar was no stranger to luxury. His bespoke suits and designer watches were just a few of the many trappings of his wealth, accumulated through a combination of shrewd business deals and family connections.

But tonight, Oskar wasn't here to indulge in the finer things in life. He had a meeting with one of his most important investors, a mysterious figure known only as "The Wolf." Rumors swirled that The Wolf was planning to invest millions in Oskar's latest venture: a cutting-edge tech firm specializing in artificial intelligence.

As Oskar approached the building where he was supposed to meet The Wolf, he noticed a group of rough-looking men lingering outside. Their scarred faces and black leather jackets seemed out of place among the gleaming skyscrapers, but Oskar knew that sometimes appearances could be deceiving.

He pushed open the door and stepped into the dimly lit lobby, where his driver was waiting with a curt nod. "The Wolf is running late," he muttered, as if he had expected anything else.

Oskar smiled wryly to himself. He had worked with enough shady characters to know that The Wolf's punctuality was an urban legend. But he also knew that this meeting was crucial to his company's survival â€“ and his own future.

As he waited, Oskar's mind wandered back to his childhood in the Soviet Union, where he had grown up surrounded by propaganda posters and whispered rumors of a "new world order." He had always dreamed of escaping Russia's stifling bureaucracy, but the opportunity never seemed to arise. Until now.

The elevator doors slid open with a soft beep, and Oskar stepped inside, his eyes locked on the floor number: 23. The doors closed behind him, and he was enveloped in silence.
