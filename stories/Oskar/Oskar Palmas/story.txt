Oskar Palmas stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the bustling streets of Montmartre. His eyes scanned the crowded cafes and artist studios, searching for someone. It had been months since he'd received a message from his estranged sister, Anna.

As a young boy, Oskar had idolized Anna - she was the free spirit, the painter, the adventurer. But after their parents' tragic death in an accident when they were both teenagers, Anna vanished without explanation. The police and family had given up searching for her years ago, but Oskar couldn't shake off the feeling that she was still out there, waiting for him.

Oskar pushed through the crowd and entered a small gallery tucked away on Rue des Abbesses. The owner, Madame Dupont, greeted him with a warm smile as he approached his latest exhibition of charcoal drawings. "Bonjour, Oskar! Welcome back to Paris."

"Merci," Oskar replied, his eyes scanning the vibrant canvases that seemed to pulse with life.

Madame Dupont handed him a cup of coffee and sat down beside him. "I heard you received a letter from Anna?"

Oskar's heart skipped a beat as he pulled out the crumpled envelope from his pocket. He hadn't shared its contents with anyone, not even Madame Dupont. But there was something about this letter that had compelled him to share it.

He unfolded the page and read:

"Dear Oskar,

I'm here. I've been in Paris for months, watching you grow into a man just like our father. Your art is raw, honest - it speaks of pain but also hope. Come find me at Caf√© de la Paix at midnight."

Oskar looked up to meet Madame Dupont's expectant gaze.

"Who is Anna?" she asked softly.

Oskar hesitated before revealing the truth: his sister was out there somewhere, watching him from afar, waiting for him to take a step forward.
