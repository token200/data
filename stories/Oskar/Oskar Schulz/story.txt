The opportunity was a dream come true for the young artist, and he threw himself into the project with abandon. Weeks turned into months as Oskar poured his heart and soul into the artwork, which eventually became known as "Symphony of Light."

When "Symphony of Light" was unveiled to the public, it was met with thunderous applause and critical acclaim. The Berlin Philharmonic's director declared that the mural was a masterpiece, one that captured the very essence of music itself.
