Oskar Xia stared out at the crowded streets of Taipei, his eyes scanning the sea of faces as if searching for something – or someone. A master thief and art connoisseur, he had built a reputation on the black market for his unparalleled skill and discerning eye.

As he navigated the winding alleys of the city's old town, Oskar's mind wandered back to the job that had brought him here in the first place. The priceless Ming vase, stolen from the National Palace Museum just weeks ago, was still eluding him. His only lead was a cryptic message from a rival thief, hinting at its location.

Oskar stopped at a small tea shop, ordering a steaming cup of jasmine as he sat down to study his map. The owner, an elderly woman with piercing green eyes, watched him with a knowing gaze. "What do you seek, Mr. Xia?" she asked, her voice low and smooth.

"Just a lead," Oskar replied, taking a sip of the fragrant tea. He knew the old woman had ties to some of Taipei's most unsavory characters – information brokers, smugglers, and thieves like himself. Maybe she could help him track down his quarry.

The owner smiled, her eyes glinting with amusement. "I might have something for you," she said, vanishing into the back room and emerging with a small package wrapped in crimson silk. Oskar took it, feeling an electric thrill as he unwrapped the fabric to reveal a tiny note with a single phrase: "Look to the moon."

A shiver ran down Oskar's spine as he tucked the note into his pocket. The moon was full tonight – and so was his obsession with finding that Ming vase. He knew it wouldn't be easy, but he was willing to risk everything for the thrill of the chase.

As he left the tea shop, Oskar felt a familiar sense of excitement building within him. This job would be different from the last, he could feel it. And when he finally had that vase in his hands – well, that was all that mattered.

With a mischievous grin spreading across his face, Oskar disappeared into the crowd, ready to dance with fate and see where the night took him.
