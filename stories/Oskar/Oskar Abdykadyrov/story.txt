Oskar Abdykadyrov stepped out of the sweltering Moscow summer, his eyes scanning the crowded streets of Khamovniki. As an undercover agent working for the FSB, he had grown accustomed to blending in with the locals. His dark hair was slicked back, revealing a sharp jawline and piercing blue eyes that seemed to bore into those he encountered.

At 35, Oskar had been a rising star within the agency, known for his ruthless tactics and unwavering loyalty to the Motherland. But it was a reputation forged in the shadows, not the public spotlight. Few people knew about the quiet nights spent sipping vodka with dissidents or the whispered conversations with fellow agents about potential threats to national security.

Tonight, Oskar had received intel that a prominent journalist was about to expose a web of corruption within the government's inner circle. He needed to know more. His phone buzzed in his pocket as he navigated through the throngs of people, dodging haggard vendors and weary office workers on their lunch breaks.

With every step, Oskar felt an itch beneath his suit jacket. It was a familiar sensation – one that signaled the presence of something he couldn't quite put his finger on. He had worked this neighborhood for years; usually, it meant trouble was lurking just around the corner.

As he turned onto Pushkin Square, a sudden chill ran down Oskar's spine. Something felt off. Cars screeched to a halt, pedestrians spilled onto the sidewalks, and the neon lights of cafes seemed to flicker in sync with his racing heart.

Without hesitation, Oskar ducked into the nearest café, pushing through the crowds to reach a table by the window. He pulled out his phone, dialing a single number as he ordered a whiskey on the rocks from the barista. The line would go straight to Natalia – an old friend and fellow agent who might know more about this journalist's plans than Oskar did.

As the drink materialized in front of him, Oskar waited with bated breath for the response that could change everything. His eyes locked onto the crowded streets beyond the glass, a new sense of awareness settling over him like a shroud. This wasn't just about one journalist; this was about something much bigger.

The phone buzzed to life in his hand, and Oskar's ears perked up. The voice on the other end sent a jolt through his very being – a warning that would leave Oskar breathless and determined more than ever: "Meet me at the Okhotny Ryad. We have a problem."
