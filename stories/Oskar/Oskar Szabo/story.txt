Oskar Szabo stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the cityscape as the sun set behind the towering skyscrapers. A private investigator with a penchant for solving the unsolvable, he had seen it all - from gruesome murders to high-stakes corporate espionage.

As he scanned the rooftops, his trained eyes picked up on a figure huddled in the shadows. Oskar's instincts told him that this was no ordinary trespasser. He slipped down into the stairwell, his footsteps echoing off the walls as he made his way towards the unknown intruder.

When he reached the bottom floor, he spotted a young woman rummaging through a trash can. She looked up, startled, as Oskar approached her. "Can I help you?" he asked gruffly, eyeing the dumpster's contents.

The woman hesitated before answering. "I'm looking for something," she stammered. "A package. It was supposed to be delivered yesterday."

Oskar's curiosity was piqued. He flashed his PI badge and motioned for her to follow him. Together, they made their way back up to the rooftop.

As they reached the edge, Oskar noticed a small package tied to the railing with a length of twine. The woman gasped in recognition. "That's it," she exclaimed.

He carefully untied the twine and examined the package. It was an old-fashioned letterbox, adorned with intricate carvings. Oskar's eyes widened as he realized its significance - this was no ordinary delivery.

Just then, a sleek black sedan pulled up to the curb, its tinted windows reflecting the city lights. The woman's eyes darted towards the vehicle before returning to Oskar.

"We have to get out of here," she whispered urgently.

Without hesitation, Oskar grabbed her arm and they fled back down into the stairwell, leaving the sedan to speed away in the night air. As they reached the safety of his office, he leaned in close, his voice barely audible over the pounding of his heart.

"Who are you?" he demanded, eyes locked on hers.

The woman's gaze flickered before responding, "I'm Anna."

Oskar nodded thoughtfully. "Anna, what have you gotten yourself into?"

But before she could answer, the phone rang, shrill in the quiet night air.
