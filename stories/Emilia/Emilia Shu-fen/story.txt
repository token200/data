Born into a family of modest means, Emilia's love for music was nurtured by her father, a humble luthier who crafted beautiful instruments in his small workshop.

As she grew older, Emilia's passion for the koto only intensified, and she spent countless hours practicing under the guidance of her wise and patient teacher, Master Tanaka.

One day, Emilia Shu-fen received an invitation from the Imperial Court to perform for the Emperor himself. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for any musician, and Emilia was both thrilled and intimidated by the prospect.

The day of the performance arrived, and Emilia Shu-fen took to the stage before the Emperor and his courtiers. Her koto sang with a beauty and emotion that moved even the most hardened of hearts.
