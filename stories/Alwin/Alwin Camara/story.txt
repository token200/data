Alwin Camara stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station for any signs of life. It had been months since he'd last set foot in Ravenswood, the town where he grew up. The once-thriving community was now a shadow of its former self, its factories shuttered and its streets eerily quiet.

Alwin's thoughts turned to his family, who had long since moved away in search of better opportunities. His parents had always encouraged him to follow his dreams, but Alwin had never left Ravenswood. He'd stayed, stuck in a rut of small-town life, waiting for something – anything – to change.

As he made his way through the deserted streets, Alwin noticed that nothing seemed different. The same old diners still served the same bland meals, and the same faces looked out from behind the windows of the closed shops. It was as if time had stood still while he'd been away.

Alwin stopped in front of his childhood home, now a relic of its former glory. He remembered afternoons spent playing in the backyard, laughter-filled nights on the porch swing, and the smell of freshly baked cookies wafting from the kitchen. A pang of nostalgia hit him, but it was tempered by a sense of unease.

As he pushed open the creaky door, Alwin's eyes adjusted to the dim light within. His mother had left this place behind, along with his father and sister. They'd all moved to the city for a brighter future. But what had they found? Only silence answered that question, as the house stood empty and still.

Alwin took a deep breath and began to explore. He wandered from room to room, searching for some sign of life or change. The only sound was his own footsteps echoing off the walls. It seemed he wasn't alone after all. In the backyard, Alwin found a small garden, recently tended. A note on the gate read: "Welcome back, Alwin Camara."
