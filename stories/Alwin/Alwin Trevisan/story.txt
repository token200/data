Alwin Trevisan stepped into the grand foyer of the old mansion, his eyes scanning the room with a mix of curiosity and trepidation. As an antique dealer, he had encountered his fair share of peculiar clients, but there was something about this particular commission that didn't sit right with him.

The client, a reclusive millionaire named Mr. Jenkins, had commissioned Alwin to authenticate a rare piece of furniture that was rumored to be one of the most valuable items in the collection. The problem was, no one knew much about the piece's provenance or history.

As Alwin began to examine the piece, he noticed something peculiar - an intricate symbol etched into the wooden frame. He couldn't quite place it, but his trained eye told him that it was anything but ordinary.

"Mr. Jenkins, I think we may have a problem here," Alwin said, his voice measured and calm. "This symbol is unlike anything I've seen before. I'm not even sure if it's from the same era as the rest of the piece."

Mr. Jenkins nodded curtly, his eyes fixed on some unknown point beyond the room. "I know what you're saying, Alwin Trevisan. But I have faith in your expertise. You're the best in the business."

Alwin smiled wryly to himself. He had heard that claim before, but he couldn't deny that Mr. Jenkins was a shrewd businessman with an uncanny ability to sniff out valuable artifacts.

As the hours ticked by, Alwin delved deeper into the mystery of the symbol, poring over dusty tomes and scouring the internet for any mention of similar markings. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, he stumbled upon a tantalizing reference in an obscure academic journal.

"It's an ancient dialect," Alwin exclaimed, his eyes shining with excitement. "I think I can decipher its meaning."

Mr. Jenkins leaned forward, his expression eager. "Tell me, Alwin Trevisan, what does it say?"

Alwin took a deep breath before speaking the words that would change everything.
