After weeks of tireless research and writing, Alwin Hiroki finally published his expos√©, titled "Windfall: The Rise of Japan's Sustainable Energy Revolution."

The article sparked a heated debate in Tokyo, with some hailing Hiroki as a visionary and others accusing him of spreading unsubstantiated claims. But the young journalist remained undeterred, confident that his story had shed light on an important issue that needed attention.
