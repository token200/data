Alwin Malinowska was a man with a passion for photography that knew no bounds. As a young boy growing up in the small town of Krakow, Poland, he would spend hours exploring the streets and alleyways, camera in hand, capturing the beauty of his surroundings.

As he grew older, Alwin's love for photography only intensified, and he went on to study fine art at the local university. After graduating, he spent several years traveling the world, taking photographs of everything from bustling cities to serene landscapes.

But it was during one of these travels that Alwin stumbled upon his true calling - capturing the beauty of abandoned places. There was something about the decay and neglect of these forgotten buildings that resonated deeply with him, and he found himself drawn to it like a magnet.

Over the years, Alwin's photographs of abandoned places have become some of his most famous works. His camera has taken him to derelict factories, crumbling castles, and even entire ghost towns. Wherever he went, he seemed to find beauty in the decay and neglect.

People often ask Alwin why he is so drawn to these forgotten places, but he says that it's because they hold a story that needs to be told. "These buildings have seen generations come and go," he explains. "They've been witnesses to history, to love, to loss. And I want to capture that in my photographs."

One of Alwin's most famous series, "The Forgotten Coast", showcases the abandoned coastal towns that once thrived along Poland's Baltic coast. His photographs are hauntingly beautiful, full of a sense of longing and nostalgia.

As he works on his latest project, Alwin Malinowska can often be found in his small studio, surrounded by rolls of film and scattered photographs. He is a man consumed by his passion for photography, but one that brings him immense joy and fulfillment.

For Alwin, there is no greater thrill than capturing the perfect shot, the one that reveals the hidden story behind an abandoned building or landscape. And when he finally does find it, he knows that all his hard work has been worth it.
