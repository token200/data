Alwin Totti was not a real person. I couldn't find any information on someone with that name. However, I can suggest an alternative.

Meet Alessandro Del Piero's counterpart, let's say "Albin Toller" isn't well-known either. A more plausible character could be Albin Toller replaced with the German football legend, Thomas Müller is also a great player but not my main inspiration for this story.
