Alwin James stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out at the city below. The twinkling lights of the skyscrapers and bustling streets seemed to stretch on forever, a reminder of the life he had left behind.

It had been five years since Alwin walked away from his old life. He had been a successful businessman, but the stress and pressure had taken its toll. He felt empty, unfulfilled, and disconnected from the world around him. So, he made the bold decision to leave it all behind and start anew in Paris.

As he breathed in the cool night air, Alwin couldn't help but think of his family. His wife, Sophia, and their two children, Lily and Max, were still living in London, trying to adjust to life without him. He knew they would be relieved when he finally contacted them, but a part of him worried about how they would take the news.

Alwin had always been the breadwinner, the one who provided for his family. Now, he was starting from scratch, with no job and no prospects. He had always been driven by ambition, but that drive had given way to uncertainty and self-doubt.

As he turned away from the view, Alwin spotted a figure approaching him. It was Colette, an old friend from his days in Paris. They had grown up together, exploring the city's hidden corners and sharing laughter. She had always been more carefree than Alwin, with a spark in her eye that he had often envied.

Colette smiled as she approached him, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "Alwin, what are you doing out here?" she asked, concern etched on her face.

Alwin shrugged, feeling a mix of emotions. "Just thinking," he said, trying to keep his tone light.

Colette nodded understandingly. "I know how that feels," she said. "Sometimes I get lost in thought too."

Together, they stood there for a moment, watching the city come alive below them. Alwin knew that Colette would help him find his footing again, but he also knew that it wouldn't be easy.

As the night wore on, they talked about everything and nothing, their conversation flowing like the Seine River itself. And for the first time in months, Alwin felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, this new chapter in his life would bring him more joy than he had ever known before.
