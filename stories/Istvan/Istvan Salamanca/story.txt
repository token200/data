Istvan Salamanca walked into the dimly lit bar, his eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As the leader of Los Pollos Hermanos' security team, he had seen it all before - from rival gangs to disgruntled customers looking for a fight.

But tonight was different. Tonight, Istvan's attention was drawn to a familiar figure sitting in the corner, nursing a drink. It was Hector Salamanca, his father and the infamous kingpin of Los Pollos Hermanos' operations.

Istvan approached his father slowly, not wanting to startle him. As he sat down across from Hector, he couldn't help but notice the change in his father's demeanor. Gone were the days of cold calculation and ruthless ambition - today, Hector seemed... tired.

"What's going on, Papi?" Istvan asked, using the affectionate term that only he and his father understood.

Hector looked up at him, his eyes sunken from lack of sleep. "Istvan Salamanca," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "I've been thinking... about retiring."

Istvan's eyes widened in surprise. Retiring? His father, the man who had built Los Pollos Hermanos into an empire, wanted to hang up his guns and take it easy?

"What do you mean?" Istvan asked, trying to keep his curiosity in check.

Hector took a sip of his drink before continuing. "I've been feeling... old. The business is still good, but it's not what it used to be. And I'm tired of the violence, the stress... it's taking its toll on me."

Istvan nodded slowly, understanding where his father was coming from. He knew that Hector had always been driven by a desire for control and power - but now, it seemed like he just wanted to enjoy the fruits of his labor.

As they sat there in silence, Istvan realized that this could be an opportunity for him to take over, to prove himself as more than just his father's shadow. But for now, he just smiled and nodded, happy to see his father finally taking care of himself.

"You know what, Papi?" Istvan said, leaning forward. "I think I'll help you with this transition. We can work together, make sure Los Pollos Hermanos stays in the family."

Hector looked up at him, a glimmer of pride in his eyes. "Gracias, m'hijo," he said, his voice filled with emotion.
