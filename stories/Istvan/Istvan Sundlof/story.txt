Istvan Sundlof stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the quaint town of Ravenshire. The misty morning air clung to his trenchcoat like a damp shroud, weighing him down with each step. It was 1947, and the world was slowly rebuilding from the devastation of war.

As he made his way through the bustling station, Istvan's mind wandered back to his childhood on the windswept coast of Sweden. He remembered the harsh winters and rugged coastline that had forged him into the man he was today. A private investigator with a penchant for getting in over his head.

Istvan's thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of a young woman, her eyes fringed with exhaustion as she clutched a worn leather suitcase to her chest. "Mr. Sundlof?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

He nodded curtly, his expression softening ever so slightly as he took in her gaunt features and pale skin. "Yes? Can I help you?"

The woman hesitated before producing a small photograph from her pocket. Istvan's eyes narrowed as he recognized the face: that of his old acquaintance, Lars Eriksson, who had gone missing several years prior.

"Istvan Sundlof," she whispered again, "I've come from Stockholm. I think Lars may be alive."

A spark of curiosity ignited within him, and he nodded once more. Together, they set out into the misty Ravenshire morning, Istvan's mind racing with possibilities as they delved deeper into the mystery.

As they walked, Istvan couldn't shake the feeling that his life was about to become very complicated indeed. The world might be rebuilding, but in his line of work, the past never truly stayed buried.
