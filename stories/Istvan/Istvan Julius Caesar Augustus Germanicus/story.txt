Years passed, and Istvan grew into a strong and charismatic young man, earning the respect of his peers and the attention of the noblewomen in attendance at court.

With his people at his side, Istvan Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus set out to fulfill the prophecy, rallying the clans against their common enemies and forging a united Valtania. As he rode into battle, his golden armor shining in the sunlight, the people cheered, knowing that they had chosen wisely. For this was no ordinary leader â€“ only the one foretold by the ancient scroll, destined to bring peace and prosperity to their beloved land.
