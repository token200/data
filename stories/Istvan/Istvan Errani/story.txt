Istvan Errani stepped into the dimly lit caf√©, his eyes scanning the room for any familiar faces. He had received an invitation to meet with a mysterious patron, one who claimed to have information about his troubled past.

As he waited in line to order, Istvan's mind wandered back to his childhood on the streets of Budapest. Growing up as an orphan, he had learned early on to rely only on himself. But it was that same drive that now led him down a path of crime and corruption.

The barista handed Istvan his coffee, and he took a sip before taking a seat at the small table by the window. A woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair slid into the booth across from him.

"Thank you for meeting me," she said, her voice low and husky. "My name is Sophia, but I think you know that already."

Istvan nodded, his eyes never leaving hers. "Yes. Sophia. What do you want to tell me?"

Sophia leaned in closer, her voice taking on a conspiratorial tone. "I know about your past, Istvan Errani. About the circumstances that led you down this... path."

Istvan raised an eyebrow. "What are you talking about? I thought you were just here to warn me about the cops."

Sophia smiled, her lips curling up in a sly smile. "Oh no, dear Istvan. That's just the tip of the iceberg. You see, there's something much bigger at play here. Something that could get you killed if you're not careful."

Istvan's eyes narrowed. He didn't like being played, but he also didn't like being blindsided. He leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers together as he listened intently.

As Sophia spoke, Istvan Errani found himself drawn into a web of intrigue and deception that threatened to destroy everything he had worked for. And yet, despite the danger, he couldn't help but feel a spark of curiosity ignite within him.
