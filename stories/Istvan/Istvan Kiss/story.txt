Istvan Kiss stood alone on the moonlit beach, the waves crashing against the shore as he stared out at the endless expanse of water. It was a moment of solace for him, a brief respite from the chaos that had driven him to seek refuge in this small coastal town.

As a former CIA operative, Istvan Kiss had seen his fair share of bloodshed and betrayal. He had lost count of the number of lives he had taken, or the number of times he had been forced to play the role of the ruthless assassin. But now, at the age of forty-five, he was determined to leave that life behind.

Istvan Kiss took a deep breath, feeling the salty air fill his lungs as he watched the stars twinkling above. He thought about the people he had loved and lost – his wife, his daughter, and his closest friends – all of whom had fallen victim to his own actions.

The sound of footsteps approached, breaking Istvan's reverie. It was an old man, dressed in worn jeans and a faded windbreaker, who introduced himself as Jack. He had noticed Istvan standing alone on the beach that evening and had come over to strike up a conversation.

As they talked, Istvan found himself opening up to Jack in ways he never had with anyone before. It was as if the old man's gentle demeanor had put him at ease, allowing him to reveal the vulnerabilities he had kept hidden for so long.

Over the next few weeks, Istvan and Jack became fast friends, taking long walks along the beach and exploring the town together. Istvan found himself feeling a sense of belonging that he had never experienced before – a sense of being part of something greater than himself.

As he looked out at the ocean, Istvan Kiss felt a sense of peace wash over him. For the first time in years, he felt like he was finally home, and that this small town would be his refuge from the demons of his past.
