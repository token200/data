One day, while working on a particularly vexing puzzle, Istvan received an enigmatic message from an unknown sender. The note read: "Meet me at the old windmill on the outskirts of town at midnight. Come alone." Intrigued, Istvan arrived at the windmill, his heart racing with anticipation.

As he dismounted his horse, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was a woman with raven-black hair and skin as pale as alabaster. She introduced herself as Sophia, a fellow cryptographer who had been tracking a particularly elusive code.
