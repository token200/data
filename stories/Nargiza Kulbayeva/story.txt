Born on a cold winter morning in 1985, Nargiza was destined for greatness. She grew up in a family of nomadic herders, where hard work and resilience were the only constants.

As a child, Nargiza watched as her parents battled against the harsh desert winds to raise their livestock.

She worked tirelessly to balance her studies with her nomadic duties, earning the respect and admiration of her peers.

However, fate had other plans for Nargiza. A devastating earthquake struck Aktau in 2012, leveling homes and businesses, leaving hundreds homeless. The village elder, aware of Nargiza's engineering background, approached her with a proposal: use her skills to help rebuild the community.
