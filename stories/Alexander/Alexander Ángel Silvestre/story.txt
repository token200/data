In the scorching desert town of El Paso, Arizona, 25-year-old Alexander Ángel Silvestre was known for his unwavering determination and unrelenting spirit. Born to a family of modest means, Ángel had always dreamed of leaving his mark on the world beyond the dusty streets of his hometown.

As a child, Ángel would often sneak into his father's old workshop, fascinated by the tools and machinery that brought life to the local artisans' creations. It was there that he discovered his passion for metalwork, and with each passing day, his fascination grew stronger. With an unyielding work ethic and a natural talent for craftsmanship, Ángel spent countless hours honing his skills, fueled by an insatiable desire to create something truly remarkable.
