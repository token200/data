Alexander Saldaña had always been drawn to the world of art. As a child, he spent hours sketching the cityscapes of his native Mexico, captivated by the vibrant colors and textures that seemed to pulse with life.

After graduating, Alexander set out into the world, determined to make a name for himself as an artist. He worked tirelessly, pouring his heart and soul into every piece he created.

The success was overwhelming, but Alexander remained grounded, crediting Lily and the collective for helping him find his voice. He continued to work tirelessly, always pushing himself to innovate and improve, and it showed – his next show was even more stunning than the last, earning him a coveted spot on the cover of Artforum magazine.
