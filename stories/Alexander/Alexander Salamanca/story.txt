Alexander Salamanca was known for his cunning and ambition, traits that had served him well in his rise to power as the ruthless leader of the Los Pollos Hermanos chicken empire.

But few knew the story behind Alexander's success. Born into a humble family, he had grown up on the streets of Albuquerque, where he quickly learned to rely on his wits and his fists to survive. He had always been drawn to the fast food business, and after serving time in prison for armed robbery, he saw an opportunity to start fresh.

With a small loan from a local investor, Alexander opened the first Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant, serving up fried chicken and wits to anyone who would listen. His restaurant quickly became a hit, attracting customers from all over the city with its spicy food and charismatic leader.

As the years passed, Alexander expanded his business, buying out rival restaurants and absorbing smaller chains under his umbrella. He was always one step ahead of his competitors, using his intelligence and cunning to stay ahead of the game.

But despite his success, Alexander's past still haunted him. His imprisonment had left scars, both physical and emotional, and he struggled to connect with those around him. Only a handful of people knew the truth about Alexander Salamanca - that beneath his tough exterior lay a complex web of emotions and motivations.

One person who did know was Mike Ehrmantraut, a former cop turned cleaner who had been hired by Los Pollos Hermanos to take care of its dirty work. He saw something in Alexander that no one else did - a deep vulnerability, a need for love and acceptance that he struggled to fulfill.

As the years went by, Alexander continued to build his empire, using his intelligence and charm to outmaneuver anyone who stood in his way. But Mike knew the truth about Alexander Salamanca - that beneath the surface lay a man with a deep-seated desire for connection, for love and acceptance in a world that had once rejected him.
