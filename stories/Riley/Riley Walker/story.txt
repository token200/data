Riley Walker stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. She had been traveling for hours, and the isolation was starting to get to her. As she made her way through the empty station, a figure emerged from the shadows.

"Welcome to Ravenswood," the stranger said with a nod. "I'm Max. You must be Riley Walker."

Riley hesitated, unsure of how much to reveal. But there was something about Max's kind eyes that put her at ease. She nodded, and he led her out of the station and into the crisp evening air.

As they walked through the village, Riley noticed that it was eerily quiet. The streets were empty, and the few buildings seemed to loom over them like sentinels. Max seemed to sense her unease and offered a reassuring smile.

"Ravenswood's not for everyone," he said. "But if you're looking for a fresh start, this might be the place."

Riley had indeed been seeking a change of scenery. Her past was... complicated, and she'd grown tired of the noise and chaos that seemed to follow her everywhere. She'd heard whispers of Ravenswood, a small village on the outskirts of nowhere, where people went to escape their troubles.

As they approached Max's cabin, Riley noticed something peculiar. The windows were all boarded up, and the door was covered in vines. It looked like it had been years since anyone had lived here.

"What happened?" Riley asked, curiosity getting the better of her.

Max's expression turned somber. "The village was abandoned after a... incident. Something tragic happened, and everyone left. I'm not supposed to talk about it too much."

Riley sensed there was more to the story, but Max seemed determined to keep secrets buried. She nodded, understanding. Sometimes, some things were better left unsaid.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Riley found herself drawn to the quiet beauty of Ravenswood. It wasn't perfect, and it certainly had its share of mysteries, but there was something here that felt... right. As she settled into her new home, surrounded by Max's warm presence, Riley began to realize that sometimes, it's okay to take a step back from the world and find solace in the unknown.

For now, Ravenswood seemed like a place where she could finally breathe.
