Riley Kalnina was known for her fiery personality and sharp wit, but few people knew about the quiet struggles she faced behind closed doors. As a successful event planner, Riley had built a reputation for herself as someone who could pull off even the most impossible tasks with ease. But in reality, she was haunted by the weight of her own expectations.

Riley's day began like any other, with a flurry of activity as she prepared for the biggest wedding of her career. She had spent months planning every detail, from the flowers to the music, and was determined to make it perfect. As she sipped her coffee and reviewed the schedule one last time, Riley couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off.

Just then, her phone rang, breaking the silence. It was her best friend, Lena, calling to check in on the wedding preparations. Riley hesitated for a moment before answering, feeling a twinge of anxiety about the state of her work. But as she talked to Lena, she began to open up about her struggles with anxiety and pressure.

Lena listened attentively, offering words of encouragement and advice that Riley had been too proud to ask for herself. For the first time all day, Riley felt a weight lift off her shoulders. She realized that it was okay to not have everything under control, and that asking for help was a sign of strength, not weakness.

As she hung up the phone, Riley took a deep breath and let her eyes wander around the room. She saw the neatly arranged tables, the sparkling chandeliers, and the rows of perfectly folded napkins. It was all so perfect, yet somehow, it felt empty without the person she wanted most to share it with â€“ herself.

With renewed determination, Riley Kalnina set out to finish the preparations, this time with a sense of purpose and self-compassion that she had been lacking earlier. She knew that the real magic happened when the guests arrived, not when the planners were stressed and exhausted. And as the sun began to set on what promised to be an unforgettable night, Riley felt a glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, this was going to be her best wedding yet.
