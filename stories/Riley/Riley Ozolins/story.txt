Riley Ozolins stepped off the bus and onto the cracked sidewalk of Willow Creek's Main Street. The afternoon sun cast long shadows behind the old diner where she worked, and the smell of stale coffee wafted out into the street. As a part-time waitress, Riley had grown accustomed to the familiar rhythm of the diner: the clinking dishes, the hushed conversations, and the occasional shout from the kitchen.

As she locked her bag onto the bus's overhead rack, a gust of wind swept down the street, carrying with it a handful of discarded newspapers. Riley watched as they danced in the air before coming to rest at the base of the diner's sign. She chuckled to herself, thinking about how much those papers must have wanted to be read.

Back inside, Riley found her coworker, Mike, prepping for the evening rush. "Hey, Ozolins!" he called out, as always addressing her by her full name. "Ready for another night of serving up the usual suspects?"

Riley smiled and replied, "Born ready, Mike." She began arranging the silverware on the counter with practiced ease. The door swung open, admitting a wave of cooler air from outside. In walked Mr. Jenkins, their regular customer, who ordered his usual: a cup of black coffee and a plate of eggs.

Throughout the evening, Riley efficiently juggled tables, refilled drinks, and took orders while keeping an ear out for Mike's tired jokes and the murmur of the diner's patrons. When the last customer left and the kitchen finally shut down, she and Mike exchanged stories about their day – some funny, others mundane – over steaming cups of coffee.

As Riley slipped on her jacket to head home, a faint rain began to fall from the sky, drumming against the roof of the diner. The sound brought a sense of closure to an already satisfying shift. Outside, under the flickering streetlights, she breathed in deeply and let out a sigh, feeling grateful for another day spent watching over Willow Creek with her old friend Mike by her side.

And so, Riley Ozolins vanished into the rain-soaked darkness, lost once again among the shadows of Main Street.
