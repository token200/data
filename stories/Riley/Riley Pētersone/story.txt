One stormy evening, Riley Pētersone was on the beat, investigating reports of a local factory polluting the nearby Daugava River. The factory, owned by a wealthy businessman, had been accused of releasing toxic waste into the waterway, causing widespread concern among residents.

With her trusty notebook and pen in hand, Riley Pētersone began to interview locals who claimed to have seen the pollution firsthand. She spoke with fishermen who had caught fish with strange markings, and residents who had fallen ill after spending time near the river.
