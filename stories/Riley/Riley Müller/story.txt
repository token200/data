Riley MÃ¼ller stepped into the dimly lit jazz club, her eyes scanning the crowded room for a glimpse of familiar faces. The air was thick with the smell of smoke and whiskey, the sounds of Duke Ellington's "Take the A Train" drifting through the speakers.

As she made her way to the bar, Riley's thoughts drifted back to the letter she had received that morning from an old friend. It had been years since they'd last spoken, but the words on the page still lingered in her mind like a whispered secret.

She ordered a whiskey and slid onto a stool at the end of the bar, surveying the crowd with a practiced eye. The patrons were a mix of regulars and newcomers, all united by their love of the music and the camaraderie that came with it.

Riley's gaze landed on a figure sitting in the corner, nursing a glass of wine. There was something about him that caught her attention - maybe the way he sat with his elbows resting on his knees, or the way his eyes seemed to be watching her from across the room.

As she turned back to her drink, Riley felt a tap on her shoulder. She turned to find a smile from the mysterious stranger, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he introduced himself.

"I'm Max," he said, his voice low and smooth. "I couldn't help but notice you sitting here all alone."

Riley smiled back, feeling a spark of connection she hadn't felt in a long time. They talked for hours, their conversation flowing easily from music to politics to old movies. The night wore on, the crowd growing thicker and the whiskey bottles getting emptied.

As the clock struck midnight, Riley knew it was time to leave. She stood up, stretching her arms over her head as she prepared to make her exit. Max walked with her out of the club, the cool night air hitting them like a slap in the face.

"Would you like to grab some coffee sometime?" he asked, his eyes locked on hers.

Riley smiled again, feeling that familiar spark of connection. "I'd like that," she said, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear as they walked off into the night together.
