Riley Szymanski stepped into the dimly lit diner, the smell of greasy burgers and stale coffee enveloping her like a worn blanket. She slid onto a stool at the counter, running a hand through her messy brown hair.

The waitress, a gruff but kind-hearted woman named Marge, raised an eyebrow as Riley ordered the usual: black coffee and a slice of whole wheat toast. "You know you're not supposed to eat that much caffeine, kiddo," she warned with a chuckle.

Riley smiled blandly, her eyes fixed on the worn Formica tabletop. She'd been coming to this diner for years, ever since she was a kid running away from home after her parents got divorced. It had become her own little sanctuary – a place where she could escape the memories that haunted her.

As she sipped her coffee, Riley's mind began to wander back to the events of the past week. She'd just landed a job as a freelance writer, and was starting to make a name for herself in the literary world. It was a far cry from the small town where she grew up, but it felt like home now.

Just then, a tall, lanky man with a mop of curly hair walked into the diner, his eyes scanning the room until they landed on Riley. He smiled, and made his way over to her table. "Hey, Ril," he said, using the nickname only she ever allowed herself.

Riley's heart skipped a beat as she saw him. His name was Max, and they'd been friends since college. They'd lost touch after graduation, but had reconnected online a few months ago. There was something about his easy smile and quick wit that made her feel like she could trust him.

Over the next hour, Riley and Max chatted about everything from their jobs to their personal lives. It felt like old times, and for a moment, Riley forgot all about her troubles. As they parted ways outside the diner, Max reached out and put his hand on her shoulder. "Hey, kiddo? You're doing okay, I think."

Riley looked up at him, her eyes searching his face. For the first time in years, she felt like maybe – just maybe – she was going to be alright.
