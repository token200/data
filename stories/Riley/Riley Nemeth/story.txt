Riley Nemeth walked into the crowded coffee shop, scanning the room for a familiar face. She had been friends with Alex since college, and he often met her here for breakfast on Fridays. As she waited in line, she noticed a group of students from her graphic design class, all sipping on lattes and chatting animatedly.

When it was finally her turn to order, Riley asked for her usual coffee and took a seat at the bar, pulling out her sketchbook and pencil. She began to doodle, lost in thought as she pondered her latest project. Alex arrived a few minutes later, plopping down beside her with a warm smile.

"Hey, Riles," he said, using his nickname for her. "What's new?"

Riley closed her eyes, feeling the tension in her shoulders begin to ease. "Just trying to get this design concept down on paper," she replied, handing him her sketchbook to take a look. Alex flipped through the pages, making supportive noises as he scanned the intricate patterns and shapes.

As they chatted, Riley's mind began to wander back to their conversation from the day before. She had mentioned her struggles with anxiety to Alex, and he had listened attentively, offering words of encouragement. He was always like that â€“ a rock for her, someone who knew exactly how to make her feel better when she needed it most.

Just then, the barista called out Riley's name, signaling that her coffee was ready. She grabbed her cup and took a sip, feeling the caffeine kick in as she turned back to Alex. "I'm thinking of taking a break from design for a while," she said, hesitating. "Maybe try my hand at writing instead?"

Alex raised an eyebrow. "Writing? You're not exactly known for your love of words, Riley Nemeth."

Riley laughed, feeling a twinge of defensiveness. But Alex just smiled and put his arm around her shoulders. "I like the sound of it," he said. "You never know what you might discover."
