Riley Faust stood in front of the old, worn-out mirror in her bedroom, staring at the reflection of the person she used to be. The girl with bright blue eyes and curly brown hair had long since given way to a more mature, confident version of herself.

She remembered the days when she was struggling to find her place in the world. As a teenager, Riley had always felt like an outsider, like she didn't quite fit into any one group or clique. She was always drawn to the unknown, always looking for something more than what society had to offer.

That's when she stumbled upon the portal to another dimension, a portal that would change her life forever. On the other side of the portal lay a world of magic and wonder, a world where Riley could be herself without fear of judgment or rejection.

As she grew older, Riley became more confident in her abilities as a Time-Traveling Adventurer, taking on missions to protect the timestream from those who sought to disrupt it. She formed close bonds with her allies, including Wendy Corduroy and Fintan Dillon, and together they saved countless lives and prevented catastrophic events.

But despite all the adventures she had been on, Riley couldn't shake the feeling that there was something missing. A piece of herself was still stuck back in her own time, a piece that she could never quite reach. She became obsessed with finding a way to bring that piece of herself back, to reconcile the different versions of herself.

One day, Riley received a message from an unknown sender, claiming to have knowledge of a way to return to her original timeline. Without hesitation, she set out on a new adventure, navigating treacherous landscapes and battling formidable foes in order to reach her destination.

As she stood before the portal once again, Riley felt a sense of trepidation wash over her. What would she find on the other side? Would she be able to reconcile the different versions of herself, or would she remain forever stuck between two timelines?

With a deep breath, Riley stepped through the portal and into the unknown.
