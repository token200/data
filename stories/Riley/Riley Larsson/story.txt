Riley Larsson stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar station. She had just arrived in Portland, Oregon, for a job interview that could make or break her music career. As a young singer-songwriter, Riley had always dreamed of making it big, but so far, she'd been stuck playing small gigs in local bars.

As she walked to the hotel, Riley couldn't help but think about how far she'd come since high school. She had honed her craft, written songs that truly reflected her soul, and even landed a few small record deals. But this interview was different – it was with a major label, one that could offer her the opportunity of a lifetime.

Riley checked into her hotel room and took a few deep breaths before heading out to the interview location. She arrived early, dressed in her best "professional musician" attire, and waited for what felt like an eternity for her interviewer to arrive.

When he finally did, Riley was introduced as herself, not just Riley Larsson – although she did introduce herself with that name first, of course. The man smiled warmly and extended a hand, saying, "Delighted to meet you, Ms...Larsson."

As they sat down to discuss her music, Riley felt like she was in her element. She talked about her influences, her songwriting process, and her vision for the future – all while trying not to fidget or spill her coffee.

The interview flew by in a blur, and before Riley knew it, they were wrapping up. The man smiled again and stood up, saying, "Thank you so much for coming in today, Riley Larsson. We'll be in touch soon."

As she left the office building, Riley couldn't help but feel a sense of hope that she hadn't felt in months. Had she just landed her big break? Only time would tell, but one thing was for sure – with this interview under her belt, Riley Larsson was ready to take on whatever came next.
