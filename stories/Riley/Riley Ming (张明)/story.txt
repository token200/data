Riley Ming, also known as Zhang Ming in his native Chinese-speaking world, was a young and ambitious artist living in modern-day New York City. Born to a family of modest means in Shanghai, China, Riley had always been drawn to the vibrant colors and textures of traditional Chinese art.

As he grew older, Riley became increasingly fascinated with Western art movements, particularly Abstract Expressionism. He spent countless hours studying the works of Pollock and Rothko, experimenting with bold brushstrokes and vivid color palettes on his own canvases.

Despite facing many challenges as a young immigrant in a foreign land, Riley's passion for art remained unwavering. He worked multiple part-time jobs to support himself while taking classes at night to hone his craft.

One fateful evening, Riley's big break came when he was invited to showcase his work at a prominent gallery in Chelsea. His piece, "Urban Bloom," a swirling vortex of colors inspired by the street art of Shanghai, caught the eye of a prominent curator who offered him a solo exhibition.
