Riley Schäfer walked into the dimly lit café, scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Emma, sitting at a small table by the window, sipping on a cup of coffee.

"Hey, Em," Riley said, sliding into the seat across from her. "What's new with you?"

Emma smiled and leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. "I just got an offer to study abroad next semester. I'm thinking of accepting it."

Riley's eyes widened in excitement. "That sounds amazing! You've always been so adventurous, Em. When are you planning on leaving?"

Emma shrugged. "I'll need to finalize the details soon, but I'm hoping to go sometime in January or February."

Riley nodded thoughtfully, taking a sip of her own coffee. She had always been fascinated by Emma's fearlessness and willingness to take risks. As a creative writing major herself, Riley often found herself stuck in a rut, feeling like she was just going through the motions.

But being around Emma made her feel alive again. The two had met in their freshman year of college and had quickly become inseparable friends. They spent countless hours discussing everything from literature to music to their dreams for the future.

As they chatted, Riley found herself opening up about her own plans. She had been accepted into a prestigious writing program, but was struggling to decide whether or not to take it. Emma listened intently, offering words of encouragement and advice.

"You're so talented, Riley," Emma said, smiling. "I have no doubt you'll make the most of this opportunity."

Riley smiled back at her friend, feeling grateful for Emma's unwavering support. She knew that with Emma by her side, she could conquer anything.

As they finished their coffee and prepared to leave, Riley turned to Emma with a serious look on her face. "Hey, Em? I've been thinking... maybe we can plan a trip together before you leave?"

Emma's eyes lit up with excitement. "That sounds like the perfect way to spend our last few months together!"

Riley grinned, feeling a sense of joy and anticipation wash over her. She knew that with Emma by her side, she was ready for whatever came next.
