Riley Taro sat in his small, cluttered apartment, staring blankly at the old guitar that lay on the floor. It had been months since he'd last played, and the silence was deafening. He used to play for hours on end, lost in the melodies and chords, but after his mom's passing, it all just seemed pointless.

As a child, Riley had been obsessed with music. His mom had taught him how to play when he was just six years old, and he'd spent countless hours practicing. She'd always said that music was life itself - it was the rhythm of our hearts, the harmony of our souls. And for a while, it seemed like she'd been right.

But after she died, everything changed. Riley's dad got lost in work, his grades started to slip, and he found himself withdrawing from everyone around him. Music just wasn't as important anymore. It was like a part of him had been torn away, leaving a gaping hole that couldn't be filled.

Still, tonight felt different. Maybe it was the full moon hanging low in the sky outside, casting an eerie glow over everything. Or maybe it was just the ache in his chest, reminding him that music still existed - and that he hadn't picked up a pick in far too long.

Taking a deep breath, Riley stood up, slowly walking over to the guitar. He picked it up, running his fingers over the familiar curves of its body, feeling the weight of years' worth of memories settle onto his skin. It was worn smooth from countless touchings and strokes - like an old friend that he hadn't seen in ages.

Without thinking, Riley began to play. At first, it sounded like nothing at all - just a mangled mess of notes that seemed to have no purpose or meaning. But as the seconds ticked by, something strange happened. The sounds began to take shape, forming into melodies and harmonies that seemed both familiar and new.

Riley felt himself getting lost in the music once more. It was like his mom's presence was wrapped around him, her fingers intertwined with his on the strings. Tears pricked at the corners of his eyes as he realized that even though she was gone, a part of her would always be with him - through the notes and chords, the rhythm and beat.

As the last chord faded away, Riley sat down in the chair across from the guitar, feeling like a man rediscovering himself. Maybe it wouldn't work out between them after all. But one thing for sure: he'd never stop playing again.
