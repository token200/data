Riley Ivanov walked into the crowded coffee shop, scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting in the corner, sipping on a latte and typing away on his laptop. It had been months since she'd last seen her brother, Alex, but the ache of missing him still lingered.

As she approached the table, Alex looked up, catching her eye. He smiled, closing the lid on his laptop with a satisfying click. "Riley! It's so great to see you," he said, pushing his chair back and standing up.

The two siblings hugged tightly, Riley feeling a mix of emotions as she pulled away from him. They'd been estranged for years, but despite that, their bond remained strong. Alex had always been the protective one, looking out for her when things got tough.

As they sat down at the small table by the window, Riley couldn't help but notice the changes in Alex. His hair was longer now, and he had a small beard that framed his face. He looked more grown up, more confident. She felt a pang of pride knowing she'd played a part in helping him grow into this person.

"So, what brings you here?" Alex asked, ordering them each another coffee.

Riley pulled out her phone, scrolling through her calendar. "I'm actually on my way to the music festival tomorrow," she said, excitement creeping into her voice. "I got tickets last minute, and I couldn't resist."

Alex's eyes lit up. "That sounds amazing! I'd love to come with you," he said, his face lighting up with enthusiasm.

Riley hesitated for a moment before nodding. It had been a while since they'd done anything together, but she knew that was exactly what they needed – some quality time together. As they sipped their coffee and chatted, Riley felt a sense of peace wash over her. Being around Alex made her feel like everything was going to be okay.

As the morning wore on, they finalized plans for the festival, making promises to meet up before she left. Riley smiled as she watched Alex gather his things, feeling grateful for this moment of reconnection with her brother. Despite their differences and the years apart, Riley Ivanov knew that her bond with Alex was unbreakable – a connection that only grew stronger with time.

With a renewed sense of purpose, Riley grabbed her bag and stood up, ready to face whatever lay ahead. As she turned to leave, Alex caught her arm, his eyes sparkling with mischief. "Hey, sis? Can I come on stage and sing with you?"
