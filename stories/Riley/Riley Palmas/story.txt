Riley Palmas, a young and ambitious journalist, sat at her desk, sipping her lukewarm coffee. She had just received an anonymous tip about a possible corruption scandal involving the city's mayor, and she was determined to get to the bottom of it.

As she began researching, Riley couldn't help but think about how this story could be her big break. She had always dreamed of being a investigative reporter, and now seemed like the perfect opportunity.

Riley spent hours pouring over documents and conducting interviews with sources, but every lead seemed to go cold. It was as if the mayor's office had an iron grip on all information related to the scandal.

Undeterred, Riley decided to pay a visit to her estranged father, Jack Palmas, a retired detective who used to work for the city police department. She knew he might have some insight into the mayor's dealings, and she hoped he could help her find a new lead.

When she arrived at his small apartment, Jack was hesitant to talk about the past, but Riley's persistence eventually won him over. He shared with her an old case file that had been shelved years ago, containing evidence of a large-scale embezzlement scheme involving several high-ranking city officials, including the mayor.

Riley's eyes widened as she flipped through the pages of the file. This was it – the smoking gun she needed to take down the corrupt mayor and his accomplices. But as she was about to leave, Jack handed her a small piece of paper with a cryptic message: "Trust no one."

Riley felt a shiver run down her spine. What did her father mean? Who could be involved in this corruption that even he didn't know?

Despite the warning, Riley was more determined than ever to see justice served. She spent the rest of the night working tirelessly to verify the evidence and prepare her story for publication.

As she sat at her desk the next morning, Riley's phone rang. It was a mysterious voice on the other end, telling her that she had uncovered something big – but also warning her that she was now in grave danger.

Riley knew that this was what investigative reporting was all about: taking risks and facing challenges head-on. She steeled herself for whatever lay ahead, knowing that the truth would eventually come out, no matter who tried to stop her.

With a newfound sense of determination, Riley Palmas set out to expose the corrupt mayor and bring justice to the city's residents, ready to face whatever came next in her pursuit of truth.
