Riley Sundberg stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the small town of Oakdale. It was a place he'd known his entire life, where everyone knew his name and he knew theirs. Growing up, Riley had always felt like he was stuck in a rut, content to help his dad's old car repair shop run smoothly.

But after his parents' messy divorce, Riley had drifted through high school feeling lost and aimless. Now, at 22, he'd decided it was time to take control of his life. He'd left Oakdale for college on the East Coast, where he'd studied business and spent years working multiple part-time jobs to make ends meet.

As he walked through the quiet streets, Riley couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia. This had been his childhood home, where he'd spent countless afternoons exploring the woods behind his house with his best friend, Alex. Now, as he passed by familiar landmarks – the ice cream parlor where they'd celebrated their first kiss, the baseball field where Riley's dad coached little league – it all seemed so different.

Riley made his way to the local diner, a place that had always been a staple of Oakdale life. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of bacon and coffee, and the owner, Marge, greeted him like an old friend. "Hey there, kiddo!" she boomed, as Riley slid onto a stool at the counter.

Over a cup of black coffee, Riley told Marge about his plans to return to Oakdale and take over the family business. Marge listened intently, her eyes sparkling with interest. "You're gonna make me proud, you know that?" she said, patting Riley's hand.

As he finished his coffee and headed out into the bright sunlight, Riley felt a sense of determination wash over him. This was it – his chance to prove himself and show Oakdale what he was made of. He took a deep breath, feeling the cool breeze fill his lungs, and set off down Main Street.

The town might be small, but Riley Sundberg was ready to make his mark.
