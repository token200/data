Riley Boucher trudged through the snow-covered streets of Brooklyn, her bright pink scarf wrapped tightly around her neck. She had just left a meeting with a record label, and the news hadn't been good. Again.

As she walked towards her tiny apartment in Bushwick, Riley couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration wash over her. She had poured her heart and soul into her music, writing songs that spoke to her own experiences as a queer woman of color. But no matter how hard she tried, it seemed like the industry just wasn't ready for her.

Riley had always been passionate about music, but it wasn't until she discovered riot grrrl bands like Bikini Kill and Hole that she found her true voice. She started writing songs on her own, inspired by the raw energy and unapologetic lyrics of these female-fronted bands. As she got older, Riley began to perform at local shows and open mic nights, slowly building up a following.

But the more she performed, the more she realized that she wasn't like other musicians. She didn't fit into any one genre or mold. Her music was messy and experimental, with lyrics that often explored themes of love, identity, and social justice. And while some people appreciated her unique sound, others just couldn't handle it.

As Riley approached her apartment building, she felt a pang of sadness. Was this really the path she was meant to take? She thought about all the times she'd been told she was too "hard" or "aggressive," that she needed to tone down her lyrics and be more "palatable." But she knew deep down that she couldn't do that.

Riley unlocked the door and stepped inside, dropping her coat onto the floor. Her cat, Luna, greeted her with a soft meow from the windowsill. Riley smiled wearily and settled in on the couch, pulling out her guitar and beginning to strum a melancholy tune.

For a few moments, all was quiet. Just Riley and her music, lost in their own little world. But as she started singing, the words began to spill out – raw, unfiltered, and utterly true. She sang about the pain of being erased, the joy of self-discovery, and the anger that fueled her creative fire.

And even though the record label hadn't offered her a deal, Riley knew in that moment that it didn't matter. Her music was her own, and she would make it work – no matter what.
