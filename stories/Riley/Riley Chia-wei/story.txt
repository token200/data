Riley Chia-wei was a young and ambitious journalist, always chasing the next big scoop. Born in Taiwan to a family of activists, Riley had grown up surrounded by the struggles of her people, from protests in Taipei to migrant worker stories in the southern cities.

After studying journalism at the National Taiwan University, Riley landed an internship at the largest daily newspaper in Taipei, where she quickly made a name for herself as a fearless and resourceful reporter. Her fearless attitude earned her the nickname "Wolf Girl" among colleagues, who marveled at her ability to track down sources in even the most inhospitable corners of Taiwanese society.

One day, while investigating the decline of traditional industries such as textile manufacturing and fishing, Riley stumbled upon a shocking story: a group of influential businessmen were secretly buying up public lands, threatening the livelihoods of countless workers who had dedicated their lives to these trades. The more she dug, the more convinced she became that this was no ordinary scandal.

With her colleagues urging her to back down, fearing they would be labeled "radical" or even arrested, Riley knew she had stumbled upon something big. Determined to expose the truth, she spent countless late nights poring over documents and conducting interviews with former government officials and workers who had been displaced by the land purchases.

Her investigative reporting eventually caught the attention of a prominent Taiwanese opposition party leader, who agreed to provide her access to sensitive information about the scandal. As Riley prepared to publish her explosive expos√©, she received an unsettling warning from an anonymous source: "You have no idea what you've gotten yourself into."

The night before publication, Riley felt a chill run down her spine as she checked the locked doors of her small apartment for the 27th time. Her family's history of activism had prepared her for moments like these, but this was different - this was personal.
