Giacomo Bierhals was known for his cunning and wit, often using these traits to extract information from those around him. He had a particular knack for getting people to open up to him, whether it was through charm or coercion, and he never hesitated to use this gift when it suited his purposes.

One fateful evening, Giacomo Bierhals received an invitation from the wealthy merchant, Monsieur LeFleur, to attend a lavish dinner party at his opulent estate.
