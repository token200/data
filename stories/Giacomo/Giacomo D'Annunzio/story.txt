Giacomo D'Annunzio stepped onto the balcony, gazing out at the city below. The Tuscan sun cast a golden glow over the rolling hills and vineyards, as if trying to burn away his troubles. He lit a cigar, feeling the familiar sting of nicotine coursing through his veins.

It was 1914, and Europe teetered on the brink of war. Giacomo's own country, Italy, had recently joined the Allied powers in their fight against Austria-Hungary. But Giacomo's heart belonged to Albania, a land he had fought to free from Ottoman rule all those years ago.

He thought of his beloved Albania, and his mind wandered to the beautiful princess, Zog's wife, who had captured his heart long ago. The same princess who now waited for him in Rome, her letter on the breakfast table calling him back to duty.

Giacomo sighed, feeling like a man torn apart by conflicting loyalties. His poetry and politics were intertwined – he wrote of war, but also of love, of longing, of passion. Was it possible to reconcile these opposing forces within himself?

As he gazed out at the city, Giacomo saw the echoes of his past life playing out on the streets below. The bohemian artists and writers who had once called him friend now mocked him for his flirtations with fascism.

But what choice did he have? Giacomo was a man born of his times – he had grown up in the shadows of revolution, witnessing the rise and fall of empires. Albania's struggle for independence had been but one chapter in his own life's epic saga.

And now, as war raged across the continent, Giacomo felt an itch to write something new – a battle cry to rally his fellow Italians to Albania's cause? Or perhaps a scathing critique of the war effort, like some of his earlier works?

The wind carried the scent of freshly cut grass and ripening grapes through the air. Giacomo inhaled deeply, feeling the familiar calm wash over him. He knew that as long as he had his words, he would always have a way out.

"Ma Roma è chiusa!" – But Rome is closed! Giacomo whispered to himself, smiling wryly at his own wit. For tonight, at least, he would retreat into the silence of his balcony, watching over Albania and Italy, dreaming up the poetry that would change the course of history.
