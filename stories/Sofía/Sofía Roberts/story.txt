She would spend hours capturing the beauty of her hometown, experimenting with different techniques and styles. Her passion only grew stronger as she honed her craft, and soon, her work was being featured in some of the world's most prestigious publications.

One day, while covering a major international event, Sofía met a young journalist named Alex Chen. They struck up a conversation about their shared love of photography, and before parting ways, they exchanged numbers.
