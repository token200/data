Zeme quickly became the go-to destination for foodies and critics alike, with Sofía Bērziņa's innovative takes on traditional Latvian dishes drawing rave reviews. Her menu featured creative twists on classic dishes like stuffed cabbage rolls filled with sweet potatoes and wild mushrooms, and crispy latke-like pancakes served with a tangy sour cream.

Despite her success, Sofía Bērziņa remained committed to her roots. She sourced ingredients from local farmers whenever possible, and worked closely with other chefs and food artisans to support the Latvian culinary community.

As Zeme's popularity grew, so did Sofía Bērziņa's influence on the Riga food scene.

Through it all, Sofía Bērziņa remained true to herself and her passion for cooking, inspiring countless young chefs and food lovers in her wake.
