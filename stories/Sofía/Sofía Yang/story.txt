Luna had written a novel that explored themes of identity, culture, and community, and she believed that Sofía Yang's voice would be the perfect complement to her story.

Sofía Yang was intrigued by Luna's pitch and agreed to meet with her in person. Over coffee, they discussed their shared passion for storytelling and their desire to use their platform to amplify marginalized voices.
