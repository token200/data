Sofía Eben stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a glimpse of her friend, Mateo. She had been waiting for what felt like an eternity for him to arrive, and the minutes were starting to tick by.

As she waited, Sofia's mind wandered back to their conversation from the day before. They had been talking about their dreams, and how they were going to make them a reality. Mateo had always been the driven one, with his engineering degree and high-paying job at a top firm. But Sofia had other plans. She wanted to be a writer, to create stories that would transport people to another world.

Sofía spotted Mateo across the room, sipping on a coffee and chatting with someone she didn't recognize. He caught her eye and flashed his usual charming smile, and Sofia's heart skipped a beat.

As she made her way over to him, he stood up and wrapped his arms around her in a warm hug. "Sorry I'm late," he said, holding her at arm's length to examine her face. "I got stuck in traffic."

Sofía rolled her eyes good-naturedly. "You're always getting stuck in traffic," she teased.

They sat down and ordered their coffee, catching up on each other's lives. Mateo filled Sofia in on his latest project, a sustainable energy startup that he was determined to make a success of. And Sofia shared with him her latest writing ideas, including a novel about a young woman who discovers she has the ability to time-travel.

As they talked, Sofia couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness. She had always dreamed of leaving her small town behind and making it big in the city. Mateo's success had given her hope that maybe, just maybe, she could make those dreams come true.

"Hey, Sofía?" Mateo said, noticing the far-off look in her eyes. "What's on your mind?"

Sofía turned to him, a smile spreading across her face. "I don't know if I'm good enough," she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. "But I want to try."

Mateo took her hand in his, his eyes filled with understanding. "You're always going to be 'good enough'," he said softly. "You just have to believe it."

Sofía smiled, feeling a sense of gratitude towards her friend. With Mateo by her side, she knew that anything was possible.
