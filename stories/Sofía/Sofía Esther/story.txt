As she grew older, Sofía Esther's passion for art only deepened, leading her to study fine art at a prestigious university. It was there that she honed her skills, experimenting with various mediums and techniques until she found her unique voice.

After graduating, Sofía Esther landed a job as an intern at a small gallery in the city.

As she curated exhibitions for local artists, she discovered new talent and nurtured emerging careers.

Despite her success, Sofía Esther remained humble and kind. She was always willing to lend a helping hand or offer words of encouragement to those just starting out in the industry. Her friends adored her for it, often joking that she had a "twin flame" among her art students – someone who shared her passion and energy.

One day, Sofía Esther's boss approached her with an exciting proposition: would she be willing to curate a retrospective exhibition for a renowned artist? The offer was too good to pass up. With her keen eye and deep understanding of the artist's work, Sofía Esther spent months selecting pieces from every stage of the artist's career.
