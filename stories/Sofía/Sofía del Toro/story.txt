Sofía del Toro stepped off the plane in Lima, Peru, her eyes scanning the bustling airport as she clutched her worn leather suitcase to her chest. A seasoned traveler, she had been on countless journeys, but this one held a special significance. She was returning to her hometown of Cusco, where her abuela (grandmother) had passed away just a week ago.

As Sofía made her way through customs and immigration, memories flooded her mind. Growing up in Cusco, she had spent hours exploring the ancient Inca city with Abuela Elena, learning about the history and traditions of their people. She remembered the way Abuela's eyes sparkled when telling stories of the Incas' conquests and the mythical creatures that roamed the Andes.

Sofía hailed a taxi outside the airport and gave the driver the address of her family's ancestral home in Cusco's historic center. As they wound through the narrow streets, Sofía gazed out at the colorful buildings and bustling market stalls, feeling a sense of belonging wash over her.

When she arrived at the old house, Sofía was greeted by her younger brother, Carlos, who had flown in from Madrid to help with the funeral arrangements. Together, they spent the next few days preparing for Abuela Elena's burial and welcoming visitors from around the world.

As Sofía settled into the routine of mourning and caring for their family's home, she began to feel a sense of connection to her heritage that she had never experienced before. She started taking long walks through the Andean countryside, where she discovered hidden temples and sacred sites that Abuela Elena used to take her on when they were children.

One day, while exploring a small village near Cusco, Sofía stumbled upon a traditional weaving cooperative. The women there welcomed her with open arms, teaching her the intricate techniques of creating woolen textiles. As she worked alongside them, Sofía realized that Abuela Elena's stories had been more than just tales – they were threads in a rich tapestry of Andean culture.

Sofía spent the next few weeks learning and weaving, finding solace in the rhythmic patterns and vibrant colors of the textiles. When it was time to return to her life abroad, she knew that she would carry Abuela Elena's legacy with her – not just as a family heirloom but as a piece of herself. As she boarded the plane to leave Cusco behind, Sofía smiled, knowing that a part of her abuela lived on in every thread, and that their stories would forever be intertwined like the finest Andean wool.
