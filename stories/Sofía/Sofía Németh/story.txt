Sofía Németh stepped out of the small café, her eyes scanning the bustling streets of Budapest. As a journalist, she had grown accustomed to the city's fast-paced rhythm, but today felt different. A sense of unease settled in the pit of her stomach as she made her way through the crowded sidewalks.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket, breaking the silence. She pulled it out, and her heart skipped a beat as she saw the message from her source: "Meet me at the Széchenyi Thermal Bath. Come alone."

Sofía's instincts told her to ignore the warning, but her curiosity got the better of her. She had been investigating a string of corruption cases involving high-ranking officials in Budapest, and this message might be the break she needed.

She hailed a taxi and headed towards the Széchenyi Thermal Bath on the outskirts of the city. As she arrived, she saw a figure waiting by the entrance – a young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair.

"Who are you?" Sofía asked, trying to keep her voice steady.

"My name is Ágnes," the woman replied, her voice barely above a whisper. "I have information about your investigation. But we need to be careful. They're watching us."

Sofía's mind raced as she followed Ágnes into the bath, where they sat down on a wooden bench by the edge of the thermal pool.

"I've been working undercover," Ágnes explained, her eyes darting around the crowded room. "I stumbled upon a conspiracy involving some of the most powerful people in Budapest. They're embezzling funds and using them for their own gain."

Sofía's mind reeled as she took out her notebook and began to scribble down notes. This was it – the evidence she needed to bring the corrupt officials to justice.

But just as they were about to part ways, a figure emerged from the crowd, his eyes locked on Sofía with an unnerving intensity.

"It seems we have company," Ágnes whispered, grabbing Sofía's arm and pulling her close. "We need to get out of here – now."

With that, they jumped up from the bench and made a run for it, disappearing into the throngs of people in the bath as quickly as possible. As they emerged into the bright sunlight, Ágnes handed Sofía a small package.

"For you," she said with a smile before turning and vanishing into the crowd.

Sofía watched her go, feeling a sense of gratitude towards this mysterious stranger who had just changed the course of her investigation – and possibly her life.
