As the evening drew to a close, Lucas approached Sofía with a surprise announcement: he wanted to offer her a permanent spot in his gallery. Overjoyed by the opportunity, Sofía accepted, knowing that this partnership would help take her art career to new heights. With her dreams finally within reach, Sofía Elara Marrone smiled, feeling as though she was finally living up to her full creative potential.
