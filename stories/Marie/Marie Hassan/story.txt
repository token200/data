Marie Hassan stepped into the crowded café, scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Rachel, sitting alone at a table by the window and made her way over.

As she approached, Rachel looked up and smiled. "Hey, Marie Hassan! Long time no see," she said, extending a hand.

Marie Hassan sat down across from Rachel and ordered a cup of coffee. They chatted for a bit about their lives, catching up on each other's jobs and hobbies. Marie Hassan was a freelance writer, working on her first novel in her spare time. Rachel, on the other hand, was a successful event planner.

As they sipped their coffee, Rachel asked Marie Hassan about her latest writing project. "So, how's your novel coming along?" she asked, curiosity etched on her face.

Marie Hassan took a sip of her coffee before launching into a detailed explanation of her story. It was a sweeping romance set in 19th-century Egypt, inspired by her own family history. Rachel listened intently, asking thoughtful questions and offering words of encouragement.

As the afternoon wore on, the café began to fill with more patrons. The atmosphere grew louder and more chaotic, but Marie Hassan and Rachel barely noticed. They were too engrossed in their conversation to care about the commotion around them.

At one point, a group of rowdy teenagers came over to their table, laughing and joking loudly. Marie Hassan rolled her eyes good-naturedly, while Rachel chuckled and shook her head. "Sorry about that," she said, smiling at Marie Hassan. "I think they were just looking for someone to join in on the fun."

Marie Hassan laughed and playfully tossed a napkin at one of the teenagers. The group dispersed, leaving the two friends to continue their conversation.

As the hours passed, the café began to empty out. Rachel glanced at her watch and stood up. "I should probably get going," she said. "It was great catching up with you, Marie Hassan."

Marie Hassan smiled and stood up, feeling rejuvenated after their conversation. "The same to you, Rachel. Let's do it again soon."

As they parted ways outside the café, Rachel called out, "Take care of that novel for me!" Marie Hassan grinned and waved goodbye before disappearing into the crowded streets.
