Marie Sharma walked into the small café on a chilly winter morning, her eyes scanning the crowded room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Ramesh, sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of hot coffee. Marie made her way over to him, exchanging warm smiles as she sat down.

Ramesh was a writer, and Marie had been his muse for many years. He had written several novels based on their friendship, and Marie had become an iconic character in his works. She knew it sounded cliché, but Marie didn't mind the association. In fact, she rather enjoyed being a symbol of love and loyalty in Ramesh's stories.

As they caught up over coffee, Marie couldn't help but tease Ramesh about his latest novel. "You're still stuck on me, aren't you?" she asked with a laugh. Ramesh blushed, looking sheepish, but also pleased that Marie was so comfortable with her portrayal in literature.

Their conversation turned to their childhood memories of growing up in Delhi. Marie reminisced about the time they spent exploring the city's streets, playing hide-and-seek among the narrow alleys and eating street food from vendors. Ramesh chuckled along with her, his eyes twinkling with mirth.

As the morning wore on, the café began to fill with more patrons. The sound of clinking cups and chatter filled the air, but Marie and Ramesh were lost in their own world, transported back to a time when life was simpler. Marie felt grateful for this friend who had seen her through thick and thin, and whose stories had brought her so much joy.

As they prepared to part ways, Ramesh turned to Marie and said, "You know, I've been thinking of writing another novel based on our friendship." Marie's eyes sparkled with excitement. "I'd love that," she replied. And as she walked out of the café, she couldn't help but wonder what new adventures Ramesh would weave around her character.
