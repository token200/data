Marie Yi-hsien was a legend in her own time, known for her striking beauty and razor-sharp wit. Born in the sweltering summer of 1920 to a French father and Taiwanese mother, she grew up navigating the complexities of colonialism and cultural identity.

As a young woman, Marie's life was a whirlwind of social events and high society gatherings. She charmed the world with her effortless elegance, effortlessly switching between fluent Mandarin, French, and English. Her parents' divorce when she was 15 left her feeling lost and abandoned, but it also gave her a sense of independence that served her well.

After completing her studies in Paris, Marie returned to Taiwan as a cultural ambassador for her mother's family. She quickly became a darling of the Taiwanese high society, known for her daring fashion choices and sassy humor. But beneath her glamorous facade, Marie was hiding secrets – secrets about her past, her feelings, and her desires.

One fateful evening, while attending a black-tie gala at the Taipei Hotel, Marie met him: Dr. Lee Chen-hua, a brilliant historian and author of several acclaimed books on Taiwanese history. His piercing gaze locked onto hers across the crowded room, and she felt an electric jolt run through her veins.

Their conversation flowed effortlessly from politics to literature, with neither willing to give ground. As they strolled along the banks of the Keelung River, discussing everything from Confucianism to Surrealist art, Marie found herself drawn to Dr. Lee's quiet intensity and dry wit.

In that magical night, something shifted within Marie Yi-hsien. She began to peel away the layers of her carefully constructed persona, revealing a depth she never knew existed. And for the first time in years, she felt truly seen – by someone who understood not just her beauty but also her inner turmoil.

Though their whirlwind romance was short-lived, with Dr. Lee's duties requiring him to travel abroad, Marie knew that their encounter had changed her forever. She emerged from the experience wiser and more self-assured, ready to forge a new path forward – one that would blend the elegance of her past with the authenticity she'd discovered in Dr. Lee Chen-hua's eyes.
