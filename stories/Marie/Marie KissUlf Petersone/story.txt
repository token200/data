Marie KissUlf Petersone was a renowned botanist who had spent her entire life studying the unique flora of the Arctic tundra. Born and raised in Svalbard, Norway, she had developed a deep understanding of the harsh yet beautiful environment that surrounded her childhood home.

As a young girl, Marie would spend hours exploring the frozen landscape with her grandfather, a local guide who taught her about the medicinal properties of the plants they encountered. This early exposure sparked her passion for botany, and she went on to study at the University of Oslo, where she earned her Ph.D. in plant biology.
