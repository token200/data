Milan Krūmiņš was a man shrouded in mystery, with an air of quiet confidence that commanded attention without ever demanding it. A former Soviet Union athlete turned Olympic coach, he had spent his life cultivating a reputation for success – not just on the track, but off it as well.

His eyes, a deep shade of brown that seemed almost black, held a world of stories within them. Those who knew him spoke of his unwavering dedication to his athletes, his unshakeable faith in their abilities, and his ability to coax performances from those who doubted themselves.

Milan's own athletic career had been marked by triumphs and setbacks alike. Born in the Soviet Union, he had risen through the ranks as a sprinter before being drafted into the Red Army. Post-Soviet life saw him coach athletes for various Eastern European nations before finally settling in Latvia.

In Riga, he found success with his team, including Olympic gold medalists Kārlis Silovsky and Andris Laiškevics
