Born in a small village on the outskirts of Madrid, Lev grew up surrounded by the rich colors and patterns of Spanish folk art. From a young age, he was fascinated by the way his abuela could transform ordinary objects into works of beauty. As he honed his craft, Lev became determined to capture that same essence in his own work.

Lev Pérez Sánchez spent years experimenting with different materials and techniques, often incorporating elements of nature into his art. He would spend hours collecting leaves, petals, and other organic matter to use as dyes for his paints. His studio was a riot of color and texture, with paint-splattered canvases, dried flowers, and scraps of fabric scattered everywhere.

Despite the unconventional nature of his work, Lev Pérez Sánchez had a loyal following among art enthusiasts. People were drawn to his unique energy and passion, which seemed to radiate from every brushstroke he made. As his reputation grew, so did the demand for his work.
