Lev Nowak stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the chill of the autumn evening seeping into his bones. He had been away for months, chasing leads in the dark corners of Eastern Europe, but it was finally time to return home.

As he made his way through the deserted station, Lev's eyes scanned the familiar surroundings. The once-grand waiting room now seemed worn and tired, the chipped linoleum and faded wallpaper a testament to neglect. He spotted the old coffee shop next door, its neon sign flickering like a tired heart. A warmth of nostalgia stirred within him as he pushed open the creaky door.

Inside, the air was thick with the scent of burnt coffee and stale cigarettes. Lev slid onto a stool at the counter, his eyes locking with that of their proprietor, an old man named Szymon. The look on Szymon's face said it all - a mix of curiosity and suspicion.

"What can I get you, Lev?" Szymon asked, his voice low and gravelly.

"Just a cup of black coffee," Lev replied, his eyes scanning the room.

Szymon nodded, moving with a jerky motion to the counter. "On the house."

As he waited for his coffee, Lev's mind wandered back to the case that had brought him here. A string of seemingly unrelated murders across Eastern Europe, each one bearing an eerie resemblance to an ancient myth from Slavic folklore.

Lev took a sip of his coffee, feeling it course through his veins like adrenaline. He was getting close, he could feel it. The threads of the mystery were starting to unravel, revealing a sinister pattern that threatened to engulf the entire region.

The station door swung open, admitting a blast of cold air as a young woman stepped inside. Her eyes locked with Lev's, and for an instant, they shared a spark of recognition. She was one of his sources - a talented but reckless journalist who had stumbled into danger.

Szymon gestured toward her, and Lev slid off the stool. "For you," he said, following her out onto the platform.

The night air enveloped them like a shroud as they walked side by side towards the shadows of the station's abandoned buildings. The wind carried whispers of the past, echoes of ancient myths waiting to be uncovered.
