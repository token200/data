As a renowned archaeologist, he had spent years studying the ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean, uncovering hidden treasures and unraveling mysteries that had stumped scholars for centuries.

Born into a family of modest means, Lev Pioli's passion for discovery was nurtured from an early age by his wise and adventurous grandmother, Sofia. She regaled him with tales of her own travels, from the sun-kissed hills of Tuscany to the bustling souks of Marrakech, sparking a fire within him that would burn bright throughout his life.

One day, while excavating a long-abandoned site on the Greek island of Santorini, Lev Pioli stumbled upon an ancient scroll hidden away in a crumbling temple.
