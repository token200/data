Lev Eriksson stood at the edge of the frozen lake, his eyes fixed on the dark shape that had begun to take form in the distance. It was a fleeting glimpse, but one that sent a shiver down his spine. He had seen it before - the ghostly apparition of a young woman, her long hair blowing in the wind like a mournful sigh.

As a member of the Swedish royal guard, Lev had witnessed many strange occurrences on the frozen lakes and snow-covered forests surrounding Stockholm. But none as inexplicable as these recurring visions. Some said he was cursed by the gods themselves; others claimed it was just the product of too much time spent in the cold.

Lev didn't believe any of it. He knew what he saw, and he knew that it was trying to tell him something. The woman's face was always distorted, her eyes black as coal. But sometimes, on rare occasions, he caught a glimpse of her eyes - piercing green, like the first shoots of spring after a long winter.

As the vision faded away, Lev felt a surge of energy course through his veins. He knew that this moment had been coming for weeks now, ever since the royal family's heir apparent had gone missing on one of these same frozen lakes. Lev's unit had combed the area, searching for any sign of him, but so far, there was nothing.

Without hesitation, Lev set off across the lake, his long strides eating up the distance. He knew every inch of this land, every hidden corner and crevice. He could feel it - the presence of the woman, like a beacon calling to him.

As he reached the midpoint of the lake, Lev stopped in his tracks. There, standing before him, was the ghostly apparition once more. But this time, she did not flee. Instead, she turned to face him, her green eyes locked onto his.

Lev felt a jolt of electricity run through his body as he gazed into those eyes. Suddenly, the past and present blurred together, revealing a vision that had been hidden for centuries - the truth behind the royal family's disappearance, and the reason why Lev's visions began in the first place.

With this newfound understanding, Lev felt a sense of purpose wash over him. He knew what he had to do next. With renewed determination, he set off across the lake once more, ready to uncover the secrets that lay hidden beneath the frozen surface.
