Lev poured his heart and soul into the performance, playing songs that spoke directly to his own experiences growing up in Riga. The crowd was captivated by his energy and passion, singing along to every word. This night marked the beginning of Lev Kalējs' meteoric rise to fame – he would go on to release several critically-acclaimed albums, collaborate with other renowned musicians, and win numerous awards for his work.

Years later, as Lev looked back on that pivotal performance at Domkultūra, he knew that it was just the beginning.
