Lev Poirier stepped into the dimly lit jazz club, the sounds of Miles Davis wafting through the air like a warm hug. As a young saxophonist, he felt at home among the smoke-filled rooms and whiskey-stained glasses. His eyes scanned the crowd, searching for the familiar figure of his mentor, Professor Émile.

As fate would have it, Lev spotted the professor perched on a stool, sipping on a glass of fine scotch. The older man's eyes locked onto Lev's, and he nodded in approval. "Ah, cher, you're here," he said, his voice low and gravelly.

Lev smiled, feeling a sense of comfort wash over him. He took a seat beside the professor, who handed him a drink without needing to be asked. As they sipped their cocktails, Lev's fingers began to itch with restlessness. "Professor, I need to talk to you about something," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Émile raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the look on Lev's face. "Oui?" he prompted, setting his glass down on the table.

Lev hesitated, collecting his thoughts before speaking. "I want to leave Quebec City. I know it's not the most exciting place, but... I feel like there's something missing for me here." The words tumbled out of him like a confession, and he felt a pang of vulnerability.

Émile listened intently, his eyes never leaving Lev's face. When the young saxophonist finished speaking, the professor nodded thoughtfully. "Cher, sometimes we need to leave our comfort zones to find ourselves," he said. "But don't go chasing dreams without thinking them through."

Lev nodded, feeling a mix of excitement and trepidation. He knew that Émile was right – but where would his dreams take him? The professor's words hung in the air like a promise, leaving Lev with more questions than answers.

As the night wore on, Lev listened to the sounds of the city outside, his mind whirling with possibilities. When he finally emerged into the cool night air, he knew that his journey had just begun – and Émile's wisdom would stay with him every step of the way.
