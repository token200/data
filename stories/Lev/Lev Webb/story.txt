Levontay "Lev" Webb was a free-spirited artist with a passion for music and dance. Growing up in a small town, he always felt like an outsider, much to his parents' dismay. His mother, a talented painter, encouraged Lev's creative pursuits from a young age, while his father, a musician himself, taught him how to play the guitar.

There, he honed his skills as a painter and mixed media artist, experimenting with bold colors and abstract shapes. His passion for music never faded, however, and he began to incorporate beats into his performances, much to the delight of his fellow students.

One fateful evening, Lev had an epiphany â€“ he wanted to merge his two passions into one cohesive art form. He began working on a multimedia installation that combined paint-splattered canvases with pulsing electronic beats and mesmerizing dance performances. The result was a truly immersive experience that left audiences breathless.
