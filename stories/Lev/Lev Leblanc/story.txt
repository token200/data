Lev LeBlanc was no ordinary thief. While most con artists relied on charm and deception, Lev's methods were more... unconventional. He had a fascination with the world of science fiction, and often incorporated elements from his favorite novels into his heists.

One night, Lev received an offer from a wealthy collector who claimed to have acquired a rare, prototype artifact from a fictional universe - one that was said to grant immense power to its possessor. Lev saw this as the opportunity of a lifetime and assembled his team of experts: tech-savvy hacker, "Zero Cool", and explosives expert, "Bullseye".

Their target was a heavily guarded facility in downtown Los Angeles, where the collector was hosting an exclusive viewing party for select guests. Lev's plan involved infiltrating the event, posing as a high-end art dealer, and making off with the artifact.

As they navigated the crowded gala, Zero Cool worked her magic on the security cameras, while Bullseye planted explosives at strategic intervals to clear the way for their escape. Meanwhile, Lev mingled with the guests, exchanging witty banter and pretending to be an expert on rare artifacts.

The plan was set in motion as Bullseye detonated a carefully timed bomb, sending shards of glass flying everywhere. Zero Cool swiftly hacked into the security systems, disabling cameras and alarms, while Lev made his move. With the artifact in hand, he pretended to accidentally drop it during a game of high-stakes poker.

The collector's eyes widened in horror as Lev claimed he had simply "accidentally" picked up the wrong piece of artwork. Zero Cool quickly dispatched the security team, and Bullseye led them out through the back door, leaving behind a trail of broken glass and chaos.

As they made their getaway, Lev couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement. He loved the thrill of the chase, the rush of adrenaline that came with outsmarting his enemies. And this artifact? It was just the beginning.

Once safely in his hideout, Lev began to study the artifact, fascinated by its power and potential applications. This could be the start of something big - a way for him to not only get rich, but also change the world. The possibilities swirled in his mind as he pondered his next move.

With the artifact in hand, Lev LeBlanc was ready to make his mark on the world. Bring it on.
