LevMercier sat at the worn wooden table, sipping his whiskey as he stared out the rain-soaked window. His eyes, a deep shade of indigo that seemed to hold a world of sadness within them, reflected the turmoil brewing inside him. It had been five years since the accident took the life of his younger brother, Étienne, and the pain still lingered like an open wound.

As he nursed his drink, Lev's mind wandered back to the fateful night when it all went wrong. He recalled the sound of screeching tires, the crunching metal, and the eerie silence that followed as the darkness closed in around him. The memory made his jaw clenched tightly, his fists balled into a knot on the tabletop.

The door creaked open, and his sister, Colette, walked in carrying a steaming tray of freshly baked croissants. "Morning, Lev," she said softly, her voice barely above a whisper. "I brought your favorite."

Lev nodded, taking a small bite of one of the flaky pastries. The sweetness momentarily distracted him from his reverie, and he smiled wistfully at Colette. She had always been there for him, a rock in the midst of chaos.

"Mercier, you need to get out of this funk," she said, setting the tray down beside him. "You can't keep dwelling on the past."

Lev knew Colette was right. He needed to find a way to honor Étienne's memory while also forging his own path forward. The thought filled him with determination.

Just then, a knock at the door interrupted their moment of contemplation. It was Aurélien, Lev's old friend and confidant. "Hey, buddy, I brought some news that might interest you," he said, flashing his signature smile.

Lev raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. As Aurélien handed him a folder filled with documents and photographs, Lev felt the weight of uncertainty begin to lift. Perhaps it was time for Lev Mercier to start anew, to find a way to channel his grief into something beautiful.

With a newfound sense of resolve, Lev pushed back from the table, wiping away the faint tears welling up in his eyes. "Mercier's got this," he whispered, a small smile creeping onto his face as he gazed out at the rain-soaked world once more.
