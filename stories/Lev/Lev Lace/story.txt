Lev Antony Lace was a man of mystery and intrigue. With piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through you, he could charm his way into (or out of) just about any situation. As a master thief, Lev had made a name for himself on the streets of Paris, where his unparalleled skills in stealth and deception had earned him both admiration and fear.

One fateful night, as the city was bathed in the soft glow of streetlights, Lev received an offer he couldn't refuse. A wealthy collector, known only as "The Patron," had set a challenge for him: steal a priceless diamond necklace from the Musée du Louvre itself.

Word of Lev's achievement spread like wildfire, cementing his reputation as one of the greatest thieves of all time.

Lev Antony Lace was a ghost, always just out of reach – and that was exactly what made him so elusive, so impossible to catch.

As he disappeared into the night, the city lights twinkling like stars around him, Lev knew that this was only the beginning of his next adventure. And The Patron? He had earned himself a permanent place on Lev's list of targets...
