Leonard Zielińska stepped out of his small, cluttered flat and into the chilly London morning. A former Polish army medic, he had left his homeland in search of a fresh start after the fall of communism. Now, as a freelance translator, he worked from home, juggling projects with various clients.

As he walked to the nearby café, Leonard couldn't shake off the memory of his last mission in Warsaw. He had been on the phone with a client who required him to translate sensitive documents about an undercover operation. The details were sketchy, but something didn't sit right with Leonard – this could be more than just a simple translation job.

Over steaming cups of coffee and pastries, Leonard discussed his concerns with his best friend, Rafal. A fellow Poles native who had also escaped the Soviet-backed regime, Rafal listened attentively before dismissing Leonard's worries. "You're being paranoid again," he teased.

Leonard sighed, rubbing his temples. He knew Rafal was right; his instincts were always on high alert. The constant threat of surveillance and espionage lingered in his mind like a shadow. His mother had been killed during the crackdown in 1981 – a traumatic event that still haunted him to this day.

As he finished his coffee, a text message appeared on his phone. It was from an unknown number – one that Leonard didn't recognize.

"Meet me at the old clock tower at 5 PM," the message read. "Come alone."

Leonard's heart skipped a beat as he deleted the message and stared out of the window. He couldn't shake off the feeling that someone was watching him, even in this quiet corner of London.

Rafal must be right; he needed to let go of his fears and focus on work. After all, Leonard had built a new life here – one that didn't revolve around espionage or revolution.

He took another sip of coffee, determination etched onto his face. Whatever the unknown person wanted, Leonard Zielińska wasn't going to play games.
