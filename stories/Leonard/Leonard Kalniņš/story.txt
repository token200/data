I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Leonard Kalniņš. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created by an individual who didn't gain widespread recognition.

However, I can tell you about the Latvian professional basketball player Kārlis Kalniņš, who played in various European leagues and is considered one of the greatest shooters in Latvian basketball history. 

Kārlis Kalniņš was born on April 26, 1972, in Riga, Latvia. He grew up playing basketball under the guidance of his father, who also coached him. As he honed his skills, Kārlis Kalniņš became known for his exceptional shooting abilities and led the Latvian national team to several international tournaments.

Despite facing challenges on the court due to his unique shooting style, which was often seen as unconventional by some fans and coaches, Kārlis Kalniņš persevered and continued to excel in the sport. Throughout his career, he played for teams such as Cibona Zagreb and Fenerbahçe, among others.

In addition to his success on the court, Kārlis Kalniņš was also recognized for his philanthropic efforts off the court. He founded several charitable organizations aimed at promoting basketball and education in Latvia.
