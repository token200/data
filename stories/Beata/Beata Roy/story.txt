Beata Roy sat alone in her small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and scraps of paper filled with half-written poems. It was a typical Wednesday evening, and she had just received news that her grant application to publish her novel had been rejected for the third time.

Feeling defeated, Beata poured herself a cup of cold tea and slumped onto her couch, staring blankly at the walls as tears welled up in her eyes. She had always dreamed of becoming a published author, but it seemed like an impossible feat. Despite her best efforts, she couldn't seem to catch a break.

As she sat there, a faint knock on the door broke the silence. It was her neighbor, Mrs. Patel, who had lived across from Beata for years. Mrs. Patel was a kind and gentle soul, with a warm smile that could light up even the darkest of rooms.

"Beeta, beta," Mrs. Patel said, using the affectionate nickname she had given to Beata when they first met, "I saw you crying in your apartment building. Do you want some company?"

Beata hesitated for a moment before nodding, and Mrs. Patel entered with a steaming cup of hot chai and a plate of freshly baked naan bread.

Over the next hour, Beata opened up to Mrs. Patel about her struggles as an author, sharing her fears and doubts with her neighbor. But instead of offering words of encouragement or telling her to keep trying, Mrs. Patel listened intently, nodding along as if she understood exactly what Beata was saying.

When Beata finished speaking, Mrs. Patel smiled and said, "Beeta, your writing is not for the publisher's eyes. It's for yours. You write because you must, not because you want to sell books or make money."

Beata looked up at Mrs. Patel in surprise, feeling a lump form in her throat. No one had ever put it that way before.

"You're right," Beata said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I've been writing for myself all along, but I forgot that."

Mrs. Patel patted Beata's hand and said, "That's the most important thing to remember, beta. Write because you must, not because anyone else will like it. And if they don't, then that's okay too. You'll know when your time is right."

As the evening drew to a close, Beata felt a sense of peace wash over her. She realized that she didn't need external validation to validate her writing. She could create for herself alone, and that was enough.

From that day on, Beata returned to her writing with renewed passion and purpose. And although she never did publish her novel, she wrote many more stories, poems, and letters to herself, a reminder of Mrs. Patel's wise words: "Write because you must."
