Beata Ozolina was a woman with a passion for photography that rivaled her love for life itself. As she wandered through the bustling streets of Moscow, camera in hand, she captured the essence of the city's vibrant culture. Her lens seemed to drink in the beauty of every street performer, vendor, and passerby, freezing their stories into frames of light and shadow.

Beata Ozolina's journey as a photographer began in her childhood home in rural Lithuania, where she grew up surrounded by the rolling hills and forests that would later inspire her work. Her parents, both artists themselves, encouraged her creative pursuits from an early age, gifting her with a small camera when she was just eight years old.

As Beata Ozolina navigated the complexities of adulthood, her photography took on a new level of depth and nuance. She began to explore themes of identity, community, and social justice, using her lens to amplify marginalized voices and challenge systemic inequalities.
