Audrey Lacis stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. It was a typical morning in Paris - the smell of freshly baked croissants wafted from the nearby café, and the sound of laughter filled the air. Audrey had always loved mornings like this, full of possibility and promise.

As she made her way through the crowd, Audrey's thoughts turned to the day ahead. She was scheduled to meet with a potential client for her freelance writing business, and she needed to make a good impression. With a deep breath, she pushed open the door to the café and slid onto a stool at the bar.

The waitress, a warm-smiling woman named Colette, greeted Audrey with a friendly bonjour. "Un café, s'il vous plaît," Audrey replied, her eyes scanning the menu as Colette expertly brewed her coffee.

As she waited for her drink to arrive, Audrey pulled out her notebook and began to scribble down some notes for the meeting later that day. She was determined to land this client, and she knew that a solid outline would help her make a strong pitch.

The door swung open and a figure entered, their eyes scanning the room until they landed on Audrey. It was Sophie, one of Audrey Lacis's closest friends from college. The two women hugged warmly, exchanging stories and gossip as they waited for their drinks to arrive.

With Colette out of earshot, Sophie leaned in close and whispered, "I have some exciting news - I just got accepted into the program at the American University! You're going to be so proud." Audrey's face lit up with a wide smile as she hugged her friend tightly. This was exactly the kind of positive energy Audrey needed to tackle the day ahead.

As they finished their drinks and prepared to part ways, Audrey turned to Sophie and said, "I'll be so happy for you, Soph - I couldn't have asked for a better friend." With a final squeeze, the two women went their separate ways, each feeling uplifted and ready to take on whatever the day had in store.
