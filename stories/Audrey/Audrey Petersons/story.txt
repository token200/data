Audrey Petersons was a free-spirited artist who had always been drawn to the sea. Growing up in a small coastal town, she spent most of her childhood exploring the tide pools and watching the sunset over the ocean. As she grew older, her love for the sea only deepened, and she decided to pursue a career as a marine biologist.

Audrey Petersons' passion for the ocean led her to study at the local university, where she earned a degree in marine biology. After completing her studies, she landed a job at a prestigious research institute, where she spent years studying the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems.
