Audrey Makinen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her bright pink sneakers making a splash amidst the drab, industrial surroundings. As she made her way through the quiet station, the soft glow of fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie light on her features. Her short, spiky hair was dyed a vibrant shade of purple, which seemed to clash with the dull atmosphere of the place.

Audrey was on her way back home to Detroit for spring break, eager to spend some quality time with her family and friends after a long year at art school in Chicago. She had always been drawn to the city's grittiness and creative energy, but sometimes it felt like too much to handle. As she walked through the deserted streets, Audrey couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness, as if she was meant for something more.

As she turned onto her street, the familiar sight of her family's bakery wafted out into the air, enticing her with the sweet scent of fresh bread and pastries. Audrey's eyes widened in delight as she pushed open the door, greeted by the warm smile of her mother, Rosa. "Audrey, mija! It's so good to see you!" Rosa exclaimed, enveloping her daughter in a tight hug.

After a quick lunch with her family, Audrey set off on her usual route around the neighborhood, taking in the sights and sounds of home. She stopped by the local park, where she watched as children played tag and laughed together. As she sat down on a bench to take it all in, Audrey felt a sense of peace wash over her. This was what she had been missing â€“ connection with others, with nature, with herself.

As she walked back home, the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the streets. Audrey's mind turned to her art school projects and upcoming deadlines. She knew she still had a lot to prove herself in the competitive world of fine arts, but for now, she was content to simply be home, surrounded by love and light.
