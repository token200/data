Audrey Horváth sat at her small, cluttered desk, surrounded by stacks of old taxidermy manuals and dusty jars of specimens. Her eyes gleamed with a mix of fascination and morbid curiosity as she carefully dissected the latest addition to her collection: a perfectly preserved opossum.

It was a chilly autumn evening, and Audrey's tiny studio apartment in the heart of New Orleans seemed to be shrouded in an air of foreboding. The flickering candles cast eerie shadows on the walls as she worked, the scent of formaldehyde and decay wafting through the air.

Audrey was a taxidermist with a dark and troubled past. Her family had been part of a secretive cult that revered death and the supernatural. As a child, she'd helped her parents prepare bodies for their rituals, learning the art of preserving flesh and creating lifelike silhouettes from the deceased.

But after a fateful night when one of their human sacrifices had turned on them, Audrey's family was torn apart, and she was left alone, adrift in a world that no longer understood her. She found solace in taxidermy, using her skills to create eerie, unblinking creatures that seemed to stare back at her with cold, dead eyes.

As the night wore on, Audrey began to feel a sense of unease. The opossum's glassy stare seemed to be watching her, and she couldn't shake the feeling that it was waiting for something – or someone. She packed up the specimen and carefully wrapped it in tissue paper, the sensation of its cold skin sending shivers down her spine.

In the silence of her apartment, Audrey felt a presence closing in around her. The shadows seemed to deepen, twisting into grotesque forms that lurked just beyond the edge of perception. She knew then that she was not alone – and that some secrets were better left unburied.

As the candles burned low, Audrey vanished into the darkness, leaving behind only the faint scent of decay and a trail of taxidermy pins, like skeletal fingers, reaching out into the night.
