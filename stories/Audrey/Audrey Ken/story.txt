She spent most of her days painting vibrant masterpieces in her small studio apartment, while her nights were filled with the melodies of jazz and blues. Her love for these creative outlets had taken her on many adventures throughout her life.

As a child, Audrey Elaine Ken would spend hours sketching in her notebook during class, much to the dismay of her teachers. However, it wasn't until she stumbled upon an art workshop while wandering through the streets of Tokyo that she found her true calling.

The girl's artwork was raw and unpolished, yet there was something undeniably charming about it. Audrey took the girl under her wing, offering words of encouragement and constructive feedback that helped shape her into a talented young woman.
