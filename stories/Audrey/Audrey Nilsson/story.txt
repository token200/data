Audrey Nilsson sat alone in her small, cluttered studio apartment, surrounded by scraps of paper, half-finished canvases, and the faint scent of paint. As an artist, she had always been drawn to the darker corners of life, and her paintings often reflected that.

As a child, Audrey had been fascinated by the strange and unknown. She spent hours poring over dusty old books in her parents' library, devouring tales of ghostly encounters and supernatural events. Her love of the macabre only intensified as she grew older, leading her to become an artist specializing in haunting landscapes and eerie portraits.

Audrey's latest piece, "The Shadows Within," was nearing completion. It depicted a young woman trapped in a world of twisted branches and gnarled roots, her eyes black as coal, and her skin deathly pale. The colors were muted, with hints of crimson and gold that seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy.

As she worked on the final details, Audrey felt a presence in the room. At first, she thought it was just her imagination playing tricks on her, but then she heard a faint whispering in her ear. The words were indistinguishable, but the voice sent shivers down her spine.

She froze, her brush hovering above the canvas. Slowly, the whispers grew louder, until Audrey could make out a single phrase: "You should not have looked." Suddenly, the lights flickered and died, plunging the studio into darkness.

Audrey's heart pounded as she frantically reached for the nearest candle. When the flame illuminated her face, she saw that her eyes had changed. They were no longer her own â€“ they were black as coal, just like the subject in her painting.

In a daze, Audrey stumbled out of the studio and into the night air. The world seemed to tilt and distort around her, as if reality itself was unraveling. She wandered aimlessly through the streets, unable to shake the feeling that she was being pulled back to her canvas.

Eventually, Audrey returned to her apartment, exhausted and shaken. As she looked down at her hands, she saw that they were still her own, but a faint residue of paint remained on her skin. The message was clear: "You should not have looked."
