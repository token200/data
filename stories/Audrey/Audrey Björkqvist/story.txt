Audrey Björkqvist was a Swedish singer-songwriter known for her captivating stage presence and emotive lyrics. Born in Stockholm, Sweden, she began writing songs at a young age, inspired by the likes of Joni Mitchell and Bob Dylan.

After releasing several independent EPs, Audrey's big break came when she was discovered by a prominent record label scout at one of her local gigs. The label offered her a recording contract, and she quickly set to work on her debut album, 'Winter's Requiem'.

The album's lead single, 'Frozen Tears', became an instant hit, with its haunting melody and poignant lyrics capturing the hearts of listeners across Europe. Audrey's unique voice, which seemed to evoke both sadness and hope at the same time, drew comparisons to other great female vocalists.

Her rendition of 'Wildflower', a song she wrote specifically for the occasion, brought the crowd to its feet, with many wiping away tears as they sang along.
