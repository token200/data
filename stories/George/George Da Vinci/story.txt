One day, while strolling through the bustling streets of Florence, George Da Vinci (as he preferred to be called) stumbled upon a young apprentice, struggling to finish a painting. Without hesitation, he took the brush from the boy's hand and added a few delicate strokes, transforming the entire canvas. The apprentice watched in awe as George's hands moved with precision, infusing life into the artwork.
