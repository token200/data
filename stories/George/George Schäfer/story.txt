George Schäfer trudged through the snowy streets, his scarf wrapped tightly around his neck to ward off the chill. As a retired detective, he had seen his fair share of winter days, but this one seemed particularly grey and bleak.

As he turned the corner onto Elm Street, he noticed a figure huddled on the sidewalk. George's instincts kicked in, and he quickened his pace towards the stranger. As he approached, he saw that it was an elderly woman, her eyes red-rimmed from crying.

"Ma'am, are you okay?" George asked gently, crouching down beside her.

The woman looked up at him, her eyes filled with a mixture of fear and desperation. "Please, you have to help me," she stammered. "They're after me."

George's mind began to race as he pulled out his phone to call for backup. But the woman's words were laced with an air of panic that made him wonder if this was more than just a simple case of theft or vandalism.

As he listened intently, George learned that her name was Frau Müller, and she had been receiving threatening letters for weeks. The messages seemed innocent enough at first – just warnings to stay away from certain places – but the tone had grown increasingly menacing.

George's years of experience told him that this wasn't your average stalking situation. There was something more sinister at play here, something that Frau Müller was too scared to confront alone.

As he led her to safety and arranged for a local shelter to provide her with temporary protection, George couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He glanced around cautiously, but the streets were quiet and still.

It wouldn't be long before he dug deeper into this case, following the trail of breadcrumbs left by Frau Müller's pursuer. And when he did, he knew that George Schäfer would stop at nothing to bring justice to those who had frightened her half to death.

For now, though, he would focus on keeping Frau Müller safe – and unraveling the tangled web of secrets that seemed to be entwining her life.
