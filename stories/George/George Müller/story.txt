It was a chilly winter evening in Bristol, England when George Müller sat by the fire, his mind consumed by thoughts of doubt and uncertainty. A young orphan, taken in by strangers who never adopted him, George had always felt like an outsider. As he delved deeper into the scriptures, he found comfort in the words of Christ: "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you" (Matthew 7:7-8).

With newfound resolve, George decided to take a leap of faith. He wrote to various wealthy individuals, pleading for support to establish an orphanage in Bristol. His letters were met with rejection after rejection, until finally, a wealthy merchant replied. The merchant donated £100 to George's cause, which was barely enough to rent a small room in the city.

Undeterred, George continued to pray and seek God's provision. He would often spend hours at prayer, fasting, and crying out to the Lord for guidance. One fateful evening, as he sat by the fire once more, he felt an unusual sense of peace settle over him. Suddenly, his mind was filled with a vision: a grand, sprawling building, where orphaned children could receive care and education.

George knew that this vision was from God, and he immediately set to work on making it a reality. With the £100 provided by the merchant, he managed to rent a small plot of land and build a humble schoolroom. Word spread quickly about George's faith and his determination to provide for those in need.

Before long, more and more individuals responded to George's pleas for support. The orphanage began to grow, as children from all walks of life came under its care. George continued to pray and seek God's provision, trusting that His ways were not our own. Through the years, he would come to receive miraculous blessings - food for his orphanage seemed to multiply itself overnight; families who had lost their children came forward with generous gifts.

Years later, when people from all over England would visit George's orphanage, they would be struck by its beauty and order. Children laughed and played in the courtyard, while older boys were learning trades that would serve them well for life. As visitors approached George's office, they would find him kneeling before his desk, his eyes closed in fervent prayer.

"I do not pretend to understand it," he would say, with a humble smile, "but I know one thing - God is good."
