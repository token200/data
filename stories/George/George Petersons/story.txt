"You're George Petersons," she said, her voice filled with excitement. "I've seen your work online. You're incredibly talented."

George Petersons blushed at the compliment and introduced himself to the woman, who turned out to be a fellow photographer. They spent the next hour talking about their shared love of photography, exchanging tips and tricks for capturing the perfect shot.
