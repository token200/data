George Rosén stepped into the crowded café, his eyes scanning the room with a mix of familiarity and disinterest. He had been to this place countless times before, but it still held a certain charm that drew him in every now and then.

As he made his way to the counter, he noticed a young woman sitting at a small table by the window, staring intently at her phone. There was something about her that caught his attention – perhaps it was the way she seemed lost in thought, or the determined look on her face.

George ordered his usual coffee and took a seat next to her, trying not to make any noise as he sat down. The woman looked up, startled, as George placed his cup down beside hers.

"Sorry about that," he said with a nod, "I didn't mean to disturb you."

The woman smiled slightly, looking him up and down before returning her gaze to her phone. "It's okay," she replied, her voice barely above a whisper. "I was just trying to figure something out."

George nodded sympathetically, taking a sip of his coffee as he waited for the woman to look away from her device once more. When she finally did, he couldn't help but notice the faint scratch on her left eyebrow.

"Accident?" he asked, curiosity getting the better of him.

The woman's eyes flicked up to meet his again, and this time, they held a glimmer of surprise before quickly looking away. "Just a little bump," she said nonchalantly.

George raised an eyebrow, sensing that there was more to her story than she was letting on. As he sat beside her in silence, watching the rain patter against the café's windowpane outside, he couldn't shake off the feeling that this chance encounter might be just what she needed – a distraction from whatever worries or doubts were plaguing her.

As they sipped their coffee together in comfortable silence, George found himself wanting to know more about this mysterious young woman. Who was she? What had led her here, and what secrets did she hide behind those piercing brown eyes? The questions swirled in his mind as the rain drummed on outside, but for now, he was content to simply be there for her, a gentle presence amidst the bustle of the café.

As they finished their drinks and prepared to part ways, George leaned over and scribbled down a small note on a napkin. "If you ever need someone to talk to," it read, "I'm just down the street." The woman smiled once more before taking her leave, leaving George with only his coffee-stained napkin and the faint memory of those piercing brown eyes staring back at him.
