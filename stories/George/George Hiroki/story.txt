George Hiroki was known for his quick wit and sharp tongue, but beneath his tough exterior lay a heart of gold. As a retired detective, he had spent years solving cases and uncovering secrets, but now he was content to spend his days fishing on the lake and tending to his garden.

Despite his peaceful demeanor, George's past was not without its scars. Growing up in the rough neighborhood of Willow Creek, he had learned early on to rely only on himself. His parents had passed away when he was just a teenager, leaving him to fend for himself from a young age. But it was this same determination that had driven him to become one of the top detectives in the city.

As he sat on his porch, watching the sun set behind the trees, George's mind began to wander back to some of his most notable cases. There was the time he solved the murder of the reclusive millionaire, or the string of burglaries that had plagued the upscale neighborhood just a few blocks away from his own home.

But one case still haunted him to this day: the disappearance of young Sarah Jenkins. She had been a promising student at George's alma mater, and her parents had implored him to find out what had happened to their daughter. Despite his best efforts, she was never found, and George had been left with a nagging feeling that he had missed something crucial.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, George stood up and headed back into his house. He poured himself a glass of whiskey and sat down at his desk, surrounded by photos and mementos from his time as a detective. His wife, Yumi, looked up from her book and smiled at him. "You're still thinking about that case, aren't you?" she asked.

George nodded, taking a sip of his drink. "I never forget," he said quietly. "It's who I am."
