George Jhih-hao, or "Georges" as his friends called him, was a quiet and introspective man in his late 30s. He worked as an architect in Taipei, designing buildings that seemed to blend seamlessly into the city's ancient landscape. Despite his reserved nature, Georges had a passion for traditional Taiwanese crafts and was known among his colleagues for his intricate wood carvings.

One day, while working on a project in the heart of old Taipei, Georges received an unexpected visit from his grandfather, who had immigrated to Taiwan from China when Georges was just a child. His grandfather, Gong-gong, had always been close to Georges but had rarely spoken about his own past. Today, however, he seemed determined to share stories with his grandson.

As they sat in the small courtyard of the apartment building where Georges worked, Gong-gong began to speak about his childhood in southern China. He described the sounds of the bamboo forests, the smell of jasmine tea, and the feeling of wooden boat paddles beneath his hands as he helped his father on their family's traditional craft, boat-building.

Georges listened intently, mesmerized by the vivid descriptions and the sense of longing that lingered in Gong-gong's voice. As they spoke, Georges felt a connection to his heritage that he had never experienced before. He realized that there was more to being Taiwanese than just eating night markets or watching traditional lion dances – it was about understanding the land, its people, and their history.

Over the next few weeks, Georges found himself drawn into Gong-gong's world of stories and crafts. He began taking wood carving classes at night school, and soon his hands were moving with a newfound precision, creating intricate patterns on the wood that seemed to come alive under his fingers.

As he worked, Georges felt a sense of purpose growing within him. He realized that he didn't have to choose between modernity and tradition – he could find a way to bridge the two worlds in his own unique way. With Gong-gong's guidance, Georges began to see himself as not just an architect but also as a keeper of cultural heritage, a storyteller, and a weaver of tales that would carry on through generations.

As the days turned into weeks, Georges' passion for traditional crafts continued to grow. He knew that he had found his true calling – not in designing buildings, but in preserving the stories, traditions, and cultures that made Taiwan so rich and vibrant.
