George Omar sat alone in his dimly lit office, staring at the framed photograph on his desk. It was a picture of him as a young man, standing proudly beside his father, who had passed away just a year ago. The caption read: "Dad's Boy."

George chuckled to himself, remembering the countless times he'd been told that by his friends and family. But it wasn't a nickname he deserved. He was more like his late father - a hard worker, a man of principle, and a master craftsman.

As a child, George had always been fascinated by his father's work as a skilled woodworker. He spent hours watching him shape wooden beams into beautiful furniture pieces that seemed to come alive in his hands. When his father passed away, George took up the mantle, determined to carry on his legacy.

Years of dedication and hard work had made George Omar one of the most respected furniture makers in the city. His shop was a testament to his skills - every piece he created told a story of craftsmanship, care, and attention to detail. People came from all over to commission him for custom pieces, and his business boomed.

Despite his success, George couldn't shake off the feeling that he was somehow failing his father. He worked tirelessly to ensure that every chair, table, or cabinet he created met his father's standards. But it wasn't enough; no matter how hard he tried, he felt like he'd never be good enough.

One day, as he was sanding a particularly intricate carving on a new piece of furniture, George heard a knock at the door. It was his 10-year-old nephew, Juan. The boy looked wide-eyed and curious, and George couldn't help but smile.

"Hey, cuz," Juan said, "I love looking at your pictures. What's it like making all these beautiful things?"

George looked down at his hands, feeling a lump form in his throat. It was moments like these that reminded him why he kept doing what he did - for the joy of creating something with his own two hands, not just to impress others.

"I make it because I love it," George said, looking up at Juan. "My dad taught me how, and now it's my turn to pass on the tradition."

Juan nodded enthusiastically, and George knew in that moment that he was doing okay, that he'd carried on his father's legacy with pride.
