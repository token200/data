Salvatore "Sal" Ken was a man with a reputation for being one of the most charming and cunning con artists in the city. His real name was Salvatore Antonello Ken, but to his victims, he was simply Sal. He had an uncanny ability to talk his way out of any situation, often leaving people bewildered and impressed.

Sal's latest scheme involved posing as a wealthy businessman looking for a rare artifact. He spent weeks researching the market, gathering intel on potential buyers and sellers, before finally finding the perfect mark. His target was a wealthy collector who would stop at nothing to add to his collection.

The day of the meeting arrived, and Sal put on his best suit and charm. He walked into the collector's mansion, confident that he had convinced him that he was indeed interested in purchasing the artifact. The collector, a portly man with a thick beard, greeted Sal warmly and led him to a room filled with rare treasures.

As they discussed the artifact, Sal effortlessly steered the conversation towards his own supposed wealth and influence. He spun tales of business deals gone sour and fortunes lost at sea, all while maintaining an air of suave sophistication. The collector was completely taken in, and by the end of the meeting, he had agreed to meet with Sal at a private auction house later that week.

The night before the auction, Sal received a mysterious text message from an unknown number. "Don't do it," the message read. "You're not who you say you are." Sal laughed it off as a prank, but deep down, he knew something was off. As he arrived at the auction house, he caught a glimpse of himself in a window reflection and felt a shiver run down his spine. Who was this man, really? And what secrets lay hidden behind his charming facade?

Despite his doubts, Sal put on a brave face and walked into the auction room. The game was far from over, but one thing was certain: Salvatore Antonello Ken had just taken a step closer to his ultimate downfall.
