In the sweltering summer of 1490, Salvatore Visconti, Duke of Milan, strolled through the bustling streets of his city, taking in the sights and sounds of his vibrant metropolis. As he passed by the grand cathedral, its imposing structure seemed to whisper secrets of power and intrigue that only a true leader like Salvatore could understand.

Salvatore, the nephew and successor of his late uncle, Gian Galeazzo Visconti, had been at the helm of Milan for nearly five years now, navigating the treacherous waters of European politics with ease. His cunning mind and ruthless ambition had earned him a reputation as one of the most feared and respected leaders in Italy.

As he entered the palace, Salvatore was greeted by his loyal advisor, Francesco del Carretto. The old man bowed low, his eyes locked onto Salvatore's with an air of reverence. "Your Excellency, the French ambassador has arrived, bearing gifts and pleasantries," Francesco announced, his voice low and measured.

Salvatore's gaze narrowed as he considered the implications of this unexpected visit. He had long maintained a delicate balance between France and Italy, but a French overture could potentially upset that equilibrium. He motioned for Francesco to usher in the ambassador, and the two men entered the throne room together.

The French ambassador, Maréchal de la Roche, bowed low before Salvatore, his eyes sparkling with diplomatic charm. "Your Excellency, it is an honor to serve you," he declared, producing a lavish gift of golden statuettes from his cloak.

Salvatore's expression remained stoic as he accepted the gift, his mind racing with calculations and counter-calculations. He knew that this was no mere gesture of goodwill; rather, it was a subtle attempt to curry favor and gain leverage in their respective trade agreements. With a polite smile, Salvatore thanked Maréchal de la Roche, but his thoughts were already turning to the next move in the grand game of power.

As the French ambassador departed, Salvatore turned to Francesco with a calculating gaze. "What do you make of this visit, Francesco?" he asked, his voice low and measured. Francesco hesitated before responding, "Your Excellency, I believe it is an attempt to undermine your position in Italy...but perhaps we can turn the tables on them."

Salvatore's eyes gleamed with excitement as he nodded in agreement. The game was far from over; in fact, it had just begun.
