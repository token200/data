Salvatore "Sal" Schulz was a man with a passion for music that rivaled his love for adventure. Growing up in the bustling streets of Little Italy, New York City, Sal's family owned a small record store where he spent countless hours surrounded by vinyl records and eclectic tunes.

As a young boy, Sal would often sneak into the store after closing time to practice playing the trumpet he had inherited from his grandfather. The melodic sounds of Louis Armstrong and Miles Davis filled the narrow aisles, transporting him to a world of possibility. When Sal's mother finally caught on to his nocturnal truants, she surprised him by allowing him to join the local jazz band.

Years went by, and Sal's talents flourished under the guidance of his mentor, Max Wellington. As Salvatore Schulz (or "Sal" as he was known among friends), he became an integral part of the city's vibrant music scene. His trumpet solos could bring a crowd to its feet, and his soulful voice added depth to any performance.

But Sal's restless spirit eventually led him to leave the familiar comforts of Little Italy behind. He took on a new identity, one that would allow him to roam free and create music from the heart. This was when he started going by "Sully," a moniker chosen for its wildness and freedom.

With his trumpet case slung over his shoulder, Sal (now Sully) set out on a journey across America, soaking up the sounds of cities past and present. From the blues bars of the Deep South to the folk clubs of the Pacific Coast, he played wherever music needed him most.

It was during one such gig in a rundown coffee shop in rural Oregon that Sully first felt the weight of his true identity. His eyes met those of an elderly woman in the audience, who smiled knowingly at his name – Salvatore Schulz – etched on the back of his trumpet case. In that instant, the past and present merged into one; he realized that no matter where life took him, a part of Sal would always remain with the family and community he had left behind.

And so, Sully continued to play, the melodies carrying not just his name, but the memories of those who loved him back in Little Italy.
