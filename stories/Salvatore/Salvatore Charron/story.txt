Salvatore Charron stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the bustling streets of Paris. His piercing green eyes scanned the crowded café, searching for a familiar face. It had been months since he'd received word from his old acquaintance, Étienne Dumont, and Salvatore was eager to reconnect.

As he waited in line, sipping on a warm coffee, Salvatore's mind wandered back to their last meeting. He recalled the way Étienne's laughter echoed through the narrow streets of Montmartre, and the way his eyes sparkled with mischief as they hatched a plan to infiltrate the infamous art dealer's gallery.

Salvatore pushed open the door to the café, and was immediately enveloped in the warm aroma of freshly baked croissants. He spotted Étienne sitting at a corner table, sipping on a glass of red wine. Salvatore made his way over, flashing a charming smile as he slid into the seat across from him.

"Étienne, mon ami," Salvatore said, extending a hand in greeting. "It's been far too long."

Étienne's eyes crinkled at the corners as he grasped Salvatore's hand. "Salvatore Charron! I knew it was only a matter of time before you showed up on my doorstep. Or rather, my café."

The two old friends spent the next hour reminiscing about their past exploits and sharing stories of their current lives. Salvatore learned that Étienne had recently acquired a rare collection of Impressionist masterpieces, which he planned to auction off at a high-stakes gallery event.

As they parted ways, Salvatore felt a thrill of excitement at the prospect of getting involved in Étienne's next adventure. He knew that with his cousin's cunning and his own expertise in forgery, they would be unstoppable.

"Until next time, Étienne," Salvatore said, as he stood to leave. "Let us make this auction one for the ages."

Étienne chuckled, a glint of mischief dancing in his eye. "I wouldn't have it any other way, mon ami. The game's afoot once more."
