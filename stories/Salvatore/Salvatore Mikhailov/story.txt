Salvatore Mikhailov stepped out of the crowded train station and onto the bustling streets of Manhattan. As he made his way through the throngs of people, his eyes scanned the surroundings, taking in the towering skyscrapers and neon lights that seemed to pulse with energy.

A former KGB agent turned freelance investigator, Salvatore Mikhailov had seen his fair share of danger and deception. But despite the risks, he couldn't help being drawn to the thrill of the unknown. With his sharp mind and quick wit, he had built a reputation as one of the city's most skilled private eyes.

As he walked, Salvatore's thoughts turned to his current case: a missing persons report involving a young woman named Sophia. Her family was frantic with worry, and Salvatore aimed to find her before it was too late. He pulled out his phone and dialed the number of an old acquaintance, who just happened to have information about Sophia's last known whereabouts.

"Salvatore Mikhailov?" a voice answered on the other end of the line. "I think I can help you with that case."

"Who is this?" Salvatore asked, his eyes narrowing slightly as he tried to gauge the stranger's motives.

"My name is Victor," the voice replied. "And I have reason to believe Sophia was seen with a man named Marcus at a nightclub downtown last night."

Salvatore's ears perked up at the mention of Marcus' name. He had heard rumors about the enigmatic figure, who was said to be involved in some shady dealings. But Salvatore wasn't one to judge; he just needed to get to the bottom of things.

"Tell me more," Salvatore urged Victor, his mind racing with possibilities.

Victor hesitated before speaking up again. "I'll meet you at the club at 9pm. And Salvatore?"

"Yes?" Salvatore replied, his eyes locked on the street ahead.

"Don't trust Marcus Mikhailov's story."

Salvatore's heart skipped a beat as he processed the warning. It seemed Victor had stumbled upon something much bigger than just a simple missing persons case.
