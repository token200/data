Salvatore Zarina stepped into the dimly lit tavern, the smell of stale beer and worn leather enveloping him like a familiar cloak. As he made his way to the bar, the patrons cast him sideways glances, their eyes lingering on the intricate tattoo of a snake coiled around his right bicep.

Salvatore Zarina had earned a reputation for being a man with few words and many scars. His rugged features and piercing green eyes seemed chiseled from the same granite as the mountains that dotted the landscape beyond the tavern's walls. Few people dared to ask him about his past, but those who did often found themselves bound to the charismatic Salvatore Zarina by an unspoken oath of loyalty.

As he ordered a whiskey and slid onto a stool at the bar, the bartender – a gruff old man with a scruffy beard and a missing eye – nodded in recognition. "The usual, Salvatore," he said, pouring a generous shot into his glass. "We haven't had many strangers pass through here lately."

Salvatore Zarina sipped his drink, surveying the room with a practiced air of indifference. He knew every face that came and went from this tavern – the blacksmith who complained about the state of the town's armorers, the young widow who sold hand-woven blankets to support her children, and the burly woodsman who regaled the patrons with tales of his forest exploits.

One person caught his eye – a young woman with skin as pale as moonlight and hair as dark as the night sky. She sat alone at a corner table, nursing a cup of ale that seemed almost forgotten. Salvatore Zarina's curiosity was piqued; he felt an inexplicable pull towards her, as if the very fabric of fate had brought them together.

With a quiet deliberation, Salvatore Zarina slid off his stool and strode over to the young woman's table. "Mind if I join you?" he asked, his voice low and smooth. The woman looked up at him with eyes that seemed to hold a thousand secrets – and Salvatore Zarina knew in that moment that their lives were about to become irrevocably entwined.
