Salvatore Fliesbach stepped out of his worn leather jacket and onto the creaky wooden floorboards, his scuffed boots making a faint squeak. He had always been drawn to this place - the old dive bar in the heart of Brooklyn where he'd found solace among the whiskey-stained patrons.

Fliesbach took a seat at the bar next to Vinnie "The Bull," who eyed him with a mix of curiosity and disdain. It was a look Fliesbach knew all too well, one that said "You're trouble." But it was also one he'd grown accustomed to over the years.

As he signaled for a whiskey, the bartender, an old-timer named Sal, slid a glass down the counter with a nod. "The usual, Sal?"

"Whiskey's not my game no more," Fliesbach said with a wry smile, "but I'll take it anyway."

Vinnie snorted, raising an eyebrow. "You're getting soft, Salvatore. You can't still drink like that and expect to stay sane."

Fliesbach chuckled, his eyes glinting with amusement. "I've got news for you, Vinnie - I'm not 'soft.' I'm just...seasoned. Like a fine whiskey, which I'll have the pleasure of sipping on my final night here."

Vinnie's expression turned grave, and Fliesbach knew he'd hit a nerve. The old man was struggling to keep up appearances, just like Fliesbach himself.

As the night wore on, the bar emptied out, leaving only Fliesbach and Vinnie. They sat in silence for a while, each lost in their own thoughts. Finally, Vinnie spoke up.

"You know, Salvatore...I don't know what I'd do without you."

Fliesbach's eyes softened, and he reached out to clasp Vinnie's massive hand. "You'll find someone else, buddy. Someone who doesn't leave a trail of broken hearts and shattered dreams in their wake."

Vinnie laughed, a deep rumble that shook his shoulders. "I doubt it, Salvatore. You're one of a kind - the real deal."

As the night drew to a close, Fliesbach leaned back in his chair, feeling the familiar sting of fatigue creeping up on him. He knew it was only a matter of time before he couldn't make it out of this place anymore.

But as long as Vinnie had him around, Fliesbach knew he'd never truly leave. The old man had become his family - flawed and worn, but true nonetheless. And in the world of Salvatore Fliesbach, that was enough.
