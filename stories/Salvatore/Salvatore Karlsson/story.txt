Salvatore Karlsson was a man of few words, but when he spoke, people listened. As a former journalist turned private investigator, he had a knack for getting to the bottom of things that others couldn't.

It was a typical Wednesday morning when Salvatore Karlsson received a visit from his old colleague, Detective James. The detective was frazzled, as usual, and looked like he hadn't slept in days.

"Salvatore, I need your help," James said, plopping down into the chair across from him. "I've got a case that's got me stumped. Some wealthy businessman has gone missing, and all I can find is a cryptic message on his phone."

Salvatore raised an eyebrow. "A message? What does it say?"

James hesitated before answering. "It says 'They're watching'. That's all. But the weird thing is, the phone was last used in your area code."

Salvatore's eyes narrowed. This was starting to sound interesting.

He began by reviewing the businessman's background, looking for any connections to Salvatore Karlsson's own life. It wasn't long before he stumbled upon a surprising link: the missing businessman had been involved in some shady dealings with one of Salvatore's old sources.

As he dug deeper, Salvatore found himself entangled in a web of deceit and corruption that went all the way to the top. He was getting close to something, but he couldn't quite put his finger on what it was.

Just as he was about to give up for the day, Salvatore received another call from an unknown number. It was the businessman's phone again, this time with a new message: "Meet me at the old warehouse at midnight. Come alone."

Salvatore Karlsson knew that look in his eye all too well. He had been there before, and it never ended well.

He decided to take a chance and attend the meeting, hoping to uncover more clues. As he walked into the abandoned warehouse, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched â€“ which, of course, matched the cryptic message on the phone.

The game was afoot, and Salvatore Karlsson was ready to play.
