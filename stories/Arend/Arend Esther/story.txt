Arend Esther stood at the edge of the tranquil lake, her slender figure silhouetted against the vibrant sunset. The water's glassy surface reflected the colors of the sky – oranges, pinks, and purples – like a canvas painted by nature itself.

As she breathed in the crisp evening air, Arend felt a sense of peace wash over her. It was moments like these that reminded her why she had left the city behind, seeking solace in this small town on the shores of the lake. The world had been too loud for her, too full of noise and distractions.

Arend's thoughts drifted to her family – her parents, who had passed away when she was young; her brother, who lived in the city and worked as a marketing executive; and her sister, who had stayed in this town after high school. They were all scattered, but they would meet up here every summer for their annual gathering.

As Arend gazed out at the lake, memories of those long-ago days began to flood her mind – carefree laughter, warm conversations, and lazy summers spent watching the stars twinkle above. It was a bittersweet mix of emotions, tinged with nostalgia and longing.

Her gaze wandered to the old wooden pier stretching into the water, its weathered planks worn smooth by time and use. Arend's brother had built it himself when he was younger, using wood from their family's small workshop. She remembered helping him hammer nails in place, feeling the satisfying weight of each strike.

As she stood there, lost in thought, Arend became aware of a faint noise – someone whistling in harmony with the water lapping against the shore. It was her sister, Luna, singing as if to the rhythm of her heart alone.

With a smile, Arend turned and made her way toward the pier, following the sound of Luna's voice. The world seemed just a little brighter now, filled with music, memories, and the warmth of summer evenings by the lake. For in this small town on the shores of the tranquil lake, time stood still – but in its quiet beauty, Arend found solace and peace.

As the stars began to twinkle overhead, Arend joined her sister on the pier, together they sat watching the sun set one last time into a night filled with promise.
