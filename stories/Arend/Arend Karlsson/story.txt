Arenda "Aren" Karlsson stepped into the bustling café, her bright blue eyes scanning the crowded room for any sign of her friend, Luna. She spotted Luna sitting in the corner, typing away on her laptop, and made her way over.

"Arenda!" Luna exclaimed, closing her laptop and opening her arms wide. "It's been ages! I've missed you."

Arenda smiled warmly and hugged her friend tightly. "I've missed you too, Luni," she replied, using the affectionate nickname only Luna used for her.

The two friends sat down at a small table by the window, sipping on steaming cups of coffee as they caught up on each other's lives. Arenda filled Luna in on her latest adventure – helping out at her family's summer camp, where she had spent countless hours as a kid. Now, as a young adult, she was eager to give back and help shape the next generation of campers.

As they chatted, a group of rowdy teenagers stormed into the café, laughing and causing a ruckus. Luna groaned good-naturedly, "Great, just what we need," before turning back to Aren. "So, how's life been treating you? Any exciting plans for the summer?"

Arenda's face lit up as she pulled out her phone to show Luna a group text from their friends – invitations to an impromptu beach party on Saturday afternoon. Her eyes sparkled with excitement as she shared the details of the outing, and Luna couldn't help but grin at her friend's infectious enthusiasm.

Just then, the café door swung open, and a charming stranger strode in, his bright smile captivating everyone's attention. Arenda noticed him lingering around their table, chatting up Luna with ease. She raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the newcomer's confidence and charisma.

Luna playfully rolled her eyes at Aren, "Ah, here comes Mr. Handsome," she teased, waving a hand dismissively. "Don't worry, he'll lose interest in five seconds."

Arenda chuckled and watched as the stranger continued to chat with Luna, completely charming her into laughing along with his silly jokes. She couldn't help but notice how natural their connection was, though – it felt like they had known each other for years.

As the afternoon wore on, the stranger excused himself, leaving Luna with an impromptu invitation to meet up later that night. Aren smiled knowingly, happy to see her friend blossom around new people, even if it meant she might have some friendly competition herself.
