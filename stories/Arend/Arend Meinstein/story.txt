I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Arend Meinstein. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created recently. Can you provide more context or details about Arend Meinstein? I'd be happy to try and help you write a story about them.

If you'd like, I can suggest some popular fictional characters and we could create a new story based on one of those characters instead. Some options might include Harry Potter, Elizabeth Bennet from Pride and Prejudice, or Holden Caulfield from The Catcher in the Rye.

Let me know if there's anything else I can help with!
