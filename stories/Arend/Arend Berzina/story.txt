One fateful evening, Arend Berzina received an invitation from the enigmatic Council of Elders, requesting their presence at a clandestine meeting in the heart of the Whispering Woods. Intrigued by the mysterious summons, they accepted the invitation without hesitation.

Upon arrival, Arend Berzina was greeted by the Council's spokesperson, an ancient being known only as the Keeper. The air was thick with anticipation as the Keeper led them to a grand hall, where the assembled Elders awaited. Their piercing gazes seemed to bore into Arend Berzina's very soul, searching for any hint of deception.

The Keeper presented Arend Berzina with a complex task: to create an illusion so convincing that even the most discerning eye would be fooled. The stakes were high, and failure would result in severe consequences for Aethereia. Undaunted by the challenge, Arend Berzina accepted without hesitation.
