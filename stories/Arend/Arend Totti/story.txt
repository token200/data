Arend Totti had always felt like an outcast among his peers. As a young boy growing up in the small town of Ravenshire, he was constantly bullied and belittled by those who didn't understand him. His unique ability to communicate with animals made him an easy target for ridicule.

But Arend never let their tormenters get the best of them. With a fierce determination burning inside, he spent every spare moment honing his skills and learning how to harness his powers. He devoured books on magic and studied the ancient art of shape-shifting.

As he entered adulthood, Arend Totti became determined to use his abilities for good. He traveled the land, helping those in need and protecting the innocent from harm. His legend grew, and people began to whisper about the mysterious figure known only as "The Wilder."

One fateful day, a group of villagers came to Arend seeking his help. A rogue dragon had been terrorizing their village, burning homes and crops with impunity. The villagers were at their wit's end, and they begged Arend to come and put an end to the beast's reign of terror.

Arend Totti knew this was an opportunity he couldn't pass up. With a deep breath, he stepped forward and confronted the dragon. To his surprise, the creature spoke to him in a voice that echoed in his mind. It told him that it was once a noble guardian, but had been twisted by dark magic.

Arend Totti listened intently, sensing an opportunity to redeem the beast. He reached out with his mind, connecting with the dragon's troubled spirit. Slowly but surely, he coaxed the creature back onto the path of righteousness.

With the dragon now freed from its curse, Arend Totti watched as it transformed into a magnificent creature that spread its wings and soared into the sky. The villagers cheered, grateful for their savior. And Arend Totti smiled, knowing that his work was far from over. He would continue to roam the land, using his powers to protect those in need â€“ as Arend Totti, the Wilder.
