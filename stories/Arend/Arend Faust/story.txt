Arend Faust was a man shrouded in mystery, with a reputation that preceded him wherever he went. Some said he was a cursed soul, doomed to wander the earth in search of redemption, while others whispered that he was a devil himself, bound to the service of the underworld.

The truth, as is often the case, lay somewhere in between. Arend had once been a mortal man, living a life filled with passion and purpose. He had loved deeply, lost equally, and had thought that death would bring him peace. But fate had other plans.

After a fatal accident, Arend's soul was torn from his body and sent to the underworld, where he was forced to negotiate with the devil himself, Mephistopheles. The deal was simple: in exchange for sparing Arend's life, Mephistopheles would grant him a new existence - one that would last for centuries.

At first, Arend was overjoyed at the prospect of living on. He reveled in his newfound immortality, exploring the world and learning all its secrets. But as the years passed, he began to feel like a ghost, haunting the fringes of human society. People saw him, but they didn't see him - they just sensed that something was off about him.

Arend's existence became a series of lonely encounters, fleeting relationships that ended as abruptly as they had begun. He tried to form attachments, but he always felt like an outsider looking in. His emotions were dulled, his heart hardened by the weight of centuries spent watching civilizations rise and fall.

One day, Arend stumbled upon a young woman named Sophia, who was struggling to make ends meet on the streets. She saw something in him that no one else did - a glimmer of humanity, a spark of vulnerability. For the first time in centuries, Arend felt like he could breathe again.

As he got to know Sophia, Arend began to question his deal with Mephistopheles. Was immortality really worth losing himself? He started to see the world through Sophia's eyes - bright and bold, full of hope and possibility. For a moment, he dared to dream that maybe, just maybe, there was more to life than the endless expanse of time.

But as with all things, fate had other plans. Mephistopheles appeared one fateful night, his presence like a cold wind on Arend's skin. "You have forgotten your deal," he hissed, his voice like a serpent in the grass. Arend was forced to choose: give up Sophia and continue living for eternity, or risk everything to be mortal once more.

With a heavy heart, Arend made his decision. He chose to leave behind the only thing that had ever truly mattered - himself. And as he walked away from Mephistopheles' grasp, he knew that his eternal existence was finally at an end.
