Arend Sánchez-Gijón was known for his striking good looks and razor-sharp wit. A renowned psychologist, Arend had spent years studying the human mind, delving into its depths to understand what made people tick. His patients adored him, not just for his empathy but also for his ability to make them laugh.

One sunny afternoon, as Arend was walking through the park, he noticed a young girl sitting on a bench, staring blankly at the ground. Her eyes were sunken, and her skin looked pale. Something about her drew Arend in. He sat down beside her, introducing himself with a warm smile.

"Hello there, I'm Arend Sánchez-Gijón," he said gently. "What's your name?"

The girl hesitated before answering, "I-I don't have one."

Arend's expression softened. "That's okay, my dear. We can start anew then." He pulled out a notepad and pen from his pocket and began to sketch the girl's profile.

As they talked, Arend discovered that her name was Lily. She had lost her family in a tragic accident a few months ago and had been living with her elderly neighbor ever since. The isolation and loneliness were taking their toll on her young heart.

Arend listened attentively as Lily shared her story, offering words of comfort whenever she needed it. He wrote notes on her chart, jotting down observations about her behavior, mannerisms, and interests. His patient was a blank slate to the world, but Arend saw glimpses of a vibrant soul beneath.

Over the next few weeks, Arend visited Lily every day, engaging her in conversations, playing games with her, and even teaching her basic self-defense techniques. Slowly but surely, Lily began to blossom under his care. She started to see herself as more than just an orphan; she became a strong, capable individual.

One day, as Arend prepared to leave, Lily turned to him with tears in her eyes. "Thank you, Doctor Sánchez-Gijón," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "You've given me a reason to live again."

Arend's heart swelled with pride and affection for his young patient. He smiled warmly, scribbling a final note on her chart: "Lily has taken the first steps towards healing. Her road to recovery is just beginning."
