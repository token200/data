I must correct you that there is no public figure by the name of Detlef Bocelli. However, I believe you may be confusing them with Andrea Bocelli, a famous Italian tenor.

Andrea Bocelli was born on October 22, 1958, in Lucca, Italy. As a child, he was diagnosed with congenital glaucoma, which left him blind. Despite this, he began to learn music at the age of 12 under the guidance of his mother, who recognized his talent.

Bocelli's passion for music led him to pursue a career in singing, despite the odds against him. He went on to study at the Santa Cecilia Conservatory in Rome and later joined an opera company in Milan. His big break came when he was discovered by Pl√°cido Domingo, who became his mentor.

Bocelli's unique voice and style quickly gained international recognition, and he became one of the most celebrated tenors of all time. He has released numerous albums, performed with some of the world's top orchestras, and collaborated with artists such as Celine Dion and Sarah Brightman.

Throughout his career, Bocelli has been recognized for his philanthropic work, particularly in the area of blindness and disability rights. He has founded the Andrea Bocelli Foundation, which provides support to people with disabilities around the world.

One of Bocelli's most notable performances was at the 2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony in Moscow, where he sang "Nessun Dorma" for a global audience of millions. The performance was seen by an estimated 3.2 billion people worldwide and cemented his status as a global icon.

Despite his success, Bocelli has never forgotten his humble beginnings or the struggles he faced as a blind child. He continues to inspire audiences around the world with his music, passion, and determination.
