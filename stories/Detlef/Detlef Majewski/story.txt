Detlef Majewski, a former East German athlete, sat alone in his small flat, staring at the faded photograph on the mantlepiece. It was a picture of himself standing on the podium, his arms raised in triumph as he accepted the gold medal in the 400-meter hurdles at the 1980 Moscow Olympics.

Detlef's eyes wandered back to that moment, when the world seemed like it belonged to him. He had been a rising star in East German athletics, training tirelessly under the watchful eye of the state's sports apparatus. His natural talent and dedication had earned him numerous titles, including multiple World Championship gold medals.

But beneath the surface, Detlef was troubled. The intense pressure to perform, the constant scrutiny from his coaches and officials, and the fear of being discovered as a defecting athlete - all took its toll on his mental health.

As he gazed at the photograph, memories flooded his mind: the endless training sessions, the strict diet, the lack of personal freedom. Detlef's eyes welled up with tears, and for a moment, he felt like he was back in that stadium, running for his life, rather than living his own.

Detlef had defected to the West three years ago, leaving behind everything he knew - his family, his friends, his country. The process of adjusting to a new life was slow and painful, but with each passing day, he felt a sense of liberation he never experienced in East Germany.

He thought about his wife, who had stayed behind in East Berlin, still loyal to the state's ideals. Detlef wondered if she would ever understand why he had left, why he couldn't stay in a country that demanded everything from him. The pain of leaving her was a wound that still lingered.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting his flat in a warm orange glow, Detlef finally spoke aloud to himself, as if addressing an old friend: "You made the right choice."
