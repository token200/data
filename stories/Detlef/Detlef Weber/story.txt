Detlef Weber was known for his unassuming demeanor and no-nonsense approach to life. As the director of the Berlin Museum of Antiquities, he spent most of his days surrounded by ancient relics and dusty tomes. Despite his serious demeanor, Detlef had a wicked sense of humor that often caught people off guard.

One day, while leading a tour group through the museum's Egyptian collection, Detlef's eyes landed on a particularly fascinating exhibit - a well-preserved mummy with a mischievous grin plastered on its face. As he began to explain the significance of the artifact to the tourists, he couldn't help but crack a smile.

"Ah, this particular mummy," Detlef said, "is believed to have been placed in the tomb by the pharaoh himself. Can you imagine the scolding he would have given to his poor wrangler if they'd managed to get it wrong?" The group erupted into laughter at the absurdity of the situation.

Detlef's colleagues often teased him about his love of bad puns, but Detlef didn't mind. He took pride in being able to make even the most mundane topics interesting and engaging. As he continued the tour, he regaled the group with stories of ancient mythology and the history behind various artifacts on display.

As the day drew to a close, Detlef's assistant approached him with a concerned look on her face. "Detlef, have you seen the latest grant proposal from Dr. Müller? We need to get it reviewed by tomorrow."

Detlef nodded curtly, his expression turning serious once again. But as he walked back to his office, he couldn't help but chuckle to himself about the mummy's mischievous grin. After all, even in the world of academia, a little bit of humor could go a long way.

As Detlef sat down at his desk to begin reviewing the grant proposal, he caught a glimpse of the mummy on display through the window. He smiled wryly to himself, thinking that maybe Dr. Müller's proposal wasn't so bad after all - it was just like trying to wrangle an ancient Egyptian mummy: sometimes, it took a bit of finesse and a lot of humor to get it right.
