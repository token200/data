Detlef Ernani was known for his unorthodox approach to detective work. A man in his late 50s with a wild shock of white hair and a bushy mustache, he had a reputation for being one step ahead of the game. His latest case was no exception.

A wealthy businessman had gone missing, leaving behind only a cryptic message on his phone: "The answer lies in the shadows." Detlef Ernani's eyes narrowed as he studied the words. This was more than just a simple kidnapping; it was a puzzle waiting to be solved.

As he delved deeper into the case, Detlef Ernani discovered that the missing businessman had been involved in some shady dealings. He had made many enemies along the way, and it seemed unlikely that anyone would go to such great lengths to keep him silent.

Undeterred, Detlef Ernani began to investigate. He spent countless hours poring over financial records, interviewing witnesses, and following leads. His eyes scanned the streets of the city, searching for any sign of clues. And then, one night, he saw it: a figure lurking in the shadows, watching him.

Detlef Ernani's instincts kicked in, and he swiftly followed the figure, his heart pounding in his chest. He ended up at an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town, where he found himself face to face with none other than the missing businessman himself.

But something was off. The man looked...different. His eyes seemed sunken, his skin pale. Detlef Ernani's grip on his arm tightened as he realized that this was no ordinary case.

"Who are you?" Detlef Ernani demanded, his voice firm but controlled.

The businessman hesitated before speaking in a low, raspy voice. "I'm the man who knows too much," he whispered.

Detlef Ernani's eyes locked onto his, understanding dawning on him. This was more than just a kidnapping; it was a conspiracy that went all the way to the top. And Detlef Ernani was now at the center of it all.
