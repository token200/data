One fateful evening, as Boleslaw was celebrating a major victory in a high-stakes deal, he received an unexpected visit from his childhood friend, Martynas. Over cups of coffee, they reminisced about old times and shared stories of their respective journeys. Martynas was amazed by the transformation of the young man he once knew into the renowned financier he had become.
