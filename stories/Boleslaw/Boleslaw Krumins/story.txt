As the morning progressed, a young couple entered the store, browsing through the various artifacts on display. Boleslaw Krumins greeted them warmly and offered his assistance in finding something specific. They asked about an antique music box they had seen advertised online, but couldn't quite recall where it was from. Boleslaw Krumins listened attentively, taking note of every detail.

After some discussion, he revealed that the music box in question was actually a rare 19th-century Polish piece, which he happened to have in his collection.
