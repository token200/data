As the youngest son of the powerful Visconti family, he had grown up surrounded by intrigue and deception. His parents, Giovanni and Bianca, had instilled in him the importance of cunning and strategy, skills that would serve him well in the cutthroat world of medieval politics.

Bolesław Visconti stopped at a small tavern, where he knew the owner would provide him with valuable information. The old man nodded as Bolesław took a seat, his eyes locked on the younger man's face. "I have news of the Medicis," he whispered. "They are planning to challenge your family's claim to power."

Bolesław's expression remained impassive, but inside, a fire burned. He knew that this was his chance to strike back and reclaim what was rightfully his. With a quiet smile, he thanked the old man and disappeared into the night, his mind already racing with plans for revenge.
