Bolesław Kovács sat alone at the bar, nursing a whiskey on the rocks as he stared out into the rain-soaked night. A retired detective, he had spent decades solving crimes and unraveling mysteries, but now his mind was consumed by memories of his past cases.

As he sipped his drink, Bolesław's thoughts turned to one particular case that still haunted him - the murder of a young woman named Sophia. She had been found dead in an alleyway, her body bearing strange markings that hinted at a cult-like ritual. Despite Bolesław's best efforts, the killer had never been caught.

As he pondered the unsolved case, the bartender, a gruff but kind man named Ivan, approached him. "Bolesław, you're thinking about Sophia again, aren't you?" he asked, his voice low and sympathetic.

Bolesław nodded, feeling a lump form in his throat. Ivan poured him another shot of whiskey without being asked. "You know, I've been going over the case files in my head," Bolesław said, trying to shake off the nostalgia. "I'm starting to think I missed something."

Ivan leaned against the bar, his eyes clouding with concern. "Bolesław, you've solved so many cases, but Sophia's remains have always stuck with you. It's not uncommon for cases like that to haunt a person."

Bolesław took another sip of his drink, feeling the burn all the way down. "I wish I could have found out who did it," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

As the night wore on, Bolesław continued to ruminate on the case, but Ivan's words had struck a chord within him. Maybe it was time to re-examine the evidence, to look for clues that had previously gone unnoticed. As he left the bar and stepped into the rainy night, Bolesław Kovács felt a spark of determination ignite within him. He would not rest until Sophia's memory was avenged.
