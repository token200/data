As she waited in line, she fidgeted with her phone, scrolling through social media to catch up on the latest news. Her long, curly brown hair bounced with each step as she made her way to the counter.

"Hey, Boleslaw! How's it going?" asked the barista, a friendly smile spreading across his face.

Boleslaw smiled back, "Just getting my caffeine fix for the day. I need it to tackle this project at work."

The barista nodded knowingly and began brewing her favorite coffee drink. As she waited, Boleslaw took a seat by the window, lost in thought. Her mind was preoccupied with the upcoming art show, where she would be showcasing some of her paintings.
