Saara Yu's eyes fluttered open, and she was met with an unfamiliar ceiling. She tried to sit up, but a wave of dizziness washed over her, forcing her back onto the pillow. Her memories were hazy, but she recalled being in a car accident and waking up in this hospital room.

A soft voice interrupted her thoughts. "Hello, Saara? Can you hear me?"

Saara turned her head to see a kind-faced nurse standing beside her bed. She nodded weakly.

The nurse smiled. "I'm Nurse Kim. I've been taking care of you since the accident. You were in a coma for several weeks."

Saara's mind was foggy, but she tried to piece together what had happened. The police officer at the scene told her that her car had skidded off the road and crashed into a tree.

As Nurse Kim began to explain the extent of Saara's injuries, she winced in pain. Her ribs were broken, and her left leg was badly bruised. But it was her memories that still lingered, taunting her with fragmented images of her past life.

Nurse Kim handed Saara a cup of water, which she sipped cautiously. "You're going to be okay, Saara," the nurse reassured her. "You just need time and rest."

Saara's thoughts drifted back to her family – her parents and younger brother, Jax. She had been the responsible one in their household, always looking out for them. But now, they were all that she could hold onto.

As the days passed, Saara slowly regained her strength. With Nurse Kim's help, she began to piece together her past. Her memories returned in flashes – a high school prom with Jax and their friends, a birthday party with her family, a road trip to Yellowstone with her parents.

Tears streamed down her face as the memories washed over her. She had always assumed that Jax was on his summer break from college, but it turned out he was actually in Europe, backpacking across the continent.

With each passing day, Saara's gratitude grew for these small victories. Her leg healed quickly, and her memories began to solidify once more. As she looked at Nurse Kim, who had become a guardian angel of sorts during her convalescence, Saara knew that no matter what lay ahead, she would face it with courage and determination.

Jax was on his way home now – he texted as soon as the news reached him. "I'll be there soon," Saara typed back.
