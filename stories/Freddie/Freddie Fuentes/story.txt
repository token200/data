Freddie Fuentes stepped out of the worn, vinyl booth and onto the cracked sidewalk outside El Patio, his favorite bar. The neon sign above the door flickered like a tired heartbeat as he gazed out at the bustling street. It was late on a Friday night, and the place was alive with the rhythm of laughter and music.

Freddie slipped into the shadows, a habitual gesture that hid his eyes from prying gazes. He lit a cigarette, feeling the familiar burn in his fingers as he exhaled the first slow breaths. The smoke curled around him like a shroud, enveloping him in its familiar haze.

It was 1975, and Freddie was a ghost of his former self. He'd left his old life behind – the one with the girl, Maria – a lifetime ago. Now, he drifted through the city's underground scene like a phantom, invisible to most but seen by those who knew the right people.

A hand on his shoulder made him jump, and he turned to find Sofia, El Patio's owner, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "Hey, Freddie, I got a show for you tonight," she said, beckoning him inside.

The music was pulsating, like a live thing under the feet of the patrons. Freddie slipped onto the dance floor, losing himself in the beat as the world around him dissolved into nothingness. The crowd was fluid, shifting like water; he moved through it, invisible and unremarkable.

But when Maria appeared, her eyes locked onto his across the room, Freddie's heart stumbled like a broken thing. For an instant, the past came alive – memories of laughter, of nights spent driving with the windows down, of promises made and unkept. Then she turned away, vanished into the crowd like a ghost.

Freddie watched her go, his breath burning in his chest. He knew he'd never be able to catch up, not now that he was lost in this shadowy world. The music swirled around him once more, an endless vortex of sound and motion, carrying him away from Maria – and himself.

He exhaled a last, slow breath, feeling the smoke curl around his shoulders like a shroud. The neon sign above El Patio flickered on, pulsing with an otherworldly energy that seemed to resonate deep within Freddie's chest. It was his own heartbeat now – a solitary drumbeat in the city's endless night.
