Determined not to give up, Freddie decided to conduct his own investigation.

With trembling hands, Freddie opened the lid and retrieved the recipe card. It was a masterpiece, written in fine script on a piece of yellowed parchment. Freddie smiled to himself as he tucked the card into his pocket, knowing that justice had finally been served.
