Freddie Lefevre was a man with a penchant for mystery and mayhem. A skilled thief, he had made a name for himself in the high-stakes world of jewel heists and art thefts. But beneath his charming fa√ßade and quick wit, Freddie hid a secret: he was haunted by a tragic past.

Growing up on the streets of Paris, Freddie had lost his parents at a young age. He was forced to fend for himself, surviving on scraps and charm. As he grew older, he turned to crime as a way to support himself, but it wasn't until he stumbled upon a beautiful vintage watch that he discovered his true passion: collecting rare and valuable timepieces.

One night, Freddie received an invitation from the enigmatic collector, Monsieur LaFleur, to meet at a remote chateau in the countryside. The note was simple: "Come alone. Come prepared." Freddie, sensing an opportunity too good to pass up, arrived at the chateau under the light of a full moon.

Inside, he found himself face to face with a dazzling array of watches and timepieces, each one more exquisite than the last. Monsieur LaFleur greeted him warmly, his eyes twinkling with amusement as Freddie's eyes widened in awe. The two men spent hours discussing their shared passion for horology, exchanging stories and laughter like old friends.

But beneath the surface, Freddie sensed a darker energy at play. Monsieur LaFleur seemed to be hiding something, and Freddie's instincts told him that this was no ordinary meeting. As the night wore on, Freddie began to feel a creeping sense of unease, as if he had stumbled into a trap set by the collector.

Suddenly, the lights flickered and the room plunged into darkness. When they came back on, Monsieur LaFleur was gone, leaving behind only a small note with a single sentence: "Meet me at the old windmill on the outskirts of town tomorrow night at midnight." Freddie knew that he had to be careful; he had caught a glimpse of something sinister lurking in the shadows.

The next night, Freddie arrived at the windmill, his heart pounding with anticipation. As he stepped into the dimly lit interior, he saw Monsieur LaFleur waiting for him, a sly smile spreading across his face. "Welcome to my world, Freddie," he said, as the clock struck midnight.
