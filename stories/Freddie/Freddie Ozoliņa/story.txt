Freddie Ozoliņa stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station. As a detective with the Latvian Kriminal Investigation Bureau, he had seen his fair share of crime-ridden streets, but there was something about this city that felt different.

Born and raised in Riga, Freddie had always been drawn to the dark side of human nature. His years on the force had taken him from the meanest alleys to the highest echelons of society, where corruption and greed lurked around every corner.

Tonight, Freddie was on the hunt for a lead on a particularly puzzling case – a string of high-end jewelry heists that had been plaguing the city for weeks. Rumors swirled about a master thief known only as "The Phoenix," who seemed to appear out of thin air and vanish into the night with his ill-gotten gains.

As Freddie made his way through the crowded station, he noticed a peculiar figure lurking in the shadows. Tall, slender, and dressed in all black, the stranger seemed to be watching him with an intensity that made Freddie's skin crawl.

Suddenly, the stranger vanished into thin air, leaving Freddie staring at empty space. He shook his head – no pun intended – and continued on his way, determined to track down The Phoenix and put an end to this reign of terror.

Freddie spent the next few hours canvassing the city, interviewing witnesses and scouring the streets for any sign of the elusive thief. It wasn't until he stumbled upon a small, dingy pawnshop in one of Riga's lesser-known neighborhoods that he got his first real break.

The shopkeeper – an elderly Latvian man with a gruff demeanor – eyed Freddie warily as he asked about The Phoenix. "I don't know nothing," the old man muttered, but Freddie could see the faintest glimmer of recognition in his eyes.

With a gentle nudge from Freddie's elbow, the shopkeeper leaned in close and whispered, "Tell your friend...about the woman in red."

Freddie's ears perked up as he scribbled down the cryptic message. The game was afoot – or rather, the Phoenix was on fire, and Freddie Ozoliņa was hot on his heels.
