As Freddie grew older, his fascination with machines and gadgets only intensified. He spent most of his free time tinkering with old electronics and learning new skills from online tutorials. It wasn't long before he had built a small workshop in his parents' garage, filled with scraps of metal, wires, and other trinkets.

Freddie's passion for inventing eventually led him to apply for an apprenticeship at a local engineering firm. Despite some initial hesitation from the interviewer, Freddie's enthusiasm and talent won them over. He was thrilled to be given the opportunity to work alongside experienced engineers and contribute to real-world projects.

As he settled into his new role, Freddie began to take on more responsibilities, often working late hours to perfect his designs.
