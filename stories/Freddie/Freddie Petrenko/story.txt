They attended every show, no matter how obscure or challenging it may be. The band's music was not for everyone, but those who connected with it were rewarded with a rich, immersive experience.

One night, at the height of their popularity, Freddie Petrenko took to the stage at the iconic Fillmore in San Francisco.
