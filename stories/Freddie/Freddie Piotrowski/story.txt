Freddie Piotrowski was a man with a penchant for the unknown. He spent most of his free time exploring abandoned asylums, decaying mansions, and forgotten cemeteries – places where others dared not tread.

Born into a family of modest means, Freddie grew up fascinated by the strange and unexplained. As a child, he devoured books on ghost stories and urban legends, fueling an insatiable curiosity that only grew stronger with age.

As he grew older, Freddie began to realize that his fascination with the unknown was not just a passing phase. He had a knack for sensing the presence of spirits, something he couldn't quite explain but felt deeply in his bones.

One fateful night, while exploring an abandoned hospital on the outskirts of town, Freddie stumbled upon a hidden room deep within the bowels of the building. The air inside was thick with dust and the stench of decay. As he made his way through the darkness, Freddie felt an eerie presence lurking just out of sight.

Suddenly, a faint whisper echoed in his ear: "Find the patient number 314." Panic set in as Freddie realized he had stumbled upon something much bigger than himself – a hidden journal belonging to one of the hospital's former patients.

As he delved deeper into the journal, Freddie discovered that Patient Number 314 was a woman who had been subjected to brutal experiments by the hospital's twisted doctors. Her story was one of horror and resilience, a testament to the human spirit's capacity for survival in the face of unimaginable cruelty.

Freddie spent countless hours poring over the journal, learning more about Patient Number 314 and the horrors she endured. And as he did so, he began to realize that his own connection to the unknown was not just a curiosity, but a calling – a responsibility to share the stories of those who had been silenced or forgotten.

As Freddie emerged from the abandoned hospital, the journal clutched tightly in his hand, he knew that his life would never be the same. He had stumbled upon something much bigger than himself, and was determined to see it through to its conclusion – no matter where the journey might take him next.
