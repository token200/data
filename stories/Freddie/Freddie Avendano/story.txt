Freddie Avendano sat alone in his dimly lit apartment, strumming the chords on her guitar. She was a struggling artist, trying to make it big in the city. Her music was her escape, her passion, and her fire. With every note she played, Freddie felt like she was one step closer to her dreams.

As she sang softly to herself, the memories of her childhood flooded back. Growing up in a small town with a single mother, Freddie had always known that she was meant for more. She had a gift for music, and she knew it. But life had taken its toll, and now Freddie found herself lost in the city, trying to find her place.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was her best friend, Luna. "Hey, girl! I brought over some food," Luna said, setting down a plate of leftovers on the coffee table. Freddie smiled, grateful for the distraction from her thoughts.

Luna chatted with Freddie about everything and nothing, keeping her mind off her worries. As they talked, Freddie's gaze wandered to an old photograph on her shelf. It was a picture of her and her mother, taken when she was just a kid. Her mother had passed away a few years ago, but Freddie still felt her presence.

"I'm trying to write a song for you," Freddie said, looking up at Luna with tears in her eyes. "It's about moving on, but not forgetting." Luna nodded encouragingly, and Freddie began to strum the chords of a new melody. The music poured out of her like water, and she felt her mother's spirit guiding her.

As they ate and talked, Freddie felt like she was getting closer to something. It was hard to explain, but the music seemed to be taking her places she'd never been before. She knew that with every note, she was one step closer to finding herself. And as she looked at Luna, she knew that she wasn't alone in this journey. With her friend by her side, Freddie felt like she could conquer anything.
