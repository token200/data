This was the score he had been waiting for.

Without hesitation, Freddie slipped into position, his fingers dancing across the security camera feeds as he mapped out a clear path to Thompson's vault. A satisfying smile spread across his face as he worked, his focus laser-sharp. As the clock struck midnight, Freddie slipped into the penthouse, his eyes locking onto the prize.
