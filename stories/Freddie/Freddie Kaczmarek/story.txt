Freddie Kaczmarek sat on his worn armchair, sipping whiskey from a dusty glass. His eyes wandered to the old clock on the mantle, its face cracked and faded like the memories that lingered in this small, rundown apartment.

He was a man with a past he'd rather forget, but one that refused to be buried. Freddie had always been the kind of guy who kept his head down, never drawing attention to himself unless it was by accident. But life had a way of throwing him curveballs, and Freddie had learned to adapt.

As he stared at the clock, memories began to flood his mind - late-night poker games with shady characters, late-night phone calls from mysterious women, and endless nights spent driving down highways with the wind in his hair. He thought of his brother, Vinnie, who'd met a tragic end on one such drive. The pain still lingered, but Freddie had long since learned to dull it with whiskey.

The door creaked open, and his old friend, Tony, slipped inside. "Hey, Freddy," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "What's the haps?"

"Just sitting here, drinking my sorrows away," Freddie replied, wincing at the familiarity of the phrase.

Tony chuckled. "That's what I like about you, kid. You're always honest." He plopped down on the couch opposite Freddie, his eyes squinting as he took in the dimly lit room.

The two men sat in silence for a moment, lost in their own thoughts. Then Tony spoke up again, "Hey, Freddy? You ever think about what happened to your brother?"

Freddie's gaze snapped back to the present. He felt a lump form in his throat, but he swallowed hard and shook it off. "What makes you ask that?" he growled.

Tony leaned forward, his eyes serious. "I know I shouldn't pry, but sometimes I think about him too. We were all young guys back then, trying to make our way. It's funny how some of those old friendships stick with us."

Freddie's expression softened, and for a moment, he allowed himself to feel the weight of his past. But as quickly as it rose, the pain receded, replaced by a sense of resolve. He would never forget Vinnie, but he wouldn't let his memories define him either.

The two men sat in silence once more, this time broken only by Tony's occasional clearing of his throat. The whiskey continued to flow, but Freddie's glass was nearly empty. He took another sip before setting it down and standing up, his movements fluid despite the weariness that crept into his eyes.

"I think I'm done for tonight," he said finally, smiling weakly at Tony.
