Freddie Jorgensen was known for his unorthodox approach to music. As the lead singer and guitarist of the indie rock band, The Whiskey Wanderers, he had a reputation for being unpredictable and passionate on stage.

Born Frederick Jorgensen, Freddie grew up in a small town in Oregon, where music was a big part of his family's history. His father was a folk musician who traveled the country playing gigs at festivals and bars.
