And then, like a needle in a haystack, he spotted her – a petite woman with piercing green eyes, her gaze locked onto his with an unnerving intensity. Arkadiusz's instincts told him she was the one – the mole he had been searching for all along.

With a calculated smile, Arkadiusz Sanchez Perez extended his hand, inviting her to join him for a drink. Little did she know, this was just the beginning of a deadly game of cat and mouse. And only time would tell who would emerge victorious.
