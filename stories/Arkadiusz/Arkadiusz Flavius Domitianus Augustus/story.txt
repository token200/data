With Arkadiusz Flavius Domitianus Augustus's guidance, she harnessed her magic, conjuring a shield of protection around them.

With renewed determination, they pressed on, ready to face whatever lay ahead. The fate of Rome hung in the balance, and Arkadiusz Flavius Domitianus Augustus knew that with Aurelia by his side, he could overcome any obstacle.
