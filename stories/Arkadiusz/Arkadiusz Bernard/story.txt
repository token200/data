Arkadiusz "Ark" Bernard was a man with a reputation. A former Polish Special Forces operative turned mercenary, he had earned his nickname for his uncanny ability to infiltrate and escape from even the most secure facilities.

It had been five years since Ark's last mission went awry, leaving him without memory of who he was or what he'd done during those tumultuous months. He now lived a quiet life in Warsaw, working as a freelance journalist to pay the bills.

One day, while researching a story on Polish intelligence agencies, Ark stumbled upon an old photograph that sparked a long-forgotten memory: his comrades from the Special Forces unit. A spark of recognition reignited within him, and for the first time in years, he felt like himself again.

Determined to uncover the truth about his past, Ark began digging into classified files and conducting clandestine interviews with former allies. It wasn't long before he received an encrypted message from a mysterious source claiming to have information on his unit's fateful mission.

The meeting was set for a remote warehouse on the outskirts of Krakow. Ark arrived alone, armed to the teeth, ready for anything. Inside, he found himself face-to-face with the enigmatic figure who claimed to know what really happened on that ill-fated day.

As they spoke in hushed tones, Ark began to unravel the web of deceit and betrayal that had been shrouded around his unit's mission. His memory started returning, fragmented but clear: the botched operation, the ambush, the escape – all came flooding back.

With this newfound knowledge, Ark realized he was no longer the same man who'd signed up for those missions years ago. He was a changed person, driven by a sense of purpose and justice. The past was still raw, but with each passing moment, he felt himself shedding the weight of his former identity like a worn coat.

The figure revealed himself to be Ark's closest friend from the Special Forces unit – now on the run for speaking out against their government's corruption. They parted ways, bound by an unspoken understanding: Ark would uncover the truth and continue fighting for those who'd been silenced.

As he walked back into the fading light of day, Ark Bernard felt a sense of purpose ignite within him once more. His past was behind him now; his future beckoned with renewed determination.
