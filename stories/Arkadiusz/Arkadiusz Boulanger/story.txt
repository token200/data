The critic was impressed by the complexity and nuance in each piece, remarking on how they reminded him of classic French patisserie. Arkadiusz's eyes lit up as he listened, knowing that this endorsement could take his career to new heights. As the critic left with a promise to write a glowing review, Arkadiusz felt an overwhelming sense of pride and accomplishment.
