Arkadiusz Majewski stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the dimly lit station. He had been on the move for weeks, ever since he'd left the city behind in search of answers. The young historian's mind was consumed by a singular question: what really happened to the enigmatic king, Kazimierz I Jagiellon?

As he collected his luggage, Arkadiusz noticed an elderly woman sitting alone at a small café table, nursing a cup of coffee. Her eyes locked onto his, and for a fleeting moment, they shared a connection that went beyond words. She beckoned him over, and Arkadiusz hesitated for a fraction of a second before surrendering to the curiosity that had driven him this far.

The woman introduced herself as Helena, a former member of the city's elite who had witnessed events firsthand during Kazimierz's reign. Over steaming cups of coffee, she began to weave a tale of intrigue and deception, hinting at dark secrets hidden behind the kingdom's ornate facade.

As they conversed, Arkadiusz noticed a peculiar item resting on Helena's lap – an intricately carved wooden box adorned with symbols he recognized from his research. The box seemed to be the focal point of their conversation, drawing him deeper into the mystery.

Helena revealed that the box contained letters penned by Kazimierz himself, written in secret when the king feared for his life. According to her story, the letters held clues about a supposed pact with an external force, one that had far-reaching consequences for Poland's future.

As Arkadiusz listened intently, he sensed Helena was hiding something – or rather, concealing the full truth behind the mysterious box and its contents. Intrigued, he pressed her further, coaxing her to reveal more about the pact she spoke of.

Helena leaned in close, her voice barely audible above a whisper: "Be careful, Arkadiusz Majewski. You're just beginning to scratch the surface of this labyrinth. There are forces at play that would want you silenced – or worse."

Arkadiusz's mind reeled as he realized the depth of the secrets Helena had shared with him. He left the station later that evening, determined to continue his search for truth, driven by a burning desire to uncover the truth behind Kazimierz I Jagiellon's disappearance and the mysterious pact that might have changed Poland forever.
