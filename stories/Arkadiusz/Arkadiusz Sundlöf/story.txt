In the dimly lit tavern, Arkadiusz Sundlöf sat alone, nursing a mug of ale. The fire crackled in the hearth, casting flickering shadows on the walls as he stared into the flames. It was a habit of his, one that had become second nature after years of solitude.

As a wandering bard, Arkadiusz had seen his fair share of battles and lost loved ones. His music was a reflection of those experiences – haunting melodies and lyrics that spoke of sorrow and longing. The patrons of the tavern had grown accustomed to his presence, but they rarely knew much about him beyond his name.

A young woman with piercing green eyes sat down beside him, her gaze fixed on Arkadiusz's instrument case. "You play well," she said softly, her voice like a breeze on a summer's day. "Your music is... haunting."

Arkadiusz turned to her, his expression guarded. Few people had ever asked about his music being haunting; most just appreciated the beauty of it. "What do you mean?" he asked gruffly.

The woman leaned in closer, her breath whispering against his ear. "I can hear the pain in your songs," she whispered. "It's like I'm seeing something behind your eyes."

Arkadiusz felt a shiver run down his spine. Few people had ever noticed that. He shifted uncomfortably, avoiding her gaze.

"Tell me," she pressed on, "what drives you to create such music? Do you have someone who inspires you?"

He sighed inwardly. No one ever asked him about that. His love for his instrument and the stories he wove with it were just that – stories. But this woman seemed different, somehow.

"Sometimes," he said finally, "when I play, I think of her."

The woman's eyes locked onto his, searching for something. "Who is she?" she asked gently.

Arkadiusz Sundlöf looked away, letting the shadows consume him once more. He did not speak of her – or anything else – with anyone who came near him.
