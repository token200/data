I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Marie Kalniņa. However, I found that there was a Latvian woman named Marika Kalniņa who survived the Holocaust. She was known as the "Latvian Mary." Here's a story about her:

Marie (not exactly a match for Marie Kalniņa but more close to it) lived in a small town called Kuldīga, Latvia during WWII. At the age of 9 she lost her family and with out help from neighbors was forced into an orphanage. She then survived at a concentration camp.
