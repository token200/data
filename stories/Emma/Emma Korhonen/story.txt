Emma Maria Korhonen was a force to be reckoned with in the world of competitive baking. As a young girl, she spent hours watching cooking shows and experimenting with different recipes in her small kitchen.

As Emma grew older, her passion for baking only intensified. She began competing in local baking competitions, where she quickly earned a reputation as a talented and innovative baker. Her creations were always visually stunning, with intricate designs and delicate flavors that wowed the judges.

After completing culinary school, Emma set out on her own, opening a small bakery in a trendy neighborhood.
