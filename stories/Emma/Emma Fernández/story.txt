Emma Fernández wiped the sweat from her forehead as she gazed out at the city skyline. As a successful event planner, she was no stranger to long hours and high pressure, but this wedding was different. This one was for her ex-boyfriend's cousin, someone she had gone to school with.

As she surveyed the chaotic scene unfolding before her eyes, Emma couldn't help but feel a twinge of regret. She had been friends with her ex in college, but their relationship had ended abruptly when he realized he wasn't in love with her anymore. He had moved on quickly, and so had she. But now, years later, they were reunited for this one fateful day.

Emma's mind wandered back to the memories of their time together. They had laughed together, explored the city, and shared countless nights spent lost in conversation. She remembered the way he used to make her laugh, the way his eyes crinkled at the corners when he smiled.

Just then, a gentle hand touched her shoulder, breaking the spell. Emma turned to see her best friend, Sofia, standing beside her with a knowing smile.

"Hey, Em?" Sofia said softly. "I think you need to take a deep breath and focus on the wedding."

Emma nodded, feeling a lump form in her throat as she took a slow inhale. She glanced around at the sea of expectant faces before her, the bride and groom beaming with happiness.

As the ceremony progressed, Emma couldn't help but notice how beautifully her ex had transformed into his current self. Gone was the awkward teenager who had broken her heart; in his place stood a confident, kind-hearted man who still carried a hint of vulnerability in his eyes.

The reception was a blur of laughter and music, with Emma playing the role of gracious guest to perfection. But as she watched the newlyweds share their first dance, something shifted inside her. She realized that perhaps this wedding wasn't about closure or moving on; it was about celebrating the love that had changed both of them for the better.

Emma raised a glass in a silent toast to the happy couple, feeling an unshakable sense of gratitude towards the past – and towards herself, for finding strength and resilience amidst heartbreak. As she made her way back to her seat, Sofia by her side, Emma smiled softly to herself, knowing that this wedding was just the beginning of a new chapter in her own life.
