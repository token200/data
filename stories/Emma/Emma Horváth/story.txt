Emma Horváth sat alone in the dimly lit café, nursing a cup of cold coffee. As she stared out the window, her mind wandered back to the events that had led her here. The small town of Bratislava was never the same after the night Emma's parents disappeared during their vacation.

At first, everyone thought it was just a typical tourist tragedy - lost and found, but with no signs of foul play. However, as time went on, whispers began to circulate about an old case that had been reopened. The investigation led to a shocking revelation: Emma's parents were not who they claimed to be.

Emma Horváth felt like her whole world was crumbling around her. She couldn't shake off the feeling of being watched, and the memories of that fateful night haunted her every waking moment. She began to question everything - her own identity, her relationships with those around her.

One day, while browsing through an old newspaper clipping, Emma stumbled upon a cryptic message scrawled in the margin: "Look for the truth in the shadows." Intrigued, she decided to dig deeper into her family's past. The more she uncovered, the more complex and twisted it became.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the café, Emma felt a chill run down her spine. She knew she was getting close to something, but what? Her eyes scanned the room, searching for answers in the faces of those around her. That's when she saw him - a stranger with piercing green eyes who seemed to be watching her every move.

"Who are you?" Emma Horváth asked firmly, trying to mask the tremble in her voice. The stranger smiled enigmatically and slid a note across the table: "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone."
