Emma Taylor stepped into the small café, scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her best friend, Olivia, already seated at a corner table, sipping on a cup of coffee. As she approached, Olivia looked up and smiled.

"Hey, Em!" Olivia exclaimed, using Emma's nickname. "I was starting to think you'd forgotten about me."

Emma chuckled and sat down across from Olivia. "Of course not, Liv! I just got caught up in work. How have you been?"

Olivia leaned back in her chair, a faraway look in her eyes. "It's been a while since we last spoke, Em. I've been dealing with some personal stuff."

Emma's expression turned sympathetic. "What's going on? You know you can tell me anything."

Olivia hesitated for a moment before speaking up. "I just feel like I'm stuck, Em. Like I don't know what I want to do with my life anymore."

Emma reached out and placed a comforting hand on Olivia's arm. "You'll figure it out, Liv. You're one of the smartest people I know."

Just then, the café door swung open and their mutual friend, Alex, walked in. "Hey, guys! Mind if I join you?"

Olivia shook her head, smiling wryly. "Please do. We were just having a existential crisis."

Alex laughed and sat down beside them. "Well, I'm happy to provide some much-needed distraction. What's the plan for today?"

As they chatted and laughed together, Emma felt a sense of gratitude wash over her. This was what friendship was all about – supporting each other through life's ups and downs.

As they parted ways an hour later, Olivia turned to Emma and said, "Thanks for listening, Em. You always know just what to say."

Emma smiled warmly, feeling happy that she could be there for her friend in need. "Anytime, Liv. That's what best friends are for."
