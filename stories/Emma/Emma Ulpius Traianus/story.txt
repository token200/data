Emma nodded thoughtfully, her mind racing with possibilities. She knew that this small moment of connection could be the key to unlocking a deeper understanding between their nations.

Over the next few days, Emma Ulpius Traianus worked tirelessly to hammer out a deal that would satisfy both Rome and Dacia. And when the negotiations finally concluded, she stood triumphant, her full name on the lips of everyone from senator to merchant girl. The young woman had proven herself once again as a force to be reckoned with in the world of politics, and her legacy would live on for generations to come.
