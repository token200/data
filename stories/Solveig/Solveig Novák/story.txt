Solveig Novák stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of her host. She had been traveling for hours, and the promise of a warm meal and a comfortable bed was starting to feel like a distant memory.

As she waited, Solveig's mind wandered back to her life in Budapest. She was a freelance journalist, always on the lookout for the next big story. But this trip was different - she had received a cryptic message from an old source that hinted at a major scandal brewing in the city.

Solveig's thoughts were interrupted by a gruff voice behind her. "You must be Solveig Novák? My name is Mihály, and I've been expecting you."

She turned to face a middle-aged man with a kind smile and piercing blue eyes. He introduced himself as a friend of her source, and led her to his waiting car.

The drive through the rolling hills was scenic but uneventful, giving Solveig time to ask Mihály about his connection to her source. "Who is he?" she asked, curiosity getting the better of her.

Mihály's expression turned serious. "Let's just say he's someone who knows a thing or two about corruption in this city. But be warned, Solveig Novák, the truth can be hard to swallow."

Solveig's journalist instincts were piqued - she had always prided herself on her ability to get to the bottom of things. She pushed open the car door and stepped out onto the pavement.

As they walked towards Mihály's apartment building, Solveig felt a thrill of excitement. This was it - the tip that would lead to her next big story. She pushed open the door and stepped inside, ready to face whatever secrets lay ahead.

For now, at least, she had a warm meal and a comfortable bed to look forward to. And with Mihály by her side, Solveig Novák felt like she was one step closer to uncovering the truth.
