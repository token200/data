But she refused to lose sight of what had brought her to music in the first place: the love of creating something true and meaningful.

She negotiated fair deals with her label and manager, using her platform to support emerging artists and advocate for musicians' rights. Her music continued to evolve and grow, incorporating elements of jazz and electronic music into its unique sound.

Despite the pressures of fame, Solveig remained committed to her art. She poured her heart and soul into every show, every song, and every project she undertook.
