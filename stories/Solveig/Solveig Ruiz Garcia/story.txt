Solveig Ruiz Garcia was a woman with a passion for art and music. Growing up in a small village in Spain, she spent most of her days playing guitar and singing traditional folk songs with her siblings. As she grew older, Solveig's love for music only deepened, and she began to explore the works of famous composers like Debussy and Ravel.

Despite her love for classical music, Solveig had a secret passion for flamenco. She would sneak into local bars and watch the dancers spin and sway to the rhythm of the guitar.

She became a sought-after performer at festivals and concerts around the world, spreading her love for flamenco and classical music to new audiences. And through it all, Solveig never forgot where she came from - the small village in Spain where her passion for music first began.
