Solveig Hansen stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the quaint station for any sign of life. She had arrived in Ravensburg, a small town nestled in the rolling hills of Norway, with a sense of trepidation and excitement. As she made her way through the crowded platform, Solveig's thoughts turned to the letter she had received from her estranged father, inviting her to join him for a summer at his lakeside cottage.

It had been years since Solveig last saw her father, but the memories of their complicated past lingered in her mind like an open wound. Her father, Erling Hansen, was a man of few words and few emotions, leaving Solveig to navigate the complexities of their relationship on her own. But something about this letter had drawn her back to Ravensburg, a place she had only visited once as a child.

As she walked towards the lakeside cottage, Solveig felt a sense of peace wash over her. The air was cool and clean, filled with the scent of pine and water lilies. She pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside, where she found herself surrounded by the familiar comforts of home. Her father sat on the couch, his eyes fixed intently on her as she entered.

"Solveig," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "It's been a long time."

Solveig smiled wryly, feeling a mix of emotions as she approached him. "Father," she replied, taking a seat beside him.

The days that followed were spent exploring the surrounding countryside with her father, fishing on the lake, and talking about everything they had left unsaid. Solveig learned more about her father's life than she ever could have imagined, and slowly but surely, she began to heal old wounds. As the summer drew to a close, Solveig knew that she would carry a piece of Ravensburg with her always, a reminder of the complicated bond she shared with her father, Erling Hansen.
