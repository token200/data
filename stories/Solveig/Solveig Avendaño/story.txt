Solveig Avendaño stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She had been searching for weeks, following every lead, every hint that might bring her one step closer to finding her sister.

It was a case like no other – Solveig's sister, María, had gone missing five years ago, leaving behind only whispers of rumors and speculation. The police had given up, but Solveig refused to let go. She had dedicated herself to uncovering the truth, pouring over every shred of evidence, every witness statement.

As she waited in line for her usual coffee, a soft-spoken voice caught her attention. "¿Puedo ayudarte?" (Can I help you?) A young woman with dark hair and piercing green eyes smiled up at Solveig.

"Gracias," Solveig replied, taking the cup from the barista's hand. She sipped her coffee, her mind racing as she took in every detail of the café's patrons. And then, it hit her – that look, familiar yet strange, was one she had seen before.

The young woman leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. "I think I know what you're looking for."

Solveig's heart skipped a beat as the woman led her to a quiet corner table. She pulled out a small notebook, flipping through its pages until she found an entry that made Solveig's eyes widen.

"Where did you get this?" Solveig asked, her voice firm but controlled.

The young woman smiled again. "I used to work at María's old workplace. I was hired as a new employee – they must have thought I was someone else."

Solveig took the notebook, scanning the pages with renewed urgency. The handwriting matched Maria's – this was it, the break she had been waiting for.

With shaking hands, Solveig called her sister's phone, and waited for the call to connect. The line crackled, but then a voice answered. Solveig's eyes locked onto the woman across from her, tears streaming down her face as María's voice replied – "Solveig? ¡Es verdad! I'm alive!"

In that moment, all the waiting, the searching, the heartache and doubt – it was worth it. For one of the most long-held questions in Solveig's life had finally been answered: her sister was alive.
