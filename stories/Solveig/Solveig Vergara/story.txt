Solveig Vergara sat alone at her kitchen table, surrounded by stacks of old photographs and yellowed letters. She stared blankly at a particular image – one of herself as a child, laughing with her Abuela in the sun-drenched hills of Cartagena. Her eyes misted over, lost in thought.

It had been twenty years since Solveig's last call to Colombia. She'd fled the memories that haunted her, seeking solace in the anonymity of New York City. Now, as she sorted through the relics of her past, she couldn't help but wonder if she'd made the right decision.

Solveig was a writer, or at least, she had been when she left. Her stories were infused with the vibrant colors and rhythms of Colombia – the scent of coffee and marigolds, the sound of salsa drums pulsating through the streets. But since her arrival in America, the words had dried up, leaving only silence.

She sighed, setting down a worn book on Carlos Vila. The poetry collection she'd written as a teenager still lingered in the minds of those who knew her best – but for Solveig herself, it was lost to time.

Just then, the doorbell rang. It was Jorge, an old friend from the university. They'd remained in touch over the years, exchanging letters and emails that spoke volumes about the lives they'd led. Jorge's smile as he entered was warm and familiar, a comforting presence amidst the dusty memories.

As they sipped coffee and talked, Solveig found herself drawn to the stories Jorge shared – of his family in Medellín, their struggles and triumphs. The conversations felt like fragments of a life she thought she'd left behind, yet somehow still belonged to her.

For the first time in years, Solveig felt the itch of creative restlessness, a desire to tap into the old wellspring of words that once flowed so freely. Perhaps, she mused, it was time to revisit Colombia – not just as a place, but as a person, reclaiming pieces of herself and weaving them back into her stories.

As Jorge departed, Solveig stood up, feeling an unfamiliar lightness in her steps. It was as if the silence had been lifted, and the music of her childhood was calling once more. She gazed at the photograph on her table – her Abuela's smile seemed to sparkle with a newfound promise: that even in exile, home could be found within the words themselves.
