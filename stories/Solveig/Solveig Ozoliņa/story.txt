Her parents, both artists themselves, encouraged her creativity, providing her with endless supplies of paints, brushes, and canvases.

Solveig's passion for art only intensified as she grew older, leading her to study fine arts at the Riga Technical University.

Viewers felt an overwhelming sense of connection to the natural world, as if Solveig had somehow captured their own life force on canvas.
