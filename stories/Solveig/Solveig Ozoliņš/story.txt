However, her parents encouraged her creative pursuits, and she spent most of her childhood lost in the pages of art books and sketching out fantastical worlds.

As she grew older, Solveig's passion for art only intensified. She enrolled in a local art school, where she honed her skills under the guidance of a talented instructor named Marika Kuzma.
