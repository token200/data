Solveig Tamm was a renowned Norwegian artist known for her captivating surrealist paintings. Born in Oslo, Norway in 1907, Solveig grew up surrounded by the stunning fjords and mountains that would later inspire some of her most breathtaking works.

As a young woman, Solveig struggled to find her place in the art world, facing sexism and marginalization at every turn. Despite these obstacles, she persevered, honing her skills as a painter and studying with some of the leading artists of her time.
