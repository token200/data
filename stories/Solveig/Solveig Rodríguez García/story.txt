Solveig Rodríguez García sat alone at her small café table, sipping a lukewarm cup of coffee. She stared out the rain-soaked window, lost in thought. Her mind wandered to the countless conversations she'd had with strangers about love and relationships.

As a renowned astrologer, Solveig was often sought after for guidance on matters of the heart. People would come from all over to hear her theories and insights into their lives. But despite her success, Solveig couldn't shake the feeling that she didn't truly understand love.

She turned her attention back to the small notebook in front of her, filled with scribbled notes and astrological charts. Her eyes landed on a particularly intriguing chart - one that seemed to hint at a deep connection between two souls. Solveig's curiosity was piqued as she began to study the chart further.

As she delved deeper into the cosmos, Solveig felt an unexpected surge of emotions. She imagined herself standing amidst a swirling vortex of stars and planets, her fingers tracing the paths of the celestial bodies. It was as if the universe itself was speaking to her, guiding her toward some hidden truth.

Suddenly, a loud bang outside caught her attention. Solveig's eyes snapped back to reality as she watched a gust of wind blow open the café door, sweeping in a drenched figure. The stranger shook the rain from their coat and made their way to Solveig's table.

"Mind if I join you?" they asked with a warm smile.

Solveig hesitated for a moment before nodding. As the stranger sat down, she felt an inexplicable sense of calm wash over her. They introduced themselves as Leo, and began to chat with Solveig about their own love life - or lack thereof.

As the conversation flowed effortlessly, Solveig found herself drawn into Leo's stories, sensing a deep longing in their words. She began to see patterns in the stars that hinted at an unrequited passion, one that would only be fulfilled by someone who truly understood the universe's secrets.

Solveig leaned forward, her eyes locked on Leo's. "I think I can help you find what you're looking for," she said with a hint of mischief.

And with that, Solveig began to weave her own brand of cosmic magic around Leo, guiding them toward the hidden truths of their heart and soul. As they delved deeper into the mysteries of the universe together, Solveig realized that maybe - just maybe - she didn't need to be the one interpreting the stars; sometimes, all it took was someone to share the journey with.
