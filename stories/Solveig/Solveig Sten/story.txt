Solveig Sten stepped into the bustling streets of Copenhagen, her bright yellow coat standing out among the drab winter attire of passersby. As she walked, her worn leather boots made barely a sound on the cobblestone pavement. A freelance journalist with a passion for storytelling, Solveig was always on the lookout for the next big story.

With her sharp mind and quick wit, Solveig had built a reputation as one of Copenhagen's most fearless reporters.

With her heart racing and her mind racing faster, Solveig Sten closed in on the mysterious businessman, ready to unravel the tangled threads of his web of deceit.
