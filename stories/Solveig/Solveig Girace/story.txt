Solveig Astrid Girace was a woman of mystery and intrigue. Her piercing green eyes seemed to bore into those she met, as if sizing them up for some unknown purpose. She was a master manipulator, with a wit as sharp as her tongue.

Growing up on the streets of Paris, Solveig had always relied on her wits to survive. As a young girl, she had learned to pick pockets and swindle from the best of them. But it wasn't until she stumbled upon an underground art collective that she found her true calling. The collective's leader, a charismatic woman named Colette, took Solveig under her wing and taught her the art of deception.

Under Colette's tutelage, Solveig honed her skills, becoming a chameleon-like figure who could blend into any crowd. She mastered multiple accents, learned to speak with ease in both French and English, and even developed a talent for mimicry. Her ability to adopt the mannerisms and speech patterns of those around her made her nearly unrecognizable.

As she rose through the ranks of the collective, Solveig became known as "La Girace," a nickname that struck fear into the hearts of their enemies. She was a ghost, always one step ahead of her pursuers. But despite her tough exterior, there was a vulnerability to her, a sense of loneliness that drove her to seek connection in all the wrong places.

One night, Solveig received an invitation to attend an exclusive masquerade ball at the Palace of Versailles. The event was rumored to be hosted by none other than the enigmatic King Louis XIV himself. Solveig's curiosity was piqued, and she accepted the invitation without hesitation. As she made her way through the palace, she couldn't help but wonder what secrets lay hidden behind the royal facade.

With a mask in hand and a smile on her face, Solveig Girace set out to unravel the mysteries of Versailles. And as the night wore on, she knew that this was just the beginning of a long and winding road of deception and intrigue.
