Solveig Farah had always been drawn to the world of ancient artifacts. As a renowned archaeologist and expert in the field of Mesopotamian studies, she had spent her entire career uncovering the secrets of the long-lost civilizations that once thrived along the Tigris River.

Born Solveig Emily Farah, she had grown up with a passion for history and adventure that only intensified as she delved deeper into her studies. Her parents, both archaeologists themselves, had encouraged her curiosity from a young age, taking her on digs in Egypt and Turkey whenever possible.

As she grew older, Solveig's expertise in Mesopotamian artifacts became increasingly sought after by museums and collectors around the world. She had spent years researching the mysterious Sumerians, uncovering clues about their mythology and daily life that no one else had ever seen before.

But it wasn't until she stumbled upon an ancient text written in cuneiform script that Solveig's career truly took off. The text spoke of a lost city deep in the heart of Iraq, hidden away for centuries and guarded by treacherous sandstorms and deadly traps.

With the help of her team of experts, Solveig set out to uncover the truth behind the text. Months of excavation followed, with Solveig leading the charge through the dusty desert landscape.
