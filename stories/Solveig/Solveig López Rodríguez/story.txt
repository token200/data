She spent her days tending to the family garden, where she coaxed vibrant flowers from the earth and tended to a small menagerie of animals.

Despite her enigmatic presence, Solveig was beloved by all who knew her. She had a way of making everyone feel seen and heard, as if their deepest fears and desires were matters of great importance to her alone. Her family adored her, with her abuela being particularly close to her.
