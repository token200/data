Solveig Mitchell stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of the stranger she had agreed to meet. It was a chilly autumn morning, and the air was crisp with the scent of wood smoke and damp earth. She wrapped her scarf tighter around her neck and set off down the main street, her boots kicking up dust on the cobblestones.

She had received a mysterious letter from an old friend, inviting her to meet in this small town that seemed to appear out of nowhere. Solveig hadn't seen her friend in years, but there was something in the letter that had stirred something deep within her - a sense of longing and disconnection.

As she walked, the buildings grew taller and the streets narrower, until Solveig found herself standing before a quaint little cottage with a garden full of wildflowers. The door creaked open, and a figure stood on the threshold, beckoning her in.

Solveig's eyes adjusted to the dim light within, and she saw that it was her friend - or at least, someone who looked uncannily like her. The woman's hair was longer, and her eyes seemed darker, but there was an unmistakable spark of familiarity.

"You're here," Solveig said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I've been searching for you."

Her friend smiled, and the two women sat down at a small table by the fire. They talked long into the night, sharing secrets and laughter, as if no time had passed at all.

As the hours slipped away, Solveig began to feel a sense of homecoming that she hadn't known in years. It was as if she had been given a second chance, a chance to rediscover herself and reconnect with a part of her soul that had long been forgotten.

But there was something else, too - a feeling that they were not alone. Solveig glanced around the room, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Yet, the sense persisted, as if uninvited guests were lurking just beyond the edge of perception.

"Who is this?" Solveig asked her friend, nodding towards the shadows.

Her friend's smile faltered, and she leaned in close. "I don't know," she whispered. "But I think we're about to find out."

The fire crackled and spat, casting eerie silhouettes on the walls as Solveig waited, her heart pounding with anticipation, for whatever was coming next.
