Solveig Jankowska stepped into the dimly lit jazz club, her eyes scanning the crowded room with a practiced air. A petite woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair, she was known for her sharp wit and quick tongue – as well as her unparalleled ability to spot a good whiskey.

As she made her way to the bar, Solveig's mind wandered back to the case that had brought her here tonight. The enigmatic jazz pianist, Henry LaFleur, had been found dead in his apartment earlier that week, with no leads and no suspects. His music was a staple of this very club, and Solveig felt an inexplicable connection to the man.

The bartender, a gruff but kind-eyed man named Joe, raised an eyebrow as Solveig ordered her usual – a double shot of fine scotch. "Still got your eye on LaFleur's killer?" he asked, his voice low.

Solveig smiled wryly, sipping her drink. "Not yet," she replied, "but I have a feeling it's only a matter of time."

As the night wore on and the music grew louder, Solveig's attention turned to a young woman sitting alone at a table in the corner – a woman with piercing blue eyes and hair as platinum as snow. There was something about this woman that tugged at Solveig's memory, though she couldn't quite put her finger on it.

She made her way over to the table, introducing herself with a warm smile. The young woman, whose name was Sophia, opened up quickly about her connection to LaFleur – they had been writing together for years, and Sophia had been devastated by his passing.

As they talked, Solveig's mind began to weave together fragments of a theory she'd been itching to test. It seemed that Sophia might not be telling the whole truth about their relationship with Henry... but was it enough to make her a suspect?

Solveig leaned in closer, her eyes locked on Sophia's. "Tell me more," she urged, her voice barely above a whisper.

Sophia hesitated for a moment before beginning to reveal a secret that would change everything – and Solveig's investigation was just getting started.
