Lucía Weber stood in front of the old, worn-out mirror, adjusting her glasses for what felt like the hundredth time that day. She was already running late for her shift at the local bookstore, and she still needed to get dressed. As a bookseller, Lucía had always been meticulous about her appearance, but today she couldn't seem to get it right.

She took a deep breath and stepped back from the mirror, surveying herself critically. Her curly brown hair was a mess, her eyes were bloodshot from lack of sleep, and her white blouse was stained with last night's tea. She sighed and headed for the closet, rummaging through her clothes in search of something presentable.

As she changed, Lucía's mind wandered to the novel she was supposed to be reading for book club that evening. She had been assigned to review it over the weekend, but she hadn't had a chance to crack it open yet. She made a mental note to grab it on her way home from work.

At the bookstore, Lucía was greeted by the familiar smell of old books and the friendly chatter of regular customers. She clocked in and began restocking shelves, her fingers moving automatically as she worked. It wasn't until one of her coworkers, Emma, approached her with a concerned expression that Lucía remembered she had a meeting with the store owner later that day.

"Hey, Lucía, you're running awfully behind schedule," Emma said, eyeing her watch. "You should probably get going soon."

Lucía nodded sheepishly and gathered her things. As she made her way to the meeting room, she couldn't help but feel a sense of dread wash over her. The store owner had been making some changes lately, and Lucía wasn't sure what to expect.

The meeting was brief but tense, with the owner discussing plans for expanding the store's online presence. Lucía listened intently, taking notes and asking questions as needed. When the meeting adjourned, she breathed a sigh of relief and headed home, eager to dive into her novel and forget about the stress of the day.

As she settled onto her couch with a cup of tea, Lucía Weber felt a sense of contentment wash over her. She picked up the book and began to read, losing herself in the words on the page. For once, she forgot all about the stresses of work and just let herself get lost in the story.
