Lucía Bierhals stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him in the corner, sipping a cup of coffee and staring intently at his phone. Lucía's gaze drifted over to the empty chair beside him, where their fingers had intertwined just yesterday.

It was a strange feeling, being alone with someone you barely knew. Yet, there was something about Lucía Bierhals that made her trust this stranger instantly. Maybe it was the way he listened attentively to every word she spoke, or the way his eyes crinkled at the corners when he smiled.

As she approached him, he looked up, catching her eye with a hint of surprise. "Hey," he said softly, his voice barely above a whisper.

Lucía took a seat beside him, running her fingers over the worn wooden tabletop. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the air, transporting her back to lazy Sunday mornings spent in her family's backyard. Her mind began to wander as she pondered what brought this person into her life now.

He offered her his cup of coffee without being asked, and Lucía hesitated for a moment before taking a sip. The bitter taste was exactly how she liked it – strong and bold, like herself. They sipped their coffee in silence, the only sound being the soft hum of the café's jazz playlist.

As they sat there, Lucía felt an inexplicable connection forming between them. It was as if time stood still outside these walls, allowing her to see glimpses of a future that might not be hers to claim just yet. Perhaps it was fate's way of nudging her towards something new – something she couldn't quite put her finger on.

Their hands touched when he accidentally knocked his cup over, spilling coffee all over the tablecloth. Lucía laughed softly as they both reached for a napkin together. The touch sent shivers down her spine; it felt like electricity had coursed through her veins once again.

Without a word, he handed her a napkin and she smiled – a gentle smile that revealed a hint of nervousness beneath the surface. It was then Lucía realized she didn't care who this stranger was or what his story was; all she needed to know was if they could find their way together in this chaotic world.

As the café's door swung open once more, the sounds of the outside world crept back into their little bubble. But for Lucía Bierhals, it didn't matter – she'd found a sense of belonging within those four walls, and that was all she needed right now.
