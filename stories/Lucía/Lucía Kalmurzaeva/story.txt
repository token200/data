She gathered her winnings with an air of triumph, her eyes glinting with satisfaction as she slipped away into the night, leaving behind a trail of mystery and intrigue. For in the world of Lucía Kalmurzaeva, nothing was ever what it seemed, and those who dared to follow her would find themselves lost in the labyrinth of her secrets.
