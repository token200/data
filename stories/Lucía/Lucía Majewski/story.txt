Lucía Majewski stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for a glimpse of the mysterious figure known only as "The Ghost." Rumors had circulated for months about a young woman with an uncanny ability to vanish into thin air. Some said she was a spirit, others claimed she was a thief. Lucía didn't care what anyone thought - all she knew was that The Ghost was the key to solving her sister's murder.

It had been two years since the night that changed everything. Lucía's sister, Sofia, had gone missing after a late-night argument with their brother. The police investigation had turned up nothing, and their family had been left with more questions than answers. That's when Lucía began her own search for the truth.

She had spent countless hours poring over Sofia's journal, searching for any clue that might lead her to The Ghost. It was a wild goose chase, but one she was determined to pursue.

As she waited in line at the counter, Lucía's eyes landed on a figure sitting in the corner - a woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. She seemed out of place among the café patrons, but there was something about her that drew Lucía in.

When it was finally her turn to order, Lucía asked for coffee and sat down at a table near The Ghost. "Mind if I join you?" she asked, trying to sound nonchalant.

The woman looked up, their eyes meeting for the first time. For a moment, Lucília felt like she was drowning in those green depths. Then, with a slight smile, The Ghost nodded and took a sip of her own coffee.

As they sat there, Lucía noticed that The Ghost seemed to be listening intently to her every word. It was as if she knew more than she let on. Suddenly, the pieces began to fall into place. This woman wasn't just any ordinary person - she was Sofia's confidante, the one who had been keeping secrets from their family all along.

With newfound determination, Lucía leaned forward and asked The Ghost a question that would change everything: "What do you know about my sister's death?"
