I couldn't find any information on a person named "Matsumoto Bocelli." However, I believe you may be referring to the Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli. 

Here's a story about him:

Andrea Bocelli was born in Lajatico, Italy, on February 22, 1958. As a child, he was diagnosed with congenital glaucoma and lost his sight at the age of twelve due to this condition. However, this setback did not deter the talented young man. He learned braille and music from the age of seven, and by sixteen, he had enrolled in the Conservatory of Music in Lucca.

Bocelli's love for music led him to form a jazz quartet with his friends at school, where they would perform on weekends and during breaks. Their popularity grew rapidly, attracting audiences from all over Italy. After graduating, Bocelli moved to Milan to pursue a career as a professional singer, and by the time he was twenty-two years old, he had won several regional singing competitions.

His big break came when he signed with Sony Music in 1992 and released his debut album, "Giorgio", which earned critical acclaim. The following year, he was invited to sing at the famous Teatro alla Scala in Milan for the first time in over a century. This moment marked the beginning of Andrea Bocelli's illustrious career as an opera singer.

Throughout his life, Matsumoto Bocelli has been recognized for his dedication to music and philanthropy. He has performed for millions of people worldwide and has collaborated with renowned artists such as Sarah Brightman and Celine Dion. With a voice that can melt the coldest hearts, Andrea Bocelli continues to inspire audiences around the world with his beautiful melodies.

From humble beginnings to international stardom, Matsumoto Bocelli's remarkable journey is an inspiration to many. Despite facing numerous challenges in his life, he has never lost sight of his passion for music and has continued to use it as a tool for healing and spreading joy throughout the globe.
