In the misty mountains of rural Japan, there lived a young warrior named Matsumoto Sepp. His full name, Matsumoto Sepp, was whispered in awe by the villagers, who spoke of his exceptional bravery and skill with a sword.

Sepp was the son of a humble samurai family, but from a young age, he showed a natural talent for combat that surpassed even his father's abilities.
