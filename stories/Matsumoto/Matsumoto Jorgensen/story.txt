As she walked down the street, her bright pink hair stood out amidst the sea of faces, but it was just one aspect of her unique style. Matsumoto Jorgensen's sharp mind and quick wit made her a valuable asset to the police department.

One day, a wealthy businessman approached her with a case that had gone cold. A priceless gemstone had been stolen from his mansion, and he suspected foul play. Matsumoto Jorgensen was intrigued by the challenge and agreed to take on the case.
