In the land of Akakawa, where the sun dipped into the horizon and painted the sky with hues of crimson and gold, there lived a young nobleman by the name of Matsumoto de' Medici. His full name was Matsumoto Alessandro de' Medici, and he was the youngest son of the esteemed daimyo, Lord Matsumoto.

One fateful evening, a messenger arrived from the neighboring province, bearing grave news of an impending invasion by a rival clan. Lord Matsumoto was away on military campaigns, leaving his son to handle the crisis.
