Here's a 375-word story about Matsumoto Krūmiņš:

In the small town of Matsuyama, Japan, there lived a young woman named Matsumoto Krūmiņš. Her full name was a curiosity among the locals, who would often ask her how she got such an unusual surname. According to legend, Matsumoto Krūmiņš was born with a rare condition that caused her eyes to change color depending on her mood.

As a child, Matsumoto Krūmiņš would play tricks on her friends by changing the color of her eyes to match their own emotions. Her bright blue eyes would flash green when she was excited, and her brown eyes would turn grey when she was sad. The townspeople found it fascinating and often sought out her company just to see her change eye colors.

As Matsumoto Krūmiņš grew older, she discovered that her unique ability was not just a quirk of fate but also a gift. She could sense the emotions of those around her, and her changing eye colors allowed her to communicate with people in ways they never thought possible.

One day, a group of travelers passed through Matsuyama, seeking refuge from a fierce storm. Matsumoto Krūmiņš welcomed them into her home, and as she listened to their stories, her eyes began to change color in response. She saw flashes of fear, excitement, and joy, each reflected in the shifting hues of her irises.

The travelers were amazed by Matsumoto Krūmiņš's gift, and they begged her to teach them how to sense emotions like she could. And so, she began to share her unique ability with others, spreading love, kindness, and understanding throughout the town of Matsuyama.
