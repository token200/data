Matsumoto Laurent was a man with a penchant for the unusual. He spent his days as a curator at the Tokyo National Museum, surrounded by ancient artifacts and relics from around the world. But despite his seemingly mundane occupation, Laurent had a secret passion - he was a collector of rare and obscure taxidermy specimens.

Laurent's love affair with taxidermy began when he was just a teenager, rummaging through the attic of his family's old mansion in rural France. There, he stumbled upon an old wooden box filled with oddities: glass-eyed rabbits, antique birds, and even a stuffed owl perched atop a dusty vase.

As he grew older, Laurent's fascination with taxidermy only deepened. He spent years tracking down the rarest specimens, often traveling to remote corners of the world in search of the most elusive creatures. His collections were the envy of collectors everywhere, with pieces ranging from a perfectly preserved alpaca to a meticulously mounted giant squid.

But Laurent's life was not without its challenges. As his reputation as a collector grew, so did the interest of...unusual individuals. He had to navigate a complex web of underground dealers and black marketeers, all vying for control of his most prized possessions.

One day, Laurent received an offer he couldn't refuse - a mysterious patron willing to pay top dollar for a specific piece in his collection: a 19th-century taxidermied okapi. The catch? The okapi was said to be cursed, bringing misfortune and ruin to anyone who possessed it.

Laurent was both intrigued and terrified by the offer. He knew that the okapi was one of his most prized possessions - a creature so rare, so mysterious, that he had almost forgotten what it looked like when he first laid eyes on it. But the promise of such a large sum of money was too enticing to resist.

After much contemplation, Laurent made his decision. He agreed to sell the okapi, but only if the buyer would agree to one condition: they must keep its existence a secret from the world at large.

As he watched the patron disappear into the night, Laurent couldn't shake off the feeling that he had just made a terrible mistake. The weight of the okapi's supposed curse hung heavy on his shoulders, and he wondered if he would ever be able to escape its clutches.

Only time would tell, but one thing was certain - Matsumoto Laurent's life would never be the same again.
