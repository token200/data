Matsumoto White was a mysterious figure shrouded in legend among the inhabitants of rural Akakawa Village. With skin as white as freshly fallen snow and hair as black as the night sky, he seemed to embody the very essence of winter itself. Few had ever laid eyes on him, yet his presence was felt throughout the village.

It was said that Matsumoto White was once a mortal man, but after a freak accident involving a rare celestial event and a vat of sake, he found himself transformed into the being known today. Some claimed to have seen him walk through the forest at dawn, his footsteps silent on the snow-covered ground as if he were a ghost. Others whispered that on certain nights when the moon hung low in the sky, one could hear the soft strains of a shamisen drifting from the empty fields beyond the village.

For most villagers, Matsumoto White was little more than a myth, a legend passed down through generations to frighten naughty children into behaving. However, for Kaito – a young boy with eyes as bright as the stars and a heart full of wonder – he was something more. Kaito would often venture into the forest at night, hoping against hope that Matsumoto White would appear before him.

One fateful evening, as the moon hung low in the sky like a silver scimitar, Kaito heard the soft thud of footsteps on the snowy ground. He followed the sound until he came upon a figure cloaked in shadows, standing motionless beneath the branches of an ancient cedar tree.

As he drew closer, the figure turned to face him – Matsumoto White, his eyes gleaming like stars in the darkness. For a moment, Kaito felt as though time itself had come to a standstill. Then, without warning, the mysterious figure vanished into thin air, leaving behind only a whisper of sake-soaked breath and the faintest hint of shamisen music.

Kaito stumbled backward, his heart pounding in his chest like a wild drumbeat. When he finally found his footing, he turned to look back at the clearing – and saw Matsumoto White standing once more before him, his eyes burning with an otherworldly intensity that seemed to pierce right through to Kaito's very soul.

"Who are you?" Kaito breathed, his voice barely audible over the pounding of his heart.

Matsumoto White smiled enigmatically, his lips curled into a subtle smile. "I am Matsumoto White," he replied, his voice like the gentle lapping of waves on a winter's night.
