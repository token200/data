One day, a wealthy businessman approached Matsumoto Fernández with a peculiar case. The owner of a high-end boutique, Madame LeRoux, had reported that her prized diamond necklace was missing. The only clue was a suspicious email sent from an anonymous account, claiming responsibility for the theft and taunting the police.

Matsumoto Fernández accepted the challenge and began his investigation. He spent hours studying the crime scene, looking for any details that might have been missed. His keen eye spotted a faint smudge of lipstick on the counter, which led him to suspect that the thief was a woman.
