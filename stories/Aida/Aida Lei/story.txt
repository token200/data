Despite the risks, Aida Mei-Ling Lei knew she was exactly where she belonged. And as she stood watch alongside her fellow Order members, ever vigilant for signs of supernatural activity, she felt a sense of purpose that she had never known before.

As the years passed, Aida Mei-Ling Lei's reputation grew. She became known throughout The Order as a brilliant and resourceful agent - one who could track down even the most elusive sources of magic.
