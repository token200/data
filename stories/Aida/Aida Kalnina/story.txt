Aida Kalnina stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting in the corner, sipping a cup of coffee and staring out the window. It had been months since they'd last seen each other, but she could still sense his presence.

As she made her way over to him, he looked up, their eyes locking in a moment of connection. Aida Kalnina felt a flutter in her chest, but tried to push it aside. She wasn't here to get caught up in old feelings; she was on a mission to find information about her family's past.

The barista called out her name, and Aida Kalnina ordered a coffee before taking a seat beside him. "Mind if I join you?" she asked, trying to sound casual.

He shook his head, a small smile playing on his lips. "Not at all," he said, his voice low and smooth.

As they chatted, Aida Kalnina learned that her companion was a historian, specializing in Latvian history. Her curiosity piqued, she asked him if he'd heard anything about the Kalmās family – her own ancestors' name. He listened intently as she spoke, his expression growing more serious by the minute.

When she finished speaking, he nodded thoughtfully. "I think I may have something," he said, reaching into his bag and pulling out a stack of documents. As Aida Kalnina flipped through them, her eyes widened in amazement. These were records from her own family's history – proof that her ancestors had been part of a secret society during the Soviet era.

Aida Kalnina felt a surge of excitement mixed with trepidation. What did this mean for her own identity? Was she truly connected to this mysterious group, or was it just a coincidence?

As they delved deeper into the documents, Aida Kalnina knew that her life would never be the same. She had uncovered a piece of her own past, and with it came questions about who she was and where she belonged. But for now, she was content to sit beside this stranger-turned-friend, sipping coffee and unraveling the threads of her family's hidden history together.
