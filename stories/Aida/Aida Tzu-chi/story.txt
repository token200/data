In the heart of modern-day Taipei, a young woman named Aida Tzu-chi moved with purpose through the bustling streets. Her name, which roughly translates to "first aid" or "first daughter," was no coincidence - her mother had always believed that she would make a positive impact in the world.

Aida's parents were both medical professionals who met while working at the Taipei City Hospital. They instilled in their children a strong sense of compassion and duty, encouraging them to pursue careers in healthcare. Aida Tzu-chi followed in their footsteps, studying medicine with the same dedication as her parents had taught her.

As she worked as an ER nurse, Aida's natural talent for triage and bedside manner quickly earned her a reputation among patients and colleagues alike. Her calm and empathetic demeanor put even the most anxious patients at ease, making her a favorite among families seeking care in the hospital's pediatric ward.

One fateful evening, a severe accident shook the streets of Taipei. A young boy was critically injured in a bicycle crash near the Taipei Main Station. The ER was soon overwhelmed with trauma cases, and it fell to Aida Tzu-chi to step up and lead the charge.

With her medical training and innate ability to think on her feet, Aida worked tirelessly alongside her colleagues to stabilize the young boy's condition. She personally ensured that he received every precautionary measure required for his recovery, always keeping a close eye on his vital signs. 

After hours of hard work, the patient began to show signs of improvement, and Aida knew it was time to hand over responsibility to the next shift team. Exhausted but triumphant, she took a well-deserved break in the hospital cafeteria.

When her mother asked about her day at dinner that evening, Aida couldn't help but share stories of what had happened earlier. Her mother listened with pride and admiration, remembering when her daughter first started out on this path in life.
