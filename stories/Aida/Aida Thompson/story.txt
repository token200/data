Aida Thompson walked into the bustling café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She had been searching for weeks, trying to track down her estranged father, and finally, she had received a cryptic message that led her here. As she waited in line, she fidgeted with her phone, her thumb hovering over the screen as if willing it to ring.

The barista called out her name, and Aida Thompson made her way to the counter. "Aida Thompson, please," she said, trying to sound calm despite the butterflies in her stomach. The woman behind the counter smiled sympathetically and handed her a steaming cup of coffee. "You look like you could use this," she said.

Aida Thompson took a sip, feeling the warmth spread through her chilled bones. She had always struggled with her temper, but being on her own for so long had taught her to control it. Or at least, that's what she kept telling herself. As she waited for her coffee, she couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. What if this was just another dead end? What if she never found him?

The café door swung open, and a man with piercing blue eyes walked in. Aida Thompson's heart skipped a beat as their gazes met. It was him – her father. She felt like she'd been punched in the gut, but she couldn't look away.

He scanned the room, his eyes locking onto hers once more. Aida Thompson's legs trembled beneath her, and she felt like she was going to collapse. The barista touched her arm, concern etched on her face. "You okay?" she asked softly.

Aida Thompson nodded, trying to compose herself. She took a deep breath and made her way towards him, her eyes never leaving his face. As she approached, he stood up, a hesitant smile spreading across his lips. "Aida," he said, his voice low and rough. "It's been too long."

Aida Thompson felt tears prick at the corners of her eyes as she reached out to shake his hand. It was real – it was finally real. She had found him, and this time, they would face their past together.
