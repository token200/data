Aida Garcia stood at the edge of the rooftop, her feet curled over the precipice as she gazed out at the glittering city below. The sounds of car horns and chatter filled the air, but to Aida, it was just a distant hum, a reminder that there were people down there living their lives.

She took a deep breath, feeling the cool night air fill her lungs. It was moments like these that she felt most alive. As a photographer, she had spent countless nights prowling the streets of this city, searching for the perfect shot. But tonight, she wasn't looking for anything in particular – just the beauty of it all.

Aida's thoughts drifted to her past, to the life she had left behind. Growing up in a small town in Mexico, she had always felt stifled by the expectations placed upon her. Her parents wanted her to be a doctor, or a lawyer – someone with a "respectable" career. But Aida had other plans. She had a passion for photography that burned deep within her, and she knew she couldn't ignore it.

She had moved to this city years ago, determined to make a name for herself as a photographer. It hadn't been easy – there were times when she doubted herself, when the doubts crept in and whispered that she wasn't good enough. But Aida had persevered, working tirelessly to hone her craft and build a portfolio.

As she stood on the rooftop, Aida's eyes landed on a figure in the distance. He was young, with a messy mop of hair and a bright smile. She watched as he walked towards her, his footsteps echoing off the skyscrapers. It was a moment that seemed almost too perfect – like the universe had conspired to bring them together.

For a few fleeting moments, Aida felt like she was meant for this life. Like this was where she was supposed to be. But as quickly as it had started, the feeling dissipated, leaving her with only questions. Who was this stranger? What did he want from her?

Aida smiled wryly, knowing that some mysteries were better left unsolved. She took one last look at the city below, then turned and walked away, disappearing into the night as silently as she had appeared.

The camera in Aida's bag hung over her shoulder, a constant companion on this journey through life. She knew that tomorrow would bring new challenges, new opportunities to capture the beauty of this city. And for now, that was enough.
