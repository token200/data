Aida Renault stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the glittering lights of the city below. The cool breeze whipped through her dark hair as she leaned against the railing, lost in thought. As a renowned detective, Aida had seen her fair share of darkness and despair, but tonight was different. Tonight, she felt a sense of purpose she hadn't felt in months.

Aida's eyes narrowed as she thought back to the cryptic message that had brought her to this rooftop. The words "Echo-12" echoed in her mind like a mantra. She knew it was just a lead, but something about it resonated with her. As she pondered her next move, a faint hum caught her attention.

She turned to see a sleek black helicopter hovering above the rooftops. Aida's instincts told her this was more than just a coincidence. With a swift motion, she pulled out her phone and dialed a number, connecting with her trusted ally, Detective Jack Harris.

"Aida, what's going on?" Jack's voice came through the line, calm and collected as always.

"I think I've got something," Aida replied, her eyes scanning the rooftop for any signs of danger. "I received a message about Echo-12. I need you to dig up anything related."

There was a pause on the other end before Jack responded, "Already on it, Aida. What makes this lead so special?"

Aida hesitated, unsure how much she wanted to reveal over the phone. But something about Jack's tone put her at ease. She took a deep breath and explained the strange message and its connection to an old case from five years ago.

As she finished speaking, the helicopter vanished into the night sky, leaving Aida with more questions than answers. She knew that this was just the beginning of a long and winding road, but she was ready to face whatever lay ahead. With a newfound sense of determination, Aida Renault turned away from the edge of the rooftop, her eyes fixed on the darkness below, ready to unravel the secrets of Echo-12.

The city lights twinkled like stars as she disappeared into the night, determined to uncover the truth and bring justice to those who had been wronged.
