One fateful evening, while exhibiting her work at a gallery on Calle de la Fortaleza, Kiara met a handsome stranger named Mateo. They struck up a conversation about art and music, discovering that they shared a love for the works of Tito Puente and Celia Cruz. The chemistry between them was palpable, and before parting ways, they exchanged numbers.

Over the next few weeks, Kiara and Mateo met frequently, exploring the city's culinary scene and discussing their dreams for the future. As they delved deeper into each other's lives, Kiara found herself falling for Mateo's charming smile and infectious enthusiasm.
