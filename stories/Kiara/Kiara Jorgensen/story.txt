Kiara Jorgensen stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee. It had been months since they'd last seen each other, but Kiara's mind still lingered on their last encounter.

As she made her way towards him, he looked up and caught her gaze. A hint of a smile played on his lips, and Kiara's heart skipped a beat. She slid into the booth across from him, feeling a sense of comfort wash over her.

"Kiara Jorgensen," he said, his voice low and smooth. "It's been too long."

"I know," Kiara replied, her tone neutral. "I've been thinking about you lately."

He raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "Oh? What made you think of me?"

Kiara hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. But there was something about the way he looked at her that made her feel safe enough to open up. "I just...I don't know if I'd make it without you," she said finally.

He nodded, his expression softening. "You'll always be able to count on me, Kiara Jorgensen."

As they talked, the hours slipped away unnoticed. The café emptied out, and the lights began to dim. But Kiara and her companion didn't notice. They were lost in their own little world, one that had nothing to do with reality.

Their conversation turned to memories of old times, of laughter and adventure. Kiara felt a sense of nostalgia wash over her, remembering the thrill of exploring new places with this person by her side.

As the night wore on, Kiara realized she was running low on time. She glanced at her watch, feeling a pang of disappointment. "I should probably get going," she said finally.

He nodded, standing up to help her with her coat. As they walked out into the cool night air, Kiara felt a sense of gratitude towards this person who had brought so much joy and comfort into her life. She knew that their friendship was something special – one that would last long after this night was over.
