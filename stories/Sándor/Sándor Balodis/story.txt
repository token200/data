But life had other plans for Sándor. His early years were marred by tragedy, including the loss of both parents at a young age. He was taken under the wing of a gruff but kind-hearted uncle, who taught him how to survive on the streets and eventually landed him an apprenticeship with a local carpenter.

Sándor proved to be a natural with his hands, quickly mastering the art of woodworking and furniture-making. However, his talents didn't go unnoticed for long.
