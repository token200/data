Sándor Esquivel stood at the edge of the Grand Plaza, his eyes scanning the bustling streets below. As a skilled thief, he had spent years honing his craft in the shadows of Cartagena's ancient city walls. Tonight was no different.

With a flick of his wrist, Sándor produced a small key from his pocket and unlocked the door to the old mansion on Calle del Sol. He slipped inside, his footsteps echoing off the stone floors as he made his way up the winding staircase.

As he reached the top, he found himself in front of a large wooden chest adorned with intricate carvings of Spanish conquests. Sándor's eyes sparkled with excitement; this was the score he had been waiting for.

With a few swift movements, Sándor opened the chest and began to rummage through its contents. Gold coins clinked against his palm as he filled his pockets, while velvet pouches burst open, spilling their contents onto the floor.

But as he reached for the final treasure, a small vial of amber liquid, Sándor felt a sudden chill run down his spine. He had heard whispers that this particular item was cursed – said to bring madness and despair to anyone who possessed it.

Despite the warnings, Sándor's fingers wrapped around the vial, drawing it close to his heart. A shiver coursed through him as he lifted the liquid to his lips and drank its contents.

At first, nothing seemed amiss. But as the moments ticked by, Sándor began to feel a creeping sense of unease. The world around him grew distorted – buildings twisted, colors bleeding into one another like watercolors on wet paper.

Panic set in as he stumbled down the stairs, his eyes wide with terror. How could this be happening? He was Sándor Esquivel, master thief, feared by all who knew him.

In a desperate bid to regain control, Sándor grabbed his cloak and flung open the door, letting the cool night air wash over him like a balm. But as he stumbled into the Plaza below, he saw something that made his blood run cold – himself, standing in front of the mansion, the vial still clutched in his hand.

The mirror-like calm of his reflection showed no signs of madness or despair. It merely gazed back at him with an unblinking stare, as if Sándor Esquivel had never truly existed at all.
