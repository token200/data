I think you may be mistaken. I'm not aware of a fictional character named Sándor Dąbrowski. However, I believe you may be thinking of Janusz Korczak's character, Sándor Farkas, also known as Sándor "Dabru" (not exactly the same), however, another character from the same background is Sándor Dábróczy  but most likely the main character, was Sándor Farkas.

No I am not sure of that info... 

Anyway: a different one, and that would be "Sándor" or more specifically, (a main character) Sándor "Dabru", from:  "The Little Soldier" series by Janusz Korczak.
