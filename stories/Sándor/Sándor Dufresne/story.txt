Sándor Dufresne stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a freelance journalist and a ghost hunter, she had seen her fair share of supernatural occurrences, but nothing could have prepared her for what she was about to face.

She spotted her contact, a hooded figure who introduced himself only as "The Source," sitting in the corner, nursing a cup of black coffee. Sándor took a seat across from him, and The Source slid a small folder onto the table in front of her.

"This is the story you've been looking for, Sándor Dufresne," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "The Ravenswood Mansion has been plagued by paranormal activity for decades. Doors slam shut on their own, objects move by themselves, and witnesses claim to have seen shadowy figures lurking in the halls."

Sándor's eyes widened as she flipped through the folder, filled with photographs and eyewitness accounts. She had heard rumors of the mansion's dark history, but she never thought it would be so extensive.

As they spoke, Sándor noticed a figure watching them from across the room - a tall, imposing man with piercing blue eyes that seemed to bore into her very soul. He was dressed in black, his presence radiating an aura of malevolence that made her skin crawl.

The Source followed her gaze and nodded grimly. "That's Malcolm Ravenwood, the current owner of the mansion. He's been denying the rumors, but I believe he knows more than he's letting on."

Sándor felt a shiver run down her spine as she gazed back at Malcolm. She knew that she had to get to the bottom of this story, no matter what it took.

With The Source's help, Sándor Dufresne set out to uncover the truth behind the Ravenswood Mansion's sinister reputation. She was ready for whatever lay ahead, armed with her research and a determination to expose the truth.
