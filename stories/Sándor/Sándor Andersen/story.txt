Sándor Andersen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. The once-thriving town of Nykøbing Falster was now a shadow of its former self, its streets eerily quiet.

As he made his way through the deserted streets, Sándor couldn't help but think back to the life he left behind. He had been a successful business owner in Copenhagen, with a thriving import-export company and a beautiful wife waiting for him at home. But after a series of bad investments and poor decisions, everything came crashing down.

Now, at 60 years old, Sándor found himself forced to confront his own mortality. His wife had passed away just a year ago, leaving him alone with nothing but the memories of their life together.

As he walked, the worn cobblestones seemed to whisper stories of the past, of love and loss, of laughter and tears. Sándor's heart ached with every step, as if his very soul was being pulled back into the world of the living.

He came to a small, old-fashioned café, its windows gleaming in the fading light. Inside, a lone figure sat at a table by the fire, sipping a cup of coffee and staring into the flames. Sándor recognized the worn leather jacket, the same one he had worn on countless nights out with his wife.

Without thinking, he pushed open the door and slipped inside, feeling like a ghost from another time. The figure looked up, startled, as Sándor approached the table. It was his own younger self, sitting in the café where they used to meet to discuss their dreams and ambitions.

Sándor's older eyes locked onto the younger man, and he felt a jolt of recognition. This was him, or at least, this was how he had imagined himself all those years ago.

"Hello," Sándor said softly, his voice barely above a whisper.

The younger Sándor looked up, a look of curiosity on his face. "Sándor?" he asked, as if surprised to hear his own name.

Sándor smiled, feeling the weight of his years lift off his shoulders. He sat down at the table next to his younger self, and together they sipped coffee and talked about life, love, and the choices that had led him to this moment.

For the first time in months, Sándor felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, he wasn't too late after all.
