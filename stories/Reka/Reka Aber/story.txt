Reka Aber had always been fascinated by the ancient art of archery. Growing up in a small village on the outskirts of the kingdom, she spent countless hours honing her skills under the watchful eye of her mentor, the wise old archer, Thorne.

As she grew older, Reka's passion for archery only intensified, and she began to compete in local tournaments, earning her a reputation as one of the most skilled young archers in the land.

With the arrowhead in hand, Reka Aber set off for the capital, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.
