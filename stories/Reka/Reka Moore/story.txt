This was what she had been working towards â€“ using her skills as a journalist to make a difference in people's lives.

With her camera and notebook safely tucked away, Reka Elara Moore made her way back to her apartment, ready to begin writing the article that would expose the truth about social media's dark side. She sat down at her desk, took a deep breath, and let her pen fly across the page. The words flowed easily, as if she had always known this story needed to be told.
