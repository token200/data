Reka's journey was not without its challenges, however. Her family struggled to accept her choice of career, preferring that she follow in their footsteps instead. But Reka remained resolute, convinced that her art was the key to unlocking her true potential.

One evening, as Reka stood before a particularly vibrant painting, she felt an overwhelming sense of pride and accomplishment. This piece, titled "Chun-yi's Dawn," captured the essence of her heritage in a way that no other work had ever managed. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she gazed upon the colors, knowing that this was just the beginning of her journey.
