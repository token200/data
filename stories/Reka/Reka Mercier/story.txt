Reka Mercier stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the cool evening air enveloping her like a familiar hug. She had been away for what felt like an eternity, and it was good to be back in Ashwood, surrounded by the people and places she loved.

As she made her way through the station, Reka Mercier's eyes scanned the crowded platform, searching for a glimpse of her best friend, Luna. They had grown up together, exploring the woods and sharing secrets, and Reka knew that Luna would be the first to spot her.

Finally, she spotted Luna's bright pink hair, bobbing above the crowd as they navigated the throng of passengers. "Reka! Oh my god, you're here!" Luna exclaimed, bounding towards her with a smile that could light up the darkest room.

The two friends hugged tightly, both of them grinning from ear to ear. Reka Mercier felt a sense of peace wash over her as she wrapped her arms around Luna, holding on for dear life. This was what she had missed – the comfort and familiarity of home, the knowledge that no matter what lay ahead, she could always count on her friends.

Over the next few days, Reka Mercier settled back into her routine, spending long hours in the town's archives, pouring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls. She was determined to uncover the secrets of Ashwood's mysterious past, and Luna had promised to help her every step of the way.

As she delved deeper into her research, Reka began to notice strange inconsistencies in the records. It seemed that someone – or something – was trying to cover up a dark history, one that threatened to upend everything she thought she knew about her beloved town. With Luna by her side, Reka Mercier felt like she could tackle anything, and she set her sights on uncovering the truth.

Together, the two friends pored over ancient texts, deciphered cryptic symbols, and followed a trail of hidden clues that led them deeper into the heart of Ashwood's mystery. And as they worked, Reka knew that no matter what lay ahead, she was ready to face it head-on, armed with her quick wit, sharp mind, and unwavering determination – all thanks to her best friend, Luna.
