Reka Bauer was a free spirit, always chasing her dreams and never looking back. A world traveler and photographer, she had spent countless hours capturing the beauty of far-off lands and meeting people from all walks of life.

One evening, Reka Bauer stumbled upon a small izakaya hidden in a quiet neighborhood. The sign above the door read "Kokoro no Yūjin," or "Friendship's Home."
