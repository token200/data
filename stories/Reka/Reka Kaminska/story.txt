Reka Kaminska stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It had been months since she'd last set foot in this quaint town, and yet it felt like home. As she made her way through the deserted streets, Reka's thoughts turned to the letter she'd received just days before.

It was from an old friend, one who'd been missing for years after a tragic accident. The letter was cryptic, but it hinted that there was more to the story than anyone had ever imagined. Reka's curiosity was piqued, and she found herself wondering what secrets the town might hold.

As she walked, the buildings seemed to grow taller and the streets narrower, until Reka felt like she was wandering through a labyrinth. She'd always loved this feeling, as if the town was hiding its secrets behind every door and in every shadow.

Finally, she arrived at the old café where she used to meet her friend all those years ago. The sign creaked in the wind, and Reka's heart skipped a beat as she pushed open the door. Inside, it was just as she'd left it – dusty and faded, but with a warmth that seemed to envelop her like a hug.

Reka took a seat at the counter, ordering a cup of coffee from the gruff but kind-hearted barista who'd known her since she was a child. As she waited for her drink, she noticed a figure sitting in the corner, watching her with an intensity that made her skin prickle.

It was old man Gromov, a reclusive eccentric who'd lived on the outskirts of town for as long as anyone could remember. He nodded at Reka as if he knew exactly what she was thinking – and maybe, just maybe, he did.

The coffee arrived, and Reka took a sip, feeling the familiar warmth spread through her veins. She turned to Gromov, asking him what he wanted, and his eyes locked onto hers with an unnerving intensity. "I think it's time we talked about your friend," he said, his voice low and mysterious.

Reka's heart skipped another beat as she leaned in, ready to hear the secrets that had been hidden for so long.
