The café's owner, an elderly woman named Yumi, greeted Reka with a warm smile. "Ah, welcome back, Miss Weber! I see you're still digging into our little city's secrets."

Reka chuckled and took a seat at the bar. "Just trying to get the scoop on Tokyo's expat community, Yumi-san. I've heard rumors of a growing trend among young professionals seeking new adventures abroad."

Yumi nodded knowingly. "Yes, many of them come here looking for a fresh start. But there are also those who seek something more...hidden. Something that only we locals know about."

Reka's ears perked up at the hint. She pulled out her notebook and began scribbling down notes as Yumi leaned in to share more whispers. The conversation flowed easily, like old friends catching up over a cup of coffee.
