Reka Horvath stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of familiarity. As a lone wolf in the supernatural community, she didn't often find herself in crowded spaces, especially not among people who knew her name.

Reka Horvath had always been wary of getting too close to others. Her past was marked by loss and betrayal, leaving her with a deep-seated distrust of humanity. But tonight, something drew her to this particular café. Maybe it was the scent of old books or the soft hum of conversation that seemed almost... familiar.

As she waited for her drink, Reka Horvath noticed a figure sitting in the corner, shrouded in shadows. There was something about them that caught her attention - perhaps the way their eyes gleamed in the dim light or the subtle tension in their posture. She couldn't quite put her finger on it, but she felt an inexplicable urge to approach.

The stranger looked up as Reka Horvath drew near, their eyes locking in a flash of recognition. "Reka," they whispered, their voice husky and confident.

Reka's instincts screamed warning, but she forced herself to sit down across from the mysterious figure. "What do you want?" she asked gruffly, trying to keep her tone neutral.

The stranger smiled, revealing piercing green eyes that seemed to see right through her. "I've been looking for you, Reka Horvath," they said, their voice dripping with an otherworldly intensity. "We have unfinished business."

Reka's gut tightened, but she refused to back down. She had always walked alone, and she wasn't about to let some stranger disrupt that now. "What kind of business?" she asked, her tone a little softer.

The stranger leaned forward, their eyes burning with an inner fire. "Let's just say it involves the past we both thought was lost forever."

Reka Horvath's instincts screamed caution, but a part of her - a small, nagging part - wondered if this stranger might be someone she could trust after all.
