Her studio door swung open, and a young girl stood hesitantly, clutching a sketchbook. Sanjar offered a gentle smile and invited her in, sensing the innocence behind those eyes. As they spent hours together, pouring stories onto canvas, Sanjar realized that her art was not just about expressing herself – it was also an act of connection.
