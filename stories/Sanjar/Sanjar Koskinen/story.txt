Sanjar Koskinen, a Finnish musician and songwriter, sat on his couch, strumming the chords of his latest composition. His band, Wolf Party, had just released their highly anticipated third album, and he was struggling to find inspiration for the next single.

As he played, memories flooded his mind - late-night recording sessions with his friends, the countless hours spent perfecting his craft, and the sold-out shows that followed. He remembered the days when music wasn't about fame or fortune but about sharing stories that resonated with others. The music of his childhood grew louder in his ears: Mäki's melancholic melodies and the simple, yet powerful harmonies of the Finnish folk band, The Tampereen Tyttöjen Sinfonietta.

Koskinen began to hum a gentle tune, something new that had been hiding at the back of his mind. He felt it was familiar, like a long-forgotten melody that sparked something within him. His fingers moved swiftly across the strings as he sang softly to himself. The words spilled out without thought: "My mother's eyes were like stars in the night / Shining bright for me and her love for me."

Hours passed as Sanjar Koskinen delved deeper into his composition, pouring his emotions onto the canvas of music. It was as if an old friend had finally found their way back to him - a memory from his childhood that he thought he'd lost forever.

As the first light of dawn crept through the windows, Koskinen stopped playing and stepped away from his guitar. The song still lingered in his mind, and with it, a sense of purpose. This was what Wolf Party had always been about: sharing their stories with others - tales of love, loss, hope, and perseverance.

Days turned into weeks, as the band worked tirelessly to perfect their new single. Koskinen spent countless hours singing along to tracks in his car, imagining how they would come together on stage - a sea of bodies moving as one, united by music.

Finally, the day arrived for the release of their latest single, "Tähti" (Star). Sanjar Koskinen sat back and listened, letting the emotions wash over him. Tears welled up in his eyes as he remembered where it all started - with a simple melody that had been hiding at the back of his mind.

"Tähti" became an anthem for those struggling to find light in darkness, a reminder that even when we're lost, our stories can guide us through the void. Sanjar Koskinen looked out at the audience on stage, their eyes shining bright like stars, and he knew that music had done what it was meant to do: heal the wounds of the past and bring solace to those who needed it most.

The show came to a close with "Tähti" echoing through the venue one last time. As Sanjar Koskinen took his final bow, a wave of gratitude washed over him - for music that had always been there, guiding him when all else seemed lost.
