Sanjar Balodis stepped into the dimly lit caf√©, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. He spotted her sitting alone by the window, sipping on a cup of coffee. She turned around as he approached, a hint of surprise crossing her features.

"Sanjar," she said softly, using his full name with a touch of warmth. "It's been ages."

Balodis smiled, taking a seat across from her. Their eyes met in a silent understanding, one that only came from knowing each other through thick and thin.

As they chatted, Balodis couldn't help but notice the way the dim light danced across her features. Her bright smile seemed to illuminate the entire room, drawing him in like a magnet. He had always been drawn to her unique energy, and now, more than ever, he realized how much he missed having her around.

They talked long into the night, reminiscing about old times and sharing stories of their lives since parting ways. Balodis found himself opening up to her in ways he never thought possible. There was something comforting about knowing she'd always be there for him, even when life got tough.

As they laughed together, Balodis realized that some things remained constant, no matter where life took them. The spark between them still crackled with intensity, a flame that burned bright despite the distance and time apart.

Their conversation eventually came to an end, but not before they exchanged promises to stay in touch this time. As Balodis stood up to leave, she reached out and touched his hand, her eyes locked on his. "Take care of yourself, Sanjar," she said softly, using his full name once more.

He nodded, feeling a sense of gratitude wash over him. In that moment, he knew he'd always cherish the memories they made together, and look forward to making new ones in the future. With a final glance, Balodis walked out into the night, the city lights twinkling like stars as he disappeared into the crowd.
