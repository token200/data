Sanjar Arias stepped off the plane and into the warm desert air, feeling an instant sense of relief wash over her. She had left behind the chaos of her high-powered marketing job in New York City for a chance to reconnect with her roots and find herself in the small town of Tulum, Mexico.

As she made her way through customs and out into the bright sunlight, Sanjar felt a weight lift off her shoulders. It had been years since she'd last visited her family's old homestead, and she was excited to spend some quality time with them.

Her abuela, Maria, greeted her at the gate with a warm hug and a kiss on each cheek. "M'hija, it's so good to see you!" she exclaimed. Sanjar's eyes welled up with tears as she hugged her back tightly.

The two women spent the next few days catching up and reminiscing about old times. Maria told stories of Sanjar's father, who had passed away when she was just a teenager, and shared recipes for traditional Yucatecan dishes that Sanjar had grown up loving.

As they sat on the porch, sipping sweet tea and watching the sun set over the jungle, Sanjar felt a sense of peace wash over her. She realized that this was exactly what she needed – time away from the distractions of her old life and a chance to reconnect with the person she used to be before all the stress and anxiety took hold.

Over the next few days, Sanjar spent her days exploring the town, practicing yoga on the beach, and helping out around the homestead. She felt like she was finally coming home, and it was an incredible feeling.

As the sun began to set on their final evening together, Maria turned to Sanjar with a serious look on her face. "M'hija, I want you to know that I'm proud of you," she said, her voice trembling with emotion. "You're strong and capable, just like your father. Don't ever forget that." Sanjar smiled, feeling grateful for the wisdom and love of her abuela.

As she hugged Maria tightly one last time before heading off to bed, Sanjar knew that this trip had been exactly what she needed – a reminder of where she came from, and who she truly was. And as she drifted off to sleep with a smile on her face, she felt like she could finally start to find herself again.
