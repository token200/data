The nod of approval was music to Milan's ears. He left the tower feeling elated, knowing that this was just the beginning of his journey.

Over the next few weeks, the investors poured capital into Milan's startup, helping him refine his prototype and expand his team. The progress was rapid, with breakthroughs in materials science and engineering leading to a series of promising partnerships.

Through it all, Milan remained driven, fueled by an insatiable passion for making a difference. He spent long hours in the lab, tinkering with designs, talking to potential clients, and pushing the boundaries of what was thought possible.
