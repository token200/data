Milan Schmidt was a man with a troubled past. His eyes, once bright and full of life, had dimmed to a dull grey, like the stone that covered the crumbling mansion he'd grown up in. As a child, he'd often sneak out at night to explore the overgrown gardens and abandoned rooms, searching for something – anything – to fill the void left by his parents' tragic deaths.

Years went by, and Milan's curiosity turned into an obsession with the supernatural. He devoured books on ghosts, demons, and occultism, convinced that there was more to this world than what he could see and touch. His friends and family thought him crazy, but Milan couldn't shake the feeling that there was something out there waiting for him.

One fateful night, while investigating a long-abandoned asylum on the outskirts of town, Milan stumbled upon an ancient ritual site. The air was thick with incense and the whispers of the dead. As he knelt among the dusty artifacts, he felt it – a presence that seemed to seep into his very bones.

The days that followed were marked by strange occurrences: doors creaking open on their own, disembodied whispers in the night, and an unshakeable sense of being watched. Milan was both terrified and exhilarated by these events, unsure if he was losing his mind or unlocking secrets hidden for centuries.

As the weeks turned into months, Milan's life became increasingly isolated. He barely left the mansion, where the shadows seemed to come alive at night. His only companions were the whispers of the dead and the rustling of leaves in the overgrown gardens.

And then, one evening, he saw her – a woman with eyes that shone like stars in the darkness. She introduced herself as Arachne, an ancient entity bound to the asylum's dark energies. Milan knew, instinctively, that she was his key to understanding the world beyond the veil.

Arachne began to teach Milan the secrets of the occult, and he devoured every lesson like a starving man at a feast. As their bond grew stronger, the whispers in the night grew louder, until it seemed that Milan's very presence had awakened a host of malevolent spirits.

Milan was torn between his desire for knowledge and the terror that gripped him by the throat. He knew he was playing with fire, but he couldn't resist the allure of Arachne's world – a realm where the living and the dead blurred like shadows on a moonlit night.
