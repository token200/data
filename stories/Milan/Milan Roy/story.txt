Milan Roy stretched her long, lean body across the plush couch in her living room, letting out a satisfied sigh as she settled into the soft cushions. Her eyes scanned the room, taking in the artwork and antiques that adorned the walls, before landing on the bar behind her.

"Shall we have a drink?" she called out to her niece, Shiv.

Shiv walked into the room, dropping a purse onto the floor beside her. "Only if it's champagne," she said with a smirk.

Milan raised an eyebrow. "You know I always keep the best for you." She disappeared behind the bar and emerged a moment later with two glasses of bubbly.

As they sipped their drinks, Milan couldn't help but think about her life as Milan Roy, heiress to the massive media empire that bore her name. It was a weight she often struggled to live up to, but also one that gave her a sense of purpose and power beyond most women's wildest dreams.

Shiv took a sip of her champagne and turned to Milan with a curious expression. "So, Milly, what's the plan for tonight?" she asked.

Milan hesitated, unsure how much to reveal about her plans. But something about Shiv's knowing gaze put her at ease. "I was thinking of taking you out to that new restaurant in town," she said finally.

Shiv's eyes lit up. "The one with the celebrity chef?"

Milan nodded. "The very same."

As they finished their drinks and headed out into the night, Milan couldn't help but feel grateful for her life as Milan Roy. It was complicated and often painful, but it was hers, and she would do whatever it took to make the most of it.

As they walked through the crowded streets, Milan felt a sense of contentment wash over her. This was what it meant to be Milan Roy: to live a life of luxury and excess, but also one of power and influence. And as long as she had Shiv by her side, she knew she could face anything that came their way.

Eventually, they arrived at the restaurant and were greeted with red carpet treatment, courtesy of Milan's wealth and fame. As they sat down to a sumptuous feast, Milan couldn't help but smile at her reflection in the silverware, feeling like the ultimate winner. And for tonight, at least, she was exactly where she wanted to be: on top of the world as Milan Roy.
