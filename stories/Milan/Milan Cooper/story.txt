Milan Cooper was a man with a reputation. He was known for his razor-sharp wit, his disarming smile, and his uncanny ability to read people like a book. As a private investigator, he had built a client list that read like a Who's Who of the city's high society.

But Milan's real claim to fame came from his past. Born on the wrong side of the tracks, he had grown up on the streets of Brooklyn, where every day was a battle for survival. He had earned his degree in criminology the hard way, earning scars and street smarts that served him well in his line of work.

One fateful night, Milan's world was turned upside down when an old flame walked back into his life. Sophia was a stunning beauty with piercing green eyes and a smile that could light up a room. They had met in college, where they had been as inseparable as two peas in a pod. But after graduation, Sophia had disappeared without warning, leaving Milan heartbroken.

Years went by, and Milan's focus shifted to his career. He built a reputation as one of the best PI's in town, taking on cases that others wouldn't touch. And then, one night, Sophia reappeared, with a mysterious past and a tale of secrets and lies that threatened to upend everything Milan thought he knew.

As they delved deeper into the mystery, Milan found himself drawn back into Sophia's world. They started out as adversaries, but soon, their banter turned flirtatious, and before long, they were lost in each other's eyes once again.

But with the past always lurking just beneath the surface, Milan couldn't shake the feeling that he was being pulled into a web of deceit and danger. He knew that Sophia's secrets ran deep, and he was determined to uncover them, no matter what it took.

As they navigated the treacherous landscape of Sophia's world, Milan found himself torn between his duty as a PI and his growing feelings for the woman who had captured his heart all those years ago. It was a battle he knew he couldn't win alone, but with Sophia by his side, he felt like he could conquer anything.

For Milan Cooper, the past would always be prologue â€“ a reminder of what had come before, and what lay ahead.
