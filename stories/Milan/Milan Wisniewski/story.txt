As the sun set on another long day, Milan Wisniewski sat at his desk, sipping a cup of black coffee and staring at the tangled web of evidence before him. Suddenly, his phone rang – it was his source again, this time with a single phrase that sent shivers down his spine: "Meet me at the old warehouse on 5th and Main."

Without hesitation, Milan Wisniewski grabbed his jacket and set out into the darkness. The air was thick with anticipation as he approached the abandoned building. A figure emerged from the shadows – it was a woman, her face obscured by a hoodie.

With that, she vanished into the night, leaving Milan Wisniewski to unravel the tangled threads of corruption and deceit that had ensnared the city's elite.
