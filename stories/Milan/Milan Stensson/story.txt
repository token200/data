Milan Stensson stood at the edge of the frozen lake, his eyes fixed on the distant cabin where he was supposed to meet a mysterious client. The biting wind whipped through his dark hair, and his parka was the only thing keeping him warm as he gazed out at the vast expanse of white.

As a former special forces operative, Milan had seen his fair share of battles. But this mission felt different. He had been hired by a wealthy client to retrieve a valuable artifact from an abandoned research facility deep in the frozen wilderness. The pay was good, but Milan's gut told him something wasn't right.

He checked his watch for what felt like the hundredth time, wondering if he'd be standing here all night waiting for a non-existent meeting. Suddenly, a pair of headlights cut through the darkness, and a sleek black SUV skidded to a stop beside him.

Milan raised an eyebrow as the door swung open, revealing a woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She was dressed in the finest designer clothes, despite being covered in snow and ice from head to toe.

"Hello, Milan," she said, her voice husky and confident. "I see you're running a bit behind schedule."

Milan's instincts screamed at him to be cautious, but he played it cool. "Just getting here," he replied, falling into step beside the woman as they made their way towards the cabin.

 Inside, the cabin was opulent and expensive, with lavish furnishings and state-of-the-art security systems. Milan's trained eye picked out a few telltale signs of surveillance – hidden cameras, reinforced walls – but the woman seemed oblivious to it all.

As they sipped champagne and talked about the artifact, Milan couldn't shake off the feeling that he was in over his head. The woman seemed to be hiding something, but what?

Just as he was starting to get frustrated, a faint noise echoed from outside. It sounded like footsteps, followed by the crunch of snow underfoot.

The woman's eyes flickered towards the door, and for a moment, Milan saw a glimmer of fear in her eyes before it was gone. "It seems we have company," she said, her voice dripping with ice.

Without another word, she grabbed Milan's arm and yanked him into a nearby hiding spot just as the lights went out and the cabin erupted into chaos.
