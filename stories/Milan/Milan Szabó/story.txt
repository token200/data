Milan Szabó was a man with a reputation for being impossible to read. His piercing brown eyes seemed to bore into those he met, as if sizing them up and searching for weaknesses. But despite his intimidating demeanor, Milan had a soft spot for stray cats and old books.

He lived in a small, cluttered flat on the outskirts of Budapest, surrounded by stacks of dusty tomes that stretched all the way to the ceiling. It was a sanctuary, a place where he could escape the world and lose himself in the pages of his favorite novels.

By day, Milan worked as a journalist, writing scathing reviews of corrupt politicians and crooked business leaders. He had a keen eye for detail and a tongue sharp enough to cut down anyone who got in his way. But despite his tough exterior, Milan was a romantic at heart, always on the lookout for someone to share his stories with.

One day, while working on a particularly nasty exposé, Milan received an anonymous tip that led him to a small, forgotten café on the other side of town. The café was a dive, but there was something about it that drew Milan in. Maybe it was the smell of stale coffee and worn velvet armchairs, or maybe it was the faint scent of smoke and desperation.

Whatever it was, Milan felt an instant connection to the place. He ordered a cup of black coffee and sat down at a small table by the window, where he could watch the rain-soaked streets below.

As he sipped his coffee, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was a woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair, dressed in a long coat that seemed to swallow her whole. Milan felt a jolt of electricity run through his body as she approached him, and for the first time in years, he felt like he was being seen.

"Who are you?" Milan asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

"I'm someone who knows what it's like to be alone," the woman replied, her voice husky and mysterious. "Someone who understands that sometimes, the only way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the pages of another person's story."

Milan was taken aback by her words, but he felt a spark of recognition ignite within him. He knew exactly what she meant. And as they sat there, sipping their coffee and watching the rain-soaked streets below, Milan realized that maybe, just maybe, he had found someone who understood him.

From that day on, Milan and the mysterious woman met every week at the café, sharing stories and laughter over cups of black coffee. It was a tentative beginning, but for Milan Szabó, it was the start of something beautiful – a story that would take him to places he never could have imagined.
