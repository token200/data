Milan Saar was a name that struck fear into the hearts of those who knew him. As a former hitman and assassin, his reputation preceded him wherever he went. Born as Milan Ivanovich Saar, he had grown up on the streets of Moscow, where his rough upbringing and cunning nature had served him well in the underworld.

After serving time in prison for a string of high-profile murders, Milan saw an opportunity to start anew. He left Russia with a small sum of money and a burning desire to leave his past behind. As he settled into his new life in Paris, he began to take on odd jobs to make ends meet. However, it wasn't long before his skills as a hitman were sought after once again.

One fateful night, Milan received a visit from an old acquaintance, offering him a lucrative job to eliminate a rival businessman. The money was too enticing to resist, and Milan found himself back in the game. He tracked down his target to a seedy bar on the outskirts of town, where he waited patiently for the perfect moment to strike.

As he watched his mark from across the room, Milan couldn't help but think about the woman who had tried to save him all those years ago. Dr. Sofia Petrova, a kind-hearted psychologist who had seen something in him that no one else did – potential. She had been trying to rehabilitate him for years, but Milan had never been able to let go of his past.

The hitman's eyes narrowed as he spotted his target, and with a swift motion, he took out the rival businessman. The world around him seemed to slow down as he savored the taste of victory. But in that moment, Milan was aware that the line between good and evil had long since blurred for him.

Back in his hotel room, Milan lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling as memories flooded his mind. He thought about Sofia's words of encouragement, and how they lingered deep within him like a ghost. As he drifted off to sleep, Milan knew that he would never be able to escape his past, but perhaps one day, he'd find redemption – or at least, a chance to redeem himself.

As the morning sun crept into the room, Milan slowly opened his eyes, ready to face another day in this new life. Though still haunted by the shadows of his past, he took a deep breath and whispered to himself: "It's time for me to start anew, Milan Ivanovich Saar."
