Growing up in Riga, Latvia, he had heard stories of the Soviet occupation and its devastating effects on the city's population. Milan's curiosity led him to pursue a career in investigative journalism, determined to uncover the truth behind the country's tumultuous past.

One day, while working on a story about corruption in the government, Milan received a cryptic message from an anonymous source claiming to have information about a decades-old conspiracy involving high-ranking officials.

However, Milan knew that publishing such revelations wouldn't come without risks. He became increasingly paranoid, constantly looking over his shoulder as he pieced together the web of deceit and corruption that had been hidden for so long.
