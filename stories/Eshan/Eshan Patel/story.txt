Eshan Patel sat in his small, cluttered apartment, staring blankly at the computer screen in front of him. He was a freelance writer, and had been working on his latest article for hours, but nothing seemed to be coming together.

As he scrolled through social media, he saw post after post from his friends and acquaintances celebrating their new jobs, promotions, and accomplishments. It was enough to make Eshan feel like he was stuck in limbo.

At 28 years old, Eshan had always dreamed of making it as a writer. He had spent countless hours honing his craft, writing short stories and articles for school publications, and even publishing a few pieces online. But despite his passion, he had struggled to make ends meet.

Eshan's parents had encouraged him to pursue a "stable" career, something that would provide for them and give him a sense of security. So, after college, Eshan had taken a job at a marketing firm, thinking it was the perfect way to support himself while he worked on his writing in his free time.

But as the years went by, Eshan realized that he was losing touch with his passion. The corporate world wasn't for him, and he felt like he was just going through the motions. He began to question whether he had made a mistake by not pursuing a career in writing full-time.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was his best friend, Rohan, who had stopped by to check in on Eshan. "What's wrong?" Rohan asked, noticing the look of frustration on Eshan's face.

Eshan explained his struggles, feeling like he was stuck between two worlds. Rohan listened intently, nodding his head and making supportive noises. When Eshan finished talking, Rohan sat down next to him and put a hand on his shoulder.

"Eshan, you can't give up," Rohan said firmly. "You've got talent, and you've worked hard to get where you are. Don't let fear hold you back. Keep writing, keep pushing forward. You'll find your way."

Eshan smiled, feeling a surge of determination. Maybe Rohan was right. Maybe it was time for him to take a leap of faith and pursue his dreams full-time. He leaned over and grabbed the laptop, opening up a new document with a single, bold sentence: "It's time to start writing my life."
