Eshan Ming-che was a young and ambitious journalist who had just landed her dream job at a prestigious newspaper in Taipei. Born to a family of modest means, Eshan had always been driven to make a better life for herself and those around her. She spent countless hours honing her writing skills and building relationships with sources on the streets of Taipei.

Her editors often joked that Eshan Ming-che was like a dog with a bone - once she had her sights set on a story, nothing could deter her from pursuing it.

One day, while investigating a series of allegations against a high-ranking government official, Eshan stumbled upon a shocking revelation that threatened to upend the entire city. With the help of her sources and her own quick thinking, she managed to piece together a scandal that would shake the very foundations of Taipei's elite.
