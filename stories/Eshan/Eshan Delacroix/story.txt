Eshan Delacroix was intrigued by the challenge and agreed to meet with the informant at a secluded caf√© on the outskirts of Montmartre. As he arrived, he spotted a figure cloaked in shadows, sipping a cup of coffee.

"You're Eshan Delacroix," the figure stated, their voice low and gravelly. "I've heard a lot about you."

Seek the reflection of the sun's last ray.
There, among the whispers of the past,
You'll find the next piece, forever to last."

Eshan Delacroix studied the poem, his mind racing with possibilities. He knew that time was running out, and The Fox would strike again soon. With a determined glint in his eye, he set off into the Parisian night, ready to unravel the mystery of The Fox and bring the thief to justice.
