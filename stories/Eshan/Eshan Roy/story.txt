Eshan Roy was known for his sharp wit and quick tongue in the bustling streets of Mumbai. As a successful businessman, he had built a reputation for himself as one of the shrewdest players in town. But despite his tough exterior, Eshan had a soft spot for those in need.

One rainy evening, while strolling through the crowded alleys of Old Bombay, Eshan stumbled upon a small, makeshift clinic run by an elderly woman named Mrs. Jensen. She was tending to a young girl with a severe case of malaria, and Eshan's instincts told him that something was amiss.

As he watched, Eshan's eyes locked onto the girl's frail frame, and he knew that he had to act fast. He quickly haggled with the clinic's owner over the price of some much-needed medication, and before long, he had arranged for a team of medical professionals to be dispatched to the clinic.

Mrs. Jensen, who was none other than Eshan Roy's long-lost great-aunt, looked at him with tears in her eyes as she thanked him profusely. "I owe you one, little nephew," she said, using the term that only a few family members were privy to.

Eshan smiled wryly, knowing that he had done something good for once. For Eshan Roy, who was known for his ruthless business tactics, it was a rare pleasure to be able to use his wealth and influence for the greater good.

Over the next few weeks, Eshan made sure that Mrs. Jensen's clinic received an influx of donations and support from his associates. He also ensured that the young girl he had saved received regular check-ups and medical attention to ensure her full recovery.

As Eshan watched the girl grow stronger and healthier, he knew that it was all worth it. For once, his wealth and status hadn't been enough to bring him satisfaction; instead, it was the small acts of kindness that brought a sense of purpose to his life. And as he looked at Mrs. Jensen with pride, Eshan Roy knew that this was just the beginning of a new chapter in his life â€“ one where his great-aunt's words would forever hold a special place in his heart: "You are not just a businessman, Eshan; you are a human being."
