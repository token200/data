I couldn't find any information on a person named Eshan KissRomy Webb. It is possible that this person is not a public figure or does not have a significant online presence.

However, I can generate a story about a fictional character with the given name:

Eshan KissRomy Webb was a 25-year-old graffiti artist known for his bold and colorful street art. He had grown up in a small town in the outskirts of the city, where he learned to paint and create art from his mother, a talented painter herself.

As Eshan grew older, his passion for art only intensified, and he began to explore the city's streets, looking for the perfect spot to leave his mark. His tag, "EKC", became synonymous with street art, as people would come from all over to see his latest creations.

One day, while working on a new piece in an abandoned alleyway, Eshan was approached by a local gallery owner who offered him a solo exhibition at her prestigious gallery. Eshan was thrilled and quickly accepted the offer.

The night of the exhibition arrived, and the gallery was packed with art enthusiasts and collectors eager to see Eshan's latest work. As he stood behind his paintings, sipping champagne and chatting with guests, Eshan couldn't help but think back to his humble beginnings in the small town where it all started.

His full name, Eshan KissRomy Webb, was emblazoned on a canvas above the bar, a reminder of where he came from and how far he had come. The crowd applauded as he unveiled his latest piece, a vibrant portrait of his mother, who had inspired him to become an artist in the first place.

As the night wore on, Eshan's art stole the show, and he was hailed as one of the city's most promising young artists. And though he would go on to create many more works of art, he never forgot where it all started â€“ with his mother's love of art and his own passion for creating something beautiful.
