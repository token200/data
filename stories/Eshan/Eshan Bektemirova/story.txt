Eshan Bektemirova smiled back, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. "Yes, I do," she replied. "But tell me, what's the story behind these fabrics? They're stunning."

The old man nodded, launching into a tale of his ancestors' weaving traditions and the intricate symbolism hidden in the patterns. Eshan Bektemirova listened intently, her journalist's mind whirring with ideas.

As she left the shop, clutching a beautiful silk scarf and a notebook full of notes, Eshan Bektemirova knew she had stumbled upon something special.
