Eshan Simon had always been drawn to the world of art. As a child, he spent hours sketching and painting, lost in his own little universe of color and creativity. As he grew older, his passion for art only intensified, and he decided to pursue it as a career.

After completing his studies, Eshan Simon landed an internship at a prestigious gallery in the city. He worked tirelessly, soaking up every bit of knowledge and experience he could get.
