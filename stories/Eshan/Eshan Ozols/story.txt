One evening, while working on a particularly tough piece, Eshan received an unexpected visit from his high school sweetheart, Rachel. It had been years since they'd last spoken, but the spark between them was still palpable.

Over coffee, Rachel filled Eshan in on her latest endeavors as a social worker, dedicated to helping marginalized communities. As she spoke, Eshan found himself drawn to her passion and conviction. He realized that he had been so focused on his career that he'd neglected the things that truly mattered.

Inspired by Rachel's example, Eshan decided to take a break from his story and focus on the community project she was working with. Together, they came up with a plan to expose the systemic inequalities that plagued their city's most vulnerable residents.
