Eshan Dumas, or "Dumi" as his friends called him, was a young man with a passion for music and adventure. Growing up in the bustling streets of Mumbai, India, he spent most of his days honing his skills on the guitar and singing along to his favorite Bollywood soundtracks.

But despite his love for the finer things in life, Dumi's family struggled to make ends meet. His father was a lowly street vendor, selling everything from fruits to second-hand goods on the streets. Dumi knew he had to do something to help, so he began performing at local talent shows and open mic nights, earning enough money to put food on the table for his family.

As his music career took off, Dumi started to gain recognition in the Mumbai music scene. His soulful voice and intricate guitar riffs drew comparisons to the likes of A.R. Rahman and Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy. He began performing at bigger venues, opening for established artists and even landing a few solo gigs.

But with fame came new challenges. Dumi struggled to balance his creative pursuits with the pressures of making a living. His parents, who had always dreamed of seeing their son succeed, were both proud and worried about his rapid rise to fame. They urged him to focus on his studies and secure a stable job, but Dumi knew he couldn't give up on his music.

One night, after a particularly grueling show, Dumi received an offer from a record label that could change everything for him. They wanted him to sign a deal and release his first album, which would catapult him to stardom in the Indian music industry. But there was one condition: he had to move to New York City to work with their team.

Dumi knew this was an opportunity he couldn't miss. He packed his bags, said goodbye to his tearful family, and boarded a flight to the Big Apple. As he stepped off the plane, he felt a rush of excitement and nervousness. This was it â€“ his chance to make it big in the music industry. And with that, Eshan Dumas, or "Dumi" as he would soon be known, began his journey towards stardom.
