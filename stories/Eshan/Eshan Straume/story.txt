Eshan Straume stood at the edge of the dock, gazing out at the stormy sea. His dark hair was mussed, and his piercing blue eyes seemed to hold a thousand secrets. He was a man with a troubled past, haunted by memories he'd rather forget.

As a former Navy SEAL, Eshan had seen his fair share of battle. But after a tour in Afghanistan went horribly wrong, he'd found himself questioning everything - his purpose, his morality, and even his own sanity. The PTSD had taken its toll, leaving him with nightmares that still lingered to this day.

But on this particular night, Eshan wasn't here for solace. He was on a mission. A friend from his SEAL days, Alex, had gone missing while on a solo fishing trip off the coast of Maine. The Coast Guard had given up searching, but Eshan knew something was off. He'd received a cryptic text from Alex just hours before he vanished - "The Shadow is coming".

Eshan's instincts were screaming at him to investigate further. He'd been tracking the message for days, following every lead, no matter how small. And finally, he'd gotten his first real break: a sighting of Alex's boat, half-buried in the mud of a remote cove.

As Eshan made his way through the treacherous terrain, the wind howling around him like a chorus of ghosts, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He'd always been attuned to the supernatural, ever since his days as a SEAL. There were things out there that couldn't be explained, and Eshan had learned to respect their presence.

He reached the cove just as the sun dipped below the horizon. The air was thick with an otherworldly energy, and Eshan could feel it pulsing through his veins like adrenaline. He spotted Alex's boat, partially submerged in the mud, but something was off. The sails were torn, and the hull seemed... different.

Suddenly, a dark shape emerged from the darkness - tall, imposing, and unyielding. Eshan's instincts screamed at him to run, but he stood his ground. This was no ordinary shadow; this was something ancient, something that had been awakened by Alex's meddling.

Without hesitation, Eshan drew his pistol and prepared for battle. He knew what lay ahead would be a fight to the death - not just for himself, but for the soul of his friend. The storm raged on outside, but inside, Eshan was ready to face whatever horrors the Shadow had in store.
