Eshan Chia-wei was a brilliant and enigmatic young hacker who had made a name for himself in the dark corners of the internet. With his quick wit and razor-sharp mind, he could bypass even the most sophisticated security systems with ease.

But Eshan's true passion lay not in the thrill of the hack itself, but in using his skills to expose corruption and bring justice to those who had been wronged. He was a ghost in the machine, always one step ahead of his pursuers, yet driven by a strong sense of morality.

One day, Eshan received a cryptic message from an anonymous source, claiming that a powerful corporation was engaging in illicit activities that threatened the very fabric of society. The message read: "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone."

Eshan's curiosity was piqued, and he decided to take on the challenge. He arrived at the clock tower, his heart pounding with anticipation, and found himself face to face with a woman who introduced herself as "Zero Cool."
