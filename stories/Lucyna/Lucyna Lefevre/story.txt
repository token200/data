She was both thrilled and intimidated by the prospect, knowing that it would bring her art to an even wider audience. However, she was also concerned about losing her creative freedom in the process.

After much contemplation, Lucyna decided to take a risk and decline the offer. She knew that she had control over her own work, and she didn't want to compromise on her artistic vision.
