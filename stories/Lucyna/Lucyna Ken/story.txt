One rainy night, Lucyna received a cryptic message from an unknown sender, requesting her presence at an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. The note read: "Meet me at midnight. Come alone." Lucyna's curiosity was piqued, and she decided to investigate further.

As she arrived at the warehouse, Lucyna noticed that the entrance was locked, but a small window on the second floor was open. She carefully made her way inside, her eyes adjusting to the dim light.
