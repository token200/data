Lucyna Hébert stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station with a mixture of curiosity and trepidation. She had left Paris three months prior, seeking solace in the rural charm of this forgotten town, nestled deep in the heart of Normandy.

As she made her way through the station, Lucyna's thoughts drifted back to the events that had driven her away from the city. The pain of losing her fiancé, Jacques, still lingered, a constant ache that seemed to echo through every waking moment. But here, surrounded by the rustic beauty of the countryside, she hoped to find some measure of peace.

A faded sign above the station's entrance read "Saint-Pierre-de-Villiers" in peeling letters, and Lucyna felt a thrill of excitement as she set out to explore her new surroundings. She had brought few belongings with her, but a sturdy pack slung over her shoulder seemed sufficient for the time being.

As she walked through the village, Lucyna was struck by the tranquility that pervaded every aspect of life here. The air was filled with the scent of fresh bread wafting from the nearby bakery, and children's laughter carried on the breeze as they chased each other through the streets. It was a far cry from the hustle and bustle of Paris, where she had once felt lost and alone.

Lucyna's thoughts turned to Jacques once more, and she couldn't help but wonder what he would think if he saw her now, standing amidst this picturesque scene. Would he be proud of her for leaving behind the pain of their loss? Or would he be disappointed that she had failed to heal?

As she wandered through the village, Lucyna began to feel a sense of belonging, as if the very land itself was cradling her in its arms. She stopped at the local café, where she ordered a steaming cup of coffee and struck up a conversation with the barista, an elderly woman named Madame Dupont.

Over the next few hours, Lucyna learned that Madame Dupont had lived in Saint-Pierre-de-Villiers all her life, and knew every inch of its winding streets and fields. As they talked, Lucyna felt a sense of connection forming between them, one that transcended words and boundaries.

As she prepared to leave the café, Madame Dupont pressed a small package into Lucyna's hands. "For you," she said with a warm smile. "Welcome home."
