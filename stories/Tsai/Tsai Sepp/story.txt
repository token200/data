Tsai Sepp was a master swordsmith known throughout the land for his exceptional craftsmanship and attention to detail. Born as Tsai Sepp'sun, in a small village nestled in the mountains, he had always shown a keen interest in the art of swordmaking.

As a young apprentice under the tutelage of Master Kaito, Tsai Sepp'sun learned the intricacies of metalworking, tempering, and shaping blades to perfection. His dedication and natural talent quickly earned him recognition among the village elders, who encouraged him to hone his skills further.

Years passed, and Tsai Sepp'sun continued to refine his craft, experimenting with new techniques and materials.
