One day, while wandering through the bustling streets of Tokyo, Tsai stumbled upon a small, mysterious shop tucked away in a quiet alley. The sign above the door read "Curios and Wonders," and Tsai felt an inexplicable pull to enter. Inside, he found a treasure trove of peculiar artifacts and relics from all corners of the globe.

The shop's enigmatic owner, an elderly woman named Madame LeRoux, took Tsai under her wing and taught him the art of collecting and understanding the world's most remarkable curiosities. Under her guidance, Tsai Esquivel became a connoisseur of rare and unusual objects, able to decipher their histories and significance.
