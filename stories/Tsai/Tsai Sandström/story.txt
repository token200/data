Tsai Sandström stepped off the rickshaw and onto the winding streets of old Shanghai. The humid air clung to her skin like a damp shroud, but she barely noticed. She had come to this city in search of something – or someone.

As a private investigator, Tsai had seen it all: the beautiful and the cruel, the desperate and the powerful. But there was one case that still haunted her, a mystery that refused to be solved. A wealthy merchant's daughter had gone missing, leaving behind only a cryptic message etched into the wall of his opium den.

Tsai had been hired by the merchant himself to find his daughter, but so far, she had found nothing but dead ends and false leads. She knew that in this city, nothing was as it seemed, and everyone was hiding something.

As she walked through the crowded streets, Tsai's eyes scanned the faces of the people around her. She was a woman of few words, preferring to listen rather than talk. But she had heard whispers of a certain individual who might be able to help her crack the case.

She stopped at a small tea shop tucked away in a forgotten alleyway. The sign above the door read "Madame Lin's," and Tsai knew that this was a place where secrets were shared, but only with those who knew how to listen.

Inside, the air was thick with incense and the scent of jasmine flowers. Madame Lin herself sat behind the counter, her eyes piercing as she watched Tsai enter.

"So, you're looking for something," she said, her voice low and husky.

Tsai nodded, taking a seat on one of the cushions.

"I'm looking for information," she said simply.

Madame Lin's gaze seemed to bore into her soul. "I can help you," she said finally. "But it will come at a price."

Tsai nodded, knowing that in this city, everything had a price – even the truth. She leaned forward, her eyes locked on Madame Lin's.
