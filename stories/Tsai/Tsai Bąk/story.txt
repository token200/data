In the small village of Żabia Góra, nestled in the heart of medieval Poland, there lived a young apprentice blacksmith named Tsai Bąk. Born into a family of skilled craftsmen, Tsai Bąk had inherited his father's talent for shaping metal into magnificent forms.

As Tsai Bąk worked tirelessly at the anvil, hammering out swords and horseshoes, he dreamed of one day creating something truly remarkable – a masterpiece that would put him on the map. One day, while wandering through the village market, Tsai Bąk stumbled upon a mysterious patron who offered him a substantial sum for a single commission: to craft a sword adorned with intricate runes.

Intrigued by the challenge and eager for recognition, Tsai Bąk accepted the task. He spent countless hours pouring over ancient texts and seeking guidance from village wise women in search of inspiration.
