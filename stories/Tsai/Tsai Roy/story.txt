Tsai Roy was an enigmatic figure, shrouded in mystery and secrecy. He lived on the fringes of society, where the line between right and wrong blurred like the edges of a worn tapestry. Few people knew much about him, except that he had a reputation for being fiercely loyal to those he deemed worthy.

One rainy night, Tsai Roy walked into a dingy bar, his eyes scanning the room with an air of quiet intensity. He was a tall, imposing man in his mid-40s, with jet-black hair and piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into those he met. His presence commanded attention without being demanding.

The bartender, a gruff but kind-hearted woman named Lily, looked up from polishing a mug as Tsai Roy approached the bar. "What can I get you?" she asked, her voice neutral.

Tsai Roy slid onto a stool and ordered a whiskey on the rocks. As he waited for his drink to arrive, he took in the patrons of the bar: young couples holding hands, rowdy groups of friends laughing loudly, and solitary individuals nursing their own demons.

One such individual caught Tsai Roy's eye – a young woman with piercing blue eyes and porcelain skin, sipping a beer at the end of the bar. There was something about her that drew him in, like an invisible thread tugging at his heartstrings.

As he watched, the woman began to cry silently, her shoulders shaking beneath her jacket. Tsai Roy's instincts kicked in, urging him to approach her. Without thinking, he pushed back his stool and slid off onto the floor beside her.

"Lady?" he said softly, his voice a gentle rumble. "What's wrong?"

The woman looked up at him, startled, then composed herself with an effort. Tsai Roy took a seat next to her, ordering another drink for both of them as they talked through the night.

As the hours passed, Lily watched in fascination as Tsai Roy listened attentively to the young woman's story – one of heartbreak and loss that had left her feeling lost and alone. She sensed something about him that was beyond words: a quiet strength, a fierce protectiveness, and an unyielding commitment to those he cared for.

Eventually, the rain outside subsided, and Tsai Roy stood up, his eyes locked on the young woman's. "Time for you to leave," he said firmly, yet gently. "But don't worry – I'll be keeping an eye out for you."
