The result was a distinctive style that was both captivating and thought-provoking.

One of Tsai Rasmussen's most notable works was "The Ephemeral Bloom," a large-scale installation featuring delicate flowers made from paper and metal wire. The piece captured the impermanence of life, as the fragile petals were susceptible to gentle breezes and fading light.
