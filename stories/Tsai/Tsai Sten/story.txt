Tsai Sten was known for her sharp wit and quick tongue in the bustling streets of Kaohsiung's night markets. With her wild black hair tied up in a messy bun and a paint-splattered apron draped over her shoulders, she moved with the confidence of someone who had spent years perfecting her craft.

Tsai Sten was actually Tsai Yu-Hua, but few people knew this, as she had adopted the nickname "Sten" during her time working in the city's underground art scene. It was a name that suited her rough-around-the-edges demeanor and love of bold, edgy creations.

As a street artist, Tsai Sten (or Yu-Hua, depending on who you asked) spent most of her days painting vibrant murals on the city's walls, much to the dismay of local business owners. But no one could deny the impact of her work - she had a way of making even the most mundane buildings seem alive with color and energy.

One evening, as Tsai Sten was setting up her easel in the crowded market square, a young woman approached her with a curious expression on her face. "You're the one they call 'Sten'," she said, eyeing the artist's paint-splattered apron. "I've heard so much about your work."

Tsai Sten smiled wryly and nodded, wiping a smear of paint from her cheek with the back of her hand. "What do you think?" she asked, gesturing to the canvas laid out before her.

The young woman's eyes widened as she took in the swirling colors and bold shapes that Tsai Sten was creating on the spot. "It's amazing," she breathed. "You're so talented."

Tsai Sten shrugged, a small smile playing on her lips. "Just something I do," she said, her voice dripping with understatement.

As the night wore on, more and more people gathered to watch Tsai Sten paint, mesmerized by the way she brought color and life to the city's concrete streets. And though she may have been known as Sten to the world, few people knew that beneath this tough exterior lay a talented and creative soul - Tsai Yu-Hua, the artist.
