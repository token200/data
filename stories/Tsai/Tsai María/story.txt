Tsai María gazed out at the moonlit waters of Taipei's harbor, her heart heavy with the weight of secrets. A master thief and member of the infamous Black Viper gang, María had spent years perfecting her craft, earning a reputation as one of the most cunning and elusive thieves in all of Shanghai.

But tonight was different. Tonight, she had been hired to steal something far more valuable than gold or jewels – the legendary Golden Phoenix, a priceless artifact rumored to grant its owner unparalleled power over the spirits. The Black Viper gang's leader, Juan Carlos, had offered her a small fortune for the job, and María knew that this heist would cement her status as one of the greatest thieves of all time.

As she navigated the crowded streets of Taipei's old town, María slipped into the shadows, her eyes scanning the rooftops for any sign of danger. She was met with the familiar sight of neon lights reflecting off wet pavement – a world of crime and corruption that María had grown up in.

María spotted her mark, a high-rise building owned by the wealthy merchant, Mr. Lee, who was rumored to be keeping the Golden Phoenix safe within its walls. With a flicker of excitement, she set out for the building, using the cover of a street performer's music to distract the guards while she snuck in.

Inside, María expertly bypassed security cameras and alarms before reaching the display case housing the Golden Phoenix. As her fingers closed around the artifact, she felt an electric charge course through her veins – it was said that the spirit of the dragon, Yuling, would possess those who possessed the Golden Phoenix, granting them power beyond mortal comprehension.

María swiftly pocketed the artifact and made her way back to the safety of the night, knowing that Juan Carlos's men would be waiting for her. With the Golden Phoenix safely in hand, María vanished into the shadows, leaving behind a trail of myth and legend that would haunt Taipei's underworld for generations to come.

When questioned by Mr. Lee, María claimed she was just another foolish thief who had been tricked by a well-placed illusion. No one suspected that Tsai María, once a young orphan, had been secretly inducted into the ancient cult of Yuling, and was using this heist as a test of her devotion to the spirit.

As María disappeared into the darkness, the moon seemed to set its glow upon her shoulders – and those whispers began.
