Nicolás Chih-chieh stepped out of the crowded streets of Old Town and onto the quiet alleys that crisscrossed the old city. As a skilled woodworker, he had spent years honing his craft in the family shop, but tonight was different. Tonight, Nicolás Chih-chieh had received a mysterious commission to create a piece for a wealthy collector.

The letter had arrived unexpectedly, bearing an invitation to meet with the collector at their estate on the outskirts of town. Intrigued, Nicolás Chih-chieh had accepted, and now he found himself walking through the deserted streets, his hands tucked deep into his sleeves.

As he turned a corner, the grand mansion loomed before him, its stone façade glowing golden in the moonlight. A soft voice called out from within, and Nicolás Chih-chieh felt a shiver run down his spine as he pushed open the heavy door and stepped inside.

The interior was just as impressive as the exterior, with sweeping chandeliers and intricate moldings adorning every surface. The collector awaited him in a room filled with artifacts from distant lands – statues of ancient deities, tapestries woven by skilled artisans, and a few pieces that seemed to have been plucked straight from the heart of the forest.

Nicolás Chih-chieh's eyes widened as he took in the collection, his mind racing with ideas for the piece the collector had commissioned. The woman herself smiled warmly as she extended a hand, her touch light and gentle.

"Welcome, Nicolás Chih-chieh," she said, her voice dripping with an otherworldly elegance. "I'm so glad you could join me tonight. I have just the project in mind for you – something that will showcase your exceptional skills to the world."

Nicolás Chih-chieh listened intently as the woman outlined her vision: a beautifully crafted wooden box adorned with symbols from an ancient dialect, said to hold secrets of the forest within its heart. As he listened, his fingers began to itch for the wood and tools that awaited him in the shop back home.

Finally, it was time for Nicolás Chih-chieh to leave, but not before exchanging a few words with the collector about the piece they would create together. He departed under the star-studded sky, his mind whirling with ideas – eager to return to his workshop and start crafting this mysterious box for the discerning patron who had entrusted him with its creation.
