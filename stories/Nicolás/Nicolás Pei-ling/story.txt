One day, Nicolás Pei-ling received an invitation to participate in a prestigious art exhibition in Beijing, China. He was overjoyed at the opportunity and spent weeks preparing for the showcase. As he packed his bags, his mother, who had always been his biggest supporter, handed him a small gift – a handmade wooden box adorned with traditional Taiwanese patterns.

"This is for you, Nicolás Pei-ling," she said, her eyes shining with tears. "Remember where you came from and never forget your roots."

Nicolás Pei-ling's heart swelled with gratitude as he hugged his mother tightly. He knew that this exhibition was not just about showcasing his art but also about sharing a piece of Taiwanese culture with the world.

In that moment, Nicolás Pei-ling knew that he had truly found his place in the world – not just as an artist but as a representative of Taiwanese culture.
