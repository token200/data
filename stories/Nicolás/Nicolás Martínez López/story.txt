As a skilled mediator and counselor, he had earned a reputation as one of the most empathetic ears in the city.

One fateful day, Nicolás Martínez López received an urgent visit from his old friend, Sofia. Her normally vibrant demeanor had given way to a somber, haunted look that sent a shiver down his spine.
