And as he walked back through the forest, the weight of his discovery settled in, he knew that his name would be etched into the annals of botany history alongside the greatest minds.

With a sense of contentment, Nicolás Sundlöf returned to his lodgings, ready to pour over his findings and begin the process of sharing his discovery with the world. He knew that this was just the beginning – that his work would go on to inspire countless others in their own pursuit of botanical knowledge.
