Nicolás Sharma stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. It had been years since he'd set foot in Ravenswood, the small town where he grew up. As he made his way through the quiet streets, memories began to flood back – laughter with friends, adventures in the woods, and the comforting warmth of his abuela's cooking.

But that was all behind him now. Nicolás had left Ravenswood in search of a fresh start, determined to escape the painful past that still lingered in every corner of his mind. His parents' death, his own guilt over not being able to save them – the weight of it all had become crushing at times.

As he walked, the buildings began to change, becoming more weathered and worn. The streets were lined with old oak trees, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching for the sky. It was as if Ravenswood was a town frozen in time, holding onto the memories of those who came before.

Nicolás stopped outside his family's old house, feeling a mix of emotions swirl inside him. He hadn't been back to this place since he left, not even to visit his ailing abuela on her last breath. It was a betrayal, of sorts, but he couldn't help the draw of home.

He pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside, calling out into the silence. There was no answer, but that wasn't surprising. His abuela was long gone now.

As he moved through the house, Nicolás noticed small changes – new curtains on the windows, fresh paint on the walls. It seemed someone had been here while he was away, trying to erase the memories that lingered.

But they couldn't be erased so easily. The past still lingered in every room, every corner of this old house. Nicolás took a deep breath and began to unpack his bags, trying to convince himself that this new beginning would bring him peace.

It wouldn't come overnight, he knew, but perhaps in Ravenswood, he could find a way to forgive himself and start anew. As he settled into the worn couch in his old bedroom, Nicolás felt a glimmer of hope – maybe, just maybe, home was where the heart wanted to be, even if that place was scarred by the past.
