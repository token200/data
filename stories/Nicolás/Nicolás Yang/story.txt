Nicolás Yang sat in his small apartment, staring blankly at the walls as he struggled to find inspiration for his next art project. As an interdisciplinary artist and filmmaker, Nicolás had always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and human emotion, but lately, he'd found himself feeling stuck.

Growing up in a traditional Taiwanese-American family, Nicolás had always felt like an outsider. His parents, both high school sweethearts who had immigrated to the United States with dreams of building a better life for themselves and their children, valued discipline and hard work above all else. Nicolás's own creative pursuits, however, were seen as a frivolous waste of time.

Despite this, Nicolás had found solace in his art. He spent countless hours honing his skills as a painter, photographer, and filmmaker, using his medium to explore the complexities of identity and belonging that had always felt elusive to him.

As he sat in his apartment, Nicolías's mind began to wander back to his childhood. He remembered spending hours in his parents' garage, surrounded by their old VHS tapes and dusty trinkets, watching videos of Taiwanese folk music and dance performances. It was during this time that Nicolás first became fascinated with the ways in which technology could be used to tell stories and evoke emotions.

Nicolías's eyes landed on a small sketchbook that sat open on his coffee table. He had been working on a new film project, one that explored the intersection of virtual reality and traditional Taiwanese culture. As he began to scribble down notes, Nicolás felt a spark of inspiration ignite within him.

Suddenly, the walls of his apartment didn't feel so confining anymore. The familiar contours of his sketchbook became a gateway to new ideas and possibilities. Nicolías's mind was flooded with visions of vibrant colors, swirling patterns, and textures that seemed to shift and morph before his very eyes.

With renewed energy and focus, Nicolás dove headfirst into his project, pouring all of his passion and creativity onto the page. As he worked, he felt his parents' words echoing in his mind: "Discipline is key." But for Nicolías, discipline wasn't about conformity; it was about embracing his unique vision and bringing it to life.
