Nicolás Briedis stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. It had been years since he'd set foot in this small town, and yet the familiar sights and smells still transported him back to a time when life was simpler.

As a child, Nicolás Briedis had spent summers with his grandparents on the outskirts of town, where they raised chickens and grew their own vegetables. The summers were long and lazy, filled with days spent exploring the woods and chasing after fireflies. His grandparents taught him how to fish and weave baskets from reeds.

Years passed, and Nicolás Briedis left the town to make a life for himself in the city. He became a successful businessman, but the success came at a cost. The long hours and endless stress took their toll on his relationships and his health.

Now, as he stood on the platform, Nicolás Briedis felt a sense of restlessness wash over him. He'd been feeling unfulfilled for months, like something was missing from his life. The thought of returning to this small town had seemed absurd at first, but as the days turned into weeks, it began to feel more and more appealing.

As he walked through the station, Nicolás Briedis noticed a familiar figure standing by the ticket counter - his childhood friend, Sofia. She smiled when she saw him, and Nicolás Briedis felt a warmth spread through his chest.

"Welcome back, Nicolás," Sofia said, using his full name for the first time in years. "It's been too long."

Nicolás Briedis took a seat next to her, feeling the weight of his responsibilities slowly lift. He knew that returning to this small town wouldn't be easy - there would be people who expected him to succeed, who wanted him to stay in the city and make a name for himself.

But as he looked out at the familiar landscape, Nicolás Briedis felt a sense of peace wash over him. Maybe it was time to take a step back and reevaluate his priorities. Maybe it was time to find a simpler way of living, one that included more time with family and friends, rather than just accumulating wealth.

As the train pulled away from the station, Nicolás Briedis stood up, feeling a sense of excitement for what lay ahead. He knew that he still had a lot to learn about himself, but he was ready to take the first step on a new journey - one that would lead him back to his roots and towards a more authentic way of living.
