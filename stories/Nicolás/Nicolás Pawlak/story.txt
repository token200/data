Nicolás Pawlak sat in his small, cluttered office, staring blankly at the stack of papers on his desk. As the head of security for the prestigious Bellvue Museum, he had been tasked with protecting one of the most valuable collections of artifacts in the world.

Just then, the phone on his desk rang, shrill in the quiet atmosphere. Nicolás Pawlak picked up the receiver, expecting it to be another security concern or routine check-in from his team. Instead, it was the museum's curator, Dr. Emma Taylor.

"Nick, I need your expertise," she said, her voice urgent. "One of our most prized artifacts has gone missing."

Nicolás Pawlak's eyes narrowed as he listened intently to Dr. Taylor's description of the stolen item: a rare, ancient Egyptian sarcophagus. He immediately sprang into action, his mind racing with possibilities.

He quickly gathered his team and began reviewing the security footage from the previous night. After several minutes of fast-forwarding through hours of uneventful footage, they finally caught a glimpse of someone suspicious lurking around the exhibit hall.

Nicolás Pawlak's eyes scanned the image, committing every detail to memory. The perpetrator was tall, with dark hair and a distinctive tattoo on their neck. It looked eerily familiar.

As he examined the footage further, Nicolás Pawlak realized that the man in question bore an uncanny resemblance to one of his old associates, Viktor Kuznetsov. They had been acquaintances during Nicolás Pawlak's time working in Eastern European security.

He quickly dialed Viktor's number, hoping that their connection might lead to a breakthrough in solving the case. After several rings, Viktor answered, sounding guarded over the phone.

"Nicolás, what's this about?" he asked warily.

"I think you know exactly what I'm talking about, Viktor," Nicolás Pawlak replied, his voice measured. "The sarcophagus from Bellvue Museum. Tell me, did you have anything to do with its disappearance?"

There was a pause on the other end of the line before Viktor spoke up, his tone laced with regret.

"Nicolás, I can explain—"

But Nicolás Pawlak wasn't having it. He knew that explanation would only lead to more questions and complications.

"I want you to come in for questioning," he said firmly, hanging up on Viktor before he could respond.

As the sun dipped below the city skyline, Nicolás Pawlak couldn't shake off the feeling that this case was far from closed – not yet.
