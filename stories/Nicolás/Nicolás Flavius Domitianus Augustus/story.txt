In the scorching deserts of Rome, a young man named Nicolás Flavius Domitianus Augustus roamed, seeking solace in the ancient traditions of his ancestors. As a member of the imperial family, Nicolás had been groomed to take the throne, but he felt suffocated by the weight of responsibility.

One day, while wandering through the bustling markets, Nicolás stumbled upon a wise old man who sensed his inner turmoil. The old sage listened intently as Nicolás recounted his feelings of disillusionment with the imperial life. With a knowing glint in his eye, the old man offered words of wisdom: "Your name is a burden, young one. You are Nicolás Flavius Domitianus Augustus, but do you truly know yourself?"

Intrigued, Nicolás asked the old man to explain. The sage replied, "You were born into greatness, yet you struggle to find your place within it. Your name echoes the grandeur of emperors past, but what does it say about your own desires and passions?" The young man was taken aback by the old man's words.

As Nicolás continued his journey, he began to question everything he thought he knew about himself and his role in the empire. He started to explore new interests and connect with people from different walks of life, unshackled by the expectations of his title. The more he wandered, the more he realized that being a leader wasn't just about wielding power but also about understanding oneself.

Months passed, and Nicolás returned to Rome, no longer content to simply follow in the footsteps of his predecessors. He sought to forge a new path, one that balanced his royal duties with a deeper understanding of himself and his place in the world. As he stood before the Senate, his voice steady and confident, they looked upon him as Nicolás Flavius Domitianus Augustus, but now they saw something more – a leader who had found his own way, guided by the wisdom of the wise old man's words: "Know yourself."
