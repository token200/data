Born Nicolás Ivanovich Kovalchuk on a chilly winter morning in Moscow, Russia, Nikolai's love affair with ironing began at a young age.

The crowd that had gathered to watch him marvel at Nicolás Kovalchuk's skill, their faces aglow with wonder. Some cheered as he expertly smoothed out a stubborn crease, while others gasped in awe as he produced a silky-smooth finish from even the most recalcitrant of fabrics.

When the task was complete, Nicolás Kovalchuk stepped back to survey his handiwork, a triumphant smile spreading across his face. He had done it again – proved once more that he was the master of extreme ironing, the one and only Nicolás Ivanovich Kovalchuk.
