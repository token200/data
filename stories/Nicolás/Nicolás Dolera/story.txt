Nicolás Dolera stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of life. The patrons were few and far between, sipping on their coffee or typing away on their laptops. He spotted a vacant table by the window and made his way towards it.

As he sat down, he noticed a young woman sitting across from him, her eyes fixed on her phone. Nicolás Dolera couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. It was as if he had seen this same look before, one that spoke of longing and isolation.

The woman looked up, catching his gaze. She smiled weakly, and Nicolás Dolera felt a pang in his chest. He introduced himself, and they began to talk.

Her name was Sophia, and she was a writer, struggling to find her voice in the world. Nicolás Dolera listened intently as she spoke of her dreams and aspirations. He couldn't help but see a little bit of himself in her, a sense of restlessness that came from chasing one's passions.

As they talked, the café began to fill with more patrons. The noise level increased, and Nicolás Dolera found himself becoming distracted. Sophia, however, remained focused, her eyes locked onto his as if searching for something.

"What are you looking for?" Nicolás Dolera asked, breaking the silence.

Sophia hesitated before answering. "I'm looking for inspiration," she said. "A spark to set my words ablaze."

Nicolás Dolera smiled wistfully. He knew that feeling all too well. It was a constant companion on his own journey, one that had led him to this café and to Sophia.

As they parted ways, Nicolás Dolera couldn't help but feel a sense of hope. Maybe, just maybe, he had found what he was looking for in Sophia – a kindred spirit who understood the struggles and triumphs of chasing one's dreams. And as he walked out into the bright sunlight, he felt a sense of purpose wash over him, knowing that he would see Sophia again soon.
