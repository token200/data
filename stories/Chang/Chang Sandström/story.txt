Chang Sandström stood at the edge of the vast, empty plain, gazing out at the seemingly endless horizon. The wind whipped through her dark hair, and she raised a hand to shield her eyes from the glare of the twin suns. As the last child of a long line of nomadic warriors, Chang Sandström was no stranger to the unforgiving vastness of the steppes.

Her full name, which meant "River Breeze" in the ancient tongue, had been given to her by her grandmother, who claimed it was a sign of good fortune. Chang Sandström had always felt like an outsider among her tribe, with her quiet demeanor and affinity for the ancient stories that spoke of a long-forgotten past.

Despite this, she had proven herself to be a skilled huntress and warrior, earning the respect of her elders. Now, at the age of 25, Chang Sandström was preparing to embark on a perilous journey across the steppes, one that would take her to the distant lands beyond the known world.

With a deep breath, she shouldered her pack and set off, following the ancient tracks etched into the wind-swept earth. The suns beat down upon her as she rode, the rhythmic thud of hooves on the hard ground echoing through the stillness. Chang Sandström's thoughts turned to her grandmother, who had passed away just a year prior. She knew that this journey was not just about exploration, but also about keeping her grandmother's memory alive.

As the days passed, the landscape shifted from vast grasslands to rocky outcroppings and finally, to the towering spires of a long-abandoned city. Chang Sandström dismounted at its entrance, her eyes drinking in the sight of crumbling stone and overgrown vegetation. She knew that she was not the first to tread this path; many had come before her, seeking secrets and treasures lost to the sands of time.

With reverence, she entered the ancient metropolis, her footsteps echoing off the walls. And as she walked, the wind whispered an unheard name in her ear: Chang Sandström, River Breeze, a traveler of legend born from the very breath of the steppes themselves.
