Her abuela, Lucia García Márquez, had been a key figure in the neighborhood's struggles for social justice and equality. Chang remembered the stories Abuela used to tell her about the strikes, protests, and community gatherings that brought the residents together.

One day, while exploring the attic of their family home, Chang stumbled upon an old trunk filled with letters, photographs, and newspaper clippings.

Never forget the struggles of those who came before us, and continue to fight for a brighter future."

Touched by Abuela's words, Chang felt a sense of determination wash over her. She knew that she wanted to follow in her family's footsteps, using her voice to amplify the voices of those who had been silenced.
