Chang García Martínez raised an eyebrow but nodded graciously and allowed the artist to unfold his drawing on the table. She examined it with interest, her expression unreadable.

"Your talent is undeniable," she said finally. "But tell me, what drives you to create?"

The artist hesitated before answering, "I want to capture life in all its beauty and complexity – just like your work does."

Chang García Martínez leaned back in her chair, the corners of her mouth curving upwards into a faint smile.

"That's exactly why I do what I do," she said quietly. "To shed light on the hidden corners of this world."

With that, she stood up, tucked a few bills into her bag, and disappeared into the night as suddenly as she had appeared. The young artist watched in awe, unsure if he'd really met Chang García Martínez or merely imagined the encounter.

As for Chang García Martínez, she vanished into the darkness, leaving behind only whispers of her next move – a mysterious smile etched on her face, forever ready to appear and disappear at will.
