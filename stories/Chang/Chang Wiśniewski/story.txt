Chang Wiśniewski stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station with a mixture of curiosity and wariness. She had been traveling for days, and the smell of smoke and grease clung to her like a shroud.

As she made her way through the crowded concourse, Chang's mind wandered back to the letter she had received just a week ago. It was from an old acquaintance, inviting her to visit the city of Ashenhold. She had never been one for sentimental gestures or nostalgic reunions, but something about the letter had struck a chord.

Chang had always felt like an outsider, even among her own people. Her mixed heritage and unconventional upbringing made it difficult for her to find her place in the world. But there was something about Ashenhold that drew her in – perhaps it was the promise of anonymity or the whispered rumors of a secret society waiting to be uncovered.

She spotted a familiar face amidst the throng, a hooded figure who beckoned her towards a narrow alleyway. Chang's hand instinctively went to the dagger at her belt, but something about the figure's gesture put her on edge rather than alarm. She followed them through the winding streets, passing by vendors and performers in a haze of smoke and music.

Finally, they arrived at a dilapidated townhouse, adorned with symbols and sigils that Chang recognized from her research. The hooded figure pushed open the door, revealing a dimly lit room filled with the scent of old books and burning incense. "Welcome, Chang Wiśniewski," a low voice said, as she stepped inside.

Chang's eyes adjusted slowly to the dim light, taking in the eclectic decorations and the figure revealed behind the hood – an elderly woman with piercing green eyes. "I've been waiting for you, young one," the old woman said, her voice dripping with warmth and authority.
