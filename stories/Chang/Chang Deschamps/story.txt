Chang Deschamps stepped out of his worn leather jacket and onto the dusty streets of Shanghai. The neon lights of the city reflected off his eyes, a piercing blue that seemed to hold secrets of its own. A former thief and con artist, Deschamps had turned his life around after serving time in prison. He now worked as a private investigator, using his skills to help those in need.

As he walked into the crowded bar, Deschamps spotted a familiar face - Lian, an old flame with connections to the Shanghai underworld. She slid onto the stool beside him, her slender fingers tracing the curves of a whiskey glass.

"What brings you here, Lian?" Deschamps asked, taking a seat next to her.

"Information," she replied, her voice husky as silk. "I need someone with your particular set of skills."

Deschamps raised an eyebrow. He had worked with Lian before, but their partnership was always tenuous at best. Still, his curiosity got the better of him.

"What's the job?" he asked, taking a sip from his own whiskey glass.

"It seems that one of our... associates has gone missing," she said, using the word with a hint of reluctance. "A young girl, barely 18 years old. The family is offering a substantial reward for her safe return."

Deschamps' expression turned skeptical. He had heard rumors of Lian's associates getting involved in the kind of activities that didn't exactly... jibe with the law.

"What makes you think I can help?" he asked, trying to gauge her sincerity.

Lian leaned in close, her voice barely above a whisper. "I know you have connections, Chang. Connections that might lead us to your missing girl."

Deschamps nodded, his eyes locked on Lian's face. He knew that this could be the break they needed, but he also sensed something more - an ulterior motive hidden beneath the surface.

With a nod, Deschamps agreed to take the case. As they left the bar together, the city lights swirling around them like a vortex, he couldn't shake the feeling that there was more at play here than met the eye. And he was determined to find out what it was before things went south.
