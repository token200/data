In the bustling streets of Riga, Latvia, there lived a young woman named Chang Bērziņa. She was a brilliant engineer and inventor, known for her innovative solutions to complex problems. With her wild curly hair and bright green eyes, Chang Bērziņa stood out in a crowd, but it was her intellect that truly set her apart.

Over the next few years, Chang Bērziņa worked tirelessly with her team, designing and building a state-of-the-art spacecraft that would take them on a journey to the red planet.
