Chang Angel Silvestre's latest mark was the wealthy businessman, Marquez. He had been hiding his fortune in a safe deposit box at the exclusive Banco de Oro, but Chang Angel Silvestre had other plans. Under the cover of night, she snuck into the bank, avoiding the guards with ease. Her eyes scanned the room, locking onto the target: the safe deposit box labeled "M.M."

With precision and speed, Chang Angel Silvestre opened the box, her hands moving with a life of their own. Inside, she found a treasure trove of gold coins, precious jewels, and a small, intricately carved wooden box. The latter caught her eye, its intricate patterns and symbols a mystery waiting to be solved.

As she disappeared into the night, Chang Angel Silvestre couldn't shake off the feeling that this was only the beginning. The wooden box was calling to her, whispering secrets and stories of a long-forgotten past. She knew that she had stumbled upon something much bigger than herself, and that her life would never be the same.

With the treasure safely in hand, Chang Angel Silvestre vanished into the shadows, ready to face whatever lay ahead. Her reputation as a master thief was cemented, but she knew that this latest mark had been just a stepping stone on a journey that would take her to the very limits of her skills and her courage.
