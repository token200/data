Chang Cooper stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the familiar scene before him. The station was small, with a single waiting room that served as both a refuge for weary travelers and a hub for local gossip.

As he made his way through the door, the bell above it let out a friendly chime, announcing Chang's return to the town of Willow Creek. He had been away for a few months, working in the city, but he was eager to get back home and reconnect with old friends.

Chang's thoughts turned to his Aunt Mui, who owned the local bakery and had taken him under her wing when he first arrived in town as a young boy. She would have treats waiting for him, no doubt, and Chang's stomach growled at the prospect.

As he walked into the bakery, the sweet scent of fresh bread enveloped him, and his aunt looked up from behind the counter with a warm smile. "Ah, chang! Welcome back!" she exclaimed, using the nickname she had given him all those years ago.

Chang smiled back, feeling a sense of homecoming wash over him. "Hey, Aunt Mui," he replied, giving her a hug. "It's good to be back."

Aunt Mui led him into the kitchen, where a tray of freshly baked bao was cooling on the counter. Chang's eyes widened as she handed him a still-warm pastry, and he took a bite, feeling the flaky crust and soft fillings melt in his mouth.

The afternoon passed in a blur of visits to old haunts - the park where he had played as a child, the movie theater where he had sneaked in to watch forbidden films, and the coffee shop where he had first met his friends. Chang felt like a kid again, carefree and content.

As the sun began to set, Chang made his way home, feeling grateful for this small town that had been his refuge and his playground all these years. He knew that life would take him away from Willow Creek again someday, but for now, he was happy to be back where it felt like home.

Aunt Mui's words echoed in his mind as he drifted off to sleep: "Home is where the heart is, chang. And your heart is here."
