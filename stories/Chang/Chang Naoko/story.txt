Chang Naoko sat alone in her small Tokyo apartment, staring blankly at the walls as the rain poured down outside. It had been a long time since she'd felt this way - lost and disconnected from the world around her. As Chang Naoko, she was known for her sharp wit and quick tongue, but tonight, even those tools felt like nothing more than a shield to hide behind.

She thought back to her childhood in rural Korea, where her family had been forced to flee during the war. Her parents had instilled in her a strong sense of resilience and adaptability, skills that had served her well as she navigated the ups and downs of life. But now, at 30 years old, Chang Naoko felt like she was stuck in neutral.

She sighed and stood up, padding over to the kitchen to make herself a cup of tea. As she waited for the kettle to boil, she couldn't help but think about her relationships - or lack thereof. She had given up on love, convinced that it was just another unattainable dream like all the others.

The tea finally ready, Chang Naoko sat back down at the table and took a sip. It was hot and comforting, just what she needed. She closed her eyes and let the steam rise up to her face, feeling a tiny sense of calm wash over her.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. Chang Naoko's heart skipped a beat as she wondered who it could be. She hadn't expected any visitors tonight. She hesitated for a moment before getting up to answer the door.

To her surprise, it was her best friend, Yumi, standing on her doorstep with a big smile on her face. "I brought dinner," Yumi said, holding out a steaming hot plate of Korean fried chicken. Chang Naoko's eyes lit up as she took the plate from her friend. Maybe, just maybe, this night wouldn't be so bad after all.

As they sat down to eat together, Chang Naoko felt a weight lift off her shoulders. With Yumi by her side, she knew that anything was possible. And for the first time in months, Chang Naoko felt like herself again - strong, resilient, and ready to take on whatever life threw her way.
