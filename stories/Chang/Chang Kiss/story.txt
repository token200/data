Chang Kiss was known for his mysterious past and his unparalleled skill with a blade. Born as Zhang Wei Min, he had grown up on the streets of Beijing, where he quickly learned to rely only on himself. As he honed his fighting skills, he began to adopt the persona of Chang Kiss, a name that struck fear into the hearts of those who crossed him.

One day, while taking on a particularly tough opponent in an underground fighting ring, Chang Kiss caught the attention of a wealthy collector named Victor Vex. Vex was impressed by Chang Kiss's skill and agility, and he offered him a deal: work for him and gain access to the world's most exotic and powerful artifacts.

Chang Kiss agreed, and soon found himself working as Vex's personal bodyguard and enforcer. He traveled the globe, taking on missions that required his unique set of skills. From infiltrating high-security facilities to eliminating targets with ease, Chang Kiss proved himself to be a valuable asset to Vex's organization.

As time passed, however, Chang Kiss began to feel a growing sense of unease. He was trapped in a life he didn't choose, forced to carry out the bidding of a man who seemed to have no qualms about using violence and intimidation to get what he wanted. Despite his reservations, Chang Kiss continued to work for Vex, knowing that it was a means to an end.

His ultimate goal was to escape the web of deceit and corruption that had entangled him, and to reclaim control over his own destiny. But until then, he would continue to walk the fine line between loyalty and betrayal, always staying one step ahead of those who sought to do him harm.

Chang Kiss knew that if anyone discovered the truth about his past, it would be Victor Vex's worst nightmare come true. The name Zhang Wei Min was a secret that Chang Kiss would die to protect, and he would stop at nothing to ensure that his true identity remained hidden forever.

With every step, Chang Kiss drew closer to freedom. But until then, the mask of Chang Kiss would remain firmly in place, protecting him from the world and keeping his secrets safe.
