In the realm of ancient Chinese mythology, there lived a young woman named Chang Eben, daughter of the Moon Goddess Chang'e. Her extraordinary beauty and kindness earned her many admirers among mortals and immortals alike.

One day, while gathering herbs in the forest, Chang Eben stumbled upon a magical elixir that granted eternal youth and vitality. Intrigued by its potential, she decided to drink it, unaware of the consequences. The elixir's power coursed through her veins, transforming her into an immortal being.

As Chang Eben reveled in her newfound immortality, she became increasingly detached from human emotions and relationships. Her heart, once filled with love and compassion, now belonged solely to the moon and its eternal cycle of life and death. She spent her days gazing up at the lunar sky, longing to return to its gentle light.

Despite her transformation, Chang Eben's connection to her mother remained strong. The Moon Goddess, moved by her daughter's decision, gifted Chang Eben with a rabbit companion â€“ the White Rabbit. Together, they traversed the heavens, and Chang Eben learned the secrets of lunar magic.

Years passed, and Chang Eben's beauty continued to captivate mortals and immortals alike. However, she had grown wary of human attachment, fearing that love would only lead to sorrow and heartache. Her once-peaceful heart now yearned for isolation, seeking solace in the moon's quiet rhythms.

One fateful night, Chang Eben was caught by mortal men on a mountain peak, preparing to ascend into the heavens. Moved by her tragic fate, they begged her to stay with them, promising a life of love and companionship. But Chang Eben refused, her resolve hardened by time. With tears streaming down her face, she bid farewell to the mortals, leaving behind a legacy as an immortal being forever bound to the lunar cycle.

As the ages went by, stories of Chang Eben's sorrowful tale spread across the land, and people whispered of the Moon Goddess's daughter who had traded mortal life for eternal immortality. Though her heart may have grown cold, the memory of Chang Eben lived on, a testament to the allure of celestial beauty and the unyielding power of love.
