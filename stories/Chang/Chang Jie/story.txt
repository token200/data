Chang Jie stepped off the crowded bus and onto the bustling streets of Shanghai. The neon lights reflected off the wet pavement, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the pavement. She weaved through the throngs of people, her black hair tied back in a ponytail as she made her way to the small café on the corner.

Inside, the air was thick with the scent of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of conversation. Chang Jie spotted her friend, Liang, hunched over a laptop, typing away with a look of intense focus. She slid into the empty seat across from him, dropping her bag onto the floor with a satisfying thud.

"What's got you so worked up?" Chang Jie asked, peering at the screen as Liang nodded absently.

"I'm trying to finish this paper for my thesis," Liang replied, not looking up. "I've been stuck on it for weeks."

Chang Jie smiled sympathetically, taking a sip of her coffee. She knew the feeling all too well. The two friends had met in college, bonding over their shared love of philosophy and poetry.

As they chatted, Chang Jie's mind began to wander back to her own project – a collection of short stories inspired by the works of Chinese mythology. She was determined to publish them someday, but the words just wouldn't come.

Liang noticed her distraction and raised an eyebrow. "What's on your mind?" he asked, his tone teasing.

Chang Jie hesitated before launching into a rambling account of her writing woes. Liang listened intently, nodding along as she spoke.

Just then, the café door swung open and a young woman slipped inside, her eyes scanning the room with an air of desperation. Chang Jie felt a pang of recognition – it was Wei, a fellow writer who had been struggling to find her voice.

Without hesitation, Chang Jie jumped up from her seat and made her way over to Wei's table. "Hey, what's going on?" she asked, taking the other woman's hand in hers.

Wei explained that she was feeling lost and uncertain about her writing, just as Chang Jie had been feeling earlier. The two women sat down together, commiserating over their shared struggles.

As they talked, something shifted inside Chang Jie. She realized that sometimes, all it took was a friend to help you find your way again – and sometimes, all it took was a little bit of advice from someone who had been where she was before. With newfound determination, Chang Jie closed her eyes, letting the words flow onto the page as they seemed to pour out of her like a river.
