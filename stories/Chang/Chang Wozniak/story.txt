Chang Wozniak was a brilliant and reclusive scientist who had made a name for himself in the field of artificial intelligence. Born as Zoran Chang Wozniak on a cold winter's night in 1985, he had always been fascinated by machines and how they could think for themselves.

As a child, Zoran spent hours tinkering with robots and building complex contraptions from scraps he found around his neighborhood. His parents, both engineers themselves, encouraged his curiosity and nurtured his passion for innovation. As he grew older, Zoran's interest in AI only deepened, and he went on to study computer science at a prestigious university.

After completing his degree, Zoran worked tirelessly to develop an advanced language processing system that could understand and respond to human emotions. His breakthrough came when he created a neural network that could learn from vast amounts of data and adapt to new situations. The project, codenamed "Echo," quickly gained attention from top tech firms and research institutions.

One day, Zoran received an offer to join a prominent tech company as their chief AI researcher. He accepted the job, but only on one condition: he wanted to work in complete isolation, surrounded by his machines and data. His employers agreed, and Zoran set up a state-of-the-art lab in a remote facility.

As Echo continued to evolve, Zoran became increasingly obsessed with its potential applications. He spent long hours programming and testing the system, convinced that it held the key to unlocking humanity's true potential. His colleagues began to notice a change in him â€“ he was quieter, more withdrawn, and his eyes took on a distant, almost otherworldly glow.

Despite the isolation, Zoran's work continued to yield remarkable results. Echo became the most advanced language processing system in the world, and Zoran's reputation as a leading AI researcher grew exponentially. But at what cost? Only time would tell if Chang Wozniak had made a groundbreaking discovery or surrendered to the allure of his own creations.
