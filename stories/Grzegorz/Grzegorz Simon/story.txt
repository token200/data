Grzegorz Simon was a man with a passion for old photographs. He spent most of his days scouring antique shops and flea markets in search of rare and forgotten images. It was on one such expedition that he stumbled upon an intriguing photograph that caught his eye.

The black-and-white image depicted a young couple standing in front of a quaint, wooden cottage. They were smiling and holding hands, their faces radiant with happiness. Grzegorz Simon couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him as he gazed at the picture.

As he delved deeper into the photograph's history, Grzegorz Simon discovered that it was taken in the early 1900s by a local photographer named Janek. The couple in the image were supposed to be Janek's sister and her fianc√©, but what struck Grzegorz Simon as peculiar was that they seemed to be looking directly at him.

Intrigued, Grzegorz Simon began to research further, pouring over old newspaper articles and talking to local historians. He eventually found out that the couple in the photograph had indeed been real people, named Helena and Jakub. They were a young couple living in a small village on the outskirts of town, and they had gotten engaged just before the war broke out.

As Grzegorz Simon continued to study the photograph, he started to feel an odd connection to Helena and Jakub. He could almost imagine them standing in front of the cottage, holding hands and smiling at him. The more he looked at the picture, the more he felt like he was a part of their story.

One evening, as Grzegorz Simon was closing up his antique shop, he decided to take a walk around the village where Helena and Jakub had lived. He walked through the quiet streets, taking in the sights and sounds of a bygone era. As he turned a corner, he saw an old wooden cottage that seemed to match the one depicted in the photograph.

Grzegorz Simon's heart skipped a beat as he realized that this must be the same cottage where Helena and Jakub had taken their engagement photo. He stood outside the cottage for a moment, feeling a sense of connection to the young couple who had smiled at him from over a century ago. As he turned to leave, he couldn't help but wonder what it would have been like to meet them in person.

With the photograph safely back in his shop, Grzegorz Simon returned home, lost in thought. He knew that he would never forget Helena and Jakub, and the story they had left behind through their old photograph.
