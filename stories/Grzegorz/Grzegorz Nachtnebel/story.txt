One fateful night, Grzegorz Janusz Nachtnebel received a cryptic message from an old acquaintance, hinting at a lucrative opportunity that required his unique set of skills. The message read: "Meet me at the old windmill on the outskirts of town at midnight. Come alone."

With a quiet determination, he made his decision - one that would change the course of history and cement his place in the shadows as Grzegorz Janusz Nachtnebel, master of the night.
