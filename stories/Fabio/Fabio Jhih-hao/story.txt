Despite the whirlwind of attention surrounding him, Fabio Jhih-hao remained humble and true to his roots. He continued to create art that was deeply rooted in Taiwanese culture, while also pushing the boundaries of what was possible with street art. And as he stood in front of one of his murals, watching the crowds gather and admire his work, he couldn't help but smile – for he knew that he had truly made it as an artist, and that his name, Fabio Jhih-hao, would be remembered for years to come.
