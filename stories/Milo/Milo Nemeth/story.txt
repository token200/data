Milo Nemeth stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the bustling streets of downtown Seattle. As a freelance journalist, he had grown accustomed to working late hours, chasing down leads and sniffing out stories that others might miss. With his trusty notebook and pen slung over his shoulder, Milo set out to uncover the truth behind the city's latest scandal.

As he walked, the sounds of the city gave way to the soft hum of a nearby café. Milo ducked inside, shaking the rain from his jacket as he scanned the room for a familiar face. That's when he spotted her – Lena Grant, a fellow journalist and old friend. The two had worked together on countless stories over the years, and Milo knew he could count on Lena to provide valuable insight.

"Hey, Nemeth," Lena said with a smile, spotting him across the room. "What brings you out tonight?"

Milo slid into the booth beside her, ordering a black coffee as he began to explain his latest assignment. "I'm working on a piece about city corruption," he said, pulling out his notebook and flipping through the pages. "There's something big brewing, and I think I can get to the bottom of it."

Lena listened intently, her eyes narrowing as she processed the information. When Milo finished speaking, she nodded thoughtfully. "I might be able to help you dig deeper," she said. "Let me make a few calls and see what I can turn up."

As they talked, Milo's thoughts turned to his family – his parents, Mark and Rachel Nemeth, who had instilled in him a strong sense of journalism ethics from a young age. His sister, Ava, was still working as a lawyer, but she often found herself at odds with their father over the city's most contentious issues.

The night wore on, with Milo and Lena working tirelessly to uncover the truth behind the corruption scandal. It wasn't until just after midnight that they finally stumbled upon a break in the case – a cryptic message from an anonymous source that promised to reveal the full extent of the city's corruption. With this new information, Milo knew he was one step closer to exposing the truth – and bringing justice to the people of Seattle.
