Milo Singh trudged through the misty streets, her eyes fixed on the small café in front of her. It was the one place where she could escape the chaos that had been following her for weeks. The city seemed to be spinning out of control, with protests and riots erupting every night. Milo's best friend, Rachel, had been arrested during a protest a few days ago, and Milo couldn't shake off the feeling of guilt for not being there to protect her.

As she pushed open the door, the bell above it rang out, and the owner, Mrs. Kumar, looked up from behind the counter. "Milo! Come in, come in," she said, with a warm smile.

Milo took a seat at the small table by the window, watching as the rain dripped down outside. She had always loved this café, with its old wooden furniture and worn rugs. It was like stepping into a different world, one where time stood still.

Mrs. Kumar brought her a steaming cup of chai, and Milo took a sip, feeling the warmth spread through her body. "What's wrong, beta?" Mrs. Kumar asked, using the affectionate term for daughter. Milo shook her head, unable to explain the knot in her stomach.

Just then, Rachel walked in, her arms covered in bruises. Milo rushed over to hug her tightly, tears of relief welling up in her eyes. "I'm so sorry," she whispered into Rachel's ear. Rachel pulled back, looking at her with concern. "What are you talking about? I was fine, Milo. Just a little rough around the edges."

Milo forced herself to calm down, taking a deep breath as she looked at Rachel's battered face. They had been friends since college, and she would do anything to protect her. The city might be falling apart, but in this small café, surrounded by people who cared about each other, Milo felt like she could finally breathe.

As they sipped their chai together, Mrs. Kumar slipped them a plate of warm samosas. "On the house," she said with a smile. Milo and Rachel exchanged a look, both of them grateful for this tiny oasis in the midst of chaos. In that moment, they knew that no matter what happened next, they would face it together, as long as they had each other.

As they finished their tea, the rain outside seemed to wash away some of its intensity, leaving behind a faint glow on the horizon. Milo smiled at Rachel, feeling a sense of hope she hadn't felt in weeks. Maybe, just maybe, things would get better after all.
