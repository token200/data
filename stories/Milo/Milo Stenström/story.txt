Milo Stenström stepped out of his small cottage, breathing in the crisp morning air. The sun was just starting to rise over the frozen lake in front of him, casting a golden glow over the snow-covered trees. It was a typical winter's day on the Swedish forest lakeside, and Milo felt most at peace.

He lived alone, but not by choice. After his wife passed away a year ago, he'd found it hard to shake off the feeling of emptiness that followed her. But as the seasons changed, he began to notice the beauty in the world around him – the way the snowflakes danced in the air, the sound of the loons calling on the lake's surface.

Milo had always been a fisherman at heart, but it wasn't until his wife passed away that he found solace in the simple act of waiting by the water. He'd spend hours out here, watching the world go by, and listening to the silence.

As he walked towards the lake, Milo noticed a piece of paper stuck between two rocks. He carefully pulled it out, smoothing it with his gloved hand. It was a note, scribbled in his wife's handwriting – the same words she used to write when they were on vacation together:

"Meet me at the old oak tree at sunset. I love you."

Tears pricked at the corners of Milo's eyes as he unfolded the paper again, reading it one more time. It was a promise, a reminder that even though she was gone, their bond remained unbroken.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Milo made his way to the old oak tree. The sun had dipped below the horizon by then, casting a warm orange glow over the forest floor. He sat down on a nearby log, feeling the rough wood beneath him.

As the stars began to twinkle in the night sky, Milo closed his eyes and listened to the sounds of nature – the creaking of branches, the hooting of owls. It was a lullaby, a reminder that he wasn't alone.

In this moment, Milo felt his wife's presence with him, even though she was no longer physically by his side. He knew she'd want him to be happy, to find joy in the world around him. And as he sat there under the stars, surrounded by the peacefulness of nature, Milo realized that perhaps he wasn't alone after all – not truly.
