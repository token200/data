Milo was more than thrilled at the opportunity to share her passion with others. With her team, they set out to create a haven for plants and people alike, where they could coexist in harmony with nature. And so, under Milo Kalēja's guidance, the "Kalējiana Luxurians Garden" flourished, becoming a beacon of hope for a sustainable future.
