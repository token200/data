Milo Taro was a man with an uncanny ability to sense the world's energy. He walked down city streets, feeling the vibrations of passersby footsteps, the hum of streetlights, and the whir of cars passing by. His fingers would tingle as he passed beneath buildings, alerting him to hidden drafts or air leaks.

As a child, Milo had always been sensitive to these subtleties. His parents, both engineers, had thought it a quirk, but as he grew older, they realized their son's gift was genuine. They encouraged his sensitivity, teaching him how to channel it into useful skills – like predicting weather patterns or finding hidden water leaks.

Years passed, and Milo honed his abilities, becoming an indispensable asset in the city's infrastructure. He worked with architects to design buildings that hummed in harmony with their surroundings, using his intuitive understanding of energy flow. He tracked air quality levels, advising policymakers on how to reduce pollutants and improve urban health.

But as Milo delved deeper into the world of urban resonance, he began to notice strange occurrences. Buildings seemed to "sick" or malfunction when the energy was off-balance. People's emotions would bleed into their surroundings, affecting the atmosphere around them. The more he listened, the more he felt an eerie connection to his city.

One fateful night, Milo sensed a particularly strong resonance emanating from the abandoned skyscraper on the outskirts of town. As he approached the crumbling structure, he felt a shiver run down his spine. He stepped inside and let the energy flow through him. The air seemed to vibrate with an otherworldly frequency.

Suddenly, visions burst into his mind – echoes of forgotten lives, whispers from the past, and whispers from the city itself. It was as if the building was speaking to him, sharing secrets of its own turbulent history. The images blurred, but Milo felt a spark ignite within him.

He realized that his sensitivity wasn't just about feeling the world's energy; it was also about listening to the stories hidden beneath its surface. From that moment on, Milo saw himself not as an observer, but as a guardian – tasked with unraveling the tangled threads of urban narrative and restoring balance to his beloved city.
