As she drifted off to sleep, the sound of crickets and rustling leaves lulled her into a peaceful slumber.

The next morning, Milo woke up feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. She smiled to herself, knowing that she had found her true calling in life â€“ to spread joy and inspiration through her music.
