Milo Dabrowski sat alone in the dimly lit library, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and whispered conversations. As a resident of Hawkins, Indiana, she had grown accustomed to her solitary existence, often preferring the company of literature to that of people.

As she delved into the pages of her latest novel, Milo's thoughts wandered back to her life before Hawkins. Born with a rare gift – superhuman strength – and raised by a family of scientists, Milo had always felt like an outsider in her own community. Her parents, determined to help her control her powers, had sent her to live with her aunt, Hattie, in the small town.

But it was in Hawkins that Milo discovered her true purpose. Alongside her friends Will Byers, Mike Wheeler, Dustin Henderson, and Lucas Sinclair, she formed a tight-knit group that would change the course of their lives forever.

As she read, Milo's eyes scanned the lines, her mind processing the complexities of human nature. She was fascinated by the way people interacted with each other, often revealing more about themselves through their actions than words. It was this fascination that drew her to the written word, where she could observe and analyze without being judged.

Milo's thoughts were interrupted by a faint whisper from beside her. Will had entered the library, his eyes scanning the room until they landed on her. "Hey, Mil," he said softly, taking a seat next to her. "I needed to get away for a bit."

Milo smiled, feeling a sense of comfort in his presence. As they sat together, surrounded by books and quiet, she realized that sometimes it was okay to be alone – as long as you had people who understood you. And in the world of Hawkins, Milo knew she had found her tribe.

With a gentle nod, Milo turned back to her book, lost in the pages once more. Her life might be complicated, but with friends by her side, she knew she could face anything that came her way.
