Milo Balodis sat alone at his desk, staring blankly at the computer screen in front of him. His mind was a jumble of thoughts and emotions, each one tangled with the last like a messy knot. He had always been a creative person, but lately, it seemed like no matter how hard he tried, nothing good ever came out.

As a writer, Milo struggled to find his voice. His stories were always formulaic, predictable, and ultimately, forgettable. He felt like he was writing for other people, not for himself or his own unique vision. The words blurred together on the screen as he thought about all the rejection letters he'd received over the years.

Milo's phone rang, breaking the silence. It was his best friend and editor, Sarah. "Hey, Milo, how's it going?" she asked, her voice cheerful and unwavering.

"It's not," Milo replied, feeling a pang of disappointment.

"Come on, let's go out for coffee," Sarah said, sensing his gloom. "We can talk about your writing. I'm sure there's something we can figure out."

Milo agreed, feeling a spark of hope ignite within him. Over coffee, they talked about everything and nothing, laughing and joking like they used to when Milo was younger.

As the conversation flowed, Sarah began to notice a change in Milo. He seemed more relaxed, more open. The words started flowing easier now, as if his inner critic had been silenced.

"I've got it," Sarah said suddenly, her eyes shining with excitement. "I think I know what's wrong."

"What is it?" Milo asked, his curiosity piqued.

"You're trying to write for someone else," Sarah said gently. "You need to find out who you are as a writer and start writing from there."

Milo thought about this for a moment. It made sense. He didn't have to write the perfect story or use the latest trends; he just had to tell his own truth.

With newfound determination, Milo headed back home and opened his laptop once more. The words flowed like water now, as if he'd finally found his voice.
