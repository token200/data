Milo Salamanca sat alone in the dimly lit cantina, nursing a glass of whiskey as she watched the patrons with a mix of curiosity and disdain. A half-Mexican, half-British hybrid, Milo had always felt like an outsider, caught between two worlds that rarely understood her.

As a member of the notorious Salamanca cartel, Milo's family name carried weight - but not necessarily in a good way. Her uncle, Gus, was infamous for his ruthless tactics and brutal efficiency, while her father, Hector, had been slowly taking over the reins of power. Milo's own path was unclear, though; she longed to break free from the expectations that came with being Salamanca.

Milo's thoughts drifted back to her childhood, spent splitting time between Mexico and England. Her parents had instilled in her a love for art - painting, music, and literature - but her uncle Gus had always been firm: "You'll follow in my footsteps, Milo Salamanca. You're a Salamanca, after all."

As she sipped her drink, Milo's eyes landed on a young artist sitting across from her, sketchbook in hand. There was something about the way they worked, lost in their own world, that resonated with her. She began to sketch alongside them, losing herself in the strokes and colors.

For a moment, the weight of her family name receded, and Milo felt like she could finally be herself - not just Milo Salamanca, but simply Salamanca. It was a fleeting sense of freedom, one that vanished as quickly as it appeared.

The artist looked up, catching Milo's eye. "You're really good," they said, smiling.

Milo smiled back, feeling a connection she hadn't felt in years. Maybe, just maybe, there was a way out of the Salamanca legacy after all - not by erasing her family name entirely, but by forging a new path that allowed her to be herself, without apology. As she finished her drink and left the cantina, Milo knew that this was just the beginning of her journey, one that would take her far from the expectations of those who knew her as Milo Salamanca.
