Milo Garcia Martinez sat in his small apartment, staring blankly at the wall as he struggled to come to terms with the latest development in his life. His estranged father had passed away, leaving him a small inheritance and a plethora of questions about his family's past.

As a child, Milo had always felt like an outsider in his own family. His parents' divorce when he was just nine years old had left him feeling lost and alone. But now, with the sudden loss of his father, he couldn't help but wonder if there was more to his family's story than he had ever imagined.

Milo's mind wandered back to his childhood, to memories of lazy Sundays spent at his grandparents' house, where his abuela would regale him with tales of their own struggles and triumphs. She had always been the strong one in Milo's life, the rock that held everything together. But even she had seemed hesitant when it came to talking about Milo's father.

As he delved deeper into his research, Milo discovered that his parents' divorce had not been an easy one. His father, a man of few words, had left without explanation, leaving his mother and young son behind. The pain and anger still lingered, but as Milo read through the old newspaper articles and letters, he began to see a glimmer of understanding.

It wasn't until later that day, when Milo's best friend, Sofia, arrived at his doorstep bearing a plate of abuela's famous empanadas, that he finally found the words to express what was eating away at him. "I'm so sorry I never got to know my father," Milo said, his voice shaking with emotion.

Sofia wrapped her arms around him, holding him close as they both wept for the loss of a chance encounter. In that moment, Milo realized that it wasn't too late to start asking questions and finding answers about his family's past. As he took a bite of the sweet, flaky pastry, he knew that with Sofia by his side, he was ready to face whatever came next, armed with nothing but determination and a name: Milo Garcia Martinez.
