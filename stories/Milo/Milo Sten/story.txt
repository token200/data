Milo Sten was a man of few words, but his presence commanded attention. A former soldier turned detective, he had seen his fair share of darkness and had developed a keen instinct for sniffing out the truth.

As he stepped into the dimly lit interrogation room, the soft hum of fluorescent lights overhead seemed to fade into the background as his gaze locked onto the suspect. His eyes narrowed, scrutinizing every detail, every twitch of the suspect's lip or flicker in their pupils.

Milo Sten was known for his unyielding determination and razor-sharp mind, skills honed on the battlefields of war. But it was his years of experience as a detective that had truly honed his instincts, allowing him to read people like a book.

The suspect, a young woman with piercing green eyes, shifted uncomfortably in her seat, her hands fidgeting with the hem of her jacket. Milo Sten's gaze never wavered, his expression an unyielding mask of neutrality.

"So," he began, his voice low and measured, "tell me about your whereabouts on the night of January 15th."

The woman hesitated, a faint blush rising to her cheeks before she spoke. Her words tumbled out in a nervous torrent, each sentence building upon the last until Milo Sten's mind was flooded with images of alibis, shaky handshakes, and rehearsed denials.

But he listened intently, his eyes never leaving hers, as if searching for the slightest crack in her facade. It was an art form honed by years of dealing with lies, half-truths, and deliberate deceptions.

As she finally fell silent, Milo Sten leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers together as he absorbed every detail. His mind was already racing ahead, weaving threads of evidence into a tapestry of suspicion and doubt.

The game was on now, with Milo Sten firmly at the helm. The young woman's eyes darted nervously towards the door, but she knew she had no escape. For in this room, where Milo Sten held sway, there were no second chances.

And as he leaned forward once more, his eyes glinting with a fierce intensity, it was clear that only one thing would come out of this interrogation: the unvarnished truth â€“ or Milo Sten's own secret lies.
