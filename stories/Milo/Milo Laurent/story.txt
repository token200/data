Milo Laurent stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the small town of Willow Creek. The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the main street, where people went about their daily routines. As a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department, Milo had traveled to many places, but there was something about this quiet town that felt familiar.

As she made her way to the local sheriff's office, a young deputy, Tim, greeted her with a smile. "Milo Laurent, welcome back to Willow Creek! We've got a case for you."

The story went like this: 17-year-old high school student, Emily Wilson, had gone missing three days prior. Her parents were frantic and the local community was on edge. Milo had agreed to take the case, intrigued by the eerie similarity between Emily's disappearance and her own sister's when she was a teenager.

Back at her hotel room, Milo poured herself a glass of water and began to review the evidence. The Wilsons claimed they'd last seen Emily at lunchtime, after school. No one had seen or heard from her since. Milo noticed something odd - Emily's phone records showed an unusual amount of calls made to an unknown number in the hours leading up to her disappearance.

As she dug deeper, Milo discovered that the number belonged to a local teenager with a reputation for being trouble. She decided to pay him a visit, asking to speak with his parents first. The Wilsons seemed hesitant but Milo assured them it was just standard procedure.

With the young suspect in tow, Milo Laurent took him down to the station and asked him about the calls. He claimed he'd only exchanged texts with Emily - gossiping about school drama and flirting. But there was something about his demeanor that didn't quite add up.

The investigation continued late into the night, as Milo struggled to piece together the truth behind Emily's disappearance. Who could be hiding what? And why did this feel eerily reminiscent of her own sister's fate all those years ago? Only time would tell if she'd uncover the truth before it was too late.
