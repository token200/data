As a young man, Pekka Roche had set out on his own, seeking adventure and fortune on the high seas. He worked as a deckhand on various ships, learning the ins and outs of navigation, sailing, and survival from seasoned sailors who recognized his natural talent.

As his ship drew closer, he realized it was an abandoned research station, its windows shattered by the relentless Arctic storms. Intrigued, Pekka Roche decided to investigate, ordering his crew to drop anchor and set off in a small boat.
