Pekka Marcuzzi was a man shrouded in mystery. A master of disguise and deception, he had built a reputation as a ghostly figure who could blend into any crowd. Few people knew his true identity, but those who did whispered stories of his incredible skills.

As a young man, Pekka Marcuzzi had grown up on the streets of Helsinki, surviving by his wits and cunning. He had quickly learned to adapt to any situation, always staying one step ahead of his adversaries. This talent for improvisation had served him well in his line of work, where the truth was often more important than the lies.

One day, Pekka Marcuzzi found himself at a high-stakes poker game in Monte Carlo. He was anonymous, yet everyone seemed to know him.
