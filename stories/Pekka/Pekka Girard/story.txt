Pekka Girard stepped out of his small apartment, into the chill morning air. He lived in a world where memories were currency, and he was one of the few who had mastered the art of extracting them from others. A memory thief, Pekka roamed the streets, taking what he wanted - people's experiences, their joy, their pain.

He walked to his first appointment of the day, a young woman named Lena. Her memories were worth a fortune, and Pekka needed them to survive. He arrived at her office building, a nondescript high-rise in the financial district. After a quick knock on the door, Lena let him in.

Pekka smiled as he sat down across from her. "Lena, I have a job for you." She hesitated, unsure what Pekka wanted. "We need to relive that night at the concert," he said, producing a small vial of glowing liquid from his pocket. "Your favorite song played, the crowd was dancing... and we get to relive it all."

Lena's eyes sparkled as she downed the liquid. She closed her eyes and let out a contented sigh as Pekka began the extraction process. He listened to her memories as they flooded back into him - the music, the laughter, the sense of belonging.

As Pekka extracted more memories from Lena, he couldn't help but think about his own past. He had been born into a world where memories were scarce, and those who could extract them were sought after. He had learned early on to adapt, to take what he wanted. But at what cost? His friends, his family - they had all been lost to him over the years.

When Pekka finished with Lena, he stood up, feeling a pang of guilt for exploiting her memories. But he pushed it aside and continued his day, going from one memory extraction to the next. He walked among people, listening in on their conversations, extracting what he could.

And yet, as the day wore on, Pekka began to feel something different - a sense of emptiness. The memories he had extracted had left him feeling hollow, like he was missing out on something more. For the first time in his life, Pekka wondered if there was more to life than just taking what others had.

As he walked back into his apartment, a small smile crept onto his face. Maybe it was time for Pekka Girard to change.
