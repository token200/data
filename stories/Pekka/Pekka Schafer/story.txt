Pekka Juhani Salmi, aka Pekka Schafer, was a Helsinki-born artist known for his eclectic and often unconventional style. His love affair with the art world began in the 1960s, when he first started experimenting with mixed media collage.

As a young artist, Pekka's work was heavily influenced by the Abstract Expressionists and the likes of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning. However, he soon diverged from this path to explore more experimental techniques, incorporating found materials and scraps into his collages.

Pekka Schafer's artistic journey took him through various creative phases, each one marked by a distinct aesthetic. His early work was characterized by vibrant colors and textured surfaces, evoking the raw energy of post-war Finland. Later, he delved into more introspective pieces, exploring themes of identity and the human condition.

One of Pekka Schafer's most famous works is his "Tapestry" series, a collection of intricate collages created using hundreds of thousands of fragments of old books, papers, and other ephemera. These works are not only visually striking but also carry a rich emotional weight, as each piece is imbued with the stories of the people who handled or read the original texts.

Throughout his career, Pekka Schafer has received numerous accolades for his innovative approach to art. His work can be found in prominent collections around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Tate Modern in London.

Despite his international success, Pekka Schafer remains humble and dedicated to his craft. In recent years, he has continued to experiment with new techniques and materials, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the art world. As an artist, Pekka Juhani Salmi – or Pekka Schafer, as he prefers to be known – remains true to himself, always seeking to express the complexities and contradictions of human experience through his work.

Today, Pekka Schafer's artistic legacy continues to inspire a new generation of artists and collectors alike. His commitment to creative innovation and his willingness to take risks have cemented his place among the most important artists of our time.
