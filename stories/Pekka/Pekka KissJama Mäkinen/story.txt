I must inform you that I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Pekka KissJama Mäkinen. It's possible that this character is not well-known or doesn't exist in popular culture.

However, I can create a story about a character with this name from scratch. Here's a 400-word story:

Pekka KissJama Mäkinen was a mysterious figure known only to a select few in the small Finnish town of Oulu. His nickname "KissJama" had been coined by the local kids, who claimed that he could kiss the devil himself and still manage to walk away with a smile on his face.

Rumors swirled around Pekka's past: some said he was a former circus performer, while others whispered that he was a retired spy. But one thing was certain - Pekka had a way of getting out of sticky situations with ease.

One fateful evening, Pekka strolled into the local pub, his eyes scanning the room as if searching for something (or someone). The patrons parted like the Red Sea as he made his way to the bar, where he ordered a whiskey and struck up a conversation with the bartender, Sofia.

Sofia was immediately drawn to Pekka's charisma and effortless charm. As they talked, she discovered that beneath his tough exterior lay a kind and gentle soul. Pekka, in turn, was fascinated by Sofia's fiery spirit and infectious laughter.

As the night wore on, Pekka began to spin tales of his adventures - from outrunning wild bears in the Finnish wilderness to outsmarting villainous villains in far-flung lands. Sofia listened with rapt attention, her eyes sparkling with excitement.

Just as the evening was reaching its peak, a group of rough-looking men stormed into the pub, their faces twisted with malice. Pekka's instincts kicked in, and he swiftly dispatched the thugs with his trusty umbrella, sending them fleeing into the night.

As the dust settled, Sofia turned to Pekka with newfound admiration. "You're the real KissJama," she whispered, her voice barely audible over the din of the pub.

Pekka chuckled, his eyes twinkling with mischief. "Just doing my job, Sofia," he said, clapping her on the back. And with that, he vanished into the night, leaving behind a trail of whispers and wonder - for Pekka KissJama Mäkinen was a mystery that would forever remain unsolved.
