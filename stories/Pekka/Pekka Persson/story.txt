Pekka Persson spent years working on various ships, learning the ins and outs of navigation, repair, and survival at sea. He became known among his peers as a skilled and resourceful sailor, with a deep understanding of the ocean's moods and rhythms.

One day, Pekka received an offer from a wealthy patron to captain his own vessel, the "Maverick's Revenge."
