Pekka Fernández sat at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of bills and overdue notices in front of him. As a retired accountant, he had always been meticulous with numbers, but lately, it seemed like no one cared about anything except for their own financial woes.

He sighed and rubbed his temples, trying to ward off the headache that was brewing. How did things get so complicated? He remembered when life was simple: work, spend, enjoy. Now, everyone was worried about money, and nobody had time to worry about anyone else.

Pekka's phone rang, breaking the silence. It was his niece, Liisa, calling from Helsinki. "Uncle Pekka, I need your help," she said, her voice laced with worry. "My business partner has gone bankrupt, and I'm left with a huge debt. Can you come over and talk to them?"

Pekka sighed, feeling the familiar weight of responsibility settling onto his shoulders. He had always been the reliable one in the family, the one who could fix anything from a leaky faucet to a broken heart.

He agreed to meet Liisa at her office, and as he arrived, he was greeted by the sorry sight of empty shelves and closed doors. The once-thriving bakery was now a shadow of its former self. Pekka's niece looked up at him with tears in her eyes. "Uncle Pekka, I don't know what to do."

Pekka took a deep breath and began to sort through the accounts, his mind racing with possibilities. He talked to Liisa's partner, listened to their stories of failed ventures and misplaced investments. As he dug deeper, he discovered that it wasn't just one bad decision that had led to this mess – it was a series of mistakes, each one building upon the last.

With a plan beginning to form in his mind, Pekka sat down with Liisa and her partner once more. "We'll start from scratch," he said firmly. "We'll re-evaluate our finances, find new investors, and get this bakery back on its feet."

Liisa's eyes lit up with hope as Pekka smiled reassuringly. Maybe, just maybe, things wouldn't be so complicated after all. Maybe there was still room for a little bit of simplicity in the world.

As they left the office together, Liisa turned to Pekka and said, "You're a genius, Uncle Pekka." He chuckled and ruffled her hair. "It's not rocket science, kiddo. Just good old-fashioned accounting and a healthy dose of common sense."
