Max Kovalova stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small town that lay before her. She had been running from her past for what felt like an eternity, and this tiny town in rural Colorado was supposed to be the last place she'd ever set foot.

As a former CIA operative turned rogue, Max had made a name for herself as one of the most elusive and feared agents in the business. But after a botched mission left her with more enemies than allies, she'd decided it was time to start anew.

Max hailed a taxi and gave the driver an address on the outskirts of town. She'd rented a small cabin under an assumed name, hoping to blend in and keep a low profile. But as the driver dropped her off at the edge of town, Max couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched.

She spent the next few days settling into her new life, taking long walks through the rolling hills and getting to know the locals. The town was quiet and peaceful, with everyone knowing each other's names and stories. It was a far cry from the high-stakes world Max had left behind.

One evening, as she was walking home from the local diner, Max noticed a figure lurking in the shadows. Tall and imposing, he seemed out of place among the small-town charm. She quickened her pace, but the stranger kept pace with her, his eyes never leaving hers.

"Can I help you?" Max asked, her hand instinctively reaching for her phone.

The stranger smiled, revealing a hint of menace. "I think you can," he said, pulling out a photo from his pocket. It was an old picture of Max in her CIA days, taken during one of her many ops.

"You know me," Max spat, trying to keep her cool.

"I do," the stranger replied, his eyes glinting with interest. "I'm someone who's been looking for you."

Max raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite herself. Who was this guy, and what did he want? She decided to play it cool, taking a step closer to him. "And who might you be?" she asked, her hand still on the phone in case things got ugly.

The stranger chuckled, a low rumble that sent a shiver down Max's spine. "I'm someone who can help you," he said, his eyes locked on hers. "Or hurt you, depending on how much you want it."

Max raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite herself. She'd always been one to follow her gut, and this guy was definitely sending mixed signals. She decided to take a chance, nodding slightly as she asked, "What makes you think I need your help?"

The stranger smiled again, revealing the same glint of mischief that had caught Max's attention earlier. "Because," he said, his voice low and husky, "you're not as alone as you think."
