Eike Altmann trudged through the snow-covered streets, his eyes fixed on the small café in front of him. He pushed open the door and stepped inside, shaking off the cold air. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled his nostrils, transporting him back to happier times.

As he waited in line, Eike couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia. This was where he'd met her – Lena, the love of his life. They'd sipped hot chocolate together on countless winter mornings, laughing and dreaming of adventures yet to come. Now, years later, Eike sat alone at a table by the window, nursing a cup of black coffee.

He watched as couples strolled hand-in-hand outside, their faces aglow with happiness. Eike's heart ached with longing. He'd given up on love long ago, convinced that he wasn't worthy of such joy. The memories of Lena still lingered, but they now served only to remind him of what he'd lost.

The barista called out his name, breaking the spell. Eike took a seat at the counter and ordered a plate of German pastries. As he waited for his order, he noticed an elderly woman sitting across from him, sipping a cup of tea. Her eyes seemed to hold a deep wisdom, and Eike felt drawn to her.

When his order arrived, he sat down at a small table by the window, ready to lose himself in the quiet. But as he took a bite of his pastry, he noticed the woman glancing over at him with an understanding smile. She nodded subtly, as if acknowledging something only they shared.

Eike's curiosity piqued, he made his way back to her table. "Merry Christmas," she said, her voice warm and raspy from years of singing. Eike took a seat, feeling the weight of the world lift off his shoulders.

The woman introduced herself as Helga, Lena's mother. As they talked, Eike realized that Helga knew more about Lena than he'd ever known – stories of late-night phone calls, secret trysts, and promises made in hushed tones. Her eyes sparkled with a knowing glint, and for the first time in years, Eike felt a sense of peace.

Perhaps love wasn't something you could find, but it was something that lingered long after. As Helga reached out to place a gentle hand on his arm, Eike knew he wasn't alone anymore.
