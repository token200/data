Eike Yang stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling streets of Seoul. She had spent years studying here, pouring over texts on Confucianism and philosophy, but nothing could have prepared her for the vibrant chaos that was modern-day Korea.

As a young woman from rural China, Eike's family had been deeply rooted in traditional values - hard work, respect for elders, and a strong connection to nature. But as she delved deeper into Western thought and culture, she began to question the strictures of her upbringing. She felt stifled by the expectations placed upon her, eager to forge her own path.

Now, at 25, Eike had made the bold decision to leave home and pursue a career in psychology, driven by a passion for understanding human behavior. As she made her way through the crowded streets, she clutched a small suitcase to her chest, filled with the few belongings she'd managed to pack before embarking on this new adventure.

As she walked, Eike's thoughts turned to the Korean proverb that had been etched into her mother's wall back home - "" (do not stand by what is right in order to gain favor, but do so because it is right). It was a mantra that had guided her throughout her studies, reminding her that true wisdom came from acting on principle rather than mere expediency.

As she turned onto the street where her new job awaited, Eike caught sight of a small café tucked away between towering skyscrapers. She smiled to herself, knowing this would be her sanctuary - a place to gather her thoughts and reflect on the day's events over a cup of steaming black tea.

With each step, Eike felt a sense of liberation wash over her. She was leaving behind the comforting familiarity of home, but also the limitations that had held her back for so long. As she pushed open the café door and stepped inside, a warm smile spread across her face - in this bustling city, surrounded by strangers who were now becoming friends, Eike Yang knew she'd finally found a place where she belonged.
