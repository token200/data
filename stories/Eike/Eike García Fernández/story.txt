Eike García Fernández was a name that struck fear into the hearts of those who knew him. A former hitman, Eike had spent years honing his craft and eliminating targets with precision and stealth. But after a botched job went wrong, Eike found himself on the run, forced to leave behind the only life he had ever known.

Years passed, and Eike's skills at arms had begun to rust. He drifted from place to place, taking on odd jobs and trying to lay low. But the ghosts of his past refused to let him rest. Haunted by memories of his victims and the lives he had ruined, Eike couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.

One day, Eike received a message from an old acquaintance, offering him a chance to return to his former life. The pay was too good to pass up, and Eike knew he had no choice but to take it. He arrived at the designated location, a seedy bar on the outskirts of town, where he was greeted by a familiar face.

It was his old partner, Carlos, who had been presumed dead years ago. Carlos looked older, grayer, but his eyes still sparkled with mischief. "Welcome back, Eike," he said, extending a hand. "We've got a job for you. A big one."

Eike's instincts told him to be cautious, but the prospect of easy money and the chance to redeem himself proved too enticing to resist. He agreed to take on the job, knowing that it would mean returning to his old life.

As he sat across from Carlos, Eike couldn't help but think of his full name: Eike García Fernández. It was a name that had once brought him power and respect, but now seemed like a distant memory, a relic of a life he was desperate to leave behind. But for now, it was all he had, and he would have to live with it.
