Eike Grabowski stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As a skilled mercenary, he had seen his fair share of battles and had earned a reputation as one of the most feared warriors in the land.

As he made his way to the bar, Eike's gaze fell upon a familiar face - that of his old friend and ally, Jorg. The two men had grown up together on the rough streets of the city, and Eike had always looked out for Jorg, even when their paths diverged.

"Jorg! What brings you to this fine establishment?" Eike asked, clapping his friend on the back.

"Just passing through, my old friend," Jorg replied with a grin. "I heard there was a job available here, and I wanted to see if it was true."

Eike's eyes narrowed as he ordered a pint of ale from the bartender. "Tell me more about this job," he said, his voice low and even.

Jorg leaned in, his voice barely above a whisper. "I overheard some locals talking about a local lord who needs someone to deal with a group of bandits that have been raiding his village."

Eike's expression turned thoughtful as he considered the offer. He had no qualms about taking on work that required violence, but he also knew that not every job was worth risking his neck.

As they discussed the details, Eike couldn't help but think back to his childhood days spent with Jorg. They had always been a tight-knit duo, relying on each other for support and advice. Even now, as a seasoned mercenary, Eike valued their friendship above all else.

With a nod, he made his decision. "Alright, I'm in," he said, extending his hand to seal the deal.

Jorg grinned, clapping Eike on the back once more. "I knew you'd take it," he said with a chuckle. "You're always up for a challenge."

As they left the tavern, Eike couldn't shake the feeling that this job was going to be trouble - but with Jorg by his side, he felt ready to face whatever lay ahead.

"Stay close, Jorg," Eike warned, as they set off into the night. "We don't know what we're up against."

Jorg nodded, his eyes scanning the shadows. "Always," he said quietly.

Together, the two men marched into the unknown, their senses on high alert for any sign of danger.
