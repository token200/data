Eike Romagnoli stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the misty dawn air enveloping him like a damp shroud. He breathed in deeply, feeling the familiar scent of saltwater and tar wash over him. This was home.

As he made his way through the deserted station, Eike's mind began to wander back to the letters he'd received from his sister. She'd written to say she'd found work on a cargo ship bound for distant ports, leaving him to tend to their family's small bakery in the sleepy coastal town of Largs.

Eike shook off the melancholy and adjusted his grip on the worn leather satchel slung over his shoulder. He had a long day ahead of him, with the morning's batch of bread still to be mixed and proofed for the day's customers. His mother would expect nothing but perfection from her son.

He strolled down the narrow main street, nodding to the few early risers who passed in the opposite direction. Eike had always been a hard worker, taking on extra shifts at the bakery to help support his family after their father's passing five years ago. The thought still stung, but he knew it was what he had to do.

As he approached the bakery, Eike spotted a figure waiting outside - their neighbor and friend, Marcella. She was an artist, always carrying her sketchbook with her like a faithful companion. "Good morning," she said, her eyes crinkling at the corners as she smiled. "What's new in your world, Eike?"

"Just trying to keep up with Mamma's expectations," he replied with a laugh, ruffling his dark hair. Marcella chuckled and handed him a small package wrapped in brown paper.

"For you," she said. Inside, he found a perfectly formed wooden spoon, its surface polished to a high shine by her skilled hands. Eike grinned, feeling the warmth of their friendship spread through him like honey.

As the sun climbed higher in the sky, the bakery began to fill with customers, all clamoring for the Romagnoli's famous sourdough bread and flaky pastries. Eike worked his magic, kneading dough and sliding it into the oven as the aroma of baking wafted through the air. The town was quiet now, but he knew that when he emerged from this bakery, the bustle would be at its peak.

In these fleeting moments before the morning rush, Eike felt like he could lose himself in the rhythm of his craft, in the sense of satisfaction that came with feeding and nourishing others. He smiled to himself as the first batch of bread slid out of the oven, feeling a deep connection to this land, his family's legacy, and the endless cycle of bread-making and baking life.

Just then, a knock at the door signaled the arrival of their sister, Helena, who'd arrived from her new port after a week-long journey by sea. Eike smiled brightly as he opened it wide, knowing that with her on board, his workdays just got a whole lot more interesting.
