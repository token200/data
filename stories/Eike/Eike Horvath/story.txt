The sound of footsteps interrupted her reverie, and Eike turned to see a young gardener approaching her. "Excuse me, Ms. Horvath," he said, his eyes wide with excitement. "I've been working on a new project in one of the greenhouses. Would you like to take a look?"

Eike smiled, intrigued by the prospect of seeing something new and innovative. She followed the young gardener into the greenhouse, her eyes scanning the rows of lush plants as she made her way through the space. As she examined each specimen, memories of her own journey flashed before her eyes â€“ a reminder that growth, like nature itself, was always in motion.
