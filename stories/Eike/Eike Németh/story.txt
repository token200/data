Eike Németh's eyes narrowed as she surveyed the bustling market square. She was on the hunt for information, not treasure or trinkets to sell, but leads on her latest case.

As a private investigator in Budapest, Eike had built a reputation for being one of the best – and most tenacious. Her sharp mind and quick wit had helped her crack some of the city's toughest mysteries. But this latest case was different. It involved a wealthy businessman with ties to the underworld, and Eike knew that getting to the bottom required going underground herself.

As she wove through the crowds, Eike noticed a few familiar faces. There was József, a street vendor who always seemed to have his ear to the ground; and Zsófi, a young artist with an uncanny ability to sniff out secrets. Eike nodded at them both, knowing that in this line of work, allies were worth their weight in gold.

Eike spotted her target first – a tall, imposing figure with a scruffy beard and a black leather jacket. He was huddled in the corner of a smoke-filled room, sipping on a whiskey-fueled coffee. Eike's instincts told her he was hiding something, but she couldn't quite put her finger on what it was.

She ordered a drink at the bar and made her way over to the mysterious stranger. As she approached, his eyes flicked up – and for an instant, their gazes locked in a spark of understanding. Eike's gut told her this guy was trouble, but something about him also drew her in.

"I'm looking for information," she said, her voice low and smooth. "About a businessman with ties to the Székely People."

The stranger raised an eyebrow. "Who's asking?"

Eike smiled – a small, calculated smile. "Let's just say I have reason to believe we're after the same thing."

For a moment, they stared each other down, Eike weighing her options against his intentions. She knew this game of cat-and-mouse could go either way – but one thing was for sure: in Budapest, only the strongest survived.

Finally, the stranger spoke up, his voice low and gravelly. "I might have something that interests you, Németh."

Eike leaned in closer, her ears tuned to every word. She knew this city like the back of her hand – but sometimes, it took more than just intuition to uncover its secrets.
