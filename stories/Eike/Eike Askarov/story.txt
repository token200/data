Eike Askarov stepped into the dimly lit tavern, the smell of smoke and sweat hanging heavy in the air. As a master thief, he had been to his fair share of such establishments, but this one stood out - the infamous Black Swan Tavern was rumored to be haunted by the ghost of its former owner, a notorious smuggler.

Eike, also known as "The Fox," was no stranger to danger. With his quick wit and silver tongue, he had fooled even the most skeptical of guards. But tonight, he had a job that required him to walk a fine line between seduction and deception. He needed to gather information from the tavern's patrons, all while keeping an ear out for any mention of a valuable artifact said to be hidden somewhere within its walls.

As he made his way to the bar, Eike's eyes scanned the room, taking in the rough-looking men and women huddled around tables, sipping ale and whispering amongst themselves. He spotted a familiar face - his old acquaintance, Viktor, sitting alone at a corner table, nursing a mug of beer. Eike made his way over, flashing his famous smile as he slid into the seat across from him.

"So, Viktor," Eike said, his voice smooth as silk. "What brings you to this fine establishment tonight?"

Viktor looked up, his eyes narrowing slightly as he took in Eike's disarming grin. "Just passing through," he replied gruffly. "But I hear the Black Swan has some... interesting company tonight."

Eike raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "Oh? And what makes you think that?"

The patrons nearby began to stir, drawn into their conversation like moths to a flame. Eike leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Tell me, Viktor. What do you know about the Whispering Walls?"

Viktor's eyes darted around the room, before locking back onto Eike's face. For a moment, Eike thought he saw a glimmer of fear there - and then it was gone, replaced by a sly smile. "I might have heard a rumor or two," Viktor said, his voice dripping with mischief.

Eike leaned back in his chair, his mind racing with possibilities. He knew that tonight had the potential to be one of the most memorable nights of his life - and he couldn't wait to see what other secrets the Black Swan had in store for him.
