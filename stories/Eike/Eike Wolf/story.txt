Eike Wolf stepped out of his small, cluttered office and into the crisp winter air. The streets were quiet, save for the distant hum of snowplows clearing the sidewalks. It was days like these that reminded him why he loved this city - the stillness, the solitude.

As a private investigator, Eike had seen it all. From cheating spouses to corporate espionage, his services were in high demand. But there was something about this case that had piqued his interest. A wealthy businessman had gone missing, and the police were stumped.

Eike lit a cigarette as he walked to his car, a dusty old sedan with faded upholstery. He had been hired by the businessman's wife, a desperate look in her eyes when she'd asked for his help. Eike didn't mind the challenge - it was what made him tick.

He drove through the snow-covered streets, the GPS leading him to an affluent neighborhood on the outskirts of town. The houses were grand, with manicured lawns and sparkling ice sculptures on the front porches. Eike's eyes narrowed as he noticed a few things that didn't add up - a faint scratch on the doorframe, a suspicious stain on the welcome mat.

He parked outside the businessman's mansion and stepped inside, his eyes adjusting to the dim lighting. The air was thick with the scent of old money and decay. Eike wandered through the rooms, taking in every detail. This was no ordinary missing person case - there were too many secrets hidden beneath the surface.

As he explored further, Eike stumbled upon a cryptic message scrawled on the wall: "The wolf is not what it seems." A shiver ran down his spine. He knew that look, had seen it before in cases like this. It was the signature of someone who thought they were above the law.

Eike's phone buzzed with an incoming call from the wife. "Eike, I need you to find him," she said, her voice trembling. Eike nodded, even though he knew she couldn't see him. He took a deep breath and began his investigation once more, determined to uncover the truth behind the missing businessman - and the sinister message that had led him down this rabbit hole.

As he stood in the grand foyer, Eike Wolf felt a thrill of anticipation. This case was going to be a wild ride, and he was ready for whatever came next. The game was on, and the wolf was at the door.
