Caroline Straume stood at the edge of the rooftop, her long, dark hair whipping about her face in the gusty wind. She clutched her coffee cup tightly to her chest, feeling a sense of unease wash over her as she gazed out at the city below.

As a detective with the NYPD's elite Major Crimes Unit, Caroline had seen her fair share of darkness and despair. But tonight was different. Tonight, it felt like the whole world was conspiring against her.

She took a sip of her coffee, wincing as the bitter flavor hit her taste buds. It was a ritual she'd developed over the years - start with a fresh cup, and then face whatever demons came knocking on her door.

The phone in her pocket buzzed, breaking the silence. She hesitated for a moment before answering, her heart sinking as she heard the familiar voice on the other end.

"Detective Straume? I've got something for you," the voice said, low and gravelly. "Meet me at 5th precinct in an hour. It's about the Jones case."

Caroline's gut twisted into a knot. The Jones case was one of her own - a brutal murder that had shaken the entire department. She'd been working on it for months, following every lead, every tip, but nothing seemed to be panning out.

She arrived at the precinct an hour later, her eyes scanning the crowded room for any sign of her contact. And then, she saw him - a figure huddled in the corner, sipping a cup of coffee that looked suspiciously like Caroline's own.

As she approached, he nodded for her to sit down. "I've got something," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "A witness came forward tonight. Says they saw one of your suspects arguing with the victim just hours before the murder."

Caroline's mind was racing as she scribbled down notes on her pad. This could be it - this could be the break she'd been waiting for. But as she looked up, her eyes locked onto hers contact's face, and she knew that nothing was ever truly simple.

There were always more questions, more suspects, more twists and turns to unravel. And Caroline Straume was determined to see justice served, no matter what it took.
