Caroline Dubois stepped into the dimly lit jazz club, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a private investigator, she'd seen her fair share of shady characters and unsavory deals. But there was something about this job that had her senses on high alert.

She spotted her mark, a suave-looking businessman named Marcus Thompson, sitting at the bar sipping a whiskey. Caroline's instincts told her he was hiding something, and she aimed to find out what.

As she approached him, Marcus looked up, his eyes narrowing slightly as he took in Caroline Dubois's disheveled appearance. She didn't care about his opinion; she had a job to do. "Mind if I join you?" she asked, her voice firm but polite.

Marcus hesitated for a moment before nodding and gesturing to the stool beside him. Caroline settled in, her eyes locked on his as they ordered a round of drinks. She listened intently as Marcus talked about his business dealings, trying to pick up any inconsistencies or red flags.

But no matter how hard she tried, Caroline Dubois couldn't shake the feeling that Marcus was hiding something from her. It wasn't until he mentioned a mysterious company called "Eclipse" that her radar started to ping.

Caroline's mind began racing as she asked more questions about Eclipse. She sensed that this could be the break she'd been waiting for, but she needed concrete evidence to back it up. Marcus seemed reluctant to talk further, and Caroline Dubois knew she had to tread carefully.

As the night wore on, Caroline Dubois continued to probe Marcus, her eyes locked on his as she searched for any sign of deception. And then, just when she thought she'd gotten nothing, Marcus's expression flickered, revealing a flash of fear in his eyes.

Caroline Dubois knew she had him right where she wanted him. She leaned in, her voice low and menacing. "Tell me about Eclipse, Marcus. Or so help me..."
