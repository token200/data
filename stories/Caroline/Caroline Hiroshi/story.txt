Caroline Hiroshi stepped off the crowded train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of her friend, Lena. As she waited, her mind wandered back to their college days, when they would often meet up at this very same station to catch the 8 a.m. bus.

Back then, Caroline was known as Carly - short for Caroline, of course! - and she had a mischievous streak that often got her into trouble. Lena, on the other hand, was the voice of reason in their friendship, always there to talk sense into Carly's harebrained schemes.

Years went by, and life took them down different paths. Caroline pursued a career in graphic design, while Lena became a successful writer. Yet, despite their divergent careers, their friendship remained strong.

As she waited for Lena, Caroline pulled out her phone and scrolled through old photos. There they were - pictures of them laughing together, exploring new cities, and sharing late-night conversations over coffee. She smiled, feeling a warmth in her heart that only true friends could provide.

Just then, a familiar voice called out from across the station. "Caroline Hiroshi!" Lena exclaimed, spotting her friend amidst the crowd. The two women rushed towards each other, embracing in a warm hug.

"I've missed you so much," Lena said, as they pulled back to gaze into each other's eyes. Caroline nodded in agreement. "I know exactly what you mean."

As they made their way through the station, chatting about everything and nothing, Caroline couldn't help but feel grateful for their friendship. It was a bond that had stood the test of time, despite life's ups and downs.

Over coffee and cake at a nearby caf√©, Lena turned to Caroline and asked, "So, what have you been up to lately?" Caroline launched into a story about her latest design project, and as she spoke, she felt a sense of contentment wash over her. This was what it meant to be alive - surrounded by friends who understood you, and a world full of possibilities waiting to be explored.

And as they sipped their coffee, laughing and talking long into the afternoon, Caroline knew that no matter where life took them next, their friendship would remain a constant source of joy and comfort.
