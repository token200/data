José Roy stepped out of his worn sedan and onto the cracked pavement, surveying the rundown bar on Main Street. He had been driving for hours, chasing a lead that promised to uncover the truth behind his sister's disappearance.

The neon sign above the door creaked in the gentle breeze, casting an eerie glow over the empty parking lot. José's eyes scanned the faded letters, "El Patio", and he felt a familiar pang of sadness. This was where his sister had last been seen, sipping margaritas with friends on a fateful night.

José pushed open the door, and a bell above it let out a tired clang. The bartender, a gruff old man named Sal, looked up from polishing a mug with a dirty rag. "Can I help you?"

"Just looking for someone," José said, his voice low and even. "Name's...Marta."

Sal nodded, wiping down the counter with a flourish. "You mean our Marta? The one who disappeared?"

José's jaw clenched. "Yeah. Do you know anything about it?"

The bartender leaned in, lowering his voice. "Word on the street is she got mixed up with some bad people. Gang activity, trouble with the law...Marta was smart to disappear."

José felt a surge of anger, but he kept his cool. "Did she ever come back? Did you see her again?"

Sal shook his head. "Nah, didn't see her since that night. But I'll tell you one thing: if Marta is still alive, she's with the people she trusted. People like...your cousin."

José's eyes narrowed. He had heard rumors about a local gang leader who was rumored to be connected to his sister's disappearance. "Tell me more," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

The bartender glanced around nervously before leaning in closer. "You don't want to get involved with that family, amigo. They're trouble."

José took a deep breath, weighing his options. He knew he had to follow the lead, no matter how perilous it seemed. He straightened his shoulders and smiled, showing Sal a glint of steel.

"I appreciate your honesty," José said, "but I think it's time I got started."

With that, he turned on his heel and strode out into the night, ready to face whatever dangers lay ahead in search of his sister. The neon sign of El Patio seemed to fade into the distance as he walked away, leaving behind a trail of questions and answers waiting to be found.
