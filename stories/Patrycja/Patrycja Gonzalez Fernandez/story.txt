After completing culinary school, Patrycja moved to New York City, where she worked under some of the city's top chefs before striking out on her own.

Patrycja's restaurant, El Fuego, quickly became a hotspot for foodies seeking adventurous flavors. Her signature dish, the Cuban-Spanish fusion paella, was a crowd favorite, featuring succulent chorizo, sweet plantains, and smoky paprika. Patrycja's infectious enthusiasm for cooking was contagious, drawing customers from all over the city to try her creations.
