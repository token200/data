As she made her way through customs, Akmaral's thoughts turned to her mother, who had instilled in her a passion for discovery and adventure. Growing up, Sofia Sandström would regale her with tales of forgotten empires and lost treasures. It was only natural that Akmaral followed in her footsteps.

Her heart racing, she carefully extracted it from the dust and presented it to Dr. Patel for analysis.

The news spread like wildfire: the statue was unlike anything seen before. As word of their find reached the archaeological community, Akmaral Sandström's name became synonymous with groundbreaking discovery.
