As they made their way back to camp, the team erupted into cheers and applause, thanking Akmaral for their unwavering dedication.

Akmaral Bergstrom smiled humbly, their eyes shining with pride. This was what it meant to be a scientist – to uncover secrets hidden in the natural world and share them with humanity.
