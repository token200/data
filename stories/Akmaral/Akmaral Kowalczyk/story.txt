One fateful evening, Akmaral received a cryptic message from his source within the Russian government. A priceless artifact, the legendary Star of Khyber, would be on display at an exclusive gala in Moscow. The diamond was said to grant immense power to its owner, and Akmaral knew he had to claim it.
