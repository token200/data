Akmaral Górski was a Polish-Italian pianist born in Kraków, Poland. Her early life was marked by turmoil as her parents' tumultuous relationship often spilled over into music – her father was a renowned conductor while her mother taught piano lessons to children in the city.

Growing up amidst this chaotic symphony of sound, Akmaral began taking piano lessons from her mother at age five and quickly became fascinated with Chopin, a favorite composer of hers. Her love for classical music was further fueled by listening to local folk bands during Warsaw Uprising celebrations as a child.

Akmaral eventually left Poland for Italy in search of greater opportunities and training under the guidance of renowned Italian pianist and conductor, Aldo Ciccolini. She immersed herself in studying various musical genres from Mozart to Mahler.

However, her true passion lay not with orchestral music, but with jazz. Her exposure to different styles during a concert series celebrating Jazz at Lincoln Center's Summer Jazz Festivals opened up new avenues of inspiration for her and made her realize that jazz was an integral part of her own expression.

Akmaral eventually became known as one half of the duo "Polish Connection," performing alongside renowned jazz musicians worldwide.
