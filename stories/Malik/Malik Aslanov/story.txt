For hours, they spoke about everything and nothing – their passions, fears, and dreams.

In this rare moment of vulnerability, Aslanov began to peel away the layers of his armor, revealing a glimmer of humanity beneath. As the night wore on, he found himself opening up to Sophia in ways he never thought possible, discovering that even the most complex and guarded hearts can hold a spark of connection.
