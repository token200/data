I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Malik Vargas Llosa. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created recently.

However, I can create a short story based on a character with this name. Here it is:

Malik Vargas Llosa was a young and ambitious journalist who had just landed his first job at a major newspaper in Lima, Peru. Born to a family of activists and writers, Malik had always been drawn to the world of journalism, seeking to tell stories that mattered.

With his sharp mind and quick wit, Malik quickly became known for his incisive reporting on social justice issues and corruption. His latest expos√©, which revealed widespread embezzlement by government officials, had sent shockwaves through the Peruvian elite and earned him a reputation as one of the country's most fearless young journalists.

Despite the challenges he faced in his line of work, Malik remained committed to telling the stories that needed to be told. He was fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority and pushing boundaries in pursuit of truth.

One day, Malik received an offer from a prominent investigative journalist to collaborate on a major project exposing government corruption. The stakes were high, but Malik was determined to see it through. He spent long hours poring over documents and conducting interviews with whistleblowers, piecing together the evidence that would bring down several high-ranking officials.

As the story took shape, Malik became increasingly nervous about the potential consequences of publishing such a explosive expose. But he knew that the public had a right to know the truth, and he was willing to take the risk.

Finally, after months of hard work, the story was ready. Malik's colleagues were amazed by his thoroughness and bravery, and the piece sparked a national outcry against corruption. Malik Vargas Llosa had made a name for himself as one of Peru's most courageous journalists, and his future as a voice for truth and justice looked bright.

Note: I used some historical reference to Gabriel Garcia Marquez's surname "Llosa" which was the surname of his mother, though that is not the case in this fictional story.
