Malik Eglītis stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station as he made his way to the only hotel listed in the faded guidebook. The sign above the entrance read "Eternal Dreams," a phrase that seemed particularly ironic given the state of the town.

As he checked in, the receptionist handed him a key with a nod. "Room 314," she said, her voice as flat as the landscape outside.

Malik Eglītis made his way to his room, dropping his backpack onto the dusty floor. The air was thick with the scent of old books and stale cigarettes. He collapsed onto the bed, letting out a sigh as he stared up at the cracked ceiling.

Outside, the town seemed to be holding its breath. People moved slowly, their eyes cast down at the ground. Malik Eglītis had been told this was a place where time stood still, where people came to escape the world and find solace in the quiet.

As he wandered through the deserted streets, he stumbled upon a small park. In the center, a lone figure sat on a bench, staring out at the sky. Malik Eglītis approached cautiously, not wanting to disturb the stranger's solitude.

The figure turned, revealing a woman with piercing green eyes and hair as black as the night sky. She smiled, and Malik Eglītis felt a jolt of recognition.

"I'm Aria," she said, standing up. "Welcome to Eternal Dreams."

Malik Eglītis explained his arrival, and Aria nodded sympathetically. "You're looking for something," she said. "A way out?"

He hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. But there was something about Aria that put him at ease.

"I'm searching for answers," he admitted. "About myself."

Aria's expression softened. "I think we can help each other," she said. "Malik Eglītis, would you like to explore the town with me?"

He nodded, and together they set out into the unknown, the silence of Eternal Dreams wrapping around them like a cloak.
