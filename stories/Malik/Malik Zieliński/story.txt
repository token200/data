Malik Zieliński was a man with a passion for music and art. Born in Krakow, Poland, he grew up surrounded by the sounds of traditional folk instruments and vibrant colors of the city's street performers. As Malik Zieliński wandered through the streets as a child, he would often stop to watch the musicians play their instruments, mesmerized by the way their fingers danced across the strings.

He still wore traditional Polish clothing to performances, incorporating elements of folk art into his stage design. And when he wrote songs, he drew on the stories of his childhood, weaving tales of love and loss that resonated with listeners around the globe. Through music, Malik Zieliński had found a way to stay connected to his past while forging a new path forward.
