Malik Wozniak sat alone in the dimly lit café, nursing a cold cup of coffee as she gazed out the rain-soaked window. It was a typical Wednesday afternoon, with the usual hum of conversation and clinking cups filling the air. But Malik wasn't interested in any of that. She was lost in thought, her mind wandering to the latest argument she'd had with her best friend.

As she stared into the raindrops sliding down the glass, memories flooded her mind. Memories of laughter-filled nights spent dancing at the local club, of impromptu road trips taken without a care, and of late-night conversations shared only between the two of them. How could they have grown apart so quickly?

The café door swung open, and a new customer walked in, shaking the rain off their jacket. Malik barely noticed, too caught up in her own thoughts to care about anyone else's presence. The sound of clinking cups and muffled laughter faded into the background as she delved deeper into her reverie.

Suddenly, the door swung shut behind a young couple, laughing together over a plate of pastries. They were completely absorbed in each other, their faces lit up by the warmth of their shared moment. It was infectious, Malik thought to herself, feeling a pang of longing for something similar with Sarah.

She turned back to her coffee, lost in the bitter taste and the memories that lingered within it. As she sipped, the room began to fade away, leaving only the sound of rain pattering against the windowpane. It was then that Malik realized just how much she'd been missing out on – not just the laughter and adventures with her best friend, but also the quiet moments like this one.

The café door swung open once more, and a waitress smiled at Malik as she refilled her cup. "You okay, hon?" she asked, concern etched in her voice. Malik looked up, startled out of her reverie, and forced a weak smile onto her face. She knew the answer was no – not yet, anyway. But for now, the rain outside seemed just a little bit more manageable.
