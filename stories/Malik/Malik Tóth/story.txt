Malik Tóth stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of life. As a detective with the Budapest Police Department, he'd seen it all – from petty theft to high-stakes murder cases. But there was something about this particular case that had him on edge.

Malik Tóth had been tasked with investigating the mysterious disappearance of a prominent businessman, and so far, the trail was colder than a winter night. The victim's family was offering a hefty reward for any information leading to his safe return, but Malik Tóth knew that in this city, nothing came easy.

As he made his way through the crowded streets, Malik Tóth couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He'd been following a lead on a suspicious individual who'd been seen lurking around the victim's office building, but so far, no one seemed willing to talk.

Malik Tóth stopped in front of a small café and pushed open the door, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of recognition. The barista, a familiar face from the station, looked up as he slid onto a stool. "Ah, Malik Tóth," she said with a smile, "what brings you here tonight?"

"Just gathering my thoughts," Malik Tóth replied, ordering a cup of coffee. As he waited for his drink to arrive, he pulled out his notebook and began to review the case files once more.

Just as he was about to leave, the barista leaned in close and whispered, "I think I might have seen something, Detective Tóth. A person matching your suspect's description was here last night, around 9 pm. They were arguing with one of our regulars – a tall, thin man with a scar above his left eyebrow."

Malik Tóth's ears perked up at the mention of the scar. He'd been looking for any distinguishing features on his suspects, and now it seemed he might have finally found something. With newfound determination, Malik Tóth set off into the night, ready to follow the trail wherever it led.
