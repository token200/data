Malik Kask sat at his desk, staring blankly at the computer screen in front of him. As a freelance journalist, he was used to working long hours and facing rejection after rejection, but lately, it seemed like the universe was conspiring against him.

He had written articles for every major publication in the city, but no one seemed to want to touch his latest piece on the local arts scene. The editor at The Daily Chronicle had rejected it outright, citing "too much repetition" and "not enough insight." Malik was determined to prove them wrong.

Just as he was about to pack up and head home, his phone rang. It was an unknown number, but Malik's journalist instincts kicked in and he answered anyway.

"Hello?" he said, trying to sound confident.

There was a pause on the other end of the line before a voice spoke up. "Malik Kask? I'm calling from The Artisan's Quarterly. We've been looking for a writer with your... unique perspective."

Malik's heart skipped a beat. He had never heard of the publication before, but something about the voice on the other end made him trust them.

"What kind of piece were you thinking?" he asked, trying to play it cool.

"We'd like you to write a review of our latest exhibition," the voice replied. "Something that showcases your... let's call it your 'voice'."

Malik nodded, even though he knew the other person couldn't see him. He was stoked.

"Give me a few days to get started," he said, already envisioning the article unfolding in his mind.

The conversation ended with an offer of a advance payment and a guarantee that The Artisan's Quarterly would be interested in featuring Malik's work regularly. As soon as the call ended, Malik jumped up from his chair and began pacing around the room, excitement building inside him.

This could be it, he thought to himself. This could be the break he needed to prove himself to the world.

Over the next few days, Malik poured all his energy into the review. He spent hours researching, interviewing artists, and writing until his fingers cramped up. When the piece was finally finished, he knew he had created something special.

He sent it off to The Artisan's Quarterly with a sense of trepidation, but also a renewed sense of confidence. Would they like it? Only time would tell.

As Malik waited anxiously for the response, he couldn't help but think about all the times he'd doubted himself. All the times he'd wondered if he was good enough. But this piece... this piece felt different.

This piece felt like home.
