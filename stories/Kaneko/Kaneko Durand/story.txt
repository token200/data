Kaneko Durand sat alone in her dimly lit apartment, staring at the stack of letters in front of her. The yellowed envelopes were addressed to her, but she had never received any mail in years. It was as if she didn't exist outside of her memories.

As a child, Kaneko had been told that she was a spy, sent on missions to gather intelligence from behind enemy lines. But the stories were always hushed and secretive, and Kaneko couldn't shake the feeling that they were just tall tales spun by her overprotective mother.

Years later, after years of living in hiding, Kaneko received a message that changed everything. A mysterious organization, known only as "The Agency," had discovered her true identity and offered to reveal the truth about her past. The catch was, she would have to meet them in person - and leave behind her old life.

Kaneko hesitated for weeks, weighing the risks against the unknown benefits. But finally, she made up her mind. She packed a small bag and boarded a train to Paris, where The Agency had promised to reveal their secrets.

As she stepped off the train, Kaneko was greeted by two men in suits who introduced themselves as agents. They led her through winding streets and hidden alleyways until they arrived at a nondescript building in the heart of the city.

 Inside, Kaneko found herself face-to-face with a woman who looked uncannily like herself - piercing green eyes, jet-black hair, and an unmistakable smile. The woman's name was Agent Lee, and she revealed that Kaneko was indeed a spy, sent on countless missions during her youth to gather intelligence and protect the world from threats both foreign and domestic.

The revelation shook Kaneko to her core. She had always known that there was more to her story than met the eye, but hearing it now felt like she was finally coming home. For years, she had been searching for answers; now, finally, she had found them.

As Kaneko left the Agency building with Agent Lee by her side, she knew that her life would never be the same again. She had a new purpose, one that required her to put her skills to use once more - and this time, on behalf of those who needed protection most.
