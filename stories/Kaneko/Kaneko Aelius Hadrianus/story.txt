Kaneko Aelius Hadrianus was a man shrouded in mystery, his enigmatic smile and piercing gaze striking fear into the hearts of those who crossed him. As a mercenary, he had fought on every continent, taking on any job that paid, from guarding emperors to hunting down rebels.

But despite his fearsome reputation, Kaneko's past was a closely guarded secret. Few knew that beneath the tough exterior lay a complex and troubled individual, haunted by demons of his own making.

One day, while working as a bodyguard for a wealthy merchant, Kaneko stumbled upon a cryptic message that would change everything. It read: "Meet me at the old windmill on the outskirts of town at midnight. Come alone."

Intrigued, Kaneko decided to take on the mission. As he approached the windmill, a figure emerged from the shadows - an old acquaintance from his mercenary days.

"You've been playing both sides, Hadrianus," the stranger accused, their voice dripping with venom. "You think you can play both soldier and statesman? You're just as treacherous as the rest of us."

Kaneko's eyes narrowed, but he knew the stranger spoke the truth. He had always walked a fine line between loyalty and betrayal, using his charm and charisma to get what he wanted.

The stranger handed Kaneko a small package - a letter, sealed with the imperial crest. "This is for you," they said. "It's your ticket out of this life. You've earned it."

As Kaneko read the letter, his eyes widened in shock. It was from Emperor Aurelian himself, offering him a place at court as an advisor. For the first time in years, Kaneko felt a sense of belonging.

But would he accept? Or would he continue down the path of chaos and destruction that had defined his life for so long?

Only time would tell. One thing was certain: Kaneko Aelius Hadrianus was about to embark on a new journey - one that would change him forever.
