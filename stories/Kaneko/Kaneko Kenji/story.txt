Kenji's latest case was a particularly puzzling one - the disappearance of a wealthy businessman's daughter from her apartment in the upscale district of Roppongi.

As the sun began to set over Tokyo, Kenji finally pieced together the truth - the daughter's disappearance was not a random act, but a carefully planned event designed to cover up a dark family secret. The killer had left behind a trail of breadcrumbs, and Kenji had followed every single one.

With a sense of satisfaction, Kenji closed his notebook and stood up, his eyes gleaming with triumph. He knew that this case was just another notch in the belt of a man who had earned his place as one of Tokyo's greatest detectives - Kaneko Kenji.
