Kaneko Evans wiped the sweat from her forehead as she gazed out at the desolate wasteland before her. She had been walking for days, ever since the world ended in the Great Upheaval.

No one knew what had caused it - some said a virus, others a solar flare. But Kaneko didn't care about any of that. All she cared about was survival. And right now, survival depended on finding shelter from this scorching heat.

As a young woman when the world went down, Kaneko had always been resourceful. She grew up in a small town on the outskirts of Los Angeles, where her family made their living off the land. When the disaster struck, she was just a teenager - but she had already learned how to fix engines and cook meals over an open flame.

Now, with her short black hair tied back in a ponytail and her hands worn from years of digging for water, Kaneko knew that this wasteland could be both beautiful and deadly. Her eyes scanned the horizon, searching for any sign of life - or death.

As she crested a dune, Kaneko spotted something in the distance. A figure, huddled on the ground and sipping from a canteen. Her heart skipped a beat as she quickened her pace. Was this someone she could trust?

She approached cautiously, hand resting on the butt of her knife. The figure looked up, startled - but Kaneko saw no hostility in its eyes.

"Hello?" she said softly, trying not to scare it away. "My name is Kaneko Evans."

The stranger's gaze lingered on hers for a beat before responding, his voice hoarse from thirst. "I'm Max."

Kaneko took another step forward, and then another. She saw that Max was younger than her - probably around 20, 22 years old? - with messy brown hair and tired green eyes.

Over the next few hours, Kaneko learned that Max had been surviving on his own for months. He had skills of his own - a bit of engineering expertise, after all - but also lacked many others: knowledge of food sources, first aid, basic math...

Kaneko watched him with growing respect as he struggled to fix his broken watch. She offered her assistance, and together they coaxed the timepiece back to life.

"I think we could help each other," Kaneko said finally, turning to face Max. "You've got skills I don't have. And I've learned some things... about the world that never was."

Max nodded, his eyes locking onto hers with newfound understanding. "We should find a community," he said softly.

And so they began their journey together - searching for safety and hope in a desolate new world.
