Kaneko Volkov stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. The air was thick with the scent of decay and neglect, a reminder that this small town had long since passed its prime. She breathed it in deeply, feeling a sense of homecoming wash over her.

As a child, Kaneko had spent summers at her grandparents' old homestead on the outskirts of town. Her Japanese mother had immigrated to the States when she was just a baby, and the stories she'd told Kaneko about their ancestral homeland were woven into the fabric of her very being. But it was here, in this forgotten place, that she felt most connected to her roots.

Kaneko had come back to Ashwood to settle an estate, one left behind by a great-aunt she'd never known. The news had arrived unexpectedly, and Kaneko had felt a pang of obligation to return and see it through. As she made her way down the platform, her worn leather boots scuffling against the concrete, she wondered what secrets the old homestead might hold.

The drive from the station to the farmhouse was slow and winding, taking her past fields of rusted farm equipment and rows of crumbling fences. Kaneko's stomach growled with anticipation as the farmhouse came into view – its wooden slats weathered to a soft gray, the porch creaking beneath the weight of years.

As she stepped inside, the air grew thick with dust and memories. Kaneko wandered from room to room, her fingers trailing over the intricate patterns on the tatami mats and the faded silks in the chests. She'd never felt so at home anywhere else in her life.

And yet, as she settled into the worn cushions of a favorite armchair, Kaneko couldn't shake the feeling that Ashwood held secrets it was willing to keep hidden from her. There were whispers among the townspeople about strange occurrences and unexplained happenings – sounds in the dead of night, lights flickering in the windows. Some said it was the work of spirits, others that it was something far more sinister.

Kaneko smiled wryly to herself, knowing better than most what secrets lay hidden beneath the surface of small-town America. She would listen, she would learn, and when the time came, she'd unravel them all – one thread at a time.
