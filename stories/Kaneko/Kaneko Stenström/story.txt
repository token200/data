Kaneko Stenström stood at the edge of the frozen lake, her eyes fixed on the distant silhouette of a lone skier. She had been tracking him for hours, ever since he'd vanished from camp. The Swedish detective's instincts told her that this wasn't just another case of lost tourists in the Swedish wilderness.

As she watched, the skier picked up speed, his movements fluid and effortless. Kaneko's gaze narrowed; there was something about his technique that didn't add up. She had seen plenty of skiers on these trails before, but none as... deliberate.

Kaneko knew this terrain like the back of her hand. She'd been born in Stockholm, raised by her father, a park ranger who had taught her how to navigate even the most treacherous of landscapes. Her own skills lay more with firearms and forensic analysis, but there was something about the vast expanses of snow and ice that drew her.

Without thinking, Kaneko pulled on her own skis – she'd been carrying them as a precaution, just in case. She glided effortlessly across the frozen lake, following the same route the mysterious skier had taken. Her eyes scanned the horizon, searching for any sign of disturbance or hidden trail markers.

It wasn't long before she spotted something strange: a thin scratch on the snow, almost imperceptible. Kaneko felt her heart rate quicken; this was no natural phenomenon. She skied closer, examining the mark more closely. It looked like... handwriting?

Kaneko's mind was racing as she made her way back to camp. She had a feeling that she was onto something big, but what? The only clue she had was a hasty note on the edge of the map: "Meet me at the lake, midnight. –J"

She spent the next few hours reviewing footage from nearby security cameras and interviewing the other skiers in camp. Finally, with just an hour to spare before midnight, Kaneko found herself back at the frozen lake.

A figure emerged from the darkness, their face illuminated only by the faint light of a nearby cabin. Kaneko's hand instinctively went to her gun – but it was too late. The stranger had vanished into thin air, leaving behind only the faintest whisper on the wind: "You're getting close, Stenström..."
