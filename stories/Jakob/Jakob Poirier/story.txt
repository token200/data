Jakob Poirier stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of his contact. He was here on business, or so he had been told. As a former CIA operative turned freelance security consultant, Jakob's work took him to some of the most unlikely places.

He spotted a figure in the crowd, dressed in a long coat and hat, and made his way over. "Ah, Monsieur Poirier," the man said, with a nod. "I'm glad you could make it."

"Who are you?" Jakob asked, his hand instinctively reaching for the gun holstered at his hip.

"My name is Jean-Pierre LaFleur," the man replied. "And I have information about your sister's disappearance."

Jakob's eyes narrowed. His sister, Sophia Poirier, had gone missing a year ago, and the FBI had been unable to find any leads. He had been tracking her case on his own, but so far, nothing.

"What do you know?" Jakob asked, his curiosity piqued.

LaFleur hesitated, glancing around the station before leaning in close. "I have reason to believe that Sophia was involved in some shady dealings," he whispered. "Meetings with strangers, unusual transactions... it's as if she had been living a double life."

Jakob's mind was racing. Could this be the break he needed? He had always suspected that his sister might be hiding something from him, but he had never expected it to be this big.

"What do you want in return?" Jakob asked, his grip on his gun tightening.

LaFleur smiled wryly. "I have information about a new threat, one that could put your entire network at risk. I'm willing to share it with you... for a price."

Jakob hesitated, weighing his options. He knew he couldn't trust LaFleur completely, but he also knew that this could be the opportunity of a lifetime. "I'll listen," he said finally.

LaFleur nodded and handed him a small folder filled with documents and photographs. Jakob's eyes scanned them quickly, his heart sinking as he realized just how deep the danger ran.

He took a deep breath and made his decision. This was going to be a long night.
