The man approached him, introducing himself as Henry Blackwood, a prominent collector and patron of the arts. Blackwood was known for his ruthless business tactics, but he also had a reputation for discovering hidden gems in the art world. He offered Jakob Briedite a substantial sum for one of his paintings, which the artist accepted without hesitation.
