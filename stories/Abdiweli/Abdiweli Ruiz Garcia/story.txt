Born in Mexico City, Abdiweli grew up surrounded by the struggles of poverty and inequality. His family's experiences shaped his worldview and fueled his desire to make a difference. He went on to study law at the Universidad Iberoamericana, where he met his future wife, Sofia.

After completing his studies, Abdiweli worked as an attorney for several years, taking on cases that involved human rights violations and police brutality. His tireless efforts earned him recognition from local activists and community leaders. They began to call him "Abuela" – a nickname that stuck despite his protests.

One day, Abdiweli received a phone call from the mother of a young man who had been killed by police in a gang-related incident. The family's lawyer had abandoned them, leaving them with no representation. Without hesitation, Abdiweli agreed to take on the case.

He met with witnesses, experts, and the victim's family members to piece together what had happened that fateful night.

The verdict was guilty, but thanks to Abdiweli's efforts, the family received justice and compensation. The young man's mother tearfully thanked Abdiweli for giving her son his life back. From that day on, he was hailed as a hero by many in the community.
