One day, a devastating drought struck the land, threatening the very survival of Abdiweli Liepina's village. The crops withered, the livestock died, and the people grew hungry and desperate. Abdiweli sprang into action, rallying his community to work together to find a solution.

With the help of international aid, he was able to secure food and water for the villagers, and slowly but surely, they began to recover. The drought proved to be a turning point for Abdiweli Liepina, marking a new era of hope and resilience in Kakuma.
