Abdiweli Pelz's eyes seemed to hold a thousand secrets, and his quick wit could disarm even the most skeptical of strangers. He moved with an air of quiet confidence, as if he had always known where he was going.

One day, a young traveler named Sophie stumbled upon Abdiweli Pelz in a crowded marketplace. She watched from afar as he expertly navigated the stalls, haggling over prices and sampling exotic spices. When their eyes met, Abdiweli Pelz flashed her a disarming smile, and Sophie felt an inexplicable jolt.
