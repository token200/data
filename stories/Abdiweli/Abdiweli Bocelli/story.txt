I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Abdiweli Bocelli. It's possible that you may have misspelled the name or that this character doesn't exist in my database.

However, I can suggest some alternatives:

* Create a new character: If you'd like, we can create a new story featuring a character with the name Abdiweli Bocelli.
* Use a different character: If you'd prefer, we can use an existing character and modify their name to fit your request. For example, if you liked the character La Boh√®me by Giacomo Puccini's character Rodolfo, I could use that character instead.

If neither of these options appeal to you, please let me know what kind of story you'd like (e.g., adventure, romance, sci-fi) and I can try to create a new character or modify an existing one for you.
