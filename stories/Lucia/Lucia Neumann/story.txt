The mural, situated on a blank wall in a trendy district of Paris, depicted a mystical forest teeming with life, from towering trees to mythical creatures lurking in the shadows. As visitors wandered through the space, they reported feeling an eerie sense of being enveloped by the artwork.

When asked about her inspiration for "The Whispering Forest," Lucia revealed that she drew upon her own childhood fascination with postcards and the stories they told. She wanted to create a piece that would transport viewers to another world, one where magic was real and anything seemed possible.
