Lucia Roux stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the quaint station as if searching for a familiar face. She had been traveling for days, and the exhaustion was starting to catch up with her. As she made her way through the crowded station, Lucia's thoughts turned to the reason she had left in the first place - to reconnect with her estranged family.

Growing up, Lucia Roux had always felt like an outsider among her own kin. Her parents' fiery arguments and her father's wandering eye had created a sense of unease that lingered long after she had moved away. Despite the distance between them, Lucia couldn't shake the feeling that there was still unfinished business to be settled.

As she walked through the station, Lucia noticed a figure watching her from across the room. It was her sister, Aurelia Roux, who had always been the more outgoing of the two sisters. Lucia's heart skipped a beat as Aurelia made her way towards her, a warm smile spreading across her face.

"Alicia!" Aurelia exclaimed, using Lucia's childhood nickname instead of her full name, which had never stuck. "I was starting to think I'd never see you again."

Lucia smiled back, feeling a mix of emotions as she wrapped Aurelia in a tight hug. As they hugged, Lucia couldn't help but notice the changes in her sister - the gray in her hair, the lines on her face, and the weariness in her eyes.

Over the next few hours, Lucia Roux caught up with her family, listening to their stories and sharing her own. It wasn't easy, and there were moments of tension and awkwardness, but as the sun began to set, Lucia felt a sense of peace wash over her. For the first time in years, she felt like she was home.

As they sat down to dinner together, Lucia couldn't help but think that this might be the start of something new - a chance for her family to heal and move forward together. And as she looked at Aurelia, who was watching her with tears in her eyes, Lucia knew that she had made the right decision in coming back home.
