Lucia Straume stood at the edge of the bustling market square, her eyes scanning the vibrant stalls and shoppers alike. As the town's resident herbalist, she knew everyone by name, but few bothered to learn hers. To them, Lucia was just a knowledgeable face among many, dispensing remedies and advice with a warm smile.

Lucia Straume took pride in her work, carefully crafting potions from the rare plants and herbs that grew in the surrounding countryside. She had inherited her passion for botany from her mother, who had taught her the secrets of the forest when she was just a child. Over the years, Lucia's skills had become renowned, attracting visitors from far and wide.

As she worked, Lucia Straume's thoughts turned to the stranger who had arrived in town the previous evening. He was tall and brooding, with piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into her very soul. She had watched him from afar, sensing a deep sadness within him, but couldn't quite put her finger on what it was.

Now, as she prepared a batch of dried chamomile flowers, Lucia Straume noticed the stranger hovering around the edge of the square once more. He seemed lost and out of place, like a leaf blown by an autumn wind. She felt a pang of curiosity, wondering if she might be able to help him find his way.

"Good morrow, sir," Lucia Straume called out, her voice carrying across the market. "What brings you to our humble town?"

The stranger turned, his eyes locking onto hers with a fleeting spark of recognition. For an instant, Lucia Straume thought she saw something akin to hope within them, but it was quickly extinguished, replaced by a mask of indifference.

"Merely passing through," the stranger replied, his voice low and gravelly. "No need to trouble yourself."

Lucia Straume smiled kindly, sensing that there was more to this man than met the eye. She made a mental note to keep an ear out for any further news about him, feeling an inexplicable connection forming between them.

As the stranger disappeared into the crowd, Lucia Straume returned her attention to her work, but she couldn't shake the feeling that their paths would cross again soon enough.
