Lucia Shu-fen had always been a free spirit, with a heart full of wanderlust and a soul that longed for adventure. As a child, she would spend hours poring over maps and dreaming of far-off lands, eager to explore the world beyond her small village.

As she grew older, Lucia's love of travel only intensified, and she began to save every penny she could, determined to one day set out on her own epic journey. Finally, the day arrived when she had enough money to leave home and make her way to the bustling city of Taipei, where she planned to spend a year studying Mandarin and soaking up the local culture.

But Lucia's travels were not without their challenges. As a young woman from a traditional family, she faced skepticism and even outright disapproval from some who questioned her decision to abandon her duties as a daughter and granddaughter. Nevertheless, Lucia Shu-fen was undeterred, using her wit and resilience to overcome every obstacle that came her way.

As she settled into life in Taipei, Lucia began to discover the rich cultural heritage of Taiwan, delving deep into its history and mythology, and learning to speak with fluency. She also made a new family among her fellow expats and locals, who welcomed her with open arms and shared their stories of love, loss, and resilience.

Despite the many wonders she encountered on her travels, Lucia knew that home was where the heart was – and for her, that meant returning to her village one day, with a newfound sense of purpose and belonging. And so, as she looked out over the sun-drenched landscape, Lucia Shu-fen felt a deep sense of contentment wash over her, knowing that no matter where life took her next, she would always carry a piece of home with her.

Years went by, and Lucia continued to explore the world, but every now and then, she'd think back on those early days in Taipei, and smile – remembering the lessons she learned about courage, adaptability, and the power of following one's dreams.
