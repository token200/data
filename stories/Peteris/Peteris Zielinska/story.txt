To everyone's surprise, the wolf nuzzled Peteris' hand, and soon, he found himself understanding its thoughts.

One fateful day, while working on a project to save the Amur leopard, Peteris' extraordinary gift was put to the test. As he sat with one of the majestic cats, he received a vision – a warning that a devastating storm was brewing on the horizon. With mere minutes to spare, Peteris alerted his team, and together, they evacuated the area just in time.
