Born to a family of musicians, Peteris had grown up surrounded by the sounds of guitars and violins. From a tender age, he had demonstrated an uncanny ability to mimic the melodies of famous composers, leaving everyone in awe.

As Peteris grew older, his passion for music only intensified. He spent countless hours practicing on his guitar and perfecting his technique. His dedication paid off when he won the prestigious Tivoli Music Festival at just 18 years old, earning him a spot to study at the world-renowned conservatory.
