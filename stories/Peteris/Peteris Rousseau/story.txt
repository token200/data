I couldn't find any information on a character named Peteris Rousseau. It's possible that this is a fictional or made-up character.

However, I can create a short story based on your request. Here it is:

Peteris Rousseau was a young and ambitious journalist who had just landed his first big assignment. He was tasked with investigating a string of mysterious disappearances in the small town of Ravenswood. Peteris was determined to get to the bottom of the story, and he spent every waking moment researching and interviewing witnesses.

As he delved deeper into the case, Peteris began to notice a pattern. All of the missing persons had one thing in common: they had all been seen arguing with a local businessman named Mr. Jenkins. Peteris's curiosity was piqued, and he decided to pay Mr. Jenkins a visit.

When Peteris arrived at Mr. Jenkins' office, he was met with resistance. The older man seemed evasive and nervous, and Peteris sensed that he was hiding something. But the journalist was not one to give up easily. He pressed Mr. Jenkins for answers, and eventually, the businessman cracked under the pressure.

"It's just a coincidence," Mr. Jenkins muttered, "I had no idea it would lead to this."

Peteris smiled to himself as he left the office building. He knew that he had uncovered something big, and he couldn't wait to share his findings with his editor. As he walked back to his car, Peteris felt a sense of pride and satisfaction. This was what being a journalist was all about: seeking the truth and telling the stories that needed to be told.

With renewed energy, Peteris Rousseau headed back to the office, ready to write up his expose and bring the story to the people of Ravenswood.
