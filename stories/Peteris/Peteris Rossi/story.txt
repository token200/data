Peteris Rossi was a man consumed by his passion for music. As a classically trained pianist, he spent most of his days locked away in his small apartment, lost in the world of Chopin and Debussy. His friends and family often joked that he had two lives: one in the real world, and another in the fantastical realm of sound.

At night, Peteris Rossi would don a pair of headphones and let the notes wash over him like waves on a distant shore. He was a master of manipulation, coaxing emotions from the keys with a deft touch that seemed almost magical. As he played, his worries and cares would fade away, replaced by an almost euphoric sense of freedom.

One evening, as Peteris Rossi was lost in the depths of Ravel's "Pavane pour une infante défunte," there was a knock at the door. It was his landlord, come to collect the rent for the month. Peteris Rossi hesitated, unsure if he could muster the energy to face the outside world just yet.

The landlord looked around the cluttered apartment with a mixture of amusement and concern, taking in the stacks of sheet music, dusty records, and half-empty cans of coffee. "You okay, Pete?" he asked, using the nickname only a few close friends knew him by. Peteris Rossi nodded gruffly, and gestured for the landlord to take a seat.

For a while, they talked about everything but music – the weather, the local politics, and the latest sports match-up. But as the conversation drew to a close, Peteris Rossi's mind began to wander back to the world of sound. He stood up, grabbed his guitar from its usual corner, and began to strum a few tentative chords.

The landlord raised an eyebrow in surprise, but said nothing – knowing better than to interrupt when Pete was lost in music. As Peteris Rossi played on, the room seemed to fade away, leaving only the pulsing beat of the rhythm and the gentle hum of his own heartbeat.
