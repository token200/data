I think you meant to say Peter Gabriel, not Peteris Gabriel.

Peter Gabriel was born on February 13, 1950, in London, England. As a young man, he had a passion for music and art, which led him to study graphic design at the Chelsea School of Art. However, it wasn't long before his true calling as a musician emerged.

Gabriel's unique vocal style and eclectic musical tastes made him a standout artist among his peers. He was part of the progressive rock band Genesis, alongside Mike Rutherford, Phil Collins, and Tony Banks. Together, they created some of the most iconic music of the 1970s, with hits like "Invisible Touch" and "Land of Confusion."

But Gabriel's musical journey didn't end with Genesis. In 1986, he embarked on a solo career, which allowed him to explore his fascination with world music and social justice. His album "So" became a huge success, featuring hit singles like "Sledgehammer" and "In Your Eyes." The song's music video, directed by Simon Wincer, won several awards and cemented Gabriel's reputation as a creative visionary.

Throughout his career, Gabriel has been known for his activism and philanthropy. He is a long-time supporter of Amnesty International and has worked tirelessly to raise awareness about human rights issues around the world. His commitment to social justice has inspired countless fans and fellow artists alike.

Gabriel's collaborations with other musicians have also yielded some incredible results. In 1992, he partnered with Youssou N'Dour, a legendary African singer, on the album "Oyiangkoro." The album was a groundbreaking fusion of rock, pop, and traditional African music that showcased Gabriel's eclecticism and dedication to cross-cultural exchange.

Today, Peter Gabriel remains one of the most respected and beloved musicians of our time. His innovative spirit, passion for social justice, and commitment to artistic experimentation have made him a true icon in the world of music.
