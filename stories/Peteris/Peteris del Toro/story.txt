As the days turned into weeks, Peteris del Toro's workshop became a hive of activity, with apprentices and colleagues working tirelessly alongside him to bring the ancient technology to life. With each passing day, Peteris del Toro grew more confident in his abilities, his mastery over the mystical forces that governed Aethoria's world evident in every step, every calculation, and every stroke of his skilled hands.

The fate of Aethoria hung precariously in the balance, but with Peteris del Toro at the helm, hope seemed to flicker back to life.
