I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named "Peteris Farah". It's possible that this character is not well-known or does not exist in popular culture.

However, I can create a story about a fictional character with this name for you. Here it is:

In the bustling streets of Riga, Latvia, Peteris Farah was known as the most skilled latke maker in all the land. With his wild shock of blond hair and bushy eyebrows, he seemed like an oddity among the locals, but when it came to frying up crispy, golden-brown potatoes, no one could beat him.

As a young boy, Peteris Farah had spent countless hours watching his babka, Granny Marija, cook up a storm in their small kitchen. She taught him the secrets of traditional Latvian cuisine, and he quickly proved himself to be a prodigy in the kitchen. From latkes to zeppelins, Peteris Farah could make it all.

Years went by, and Peteris Farah's fame spread throughout the city. People came from far and wide to taste his legendary latkes, which were said to have the power to bring good luck and happiness. But Peteris Farah was humble about his success, always deflecting praise and crediting his babka for teaching him the skills.

One day, a prominent food critic from Moscow came to Riga seeking out the best latke maker in town. She had heard of Peteris Farah's legendary abilities and was determined to taste them for herself. After sampling several other vendors' wares, she finally made her way to Peteris Farah's stall, where she found a steaming plate of golden-brown goodness.

"Mmm, these are the best latkes I've ever tasted!" she exclaimed. Peteris Farah blushed and smiled, grateful for the praise. "It was all my babka, Granny Marija," he said with a chuckle.

From that day on, Peteris Farah's legend grew even further. People came from all over to taste his magical latkes, which were now famous not just for their deliciousness but also for being made with love and a dash of Latvian magic.
