Peteris Meinstein was known for his peculiar fashion sense. He often wore bright orange jumpsuits with neon green stripes, which made him stand out in a crowd. People would often do double takes when they saw him walking down the street, wondering what on earth he was wearing.

Despite his eccentric style, Peteris was a brilliant inventor. He spent most of his days tinkering with gadgets and machinery in his makeshift laboratory. His latest project was a machine that could turn thoughts into physical objects. It was still in the experimental stages, but Peteris was determined to make it work.

One day, while working on his invention, Peteris received an unexpected visit from his friend, Emma. She had heard about his machine and was curious to see if it actually worked. Peteris was thrilled to have someone to test his invention with.

Emma sat down next to Peteris at the workbench and thought about a beautiful white horse. Suddenly, a magnificent stallion appeared in front of them. It was made entirely out of gleaming silver metal, its mane and tail flowing like liquid. Emma gasped in amazement as Peteris beamed with pride.

"That's it!" he exclaimed. "The machine actually works! I knew it would eventually figure out how to translate thoughts into reality." Peteris patted the stallion on the neck, feeling a sense of accomplishment wash over him.

As they spent more time with the horse, Emma couldn't help but tease Peteris about his ridiculous outfit. "You know, Peteris Meinstein," she said with a grin, "you're so busy inventing amazing machines that you've forgotten how to dress normally." Peteris chuckled and shrugged, unapologetic about his fashion sense.

Despite the joke, Emma was genuinely impressed by Peteris's ingenuity. She had always known he was smart, but this took it to a whole new level. As they left the laboratory, Peteris couldn't wait to see what other inventions he would come up with next. With his machine working, anything seemed possible.
