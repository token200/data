Erik Pawlak trudged through the rain-soaked streets, his eyes fixed on the pavement ahead. He had been running for what felt like hours, but he knew it was only just beginning. As a former hitman for the powerful and ruthless Red Viper gang, Erik had seen things no man should ever have to see. But after a job gone sour left him with a price on his head, he'd made a vow to himself to leave that life behind.

Now, at 35, Erik was trying to start anew in the small town of Oakdale, where everyone knew each other's names and the worst crime you could commit was speeding. He'd taken a new identity - "Mike" to the locals - and was working as a mechanic at the local garage, trying to keep a low profile.

But the past had a way of catching up, and Erik knew it only a matter of time before his former employers found him. As he walked, he noticed a group of men watching him from across the street. They were too far away to make out their faces, but Erik's instincts told him they weren't just random bystanders.

He quickened his pace, his eyes scanning the rooftops and alleys for any sign of trouble. Suddenly, his phone buzzed in his pocket. He hesitated for a moment before answering it, hoping it wasn't one of his old associates.

"Mike?" A low, gravelly voice spoke on the other end. "We know you're in Oakdale. We want to... invite you back."

Erik's gut tightened. Who was this? And what did they want with him now?

"I'm not interested," he said firmly. "I've made a new life here, and I intend to keep it that way."

There was a pause on the other end of the line before the voice spoke up again. "You can't hide forever, Erik Pawlak. We always find what we're looking for."

The line went dead, and Erik's heart began to pound in his chest. He knew he couldn't outrun his past - not yet, anyway. But he was determined to fight, to prove that he wasn't just a shell of his former self.

With renewed determination, Erik turned back towards the garage, ready to face whatever lay ahead. He would show those who thought they could take him down that Mike Pawlak was a man on the move - and not one to be underestimated.
