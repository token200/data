Erik Abbagnato stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small town of Ashwood. The once-thriving coal mining community was now a shadow of its former self, its streets lined with abandoned buildings and a lingering sense of decay.

As a photographer, Erik had traveled to countless towns like this one, capturing the stories of those who remained. He had heard whispers of a local legend, a man named Leo, who was said to have uncovered a hidden vein of coal deep within the town's mines.

Erik made his way through the streets, his camera slung over his shoulder, as he searched for Leo. The locals eyed him warily, but one old man, perched on a porch bench, caught his attention.

"You're looking for Leo, I reckon?" the old man said, his voice low and gravelly.

Erik nodded, intrigued. "I've heard stories. Do you know anything about him?"

The old man leaned forward, his eyes glinting with a knowing light. "Leo was a miner, just like his father and grandfather before him. But he saw something in those mines that no one else did â€“ a secret that's been hidden for years."

Erik's curiosity was piqued. "What kind of secret?"

The old man hesitated, as if unsure whether to share the story. "It's said that Leo discovered an underground lake, filled with coal that shone like gold in the sunlight. He used it to fund his own mining operation, and it brought prosperity back to Ashwood."

Erik's mind was racing with possibilities. Could this be true? Was there really a hidden treasure beneath the town?

He asked the old man for more information, but he vanished into the crowd before Erik could press him further.

Undeterred, Erik continued his search. He scoured the town, interviewing locals and scouring dusty archives in the old library. As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the town's streets, Erik stumbled upon an old map tucked away in a forgotten corner of the archive room.

It was a crude drawing of the mine shafts, with a small X marked near one of the entrances. Erik's heart quickened as he realized that this might be the key to uncovering Leo's secret.

With his camera at the ready, Erik made his way back to the old man on the porch bench. "I think I've found something," he said, holding up the map.

The old man's eyes widened in surprise. "Where did you get that?"

Erik smiled, a sense of excitement building within him. "Let's just say I have my ways."
