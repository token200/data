Erik Salamanca stood confidently in front of the mirror, adjusting his tie for what felt like the hundredth time. As the youngest son of Tuco's empire, he had a reputation to uphold - or tear down, depending on who you asked. His full name, Erik Salamanca, carried weight, and he was determined to prove himself as more than just Tuco's little brother.

As he made his way to the meeting with his business partners, Erik's mind wandered back to their conversation earlier that day. They were discussing the plans for a new cartel operation, one that would bring in big profits but also come with significant risks. Erik knew better than to disagree with his father's methods, not when it came to the business of the Salamanca empire.

Upon arrival at the designated location, Erik spotted the other investors huddled around a large table. He took his seat and waited for the meeting to begin, trying to appear nonchalant despite the butterflies in his stomach. As he sipped on his whiskey, Erik's thoughts turned to his full name - would anyone remember it beyond the association with his infamous family?

The conversation flowed smoothly, with Erik fielding questions about his expertise in finance and management. He skillfully steered the discussion towards more lucrative ventures, impressing the investors with his strategic thinking. For a moment, he forgot about his complicated heritage and simply enjoyed being seen as an asset.

However, that brief respite was short-lived. The topic shifted to their father's increasing instability, and Erik felt his composure slipping. Would his business partners accept him for who he truly was - the spoiled son of Tuco Salamanca? Or would they view him solely through the lens of his family name?

As the meeting drew to a close, Erik made a mental note to find a way to distance himself from Tuco's shadow. It wouldn't be easy, but he knew it was necessary for his own success - and sanity. With a final nod, he gathered his belongings and slipped out into the night, ready to forge his own path under the guidance of his full name: Erik Salamanca.
