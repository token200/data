The show would feature Erik's entire body of work, including pieces he had been working on in secret. Overjoyed and overwhelmed by the opportunity, Erik accepted the challenge.

The night of the exhibition arrived, and the museum was packed with people eager to see the enigmatic Erik Corbero's latest creations.
