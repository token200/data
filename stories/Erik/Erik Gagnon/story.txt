Erik Gagnon stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway, his eyes scanning the crowded streets of Montreal's Old Port. He had been waiting for hours, watching the people come and go, before he spotted her – a woman with piercing green eyes and long, curly brown hair.

She was laughing with a group of friends, sipping on a glass of wine, and completely unaware of the danger lurking in the shadows. Erik's heart quickened as he watched her, his mind racing with the possibilities.

He had been tracking her for weeks, ever since she had walked into his favorite bar in the French Quarter. She had caught his eye, that first time – a spark of recognition that he couldn't quite explain. Since then, he had become obsessed with finding out who she was and what brought her to Montreal.

As he observed her, Erik noticed something peculiar – a small tattoo on her left wrist, shaped like a sun with an arrow pointing towards the center. He remembered seeing it in the same bar where they first met, etched into the skin of another woman who had... disappeared.

Erik's instincts told him that this woman was connected to his past, but he couldn't quite put his finger on what it was. His memories were hazy, fragmented, and shrouded in secrecy. He knew only that he felt drawn to her, like a moth to a flame.

As the night wore on, Erik found himself getting closer, trying not to startle her. She finished her drink and began to make her way through the crowd, completely unaware of his presence. Erik followed at a distance, careful not to be seen.

Finally, she stopped in front of him, looked up at him with an air of curiosity, and said, "Hi, I'm Sophia."

Erik's heart skipped a beat as he searched for an answer, but all that came out was a smile and the words, "Nice to meet you." For now, that was enough.
