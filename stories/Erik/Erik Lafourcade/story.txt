Erik Lafourcade stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the familiar streets of her hometown. It had been ten years since she'd last set foot in Ravenswood, but the memories still lingered like a ghostly presence. Erik's full name echoed through her mind as she made her way to the small café where her best friend, Rachel, worked.

As she pushed open the door, a bell above it let out a cheerful tinkle, and Rachel looked up from behind the counter, a warm smile spreading across her face. "Erik! It's so great to see you!" The two friends had grown up together, sharing secrets and laughter as they navigated the ups and downs of adolescence.

Over steaming cups of coffee, Erik filled Rachel in on her life since leaving Ravenswood. She'd spent years traveling, working odd jobs, and trying to find her place in the world. But now, at twenty-five, she felt restless, like there was something missing. As they chatted, a figure caught Erik's eye - a young man with piercing blue eyes and a messy mop of brown hair, sitting alone at a table by the window.

There was something about him that drew her in, something that made her feel seen and understood. "Who's that?" she asked Rachel, nodding towards the stranger. Rachel followed her gaze, a knowing look crossing her face. "That's Max," she said quietly. "He just moved back to town. Apparently, he's been away for years, working as a journalist in Europe."

As Erik watched, Max looked up and caught her eye, a hint of a smile playing on his lips. It was like the entire world had come alive, and she felt an inexplicable connection to this stranger. Her full name seemed to fade into the background as she leaned in, feeling a spark of excitement ignite within her.

The rest of the afternoon slipped by in a haze of conversation, laughter, and shared stories. Erik left the café with a renewed sense of purpose, feeling like she'd found a piece of herself that she thought was lost forever. As she walked away from Ravenswood, the familiar streets now felt like a threshold to new possibilities, and she knew that her life was about to take a dramatic turn.
