Erik Novak stood alone on the edge of the cliff, the wind whipping his hair into a frenzy as he gazed out at the endless expanse of ocean below. A writer by trade, Erik had always found solace in the written word, but lately, it seemed like the words were drying up within him.

As a child, Erik had been fascinated by the sea, spending hours combing the beaches for shells and sea glass. His love of the ocean had only grown stronger as he grew older, and now, at 30, he found himself feeling lost and disconnected from the world around him.

Erik's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps behind him. He turned to see his best friend, Sarah, approaching him with a concerned look on her face. "Hey, are you okay?" she asked, as Erik gestured for her to sit down beside him.

Sarah knew Erik better than anyone, and she could sense that something was wrong. "What's going on, Eri?" she asked gently. "You've been withdrawing from everyone lately. Is it the writing?"

Erik sighed, feeling a lump form in his throat. "I don't know," he admitted. "It just feels like I'm losing my way. Like I'm stuck in neutral."

Sarah put a reassuring arm around Erik's shoulders. "You're not alone, Eri," she said softly. "We all go through tough times. You just need to take a step back and remind yourself why you started writing in the first place."

Erik thought about Sarah's words, and for the first time in weeks, he felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, he could find his way again. He took a deep breath, feeling the ocean air fill his lungs, and began to scribble notes on a piece of paper that had been tucked away in his pocket.

As the sun began to set over the water, Erik smiled to himself, feeling a sense of renewed purpose. Maybe this was just what he needed - a little nudge from his best friend, and a reminder that even when the words were dry, the ocean was always there to carry him along.
