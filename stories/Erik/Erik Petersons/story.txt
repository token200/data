Alex introduced himself as the founder of a startup company, and he had heard about Petersons' Industries through mutual acquaintances. He sought Erik's expertise on how to scale his business and create a sustainable growth strategy. Erik listened intently, asking pointed questions that left Alex both impressed and intimidated.

After the meeting, Rachel reminded Erik that it was time for him to head home. As he stood up, Erik turned to Alex and said, "Keep pushing forward, young man. The world needs innovative thinkers like you." With a nod, Erik departed, leaving behind an impression of encouragement and hope.
