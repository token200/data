Erik Esposito walked into the dimly lit bar, scanning the room for his friends. He spotted them in the corner, huddled together and sipping on their drinks. As he made his way over, one of them, a tall, lanky man with a messy mop of hair, caught his eye.

"Erik Esposito," Matt said, raising an eyebrow as Erik approached. "What brings you here tonight?"

Erik slid onto the stool beside him, ordering a whiskey on the rocks from the bartender. He took a sip, feeling the burn all the way down. "Just needed to get out of the apartment for a bit," he said.

Mike, the other friend, nodded sympathetically. They had known Erik Esposito since college, and they knew that sometimes he just needed some space. Erik's job as a graphic designer could be monotonous at times, and the pressure to come up with new ideas was always there.

As they chatted, Erik couldn't help but think about his latest project. He had been tasked with creating a logo for a new client, and so far, he hadn't been able to quite nail it. His brain was filled with sketches and ideas, but none of them seemed quite right.

"I'm sorry I've been MIA all week," Erik said, leaning back in his stool. "I just need to get this logo thing figured out."

Matt chuckled. "You're going to figure it out, Erik Esposito. You always do."

Erik smiled wryly. He was grateful for his friends' support, even if they didn't understand the intricacies of graphic design. As he finished his drink and prepared to leave, Mike put a hand on his shoulder.

"Hey, you okay? You seem a bit off tonight," Mike said.

Erik nodded. "Yeah, I'm fine. Just stressed about work."

Mike's expression softened. "We're here for you, Erik Esposito. Whatever it is that's bothering you."

Erik smiled, feeling a weight lift off his shoulders. With friends like Matt and Mike by his side, he knew he could handle anything that came his way â€“ including the pesky logo project.
