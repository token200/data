Her husband had been murdered under suspicious circumstances, and she needed Kairat Esposito's expertise to unravel the tangled threads of the crime.

With an air of quiet confidence, Kairat Esposito set out to investigate. He spent the next few days interviewing suspects and gathering clues, which led him to a seedy underground club on the outskirts of town. There, he encountered a shady individual who seemed evasive but intriguingly nervous.
