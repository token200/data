Kairat Jain walked into the crowded café, scanning the room for a familiar face. It wasn't often that she found herself in such a social setting, but her friend's birthday celebration had brought out the social butterfly within her. As she made her way through the throng of people, Kairat Jain spotted her friend, Leela, waiting by the bar with a bright smile on her face.

Kairat Jain made her way over to Leela and gave her a warm hug. "Happy birthday, my friend!" she exclaimed, her eyes shining with excitement. Leela blushed and playfully pushed Kairat Jain away. "You're going to make me cry," she said, her voice trembling slightly.

As the evening wore on, Kairat Jain found herself lost in conversation with a group of strangers-turned-friends. They laughed and joked together, sharing stories and anecdotes that left her in stitches. She was having the time of her life, feeling carefree and alive for once.

But as the night wore on, Kairat Jain began to feel a pang of loneliness. She missed her family, who were back home celebrating with Leela's other friends. She had been hesitant to join them at first, but now she wished she had made more of an effort to attend. The thought nagged at her as the evening drew to a close.

As the last guest departed and the café grew quiet once again, Kairat Jain took a moment to collect herself. She looked around at the empty chairs, feeling a little wistful. It had been a night to remember, but it was also a reminder that even in the midst of celebration and joy, there were always those who made her feel like an outsider.

Just then, Leela appeared beside her, a concerned look on her face. "Hey, are you okay?" she asked softly. Kairat Jain nodded, forcing a smile onto her face. "Yeah, I'm fine," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. Leela nodded understandingly and wrapped an arm around her shoulders. "We'll celebrate your birthday too, next time." And in that moment, Kairat Jain knew that no matter what the future held, she would always have friends like Leela by her side to share it with.
