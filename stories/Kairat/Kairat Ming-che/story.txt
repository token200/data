Kairat Ming-che was known for his exceptional detective skills, which had earned him a reputation as one of the best in the business. A native of Almaty, Kazakhstan, he had always been drawn to puzzles and mysteries, spending countless hours as a child poring over detective novels and trying to solve them on his own.

As Kairat Ming-che grew older, his passion for detective work only intensified, leading him to study criminology in college. After graduating, he set up his own detective agency in Almaty, where he quickly built a loyal client base and earned a reputation for being one of the most reliable and discreet detectives in town.

One day, Kairat Ming-che received a visit from a wealthy businessman named Rakhymgali, who was frantic with worry. His daughter had gone missing, and the police were unable to find any leads. Desperate for help, Rakhymgali begged Kairat Ming-che to take on the case.
