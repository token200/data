As the day wore on, the bakery filled with the chatter of locals sharing stories and gossip over steaming cups of coffee. Leticia Mendes listened attentively, her eyes twinkling with interest as she expertly wrapped up a dozen croissants for a customer's lunchbox.

Despite the demands of running the bakery, Leticia Mendes always found time to experiment with new recipes. She spent hours poring over cookbooks and scouring social media for inspiration, often incorporating foreign flavors into her Portuguese masterpieces.
