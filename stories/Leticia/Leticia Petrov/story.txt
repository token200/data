Leticia Petrov stood alone in the rain-soaked streets, her long, raven-black hair plastered to her pale face. She was a woman on a mission, driven by a singular desire for revenge against those who had wronged her.

As she walked, the neon lights of the city's underbelly cast an eerie glow over the pavement. Leticia knew every alleyway and backstreet like the back of her hand, having spent countless nights prowling these very streets in search of information about her family's murder.

The Petrov clan had been one of the most influential families in the city's underworld for generations, but on that fateful night, their empire came crashing down. Leticia's parents and younger brother had been brutally murdered in a hail of bullets, leaving her as the sole survivor.

Years of training and preparation had honed Leticia into a deadly operative, capable of infiltrating even the most secure facilities. She had spent countless hours tracking down leads, following every tip, no matter how small, in an effort to bring those responsible to justice.

Tonight was different, though. Tonight, Leticia had received a cryptic message from an unknown source, hinting at the location of her family's killers. The note had been unsigned, but the words themselves seemed to sear themselves into her brain like a branding iron.

With a newfound sense of determination, Leticia set off towards the address on the note. Her eyes scanned the rooftops and shadows, ever vigilant for signs of danger. She knew that she was taking a risk, but she was willing to do whatever it took to see justice served.

As she reached the designated location, Leticia's heart skipped a beat. The building in front of her was nondescript, its walls covered in a mesh of rusty pipes and decaying brickwork. But it was the figure waiting on the steps that made her blood run cold – a man with a twisted grin spreading across his face, one who looked uncannily like her family's killer.

Leticia's eyes locked onto the man, her finger tightening around the grip of her gun. This was it – the moment she had been working towards for so long. She took a deep breath and stepped forward, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
