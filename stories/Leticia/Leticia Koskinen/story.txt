Leticia Koskinen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar surroundings. She had arrived in Helsinki, Finland, just hours before, with little more than a suitcase full of clothes and a sense of adventure.

As a former journalist from New York, Leticia had grown tired of the monotony of city life. She had always been drawn to the unknown, and after a painful divorce, she saw this trip as a chance to reinvent herself. Helsinki's promise of cold winters, vibrant culture, and breathtaking landscapes had lured her in like a magnet.

Leticia made her way through the station, her ears ringing from the unfamiliar language and her skin stinging from the chill of the autumn air. She hailed a taxi and gave the driver an address she had found online – a small, quirky bookstore on the waterfront.

The taxi hurtled along the darkening streets, Leticia's eyes fixed on the passing buildings as the city seemed to come alive around her. When they finally stopped at the doorstep of "Lemmat" bookshop, Leticia felt a rush of excitement. She stepped out onto the sidewalk, taking a deep breath of the salty air and letting the darkness envelop her.

 Inside the shop, she found herself lost in a world of musty pages and whispered stories. The proprietor, an elderly man with spectacles perched on the end of his nose, greeted her warmly and introduced himself as Antti.

Over steaming cups of coffee and scattered books, Leticia discovered that Antti was not just a store owner but a chronicler of Helsinki's history and mythology. His tales of old-school Finnish folk tales, Nordic legends, and forgotten heroes captivated her like no language ever had.

As the night wore on, Leticia found herself feeling more at home than she had in years. She knew that this chance trip might be just what she needed – a break from the world's expectations and a new beginning in the frozen north.
