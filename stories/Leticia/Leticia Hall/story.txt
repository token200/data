Leticia Hall sat alone at the small, wooden table in her grandmother's old cottage, surrounded by the familiar scents of fresh-baked cookies and simmering tea. It was a ritual she had grown accustomed to on Wednesday evenings, when the world outside seemed to slow down, and the only sound was the gentle ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner.

As a child, Leticia had spent countless hours listening to her grandmother's stories of love, loss, and resilience. Her grandmother, Abuela Rosa, had been a fiery woman with a heart full of kindness and a spirit that could light up even the darkest of rooms. She had passed away a year ago, leaving behind a legacy of wisdom, warmth, and a pinch of sass that only Leticia knew how to channel.

Tonight, as she sat amidst the familiar comforts of her grandmother's home, Leticia felt a pang in her chest. It was the anniversary of Abuela Rosa's passing, and the weight of grief still lingered, like an old friend visiting for the holidays. She had thought that with time, the ache would ease, but tonight, it seemed to be intensifying.

Leticia pushed aside her doubts and closed her eyes, letting the memories wash over her. She remembered Abuela Rosa's infectious laughter, her quick wit, and her unwavering optimism in the face of adversity. As she breathed in, she could almost smell the scent of Abuela Rosa's perfume, a heady mix of rose petals and jasmine that transported her back to countless afternoons spent playing hide-and-seek behind the kitchen curtains.

Suddenly, an idea struck her – an idea that had been gestating beneath the surface for months. Leticia's grandmother had always spoken about the importance of preserving memories, not just through stories but also through tangible objects and experiences. She envisioned a small exhibit space in the cottage, where she could collect her grandmother's treasured possessions, letters, photographs, and mementos from throughout their lives.

As Leticia opened her eyes, a sense of purpose settled into place. It wouldn't bring back Abuela Rosa, but it would honor her memory and keep her spirit alive. She smiled to herself, knowing that this was just the beginning of a new chapter in her life – one filled with love, loss, and the warmth of a legacy that would never fade.

With newfound determination, Leticia stood up from the table, her eyes shining with tears. Tonight might be hard, but tomorrow would be brighter, for she knew exactly what she had to do.
