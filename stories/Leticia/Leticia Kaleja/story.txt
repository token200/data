Leticia Kaleja stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. A traveler for most, she was also a wanderer, always on the move with a sense of restlessness that could never be satiated. Her thoughts were consumed by the city ahead, a place shrouded in mystery and rumor.

As she made her way through the crowded streets, Leticia Kaleja felt a thrill of excitement course through her veins. She had heard whispers of this city's hidden corners, its secret inhabitants, and its untold stories. And yet, despite the allure, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched.

A glance over her shoulder revealed a figure tailing her, their eyes fixed intently on Leticia Kaleja's back. She quickened her pace, weaving through the throngs of people with an air of confidence that belied her nervousness. The city seemed to grow denser, its shadows twisting and writhing like living things.

Eventually, she found herself at the edge of a neglected square, overgrown with vines and littered with broken statues. In the center stood an ancient fountain, its waters stagnant and still. Leticia Kaleja approached it cautiously, feeling the weight of the city's secrets bearing down upon her.

As she peered into the depths of the fountain, a face gazed back at her - that of an enigmatic woman with eyes like polished onyx. For a moment, their gazes locked, and Leticia Kaleja felt the veil between worlds lift, revealing a hidden reality that had been hidden for centuries.

The vision was fleeting, leaving behind only a whisper of its presence. But the memory lingered, a haunting echo that would stay with her forever. As she turned to leave, a piece of paper slipped from the woman's hand and drifted to the ground, bearing an inscription that read: "For Leticia Kaleja, the seeker".
