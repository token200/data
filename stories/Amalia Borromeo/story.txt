Amalia Borromeo stood in front of the grand mirror in her bedroom, adjusting the delicate lace on her evening gown. Her mother, the Duchess of Milan, had insisted she wore something "fitting" for the upcoming ball at the Palace of Versailles. Amalia sighed inwardly; she was only eighteen and didn't want to be treated like a doll.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was her loyal lady-in-waiting, Lucia. "Your Highness, it's time for your carriage," Lucia announced, curtsying. Amalia followed Lucia downstairs, where her parents waited in the foyer. Her father, the Duke, looked dashing as always, but Amalia's mother seemed nervous.

As they drove to Versailles, Amalia's thoughts wandered to the ball. She had heard rumors of a handsome young Frenchman attending, and she couldn't help but feel excited at the prospect. When they arrived, Amalia was swept up in a whirlwind of color and music. The palace was filled with people from all over Europe, and Amalia felt like a small fish in a vast ocean.

As she danced and chatted with various guests, Amalia's eyes met those of the young Frenchman. He was tall and dark-haired, with piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through her. For a moment, they locked gazes, and Amalia felt a jolt of electricity run through her veins.

The night passed in a blur, but when it was over, Amalia knew she had to leave. As she said goodbye to the young Frenchman, who introduced himself as Léonard, he pressed a small piece of paper into her hand. It was a note, scrawled with his words: "Meet me at midnight. Come alone."

Amalia's heart skipped a beat as she tucked the note into her reticule. She felt like she had been given a secret, one that only she and Léonard shared.

As the carriage ride back to Milan began, Amalia couldn't shake off the feeling of restlessness. What would happen at midnight? Would she see Léonard again? And what did he want from her?

The hours ticked by, each one a countdown until the appointed hour. Finally, when the clock struck twelve, Amalia slipped out of bed and made her way to the balcony. The night air was cool and crisp, filled with the scent of blooming flowers.

As she gazed up at the stars, Amalia saw Léonard standing below her window. He smiled when he saw her, and Amalia's heart fluttered in response. For a moment, they just looked at each other, the world around them melting away.

And then, without a word, Léonard turned and disappeared into the night, leaving Amalia feeling both exhilarated and uncertain about what lay ahead.
