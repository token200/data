István Borromeo stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station for any sign of the old man he had come to meet. As he waited, he thought back on how he had first heard about István Borromeo, a mysterious figure rumored to possess ancient knowledge of the land.

According to legend, István Borromeo was more than just a recluse living in the remote mountains - he was a keeper of secrets and stories that dated back centuries. Some said he was a direct descendant of the great Hungarian leaders who had once ruled over this region, while others claimed he was a sorcerer with the power to communicate with spirits.

István Borromeo himself remained tight-lipped about his past, but István knew better than to ask questions. He had spent years searching for this man, following rumors and whispers through dusty towns and villages until finally, here he was.

As the train's whistle faded into the distance, an old figure emerged from the trees at the station's edge. His eyes sparkled in the fading light, and István felt a shiver run down his spine as their gazes met. The man beckoned him forward, and István followed, his footsteps quiet on the stone pavement.

They walked for what felt like hours, the silence between them growing thicker with each step. Finally, they reached a small clearing surrounded by ancient trees, their branches twisted and gnarled with age. In the center of the clearing stood an old cabin, its wooden walls weathered to a soft silver-gray.

István Borromeo gestured for him to enter, and István did so, his eyes adjusting to the dim light within. The air was thick with incense and the scent of aged parchment. István's host settled into a chair by the fire, a small smile playing on his lips.

"Welcome, young one," he said finally, his voice low and gravelly. "I've been expecting you."
