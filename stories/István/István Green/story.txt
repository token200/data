István Green was a man shrouded in mystery. He lived on the outskirts of Budapest, in a small, cluttered flat that seemed to hold secrets of its own. Few people knew much about him beyond his name and occupation: István Green, poet.

Rumors swirled that he'd written some of the most beautiful and haunting verse the city had ever known. Some said it was true – that his words had a way of capturing the essence of Hungary's history and soul. Others claimed it was all fabrication, that István Green was nothing more than a nameless stranger hiding in plain sight.

One night, I stumbled upon him at a small café near the Danube. He sat alone, nursing a cup of black coffee, his eyes fixed on some invisible point beyond the table. The air around him seemed heavy with melancholy, as if he'd carried the weight of the world on his shoulders for far too long.

As I watched, a young woman approached him, her eyes shining with curiosity. She introduced herself as Lili, and István Green smiled faintly in response. They began to speak in hushed tones, their conversation peppered with nods and gestures that seemed almost... familiar.

The night wore on, the café emptied of patrons, leaving us alone with our thoughts. I listened, entranced, as István Green spoke of love, loss, and the human condition. His words were like autumn leaves – delicate, fragile, yet capable of nourishing even the most barren of souls.

As Lili departed, István Green's gaze locked onto mine. For a moment, we simply stared at each other, two strangers bound by a thread of understanding that transcended words. Then, without warning, he vanished into thin air – disappeared as if he'd never existed at all.

The next morning, I returned to the café, determined to find István Green and learn more about his enigmatic presence in our lives. But he was gone once again, leaving behind only a small note on the table: "The words are enough. Sometimes."

I stared at the paper, my heart heavy with the knowledge that some secrets were too great for words to capture – or for us to understand. Yet, as I gazed out into the misty dawn, I felt a strange sense of peace settle within me. For in that fleeting moment with István Green, I'd glimpsed something extraordinary – the boundless potential of language and the mystery that lay just beyond its reach.
