István Koskinen was a man consumed by his passion for taxidermy. His small workshop in Budapest's Jewish quarter was a curiosity among locals, who would often peer through the grimy windows to catch glimpses of the strange and wonderful creatures on display.

As a young boy, István had always been fascinated by the art of preserving dead animals. He spent hours watching videos of taxidermists at work, mesmerized by their skillful hands as they stitched and posed their subjects into lifelike arrangements. When he grew old enough, István Koskinen set out to become a taxidermist himself, apprenticing under a gruff but kind mentor who taught him the intricacies of the craft.

Years turned into decades, and István's skills only improved. His workshop became renowned for its exceptional quality, attracting visitors from all over Europe who sought to commission unique pieces from the master. There was his famous "Gypsy Bride," a stunning arrangement of a deer in wedding finery, surrounded by tiny glass slippers and a golden headdress.

Despite his success, István remained humble and dedicated to his craft. He spent every waking moment perfecting his art, experimenting with new techniques and materials to push the boundaries of what was possible. His workshop became a shrine to his beloved profession, filled with books, tools, and half-finished projects that reflected his boundless energy and creativity.

One day, a young woman named Szilvia stumbled upon István's workshop while exploring the Jewish quarter. She had always been enchanted by taxidermy, and as she pushed open the creaky door, she was met with the warm glow of incandescent bulbs and the enticing scent of preserved hide. István Koskinen looked up from his workbench, a hint of surprise on his weathered face, before breaking into a wide smile that revealed crooked teeth stained with coffee.

"Welcome to my world," he said, extending a gnarled hand for Szilvia to shake. "I am István Koskinen, at your service."
