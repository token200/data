István Balodis was a man with a troubled past, haunted by the demons of his own making. A former Hungarian poet and novelist, he had once been celebrated for his bold and unflinching portrayals of life in post-communist Hungary.

But that was before the tragedy. Before the loss that shook him to his core and left him a shadow of his former self.

Now, István wandered the streets of Budapest, lost and alone. His eyes, once bright with creativity, had dimmed like the dying embers of a fire. His words, which had once flowed so effortlessly, now felt forced and artificial, as if straining to be heard through a rusty gate.

As he walked, István's mind wandered back to the day his wife, Lilla, died in a car accident on their way home from a visit to her ailing mother. The pain was like a knife twisting deep within his chest, and every breath felt like a weight crushing him beneath its weight.

István stopped in front of a small café, one he had visited countless times with Lilla. He remembered the laughter they had shared over coffee, the way she would smile at him when he recited his poetry aloud to her. The memories were bittersweet, like a meal left out too long – sweet, but also spoiled.

With a heavy heart, István pushed open the door and stepped inside. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee enveloped him, transporting him back to a time when life felt full and vibrant. He took a seat at the bar and ordered a cup of strong black coffee.

As he sipped his drink, István noticed an old woman sitting in the corner, her eyes closed as if lost in thought. There was something about her that reminded him of Lilla – the way she smiled to herself when no one was looking, the way she would curl up with a book on a rainy day.

István approached the old woman and introduced himself. They began to talk, exchanging stories and laughter like old friends. For the first time in months, István felt a glimmer of hope – maybe, just maybe, his heart could heal and find its way back to the world of words he loved so much.

As they parted ways outside the café, István smiled at the old woman, feeling a sense of gratitude wash over him. Maybe, in time, the pain would recede, and he would find himself again – with words that flowed like life itself, not like a stagnant pool reflecting the emptiness within.
