István Morgan stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the quaint station. The air was thick with the scent of old books and stale coffee, transporting him to a time long past. As a historian, István Morgan had spent countless hours studying the lives of those who came before him, but there was something about this place that felt different.

He pulled out his map and consulted it, trying to determine which direction he should head in. The station master approached him, eyeing István's worn backpack with a hint of curiosity. "Can I help you, young man?" the old man asked.

István Morgan smiled wryly. "Just passing through," he said. "I'm on my way to meet someone."

The station master nodded knowingly. "Ah, yes. You must be here for Professor Kovács. He's expecting you."

István Morgan's eyes lit up with interest. He had heard stories about the renowned professor, who was known for his vast knowledge of ancient history. As he made his way through the winding streets of the town, István couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement.

After what felt like an eternity, he arrived at Professor Kovács's office. The old man himself greeted him warmly, shaking István Morgan's hand firmly. "Ah, welcome! I've been expecting you. Please, come in."

As they sat down to discuss the intricacies of medieval politics, István Morgan found himself becoming lost in the professor's words. For hours, they pored over dusty texts and ancient artifacts, exploring the world that had shaped the course of history.

Throughout their discussion, Professor Kovács often referred to his young guest as "István Morgan," with a warmth and familiarity that made István feel like an old friend. As the sun began to set outside, casting long shadows across the room, István knew that he had found something special in this small town and its remarkable scholar.

Over the next few days, István spent his time exploring the town and assisting Professor Kovács with his research. As he sat at the professor's desk, pouring over ancient texts alongside him, István couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude towards this man who had taken him under his wing. He knew that this experience would stay with him for the rest of his life, and that he owed it all to Professor Kovács – and, indeed, to himself, as István Morgan.
