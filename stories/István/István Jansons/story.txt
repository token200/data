István Jansons stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the familiar sights of Budapest's outskirts. It had been ten years since he'd left this city behind, fleeing the poverty and hardship that had defined his childhood. Now, at thirty-five, István was a man with a purpose.

He had made it to America, where he worked as an engineer in a small firm in New York City. The job paid well, but it was nothing compared to the satisfaction of designing bridges and buildings that would last for generations. Still, it was a start.

István hailed a taxi and headed towards his small apartment in Manhattan. He had shared it with two roommates, all fellow immigrants who had also come to the United States seeking better lives. The three men were always good company, but István often found himself lost in thought, dreaming of the homeland he left behind.

As he settled into his routine, István began to make plans for a return trip. He knew that one day, when his children grew old enough, they would need to see their heritage firsthand. His wife, Erzsébet, had always been hesitant about returning to Hungary, but István was determined to show her the country he loved.

The months passed, and István's plans took shape. He booked a ticket for Budapest, where he would spend a week reconnecting with his roots. As he stood on the platform once more, István felt a mix of emotions: excitement, nervousness, and nostalgia.

He boarded the train to Erszebetville, a small village in the countryside, where his family had lived for generations. The landscape unfolded before him like a painting – rolling hills, sparkling lakes, and forests stretching as far as the eye could see.

István's visit was a time of reflection and renewal. He spent hours walking through the fields, listening to the birdsong, and reminiscing about his childhood. Erzsébet joined him on the last day of his trip, and together they strolled along the Danube, watching the sunset over the city.

As the stars began to twinkle in the night sky, István knew that he would return to Hungary one day soon. His children needed to see their homeland, just as he had needed it all these years ago. He looked at Erzsébet, her eyes shining with love and support, and smiled – knowing that home was where the heart was.
