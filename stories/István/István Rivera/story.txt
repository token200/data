He had always been drawn to the world of art, finding solace in the brushstrokes of a painter or the melodies of a violinist. But it was not until he stumbled upon an ancient tome hidden away in a dusty bookstore that István Rivera's true journey began.

The book, bound in worn leather and adorned with strange symbols, spoke of an ancient magic that lay within the realm of art itself.
