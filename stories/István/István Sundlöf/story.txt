István Sundlöf stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the smell of damp earth and decay filling his nostrils. It was a smell he hadn't encountered in years, not since he left Budapest behind. The once-thriving city now seemed like a distant memory, a relic of a life he'd outgrown.

As a young man, István had been part of the Hungarian Underground, fighting against the oppressive regime that ruled his homeland. He'd lost friends, family members, and even parts of himself in the struggle. But when the revolution finally came, István emerged with scars on both body and soul.

Now, at 45, he was a stranger to this country he once called home. The war had left him broken, but also strangely free. He'd wandered Europe for years, taking on odd jobs and listening to stories of those who still held onto hope.

As István made his way through the desolate station, a young woman caught his eye. She was huddled in a coat, her eyes red-rimmed from crying. There was something familiar about her, yet utterly foreign. István felt an inexplicable urge to approach her, to offer what little comfort he could.

"Magyar?" she asked, looking up at him with uncertain eyes.

István nodded, and the woman's gaze faltered, like a light flickering out. "I'm Anna," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

István took a seat beside her on a bench, feeling the rough wood beneath his palms. For the first time in years, he allowed himself to be still, to simply listen. Anna told him about losing her job, her apartment, and her sense of purpose. With each word, István felt a small part of himself stirring back to life.

As they talked, István realized that this stranger had more courage in her eyes than many men he'd known during the war. She was scared, yes, but she refused to let fear define her. And as they parted ways, István knew that he would carry a piece of Anna's hope with him always.

He stepped back onto the train, feeling the familiar rhythm of the wheels on steel beneath his feet. The platform receded into the distance, and for an instant, István felt a sense of belonging, of coming home. But as the train picked up speed, he let out a sigh, acknowledging that even in this strange new land, he was still a stranger to himself.
