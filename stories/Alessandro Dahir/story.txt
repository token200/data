Alessandro Dahir stepped into the dusty café, his eyes scanning the dimly lit room for a familiar face. He had been searching for him for weeks, ever since he received the cryptic message that read: "Meet me in Rome." The note was unsigned, but Alessandro knew it came from someone he trusted – or at least, he thought he did.

As he waited, sipping on a bitter espresso, the café's owner, Giovanni, nodded at him with a knowing smile. "Il grande scampolo è arrivato," he whispered to the patrons, earning a snicker from an older man playing cards in the corner.

Suddenly, the door swung open and a tall, gaunt figure emerged into the light. It was Matteo, Alessandro's former friend and partner-in-crime. The two had grown up together on the streets of Rome, always getting into trouble and laughing until their sides ached.

Matteo spotted Alessandro across the room, his eyes narrowing as he made his way towards him. "Alessandro Dahir," Matteo said, his voice dripping with malice. "I see you're still hiding in plain sight."

Alessandro raised an eyebrow, unsure what to make of Matteo's animosity. They had parted ways years ago, but Alessandro assumed their friendship was over for good.

"I've been looking all over for you," Matteo continued, his eyes glinting with a hint of desperation. "I need your help, Alessandro."

Alessandro leaned back in his chair, intrigued despite himself. "What is it that you need?"

Matteo hesitated before pulling out a small folder from his jacket pocket. Inside was a series of photographs, each one depicting a person who had wronged him over the years – corrupt businessmen, gangsters, and ruthless politicians.

"This is my list," Matteo said, his voice trembling with rage. "I've spent years gathering evidence, but I need someone with your skills to help me take them down."

Alessandro studied the photographs, a spark of excitement igniting within him. This was what he had been missing – purpose. He had been running from the law for months, always staying one step ahead of his pursuers.

"Alright," Alessandro said finally, extending a hand. "I'm in. But we need to be careful. We can't let our emotions cloud us."

Matteo nodded, a hint of a smile playing on his lips. For a moment, the old camaraderie returned, and Alessandro felt like he was back in their youth, ready for anything.

But as they left the café together, Alessandro couldn't shake the feeling that Matteo's motives weren't entirely pure. He made a mental note to dig deeper into the list of targets – after all, revenge wasn't always the best motivator.
