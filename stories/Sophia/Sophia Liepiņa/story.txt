She saw in them stories of past generations, of struggles and triumphs, of joy and heartbreak. These tales inspired her to create pieces that celebrated the beauty of Latvia's heritage.

One day, while exploring the Old Town, Sophia stumbled upon a small alleyway she had never noticed before. The walls were adorned with colorful murals, depicting scenes from Latvian folklore.
