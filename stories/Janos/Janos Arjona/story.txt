Janos Arjona stepped out of the crowded tavern and into the cool night air, her eyes scanning the streets for any sign of trouble. As a private investigator, she'd seen her fair share of shady characters and unsavory dealings, but tonight felt different.

She had just received a cryptic message from a wealthy client, requesting her presence at an exclusive mansion on the outskirts of town. The note read: "Janos Arjona, I need your particular set of skills to uncover a deep-seated conspiracy."

Curiosity getting the better of her, Janos made her way through the winding streets, her hand resting on the grip of her pistol. She arrived at the mansion just as the sun was dipping below the horizon, casting an eerie glow over the estate.

As she entered the grand foyer, a figure emerged from the shadows - her client, a suave and well-dressed gentleman named Marcus Wellington. "Janos Arjona," he said with a bow, "I'm so glad you could make it."

He led her through the labyrinthine corridors, pointing out various symbols etched into the walls - symbols that Janos recognized as belonging to an ancient cult thought to be long extinct.

"What's going on, Mr. Wellington?" she asked, her mind racing with possibilities.

"We're dealing with a rogue member of the Order of the Red Hand," he replied, his voice low and urgent. "Someone has infiltrated our ranks, using our own rituals against us."

Janos nodded, her grip on her pistol tightening. She had dealt with cults before, but there was something about this one that didn't sit right.

As they reached the room where the symbols were most prominent, Janos noticed a faint scent of sulfur in the air. "What's the ritual?" she asked, her eyes scanning the room for any signs of life.

"We're not entirely sure," Wellington admitted, his face grim. "But we suspect it involves human sacrifice."

Janos' eyes narrowed as she took in the scene before her. She knew that she had to act quickly to stop this cult and bring them to justice. With a steady hand, she pulled out her pistol and began to survey the area for any signs of the rogue member.
