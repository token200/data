Janos Salamanca stood in front of the mirror, adjusting his signature black suit. As one half of the infamous Tuco-Salamanca duo, he knew how to make an entrance. His sharp jawline and piercing brown eyes seemed chiseled from the same stone as the desert landscape that cradled Albuquerque.

A knock at the door interrupted his grooming routine, signaling the arrival of his brother, Hector Salamanca. The older brother's stern expression matched the gravity of their situation â€“ a rival gang had set fire to their stash house, threatening their lucrative methamphetamine operation.

"Janos, we need to talk," Hector said, his voice low and menacing.

"Come in, come in," Janos replied with a smirk, gesturing for Hector to enter. The two brothers sat on the couch, their eyes locked as they dissected the situation.

Their empire had grown exponentially over the past year, but now it was at risk of collapse due to a rival gang's treachery. Janos' mind worked overtime, formulating strategies to regain control and maintain their grip on the lucrative meth trade. His brother's calm demeanor seemed out of place compared to his own turbulent thoughts.

Hector spoke up, "We need to take care of this problem quickly, Janos. If we don't act soon, our suppliers will turn on us, and we'll lose everything."

Janos nodded, a plan forming in his mind. "Leave that to me, Hector. I have some... associates who can help us get back on top." He leaned forward, his voice taking on a conspiratorial tone.

As the brothers continued their discussion, it became clear that Janos Salamanca was more than just Hector's younger half; he was a force to be reckoned with in Albuquerque's underworld. His quick wit and sharp instincts would soon make him the driving force behind the Salamanca family's resurgence.

With a newfound sense of determination, Janos rose from his seat, adjusting his suit once more before turning to face his brother. "It's time we take back what's ours," he declared, his eyes burning with a fierce intensity that left Hector no doubt about their plan's trajectory.
