Janos Ozols stepped into the dimly lit bar, his eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As a former Latvian Special Forces operative turned mercenary, Janos Ozols knew that trouble was always just around the corner.

He spotted his contact, a hooded figure sitting in the corner, sipping on a whiskey. Janos Ozols made his way over, his hand resting on the grip of his pistol. The figure looked up as he approached, and Janos Ozols could see the faint glint of gold jewelry against their pale skin.

"Janos Ozols," they said, their voice low and gravelly. "I have information about a high-stakes mission."

Janos Ozols raised an eyebrow, his interest piqued. He pulled out a chair and sat down across from the figure, who handed him a small data stick.

"This is encoded," the figure warned. "But I think you'll be able to crack it, Janos Ozols. You're good with computers."

Janos Ozols took the stick, his fingers flying over the keyboard as he began to work out the encryption. It didn't take him long to get into the system, and what he found sent a shiver down his spine.

A wealthy tech mogul had been secretly funding a group of rogue scientists who were experimenting with deadly biotoxins. Janos Ozols knew that this information could be used against him, so he tucked the data stick back into his jacket pocket and stood up.

"I think that's enough for now," he said to the figure. "You're hired."

The figure nodded, disappearing into the night as Janos Ozols made his way out of the bar. He knew that this mission would be a tough one, but with his skills and experience, he was confident in his ability to take down the rogue scientists.

As he walked through the streets, Janos Ozols couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He glanced over his shoulder, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Still, the sense of unease lingered, a reminder that in the world of espionage and counter-terrorism, you were always just one step away from disaster.

Janos Ozols quickened his pace, his hand resting on the grip of his pistol once more. He knew that he was Janos Ozols, a man with a troubled past and a penchant for danger, but he also knew that he was the only one who could stop this mission before it went too far.
