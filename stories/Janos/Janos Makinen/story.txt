Janos "Jankko" Makinen was a man of few words, but his actions spoke louder than any conversation could. A former Finnish special forces operative turned private security contractor, Jankko had seen his fair share of battles and bloodshed. His rugged demeanor and piercing blue eyes seemed to hold a thousand unspoken stories, each one etched on his weathered face like the scars that dotted his arms.

Jankko's latest assignment took him to the war-torn nation of Azalia, where he was tasked with escorting a high-value target - a prominent business magnate fleeing the conflict. The mission was deemed too hot for even Jankko's skilled team, and it fell to him alone to get the job done.

As they navigated the treacherous landscape, Jankko's instincts kicked in, his trained senses on high alert for any sign of danger. He had been around the block a few times, and he knew that in Azalia, loyalty was a luxury no one could afford.

Their route took them through a desolate stretch of desert, the only sound the soft crunch of gravel beneath their feet. Jankko moved with a fluid precision, his rifle at the ready, ever vigilant for any threat. The target, a nervous but resourceful individual, kept a wary eye on him, no doubt wondering why he had been chosen for this particular job.

Despite the risks, Jankko found himself oddly drawn to the man's determination and resilience. It was a quality he admired in those who could survive against all odds - qualities that made him a formidable operative, one who could navigate even the most treacherous terrain with ease.

As night began to fall, they reached their destination: a small, secure compound on the outskirts of the city. Jankko's job was done; the target was safe, and he had proved himself once again as a reliable and effective guardian. He would return to Finland, his reputation intact, ready to take on whatever missions came his way next.
