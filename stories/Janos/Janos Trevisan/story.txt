Janos Trevisan stepped out of the misty dawn and into the bustling streets of Rome, his eyes scanning the crowds with a practiced air of detachment. A man of few words, Janos was not one to draw attention to himself, but those who knew him understood that beneath his reserved exterior lay a complex web of emotions.

As he made his way through the city, Janos's thoughts turned to the mysterious letter that had arrived at his doorstep just hours before. The words danced on the page like fireflies in the darkness: "Meet me at the Colosseum at midnight. Come alone." Signed only with a single letter - J.

Janos's heart quickened at the prospect of an unknown encounter, but he knew better than to let his curiosity get the better of him. He had been burned too many times before, and the pain still lingered like an open wound. The memories of his past haunted him, taunting him with what could never be again.

Yet, something about this letter resonated deep within Janos Trevisan's soul. Perhaps it was the promise of danger, or perhaps it was the possibility of redemption. Whatever the reason, he knew he had to see this through.

As midnight approached, Janos found himself standing at the edge of the ancient arena, the stars twinkling above like diamonds in the sky. A figure emerged from the shadows - a woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She beckoned him closer, her voice low and husky as she whispered a single word: "Wait."

Janos's heart skipped a beat as he hesitated, his mind racing with questions and doubts. But something about this stranger drew him in, like a moth to the flame. He took a step forward, and then another, until finally, he was standing at her side, ready to face whatever lay ahead.

The game, it seemed, had begun. And Janos Trevisan was ready to play.
