Janos Angert stepped out of the dimly lit tavern, his eyes scanning the crowded streets of Ravenshire. As the town's resident cartographer, Janos Angert was no stranger to the night crowd. He had spent countless hours pouring over maps and charts, uncovering hidden secrets and lost cities.

As he made his way through the throngs of people, Janos Angert's keen eye picked out a figure watching him from across the square. It was Elara Vex, a fellow adventurer and old friend. She nodded at him, and Janos Angert smiled, making his way over to her side.

"What brings you to Ravenshire, Elara?" Janos Angert asked, falling into step beside her.

"I'm searching for a rare text," Elara replied, her eyes scanning the crowded market stalls. "One that's said to hold the secrets of the ancient world."

Janos Angert raised an eyebrow. "You're not talking about the lost city of Eldrador, are you?"

Elara's expression turned serious. "I am. But I need someone with your...particular skills to help me decipher the text once I find it."

Janos Angert chuckled. "And what makes you think I'm the man for the job?"

"Because you're the only person I know who can keep up with my research," Elara said, a hint of mischief in her voice.

As they walked, Janos Angert couldn't help but feel a thrill of excitement. He had always loved puzzles and riddles, and the prospect of uncovering the secrets of Eldrador was too enticing to resist.

They eventually found themselves at a small, dusty bookshop tucked away on a side street. The owner, an old man named Marcus, eyed them warily before nodding at Elara's text. Janos Angert watched as she delicately opened the cover, revealing yellowed pages filled with intricate symbols and diagrams.

He knew that look of intensity, that spark of curiosity in her eyes. It was a familiar sight, one that he had seen countless times over the years. And yet, every time Elara Vex set out on an adventure, Janos Angert couldn't help but feel drawn to it, like a moth to flame.
