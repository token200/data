Janos Charron stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the mist-shrouded streets of Ashwood. The air was heavy with dampness and decay, but Janos felt a thrill of excitement coursing through his veins. He had been away from this place for years, and yet, it still held a strange allure.

As he walked through the deserted streets, Janos noticed the way the light danced through the mist, casting eerie shadows on the buildings. It was as if the very fabric of reality was twisted here, warped by some unseen force. He had always been drawn to such places, where the ordinary rules didn't quite apply.

Janos arrived at his small flat, nestled in a crumbling tenement building. The door creaked as he pushed it open, and he stepped inside, his eyes adjusting to the dim light within. The space was cluttered with books and papers, relics of his research into the supernatural. Janos had always been fascinated by the unknown, and this place held many secrets.

He spent hours pouring over dusty tomes and ancient texts, seeking answers to questions that had haunted him for years. As night fell, Janos lit a candle, casting flickering shadows on the walls. The room seemed to shrink around him, as if the very darkness itself was closing in.

Suddenly, he heard a faint scratching sound outside his window. Janos froze, his heart pounding in his chest. He approached the glass, and peered out into the night. A figure stood across the street, its features indistinct in the shadows. The scratching grew louder, more insistent, as if the figure was trying to convey a message.

Janos knew that he had stumbled upon something here, something significant. He felt the weight of his research bearing down on him, and yet, he couldn't help but feel drawn deeper into the mystery. With a sense of trepidation, Janos opened the window, letting in the chill night air. The scratching ceased, replaced by an expectant silence. And then, everything went still.

Janos stood there for a long moment, listening to the darkness outside. He knew that he had crossed a threshold, one from which there was no return.
