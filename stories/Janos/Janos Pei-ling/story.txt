The people of Shanghai whispered of the daring heist for days to come, hailing Janos Pei-ling as the greatest thief the city had ever known.

Yet, despite his success, Janos Pei-ling knew that this was only the beginning. He vowed to continue pushing the boundaries of what was thought possible, leaving behind a legacy that would be remembered for generations to come.
