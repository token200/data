Janos Petrov nodded sympathetically and began his investigation. He spoke to the family members, scoured through documents, and interviewed potential witnesses. But every lead seemed to end in a dead-end.

As the sun began to set, Janos Petrov sat at his desk, sipping a cup of coffee and staring at the files in front of him.
