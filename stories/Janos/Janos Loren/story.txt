Janos Loren trudged through the dense forest, his eyes scanning the underbrush for any sign of life. A skilled hunter and tracker, he had been searching for hours, but so far, he had found nothing. His stomach growled with hunger, and he knew he needed to find shelter soon.

As a member of the Wyvern tribe, Janos Loren was accustomed to living off the land, but even he couldn't deny the feeling of unease that settled in his chest as the sun began to set. He had been tracking a large buck for days, but it seemed to have vanished into thin air.

Just as Janos Loren was starting to lose hope, he caught sight of a small clearing up ahead. In the center of the clearing stood a massive oak tree, its branches stretching towards the sky like giant arms. Janos Loren's eyes lit up with excitement as he realized that this must be the buck's lair.

He approached the tree cautiously, his senses on high alert for any sign of danger. As he reached out to touch the trunk, a small figure emerged from behind it. It was an elderly woman, her face lined with wrinkles and her eyes twinkling with wisdom.

"Janos Loren," she said, her voice low and soothing. "I have been expecting you. You are seeking something, but I sense that you do not know what you truly desire."

Janos Loren's eyes narrowed as he tried to understand the old woman's words. What did she mean? He had been tracking the buck for days, and now it seemed that his search was over.

The old woman smiled, as if reading Janos Loren's thoughts. "Come with me," she said, beckoning him towards the tree. "I will show you something."

Janos Loren hesitated for a moment, but his curiosity got the better of him. He followed the old woman to a small cave behind the oak tree, where he discovered a treasure trove of food and supplies that would sustain him for weeks.

As he sat down to eat, Janos Loren realized that the old woman had been right all along. He did not need the buck's meat; he needed the knowledge that he had learned on his journey.
