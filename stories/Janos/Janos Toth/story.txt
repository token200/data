Janos Toth stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his piercing blue eyes scanning the room with a mixture of curiosity and caution. A skilled mercenary and treasure hunter, Janos had been tracking a rumor for months, one that promised to lead him to a long-lost city deep within the heart of the cursed forest.

As he made his way to the bar, a gruff voice called out from behind the counter. "What can I get you, Toth?" The bartender, a grizzled old man with a thick beard, eyed Janos warily, no doubt sensing the danger that lurked beneath his polished exterior.

Janos smiled wryly and ordered a whiskey, tossing a few coins onto the bar. He had earned these moments of respite over countless battles and narrow escapes, and he was determined to savor every last one. As he waited for his drink to arrive, Janos took in the atmosphere of the tavern - the laughter and chatter of travelers sharing tales of their adventures, the clinking of glasses and the soft strumming of a lone lute.

When his drink arrived, Janos tossed back a swift swig, feeling the familiar burn of the liquor as it coursed down his throat. He knew that this was just a temporary reprieve - he still had to navigate the treacherous paths ahead, avoid deadly traps and ferocious beasts, and unravel the tangled threads of the ancient city's secrets.

Janos leaned against the bar, his mind racing with strategies and calculations. He thought back to his childhood, growing up on the streets of Budapest as Janos Toth - a scrappy young thief, always looking over his shoulder and never staying in one place for too long. The memories were hazy, but one thing remained clear: he had always been driven by a restless hunger for adventure.

As the night wore on, Janos's thoughts turned to the city ahead, hidden deep within the cursed forest. He knew that it would be a test of his skills and resolve, but he was ready. With a confident smile, he tossed a few more coins onto the bar and slipped out into the darkness, ready to face whatever lay ahead in pursuit of the lost treasure.
