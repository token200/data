Janos DiCaprio stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the dusty town before him. He had been on the move for weeks, ever since he'd left behind the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles to escape the pressures of fame.

As Janos DiCaprio walked through the streets, the locals eyed him warily. Some recognized the name, but most didn't know who this rugged stranger was or what he wanted. He didn't care; he just needed a place to lay low for a while and recharge.

Janos DiCaprio stopped at a small café on the outskirts of town and ordered a cup of black coffee. The proprietor, an elderly woman with a kind face, looked him up and down before nodding and handing over the coffee.

"You're a long way from home, aren't you?" she asked, her voice low and gentle.

Janos DiCaprio shrugged, taking a sip of his coffee. "Just passing through," he said, leaving it at that.

As he finished his drink and prepared to leave, the proprietor pressed a piece of paper into his hand. "Take this," she said. "It's a room at the back of the boarding house. You're welcome to stay for as long as you need."

Janos DiCaprio smiled, tucking the paper into his pocket. He knew he could trust her. For once, he didn't feel like an actor playing a role; he just felt like Janos DiCaprio, lost and alone in the world.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the town, Janos DiCaprio made his way back to the boarding house. He took a deep breath, feeling a sense of peace wash over him for the first time in months. Maybe this was exactly where he needed to be – far from the spotlight, but still connected to the world.

Janos DiCaprio climbed the stairs and entered the room, shutting the door behind him with a sense of satisfaction. This was his new life; he was finally starting to feel like himself again.
