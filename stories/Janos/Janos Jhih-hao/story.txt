In the heart of ancient Lijiang, a young master craftsman named Janos Jhih-hao lived and breathed wood. His hands were deft and sure, able to coax even the most recalcitrant pieces into shape. People from all over came to commission work from the enigmatic Janos Jhih-hao, who was rumored to possess a deep understanding of the natural world.

One day, a wealthy merchant named Lin visited Janos Jhih-hao's workshop, seeking a wooden coffin for his deceased wife. The old man listened intently as Lin described his vision: a beautiful, intricate box that would honor the departed and bring solace to those who mourned. After a series of quiet deliberations, Janos Jhih-hao began to work.

For weeks, the craftsman toiled over the coffin's design, studying the curves and lines of nature. He experimented with different woods, testing their grain and texture against his vision. The merchant grew impatient, but Janos Jhih-hao remained focused on his art.

Finally, after months of work, the wooden coffin was complete. Lin was awestruck by its beauty, marveling at the delicate patterns and inlays that seemed to dance across its surface. As he held it in his hands, he felt a deep sense of peace wash over him, as if Janos Jhih-hao had somehow captured the essence of the woman he loved.

Word of Janos Jhih-hao's skill spread far and wide, drawing visitors from distant lands to witness the master craftsman at work. Though he remained reclusive, preferring his quiet workshop to the hubbub of the city, those who saw him in action couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder at the man behind the craft.

And Janos Jhih-hao, content in the knowledge that his art brought comfort and beauty to others, returned to his work, his hands moving with renewed purpose as he coaxed yet another masterpiece from the wood.
