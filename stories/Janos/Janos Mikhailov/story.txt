Janos Mikhailov stood atop the worn stone steps, gazing out upon the rolling hills that stretched as far as the eye could see. A lone figure in the distance was making its way towards him, its pace steady and deliberate.

As the stranger drew closer, Janos could see that it was a young woman, her long brown hair blowing gently in the breeze. She wore a simple tunic and carried a worn leather pack slung over one shoulder.

"Hello," she said, as she reached the top of the steps. "My name is Ava. I've been searching for you."

Janos raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "And who might I be?" he asked, his voice low and smooth.

Ava smiled, a small, wry smile. "I'm looking for Janos Mikhailov," she said. "I've heard stories about your... skills."

Janos snorted, a dry sound. "Skills," he repeated. "That's one way to put it."

Ava took a seat beside him on the steps, her eyes fixed intently on his face. "I have information," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Information that could help you, Janos Mikhailov. Information about your past."

Janos' gaze faltered for a moment, and Ava saw a flicker of something in his eyes - sadness, perhaps, or regret. But it was gone as quickly as it appeared, leaving behind only a hint of vulnerability.

"What kind of information?" he asked, his voice cautious now.

Ava pulled out a small notebook from her pack and flipped through its pages. "I've been studying your history," she said. "Janos Mikhailov, the man who was thought to be dead. I know things about you that might surprise you."

Janos' eyes narrowed, his mind racing with possibilities. Who was this woman, and what did she really want? But as he looked into Ava's face, he saw something there that gave him pause - a glimmer of understanding, perhaps, or a shared secret.

For the first time in years, Janos felt like he wasn't alone.
