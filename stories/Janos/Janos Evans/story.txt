Janos Evans stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the city skyline as the sun dipped below the horizon. As a freelance journalist, he'd grown accustomed to working late hours, chasing down leads and stories that others deemed too obscure or uninteresting.

But Janos had always been drawn to the fringes, seeking out the hidden corners of society where the truth lay waiting. His colleagues at the newspaper often teased him about his "curiosity" and " obsession with the weird," but he knew that it was this very quality that made him a good journalist.

As he scanned the rooftops below, Janos's eyes landed on a figure huddled in the shadows. He smiled to himself - that was a lead worth pursuing. With a flick of his jacket, he leapt off the edge of the roof and landed with a soft thud on the pavement.

The figure emerged from the darkness as Janos approached, its features indistinct at first but growing clearer by the second. It was an old woman, her eyes sunken and her skin lined with age, but there was something about her that seemed...off.

"Janos Evans," she croaked, her voice like a rusty gate. "I've been expecting you."

Janos's journalist instincts kicked in immediately - he knew that this was more than just a chance encounter. He pulled out his notebook and pen, ready to take down every word as the woman began to speak.

"My name is Arianna," she said, her voice dripping with an otherworldly authority. "And I have a story for you, Janos Evans - one that will change everything you thought you knew about this city."

Janos's eyes locked onto hers, his mind racing with possibilities. He leaned in closer, his pen poised over the notebook as Arianna began to spin her tale. And he knew, in that moment, that he had stumbled upon something much bigger than a simple story - something that would shake the very foundations of his world.

"Tell me," he whispered, his voice barely audible over the hum of the city.

Arianna smiled, her eyes glinting with a knowing light. "Where to begin, Janos Evans?"
