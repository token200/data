Janos Pold was a man with a mysterious past, shrouded in secrecy and intrigue. A master thief and con artist, he had built a reputation for himself on the streets of Budapest, where his quick wit and charming smile could talk him out of even the most precarious situations.

One night, Janos Pold strolled into the upscale casino, dressed to impress in his tailored suit and gleaming cufflinks. The air was thick with the hum of high-stakes gaming, and the scent of champagne and cigar smoke hung heavy over the crowd. With a confident swagger, Janos Pold made his way to the roulette table, where he began to play.

As he spun the wheel, Janos Pold's eyes locked onto the dealer's face, searching for any sign of weakness or distraction. His opponent, a stern-faced Hungarian noblewoman, raised an eyebrow at his bold move, but Janos Pold remained unfazed.

As the night wore on and Janos Pold won hand after hand, he began to notice that the dealer seemed... off. Her movements were too precise, her smile too forced. A faint thrill ran through him - was this a setup?

Janos Pold's instincts proved correct. As the clock struck midnight, the lights flickered and the room plunged into darkness. When they came back up, Janos Pold found himself face to face with none other than the Hungarian Prime Minister himself.

"Welcome, Janos Pold," the PM boomed, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "We've been expecting you. You see, we've been tracking your little... hobby, and we think it's time for you to put your skills to use on our behalf."

Janos Pold raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. What did the Prime Minister have in mind? And what would be the cost of his loyalty?

For a moment, Janos Pold hesitated, weighing the risks against the rewards. Then, with a sly smile spreading across his face, he nodded.

"Very well," he said, extending a hand to seal their pact. "I'm all in."
