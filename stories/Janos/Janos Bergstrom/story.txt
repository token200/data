Janos Bergstrom stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station for any signs of life. It had been years since he'd last set foot in Ravenswood, and the once-thriving town seemed to have faded into obscurity.

As a young man, Janos Bergstrom had grown up in this very town, learning the ins and outs of its peculiarities from his father, a gruff but kind-hearted fisherman. But life had taken him elsewhere, and he'd left Ravenswood behind with a sense of restlessness that still lingered within him.

Now, as he walked through the deserted streets, Janos Bergstrom couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. The houses seemed to loom over him, their windows like empty eyes staring back. He quickened his pace, his footsteps echoing off the buildings.

Eventually, he found himself standing in front of the old fish market, its wooden beams worn smooth by years of salt and sea spray. Janos Bergstrom's heart skipped a beat as he pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside. The smell of fish and seaweed enveloped him, transporting him back to his childhood.

For a moment, Janos Bergstrom forgot about the present, lost in memories of summers spent helping his father on the boats, of laughter and camaraderie with the other fishermen's families. But as he made his way deeper into the market, the memories began to fade, replaced by a growing sense of unease.

What was he doing here? Why had he returned to Ravenswood after all these years? The questions swirled in his mind like the currents outside, and Janos Bergstrom couldn't find an answer. He felt like a ghost haunting the town he once called home, a stranger in his own skin.

As he turned to leave, Janos Bergstrom caught a glimpse of himself in a dusty mirror hanging on the wall. For a moment, he saw not the man who stood before him, but the boy he used to be â€“ full of hope and dreams for the future. The image vanished as quickly as it appeared, leaving him with nothing but the echoes of his own footsteps, and the haunting question: what was he running from?
