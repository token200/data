Janos Fernandez stood at the edge of the bustling city square, his eyes scanning the crowd with an air of detachment. As a former mercenary, he had seen his fair share of battles and bloodshed, but nothing could have prepared him for the sense of purpose that drove him now.

It had been five years since Janos had left the military, abandoning the camaraderie and adrenaline-fueled lifestyle for a quieter existence. He had settled in the small town of Ravenshire, where he had taken on a modest job as a carpenter's apprentice. The work was hard, but it allowed him to keep his hands busy and his mind clear.

As he watched the townspeople going about their daily business, Janos couldn't help but feel a sense of pride in his new life. He had found a sense of belonging among the locals, who saw beyond his rough exterior to the complex individual beneath. They knew that Janos Fernandez, the gruff and taciturn carpenter's apprentice, was also the same man who had fought for a living just years before.

Despite his newfound peace, Janos couldn't shake off the feeling of restlessness that lingered within him. He had always been drawn to danger, to the thrill of the unknown, and it was only a matter of time before he felt the call again. As he gazed out at the crowd, Janos's mind began to wander back to his past life, and the memories that haunted him.

He thought of his fellow soldiers, of the comrades he had lost, and of the missions they had undertaken together. The more he thought about it, the more he realized that a part of him would always be a warrior, no matter how much he tried to suppress it. Janos Fernandez, the former mercenary, may have left the battlefield behind, but a part of his heart still longed for the rush of adrenaline and the camaraderie of the fight.

With a quiet sigh, Janos turned away from the crowd and began his walk home, lost in thought as he pondered the conflicting desires that had become a part of him.
