Janos Hoffmann sat alone in the dimly lit café, nursing a cup of cold coffee. He stared out the window, lost in thought as he often was when contemplating his next move. As a skilled thief and con artist, Janos had made a name for himself on the streets of Paris, but lately, he'd been feeling restless.

As he pondered his next target, a young woman with piercing green eyes walked into the café, catching his attention. She sat down at a nearby table, ordering a cup of hot chocolate and gazing around the room as if searching for someone. Janos watched her with interest, sensing that she might be more than just a passing stranger.

He took a sip of his coffee, trying to appear nonchalant as he observed the woman's every move. She seemed out of place among the city's vibrant throng, yet there was an air of quiet confidence about her that drew Janos in. He found himself wondering what secrets she might be hiding behind those enigmatic eyes.

As the afternoon wore on, the woman finished her drink and left the café, disappearing into the winding streets of Montmartre. Janos followed her at a distance, careful not to get too close as he trailed her through alleys and side streets. He had no idea where she was headed, but his curiosity kept him moving forward.

Eventually, Janos found himself standing in front of an unassuming door, the same one the woman had slipped into earlier. With a deep breath, he knocked twice on the doorframe, hoping that the signal would be received by someone with whom he could trust. The door creaked open, revealing a dimly lit room filled with rows of dusty shelves and flickering candles.

The woman's eyes met Janos' through the narrow opening, a hint of recognition flashing across her face before she disappeared into the shadows, leaving Janos to ponder what lay ahead for him in this mysterious world he'd stumbled upon.
