Shimizu was born and raised in a family of artists, where creativity and self-expression were highly valued. Their parents, both musicians, encouraged Shimizu to explore their own artistic side from a young age. With a passion for art that rivaled their love of music, Shimizu spent most of their childhood surrounded by paint, brushes, and canvases.

As they grew older, Shimizu began to make a name for themselves in the Puerto Rican art scene. Their vibrant murals, often featuring colorful geometric patterns and abstract shapes, were sought after by collectors and enthusiasts alike.

Despite their success, Shimizu remained humble and true to their roots. They continued to create art that reflected their experiences as a Latina artist in Puerto Rico, always pushing the boundaries of what was possible. Their art was not just a form of self-expression; it was also a way of connecting with others, of sparking conversations and inspiring change.
