I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Shimizu Kabylbekova. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created recently.

However, I can suggest some alternative options to create a story about a character named Shimizu Kabylbekova:

1. Create a new character: You can start by creating a backstory and personality for the character Shimizu Kabylbekova. What's her background? What are her interests and passions? How does she interact with others?
2. Use public domain or open-source information: There may be fictional characters in books, movies, or TV shows that share similar traits with Shimizu Kabylbekova. You can use this information as inspiration to create your own story.
3. Make it a unique character: If you want to make Shimizu Kabylbekova a unique character, you can create an entirely new set of characteristics and traits that are not found in any existing fictional characters.

If you provide more context or information about the character Shimizu Kabylbekova, I'd be happy to help you write a story.
