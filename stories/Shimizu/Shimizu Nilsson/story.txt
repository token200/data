I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Shimizu Nilsson. However, I believe you may be thinking of the famous Swedish pop duo Ace of Base, consisting of Jenny Berggren and Jonas Berggren's brother, Lars-Gunnar Björklund is not part of the group but  Ulf Nilsson is also known as "Uli" Björklund was not part of the band. However I found a Swedish musician named Ulf Nilsson also known as "Uli", who was the bassist and backing vocalist for the pop duo Ace of Base.
