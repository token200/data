I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named "Shimizu Szymański". However, I found out that there is a Polish footballer by the name of Szymański (specifically, Łukasz Szymański) but most notably another player known as Lukasz Szymanski was born in Poland 1999.

Lukasz Szymański was born on March 5th, 1998. He played as a defender and has been a regular member of the Polish national team since his debut in 2016.
