In the bustling streets of Tokyo, there lived a man named Shimizu Bernard. To the untrained eye, he appeared to be just another face in the crowded city - a slight build, unruly black hair, and an aura that whispered of anonymity. But those who knew him understood that this façade hid a complex individual with secrets and stories etched into every crease of his face.

Bernard was a detective, renowned for his exceptional skills and unparalleled understanding of the human psyche. He had solved cases that baffled even the most seasoned investigators, earning him the respect and admiration of his peers. Yet, despite his success, he remained an enigma himself - always impeccably dressed in a three-piece suit, with a silver pocket watch glinting on his chain.

One fateful evening, as Bernard strolled through the neon-lit streets of Shinjuku, he stumbled upon a peculiar crime scene: a high-end jewelry store had been robbed, leaving behind a single cryptic message etched onto the wall in crimson ink - "The shadows hide the truth".

Bernard's eyes narrowed as he examined the scene. Something about this case resonated within him, stirring a sense of unease and curiosity. As he began to investigate further, his thoughts drifted back to an incident from his past, when he had encountered a figure with striking resemblance to one of the suspects.

This was no ordinary crime; it seemed linked to an ancient legend about the Shiroi Kyū, an elusive organization rumored to manipulate the threads of fate itself. Some whispered that they controlled the strings of destiny for those they deemed worthy. Was this case merely a coincidence, or had Bernard stumbled into something far more sinister?

The night wore on as Bernard immersed himself in the world of cryptic messages and hidden allegiances. He traversed Tokyo's streets with an air of quiet intensity, each step bringing him closer to unraveling the tangled threads of the Shiroi Kyū's involvement.

As he disappeared into the crowd, a silver glint caught his eye - a faint message scrawled onto a nearby brick: "Meet me at the old bridge at midnight. Come alone."
