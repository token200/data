Shimizu Eben was a enigmatic figure, known only by their nickname among the locals. Few had ever laid eyes on the 25-year-old woman with an unruly mane of curly hair and a quick wit. She kept to herself, often disappearing into the winding streets of Tokyo's Shimokitazawa district in search of her next fix.

But Eben was no ordinary addict. She was, in fact, Shimizu Eben, the illegitimate daughter of a wealthy businessman and a free-spirited artist. Her parents had parted ways when she was just a toddler, leaving Eben to navigate the complex web of family dynamics alone.

As she grew older, Eben found solace in music - specifically, the sounds of 1970s Japanese folk rock. She spent countless hours listening to vinyl records and learning to play the shamisen, an instrument her mother had once taught her but never mastered herself. The haunting melodies soothed Eben's frazzled nerves and provided a temporary reprieve from the demons that haunted her.

Despite her troubled past, Eben possessed an uncanny ability to find beauty in even the darkest of places. Her art, though largely unpolished, was raw and honest - a reflection of her inner turmoil and resilience. She sold her pieces on street corners and at local markets, earning enough money to sustain herself but never enough to escape the cycle of addiction.

One rainy evening, as Eben wandered aimlessly through the streets, she stumbled upon an old record store tucked away in a forgotten alley. The owner, an elderly man named Tanaka-san, recognized her immediately. He invited her inside and introduced her to his vast collection of Japanese vinyls - including rare records by her mother's favorite artist.

For the first time in years, Eben felt a glimmer of hope. Perhaps, she thought, it was time to confront her demons head-on and reclaim her birthright as Shimizu Eben. With Tanaka-san's guidance, Eben began to rebuild her life - one record at a time.
