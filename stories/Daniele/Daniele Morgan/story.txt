Daniele Morgan stepped out of his worn leather jacket, running a weary hand through his dark hair. The dim glow of the bar's neon sign cast an unflattering light on the creases etched into his face – proof that he'd been up all night, nursing one too many whiskeys.

As a former hitman, Daniele had seen it all – the streets of Rome, the alleys of Naples, and every city in between. He'd lost count of the lives he'd taken, the friendships forged in smoke and ash. But tonight, something felt different. Maybe it was the empty glass beside him or the faint hum of regret that seemed to echo through his veins.

Daniele's thoughts drifted back to the night he met Francesca – a shy waitress with piercing green eyes who'd seen beyond the façade of his tough exterior. They'd talked long into the night, sharing secrets and laughter like old friends. She was one person who didn't see him as "El Gringo" or "The Bull" but as Daniele.

The door swung open, admitting a chill of fresh air that snapped Daniele back to reality. His partner, Giacomo, strode in, shaking the rain from his coat like it was a mere annoyance. The two men had been an unlikely pair – Giacomo, hot-headed and impulsive, while Daniele was calm and collected.

As they ordered drinks, Daniele couldn't help but think of Francesca's words: "You can't keep running forever, Daniele." Maybe she was right. Maybe it was time to confront the ghosts that haunted him.

Daniele sipped his whiskey, feeling the burn spread through his chest like a slow-moving fire. The city outside seemed to grow darker with every passing moment – neon lights reflected in puddles like broken mirrors. He knew he couldn't stay here forever; eventually, he'd have to face what lay within.

Giacomo leaned over, nudging Daniele's shoulder. "Hey, you okay? You've been quiet all night."

Daniele met his partner's gaze – a flash of understanding and concern. "Just thinking about old times," he replied, wincing as the pain in his chest flared.

The two men fell into an uneasy silence, each lost in their own thoughts. Daniele knew that eventually, he'd have to make a choice: keep running or confront the demons head-on. The darkness closing in around him seemed to whisper a single, haunting phrase – "Time's up, Gringo."
