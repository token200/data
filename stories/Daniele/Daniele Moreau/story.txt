The finished table was breathtaking â€“ its surface gleamed with an rich patina, while the carvings seemed to dance across the wood like vines on a trellis. When the client saw it for the first time, his eyes widened in amazement, and he knew that Daniele Moreau had outdone herself.

The table became the centerpiece of the mansion's dining room, drawing admiring glances from guests at every gathering. Word of Daniele's incredible talent spread quickly, and soon she was receiving commissions from all over the city.
