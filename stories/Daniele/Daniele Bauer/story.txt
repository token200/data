Daniele Bauer stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the crowded station. He was always a bit of a loner, content to observe from afar before making his move. As he waited for his contact to arrive, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease.

It had been three years since Daniele's last job went sour. The memories still lingered, haunting him like a ghost in the shadows. He had tried to lay low, to blend in and forget, but it seemed like his past was always one step behind.

A figure emerged from the crowd, dressed in a long coat that seemed out of place in the sweltering heat. Daniele's instincts kicked in, and he fell back against the wall, watching as the stranger made their way towards him.

"Hey," the figure said, flashing a smile that sent a shiver down Daniele's spine. "I'm Alex."

Daniele nodded, his voice barely above a whisper. "I'm here to collect my payment."

Alex chuckled and handed over a briefcase filled with cash. "There's more to it than that," they said. "You see, I've got a little project going on, and I need your help to make it happen."

Daniele raised an eyebrow. He had always been wary of getting involved in other people's business, but there was something about Alex's words that piqued his interest.

"What kind of project?" he asked, taking the briefcase from Alex's hand.

Alex leaned in close. "I'm looking for someone to... retrieve a package," they said. "It's not an easy job, and I need someone with your particular skills."

Daniele hesitated, weighing the risks and benefits. He had always been drawn to jobs that pushed him to his limits, and this one sounded like it would be just what he needed.

He nodded finally, a slow smile spreading across his face. "I'm in," he said.

Alex grinned back at him. "I knew I could count on you," they said, before turning and disappearing into the crowd.

Daniele watched them go, feeling a spark of excitement ignite within him. It had been a long time since he'd felt this way about a job. He wondered what other challenges lay ahead, but for now, he was ready to take on whatever came his way.
