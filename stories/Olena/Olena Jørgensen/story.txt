Olena Jørgensen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It had been months since she'd last set foot in this forgotten corner of Norway, but the memories still lingered. As a child, Olena Jørgensen would spend summers here with her grandparents, listening to their tales of the land and its people.

Now, at twenty-five, Olena Jørgensen was a stranger in a strange land. She'd left behind the familiarity of her own village to pursue a life in the city, but something had called her back to these woods. Maybe it was the silence, or the smell of pine and earth that still clung to her clothes from those long-ago summers.

Olena Jørgensen made her way through the station, nodding at a few familiar faces as she passed. Her grandparents' old cabin stood just beyond the platform, its wooden beams weathered to a soft silver in the fading light. She'd always felt a sense of peace here, as if the land itself had wrapped a gentle arm around her shoulders.

As she approached the cabin, Olena Jørgensen noticed something new – a small garden, planted with wildflowers and herbs that bloomed like tiny flags in the sunlight. Her heart swelled with joy; this was what she'd come home to. The memories came flooding back: laughter and stories, afternoons spent exploring the forest, and her grandparents' patient guidance as she learned to tend the land.

For a moment, Olena Jørgensen forgot about the city, forgot about the doubts that had driven her from this place. She simply stood there, surrounded by the beauty of the wilderness, feeling the weight of her past lifting like the morning mist. This was where she belonged – in the quiet, dark heart of the forest, with its ancient secrets and stories waiting to be uncovered.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the cabin and garden in a soft, golden light, Olena Jørgensen smiled to herself. She knew that she still had much to learn, but for now, this was home – and she was exactly where she needed to be.
