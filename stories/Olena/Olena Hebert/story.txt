Olena Hebert walked into the small café, scanning the room for a familiar face. She had been searching for her best friend, Natalia, all morning, and finally received a text that led her to this quaint establishment. As she waited in line, Olena's thoughts drifted back to their college days, when they would spend hours pouring over literature texts and debating the meaning of life.

When it was finally her turn to order, Olena asked for a black coffee, just like Natalia liked hers. The barista raised an eyebrow but obliged, and Olena took a seat at a small table by the window. A few minutes later, she spotted Natalia walking towards her, carrying a large bag and wearing a bright smile.

"Natalia!" Olena exclaimed, jumping up from her seat to give her friend a hug. "I was starting to worry I'd never find you."

Natalia laughed and set down her bag. "Sorry about that. I got lost in the streets," she said, taking a seat across from Olena.

As they sipped their coffee, Natalia filled Olena in on her latest adventure – a solo trip to Europe to work as an English teacher for a few months. Olena listened intently, asking questions and making supportive noises.

Their conversation flowed easily, like it had all those years ago during late-night study sessions. They talked about everything from their personal lives to their hopes and dreams for the future. For a moment, it felt like no time had passed at all.

As they finished their coffee, Natalia glanced at her watch and stood up. "I have to go," she said, reluctantly packing up her bag. Olena followed suit, walking with her friend out of the café into the warm sunlight.

"Thanks for meeting me here," Natalia said, turning to Olena as they walked. "I needed that."

Olena smiled, feeling a sense of contentment wash over her. "Anytime, Nat. You know I'm always here for you." As they parted ways, Olena couldn't help but think about how lucky she was to have found such an incredible friend in Natalia Hebert.
