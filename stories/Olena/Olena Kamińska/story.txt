Olena Kami≈Ñska stood at the edge of the frozen lake, her eyes fixed on the dark shape in the distance. It was a silhouette she had seen before, yet it still sent shivers down her spine every time. The wind howled around her, whipping her long black hair into a frenzy as she gazed out at the unknown.

As a child, Olena had been warned about the Leshy, the malevolent spirit that roamed these woods. Her parents had told her stories of its power and cruelty, but Olena never believed them. She was convinced that it was just an old legend, meant to scare children into behaving.

But now, as she stood on the edge of this frozen lake, Olena wasn't so sure. The trees seemed to loom over her, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching out to snatch her. She felt a presence watching her, a weighty gaze that made her skin crawl.

Olena took a deep breath and stepped forward, her boots crunching into the snow. She had come here to retrieve a gift for her sick grandmother, one that only this forest could provide. A sprig of rowan, its berries said to have healing properties. Olena's heart swelled with love as she thought of her grandmother's frail body, and she quickened her pace.

As she walked, the silence began to take hold, a heavy blanket that suffocated her senses. Olena felt like she was being pulled deeper into the forest, further and further from civilization. The trees seemed to close in around her, their branches tangling together above her head.

Suddenly, a twig snapped beneath her foot. Olena froze, her heart racing with fear. And then, out of the corner of her eye, she saw it: a pair of glowing eyes staring back at her. The Leshy.

Olena didn't flinch. She knew that if she ran, the spirit would chase after her, dragging her down into the depths of the forest forever. So she stood still, frozen in time, as the eyes drew closer and closer. And when they finally vanished, Olena felt a strange sense of calm wash over her.

She reached out a hand and plucked a sprig of rowan from the branches above. As she turned to leave, she heard a faint whisper on the wind: "You should not have come here." But Olena just smiled, knowing that she had faced her fears and emerged victorious.
