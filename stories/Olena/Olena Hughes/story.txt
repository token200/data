Olena Hughes sat alone in her small flat, staring blankly at the wall as the rain poured down outside. She had just received news that her brother, Alex, was leaving for a business trip to Tokyo and wouldn't be back for three weeks.

As she thought about how much she'd miss him, Olena's mind wandered back to their childhood. Growing up in Kiev, they would spend hours exploring the city, laughing and getting into mischief together. She remembered the way he used to make her laugh with his silly impressions and jokes.

But life had taken a different path for them. Alex had always been driven to succeed, while Olena had struggled to find her place in the world. She had dropped out of university after just one year, feeling lost and uncertain about her future.

Despite their differences, they remained close, supporting each other through thick and thin. When their parents passed away a few years ago, Alex had been there for her, helping her navigate the grieving process. Now, she was returning the favor, in her own small way.

As she thought about all the ways she'd support him from afar - sending care packages with his favorite snacks, updating him on her life on social media, and even offering to help with any work-related tasks he needed assistance with - Olena felt a sense of purpose wash over her.

She got up from the couch and walked over to her desk, where she began to plan a surprise for Alex's departure. She had always wanted to teach him how to cook traditional Ukrainian dishes, like borscht and varenyky. Now was the perfect opportunity.

Over the next few days, Olena worked tirelessly to prepare the ingredients, cooking up a storm in her small kitchen. On the evening before Alex's flight, she presented him with a beautifully set table, filled with all of his favorite dishes.

Alex was taken aback by the gesture, his eyes welling up with tears as he hugged Olena tightly. "Thank you, sis," he whispered. "I'll never forget this."

As they sat down to eat together, Olena felt a sense of peace wash over her. Even though they were apart, she knew that their bond remained strong, and that no matter where life took them, they would always be there for each other.
