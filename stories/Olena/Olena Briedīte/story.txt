Olena Briedīte was a 25-year-old Latvian pop sensation known for her captivating stage presence and powerful voice. Born in Riga, Latvia, she began singing at a young age, inspired by the likes of Mariah Carey and Celine Dion.

After winning several local talent shows and competitions, Olena's big break came when she was discovered by a record label scout at one of her performances. She signed a recording contract and released her debut single, "Svētījoties," which quickly became a hit across Latvia.

As her fame grew, so did her unique style. Olena blended traditional Latvian folk music with modern pop elements, creating a distinctive sound that captivated audiences both at home and abroad. Her lyrics often explored themes of love, identity, and self-empowerment, resonating deeply with young women in Latvia and beyond.

One of Olena's most notable achievements was her collaboration with acclaimed Latvian composer and musician, Janis Joplin-esque singer-songwriter Ieva Daudze. The two musicians teamed up for a series of sold-out concerts across Europe, blending folk, pop, rock, jazz, blues and many more music genres.

Olena has also become known for her charitable efforts, often using her platform to raise awareness about social issues affecting Latvia's youth, such as mental health, education, and LGBTQ+ rights. In 2020, she released a song called "Pirmā Zeme" ("First Earth"), which became an anthem for environmental activists across the region.

Despite her rising fame, Olena remains committed to staying true to her roots and artistic vision. She continues to write music inspired by Latvian folklore and mythology, as well as contemporary issues affecting Latvia's young people.

In 2022, she released a critically acclaimed album called "Kalda," which featured the hit singles "Kalda" and "Bērs." The album earned her numerous awards, including the prestigious Latvijas Mūsika (Latvia Music) award for Best Female Artist.
