Olena Jansone stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It had been years since she'd set foot in this town, and yet the familiar sights and smells still brought a sense of comfort to her parched soul.

As she made her way through the deserted streets, Olena Jansone couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia wash over her. She'd grown up in this very town, playing in the park where the old oak tree now stood, chasing after rabbits and making daisy chains with her friends. Life had taken her far from here, though - to the city, to college, to a career that left her feeling empty.

But now, with a dwindling bank account and a worn-out suitcase, Olena Jansone was back where she started. She'd come to visit her ailing mother, who lay in bed on the outskirts of town, her eyes cloudy with cataracts and her heart weary from years of loneliness.

As Olena Jansone walked up to the small bungalow that had been her childhood home, memories flooded her mind - afternoons spent listening to her mother's tales of the war-torn streets of Latvia, lazy summer evenings spent watching the stars twinkle overhead. Her mother, JƒÅzepa, was still there, frail but unbroken.

 Inside, Olena Jansone found her mother sitting in a worn armchair, her hands clasped together in her lap like prayer beads. "Ola," she croaked, her voice barely audible over the creaking of the old wooden floorboards. "My dear child."

"Mother," Olena Jansone replied, tears welling up in her eyes as she kissed her mother's wrinkled cheek.

The days passed slowly, a blur of hospital visits and late-night talks with her mother about life, love, and loss. And though the road ahead was uncertain, Olena Jansone felt a sense of peace settle over her, like the soft blanket that had wrapped around her childhood home all those years ago. She knew she'd face whatever came next, armed with the lessons of her past and the love of her mother's unwavering heart.
