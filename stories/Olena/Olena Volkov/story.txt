Olena Volkov stood at the edge of the Moscow River, her eyes scanning the grey sky. The chill in the air was nothing compared to the chill that had settled in her heart since she'd received the letter. Her mother's passing had left a void she couldn't fill.

As she walked along the riverbank, memories flooded her mind. Afternoons spent playing chess with her father, laughter-filled nights watching Soviet films with her siblings. The scent of pierogies wafting from the vendor on every corner was still alive in her nostrils.

She paused at a street performer's sketch of the Kremlin walls. A small child smiled at his rendition of the Lenin Mausoleum. Olena remembered running past those very walls as a girl, chasing after stray pigeons with her friends.

It had been ten years since the fall of the Soviet Union. The old world was gone, leaving behind uncertainty and disillusionment. Olena's mother had always been a beacon of hope, instilling in her children a sense of resilience that could carry them through even the darkest times.

A street vendor approached her, his eyes filled with genuine kindness as he asked if she'd like some pelmeni. She smiled weakly, unsure how to respond. Life went on for those who had the means and resources – but what about the rest?

She bought a plate of steaming hot dumplings from him, letting the savory taste fill her empty stomach. For a brief moment, the pain receded, replaced by memories of laughter, warmth, and love shared with family.

Olena continued on to the park where she used to ride bicycles with her friends under the watchful eye of her mother's garden gnomes. Their faces had faded over time – yet the memory remained vivid.

Eventually, the riverbank gave way to a quiet café near the metro station. She ordered a strong cup of black coffee and sat down by the window, her eyes drifting towards the grey Moscow sky once more.

Her thoughts roamed free, like a solitary bird that takes flight when no one is watching – untethered from sorrow, finding solace in recollections. Perhaps it was her mother's presence she had sensed that day by the river – even if just for an instant, their spirits merged, reminding her of what lay beyond her current sorrow.

With tears stinging at the corners of her eyes, Olena sipped her coffee and began to type away on her old laptop – words pouring out from within as memories gave way to thoughts that took shape.
