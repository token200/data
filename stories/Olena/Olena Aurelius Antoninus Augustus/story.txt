In the scorching heat of ancient Rome, a young girl named Olena Aurelius Antoninus Augustus was born to a family of modest means. Her full name, Olena Aurelius Antoninus Augustus, reflected her lineage and heritage, for she was a direct descendant of the Roman emperors.

Her parents, though poor, recognized her potential and encouraged her education. She spent hours poring over dusty tomes in the local library, devouring knowledge on history, philosophy, and politics.

One day, while exploring the city, Olena stumbled upon a group of senators arguing about the latest imperial decrees. Entranced by their discussions, she listened intently, asking questions and offering her own insights.
