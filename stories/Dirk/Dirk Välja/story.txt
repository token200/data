In the dimly lit tavern, a lone figure sat huddled in the corner, nursing a mug of lukewarm ale. Dirk Välja, a man shrouded in mystery, had arrived in town just yesterday, with no clear purpose or destination. His piercing blue eyes seemed to bore into the souls of those around him, as if searching for something – or someone.

As he sipped his drink, a hooded figure slid onto the stool beside him, their presence barely perceptible. "You're Dirk Välja," they whispered, their voice like a gentle breeze on a summer's day. "I've been sent to retrieve you."

Dirk Välja's eyes narrowed, his gaze fixed intently on the stranger. He knew that name – it was a summons from an old acquaintance, one who had been watching him for years. The message had been cryptic: "The time of reckoning approaches. Come when the wind howls like a wolf."

Without a word, Dirk Välja set his mug down and rose from his seat, his movements fluid and purposeful. He paid the tavern keeper with a few coins, slipped out into the cool evening air, and disappeared into the shadows.

The hooded figure watched him go, their eyes gleaming with an otherworldly light. They nodded to themselves, as if confirming a long-held truth. Dirk Välja was indeed a man on a mission, one driven by secrets and obsessions that few knew existed.

As he vanished into the night, Dirk Välja's thoughts turned to his troubled past – the events that had led him down this winding path. His eyes clouded over, memories surfacing like ghostly apparitions. The name of his late mother echoed in his mind: Elara Välja, a woman whose love and loss had forever scarred his soul.

Dirk Välja knew not what lay ahead, but he was resolute – driven by an unyielding determination to uncover the truth. And when the wind howled like a wolf, as it would soon, he would be ready.
