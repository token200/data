Her prized diamond necklace had been stolen during a charity gala, and she suspected foul play. Dirk listened attentively as she recounted the events leading up to the theft, his eyes narrowing with interest.

"I need you to find my necklace, Mr. Poirier," Mrs. Pembroke implored, her voice trembling. "I'll do whatever it takes."
