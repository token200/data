As a lead singer of the punk rock band "Riot's Revenge," she had built a reputation for being one of the most energetic performers on stage.

Janis was also known for her outspoken views on social justice, often using her platform to speak out against injustice and advocate for marginalized communities. Her bandmates admired her passion and conviction, and her lyrics often reflected the turmoil and struggle that she experienced as a young woman growing up in a working-class neighborhood.

Despite her tough exterior, Janis had a soft spot for strays and lost causes.

Music became her solace, and writing became her therapy.

She knew that the road ahead would be long and grueling, but she was ready to face whatever challenges came her way. With her bandmates by her side, Janis Kovalchuk set out to share her message of hope and defiance with fans around the world.
