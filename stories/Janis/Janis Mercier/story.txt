As the set progressed, Janis worked her way through a carefully curated selection of songs, each one showcasing her unique perspective on love, loss, and growing up. Her voice cracked with emotion as she sang about the pain of leaving behind the only home she'd ever known, but it was a sound that resonated deeply with the audience.

Janis Mercier's dedication to her craft was evident in every performance, from the subtle nuances in her phrasing to the raw intensity of her stage presence.
