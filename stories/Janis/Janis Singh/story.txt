Janis Kaur Singh was a brilliant and feisty astrophysicist who had always been fascinated by the mysteries of the universe. Growing up in a small town in India, she spent countless nights gazing up at the stars, dreaming of one day unraveling their secrets.

As she grew older, Janis's passion for astronomy only intensified, and she went on to study at some of the top universities in the world. She earned her Ph.D. in astrophysics from Harvard University, where she became known for her innovative research methods and her ability to think outside the box.

Despite her many accomplishments, Janis remained humble and kind, always willing to lend a helping hand to those around her. Her colleagues admired her intelligence and work ethic, and she quickly became a leading expert in her field.

One day, while working on a particularly challenging project, Janis received an unexpected visit from her grandmother, Dolly Singh. Dolly had always been Janis's closest confidante, and the two shared a special bond that went beyond family ties.

Over a cup of steaming hot chai, Dolly asked Janis about her plans for the future. "Janis Kaur," she said with a smile, "what do you hope to achieve in your lifetime?"

Janis thought for a moment before responding. "I want to make discoveries that will change the way we understand the universe," she said. "And I want to inspire others to follow in my footsteps."

Dolly beamed with pride at her granddaughter's answer. "You will do great things, Janis Kaur," she said. "Remember to always stay true to yourself and never lose sight of your dreams."

Janis smiled, feeling a sense of gratitude towards her grandmother. She knew that Dolly's words were more than just empty encouragement - they came from a place of deep love and understanding.

From that day on, Janis felt a renewed sense of purpose and determination. She threw herself into her work with even greater enthusiasm, knowing that she had the support and blessing of those who loved her most.
