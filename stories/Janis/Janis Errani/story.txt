When Janis finally took her bow, the applause was thunderous. She smiled, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over her. It had been a long time coming, but Janis Errani knew that this moment was hers – and she was ready to take it all by storm.

As she left the stage, Janis Errani was stopped by fans clamoring for autographs and selfies. She signed each one with a flourish, feeling like the luckiest person in the world. For tonight, at least, Janis Errani had truly become the star she had always dreamed of being.
