Janis "JD" Girard was a force to be reckoned with on the streets of New Orleans. As the lead singer of the sultry blues band, The Blackwater Serenaders, she had built a reputation for her raw, emotive voice and unapologetic lyrics.

Growing up in the French Quarter, Janis had always been drawn to the music that flowed through the city's veins like the Mississippi River. Her love affair with the blues began when she stumbled upon a tattered vinyl record of Bessie Smith at her grandmother's house. From that moment on, Janis was hooked.

As JD Girard, she fronted The Blackwater Serenaders, a tight-knit group of musicians who shared her passion for authentic, rootsy music. With the help of guitar virtuoso and long-time friend, Jake "The Snake" Stevens, the band began to make waves in the local scene.

Janis's voice was like nothing anyone had ever heard before - it was like a rich, velvety night sky on a Louisiana summer evening: dark, mysterious, and full of hidden stars. Her lyrics painted vivid pictures of heartache, love, and the struggles of everyday life. She sang from the gut, her soul on fire with every note.

But Janis's success came at a price. The pressures of fame and the constant scrutiny of the music industry took its toll on her relationships and her mental health. One fateful night, after a particularly grueling show, Janis found herself alone in her hotel room, tears streaming down her face as she clutched her guitar to her chest.

It was then that Jake, sensing his friend's turmoil, sat down beside her and began to strum the opening chords of "River of Sorrow." The music washed over Janis like a balm, soothing her frazzled nerves and reminding her why she started singing in the first place. As she let out a shuddering sigh, JD Girard knew that no matter what lay ahead, she would always have The Blackwater Serenaders - and the blues - to carry her through.
