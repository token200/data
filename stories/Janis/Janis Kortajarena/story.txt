I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Janis Kortajarena. The name appears to be fictional.

However, I can create a new story based on your request:

Janis Kortajarena was a young and talented artist living in the vibrant city of New York. With her short, spiky hair and bright pink lipstick, she stood out in a crowd. But Janis wasn't just any ordinary artist - she had a unique vision and a passion that drove her to create some of the most incredible works of art in the city.

Janis's friends and family knew her as Janis Kortajarena, a name that was synonymous with creativity and innovation. She spent countless hours in her small studio, experimenting with different mediums and techniques, always pushing the boundaries of what was possible.

One day, Janis received an email from a prominent gallery owner, inviting her to showcase her work in a solo exhibition. The news sent shockwaves through the art community, with everyone talking about the young and talented Janis Kortajarena.

As the big day approached, Janis's nerves began to get the better of her. She was determined to make this exhibition one to remember, but she couldn't shake off the feeling that she wasn't ready. Just as she was starting to lose hope, she remembered the words of her grandmother, who had always encouraged her to follow her dreams.

With newfound confidence, Janis set up her studio and began preparing for the exhibition. She spent hours arranging her pieces, adding a few final touches to each one before stepping back to admire them. When the evening of the exhibition arrived, Janis's art stunned the crowd, with everyone in attendance marveling at the talent and creativity of this young and talented artist.

Janis Kortajarena had finally made it, but she knew that this was just the beginning of her journey. She had already achieved so much at such a young age, and she was eager to see what the future held for her.
