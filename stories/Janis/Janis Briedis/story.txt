Janis Briedis stepped onto the worn wooden dock, her boots sinking into the damp earth as she gazed out at the misty lake. A solitary sailboat bobbed gently on the water, its canvas flapping in the breeze. The local legend claimed that on nights like these, when the moon hung low in the sky and the wind carried the scent of damp earth, spirits of the past would rise from the depths.

Janis Briedis had always been skeptical, but as she stood there, a shiver ran down her spine. She was a historian by trade, known for her meticulous research and love of dusty tomes. But there was something about this place that drew her in, like a moth to flame.

As she watched, a figure began to take shape on the water's surface. At first, it was just a ripple, but as the moments passed, a face emerged, eyes closed as if lost in thought. Janis Briedis felt a jolt of recognition, as if she had seen those eyes before – but where?

The face drew closer, until Janis could see the faint outline of features, etched into the mist like a silhouette. And then, suddenly, it solidified, taking on a life of its own. A young woman, with hair as dark as the lake itself and eyes that burned like embers.

"Who are you?" Janis Briedis asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

The woman's gaze locked onto hers, and for an instant, they stood there, two souls lost in time. Then, with a quiet nod, she vanished into the mist, leaving Janis Briedis alone on the dock once more.

As she turned to leave, the wind died down, and the sailboat seemed to hold its breath. For a moment, Janis felt like she was standing at the edge of something momentous – but as she walked away from the lake, she couldn't shake the feeling that some secrets lay hidden beneath the surface, waiting for her to uncover them.
