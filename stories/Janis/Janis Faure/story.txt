Throughout it all, Luna remained by her side, offering unwavering support and encouragement. As Janis looked back on the journey that had brought her to this moment, she knew that it was Luna's unwavering faith in her that had helped her stay true to herself.

With each new piece, Janis poured a little more of herself onto the canvas, infusing them with a sense of vulnerability and authenticity. She refused to compromise on her vision, even when faced with offers from galleries and collectors who sought to shape her art to suit their own tastes. For Janis Faure, creative freedom was the ultimate prize, and she would fight to preserve it at all costs.
