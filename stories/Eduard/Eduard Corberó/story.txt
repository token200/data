Eduard Corberó stepped out of the dimly lit café, the chill of the night air hitting him like a slap in the face. He had been hiding here for days, trying to escape the memories that haunted him. The city lights blurred together as he walked down the crowded streets, his eyes scanning the faces of strangers for a moment's respite from the truth.

It was hard to believe it had come to this. Eduard, the renowned architect, who had built his career on sleek lines and innovative designs, now found himself trapped in a web of secrets and lies. His wife, Sophia, was gone, taken from him by her own demons. The police were closing in, demanding answers he couldn't give.

He turned a corner onto the riverbank promenade, where the Seine flowed sluggishly beneath his feet. Eduard had designed this very spot, imagining it as a symbol of hope and renewal. Now, it felt like a cold, unforgiving abyss.

A gust of wind swept through, extinguishing the twinkling lights that lined the promenade. The darkness seemed to swallow him whole, but Eduard didn't falter. He knew these streets better than anyone, every alleyway and hidden corner holding secrets he could hardly bear to confront.

As he walked, his mind replayed the events leading up to Sophia's disappearance. The tension between them had grown unbearable, until one fateful night she vanished. The investigation that followed had revealed a tangled web of deceit, with Eduard himself at its center. He was accused of her murder, and now he knew he had to flee.

Eduard quickened his pace, the sound of footsteps echoing through the deserted streets as he disappeared into the shadows. His heart pounded in his chest, but he refused to give in. Not yet. He would find a way out of this nightmare, even if it killed him.

For now, he had to keep moving, to stay one step ahead of the law and his own guilt. The city lights blurred together as he vanished into the darkness, leaving behind only whispers of his name, Eduard Corberó.
