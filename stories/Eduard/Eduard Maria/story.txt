He traveled extensively throughout Europe, performing in grand halls and intimate salons, sharing his music with audiences from all walks of life. His interpretations of Bach's sonatas and Debussy's sonatines were particularly praised by critics and audiences alike.

Despite the demands of his career, Eduard remained true to his roots, often returning to Vienna to visit his family and friends. He was particularly close to his mother, who had instilled in him a love for art that went far beyond music. Together, they would spend hours discussing literature, philosophy, and the latest developments in art.
