Eduard Sánchez-Gijón stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. He had been traveling for hours, and the fatigue was starting to catch up with him. As he made his way through the deserted streets, the faint scent of saltwater carried on the breeze reminded him of home.

Born and raised in the seaside town of Cangas do Morrazo, Eduard had grown up listening to the tales of his abuelo, a fisherman who had spent his life navigating the treacherous waters off the coast. The stories of the sea's fury and beauty had shaped Eduard into the person he was today: a wanderer at heart, always chasing the next great adventure.

Now, as a renowned journalist, Eduard had traveled to every corner of the globe, chronicling the stories of those who lived on the fringes of society. His reporting had taken him from the streets of Rio de Janeiro to the refugee camps of Calais, and everywhere in between.

As he walked, the buildings seemed to grow taller and more decrepit, a reflection of the town's faded glory. Eduard felt a pang of nostalgia for the days when Cangas was bustling with life, when his abuelo would regale him with tales of the sea monsters that roamed its depths.

He arrived at the old family home, now a small guesthouse, and was greeted by his mother, who had inherited the property after her husband's passing. Eduard spent hours chatting with her about everything and nothing, catching up on the news of Cangas and sharing stories of his own adventures.

As night fell, Eduard sat on the balcony, watching the stars twinkle to life above. He thought back to his abuelo, who had taught him that the sea was not just a place, but a state of mind. It was a lesson that had served him well on his travels, and one he carried with him still.

Eduard Sánchez-Gijón felt at peace in this small town, surrounded by the memories of his past and the promise of new stories waiting to be told. As he gazed out into the darkness, he knew that he would never stay in one place for too long – the world was too vast, and Eduard's curiosity too insatiable. But for now, he was home, and that was enough.
