Eduard Pérez Sánchez was a man of few words, but his actions spoke louder than any spoken language. A retired carpenter from the small town of San Miguel, Eduard had spent most of his life building homes for families in need. His hands were stained with wood shavings and his eyes twinkled with kindness as he worked.

One day, a young girl named Sofia wandered into Eduard's workshop, searching for someone to help her fix a broken chair. Her mother had told her about the skilled carpenter who lived on the outskirts of town, and she hoped to find him there. Eduard looked up from his workbench, where he was sanding down a wooden table, and nodded at Sofia.

"What seems to be the problem with your chair?" he asked in a low, gentle voice. Sofia explained that her chair had broken when she was playing outside, and she didn't know how to fix it. Eduard listened attentively, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he smiled.

"Don't worry, I'll take care of it," he said, standing up from his workbench and walking over to where Sofia's chair lay on the floor. He examined it carefully, muttering to himself as he searched for the broken piece. After a few minutes, he produced a small hammer and began to tap gently at the damaged area.

As Eduard worked, Sofia told him about her life in San Miguel. She had grown up watching her parents build homes for others, just like Eduard did, and she wanted to follow in their footsteps one day. Eduard listened intently, his hands moving deftly as he repaired the chair.

When he finished, Eduard handed the chair back to Sofia, who hugged him tightly. "Gracias, señor Eduard Pérez Sánchez," she said, her eyes shining with gratitude. Eduard chuckled and patted her shoulder. "No need to thank me, m'ija. That's what I'm here for."

As Sofia left the workshop, chair in hand, Eduard returned to his workbench, feeling content and fulfilled. He had spent his life building homes, but today he had built something even more important: a connection between two people. And as he sat down to rest his hands, Eduard knew that he would always be there for those who needed him, just as he had been for Sofia.
