One rainy evening, Eduard Emi received a visit from Lady Harcourt, whose prized possession - a rare gemstone necklace - had gone missing. She implored him to find the thief and recover her treasured heirloom. Eduard Emi listened intently, his mind already racing with theories and suspects.

As he began his investigation, Eduard Emi discovered that several people had access to Lady Harcourt's estate on the night of the theft. He interviewed each suspect, from the loyal butler to the visiting artist, searching for any inconsistencies in their alibis.
