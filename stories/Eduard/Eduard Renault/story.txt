"So, Mr. Blackwood, what exactly are you working on?" Eduard asked, jotting down notes as the billionaire began to speak in measured tones.

Blackwood leaned forward, his voice taking on a conspiratorial tone. "I'm pushing the boundaries of quantum computing, Eduard Renault. Imagine it: an AI capable of solving problems that have stumped humanity for centuries."

Eduard's eyes widened; this was exactly what he had been searching for. He pressed for more information, and Blackwood obliged, sharing tantalizing hints about his research.

As the interview drew to a close, Eduard couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement. This could be it â€“ the story that would propel him to international recognition. As he left Blackwood's mansion, he felt invigorated, already mentally crafting his article.
