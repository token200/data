Eduard Müller was known for his peculiar habit of collecting antique door knockers. His friends and family often joked that he had a fascination with entrances, and they weren't far off. Every time Eduard walked into a new home or office, he would make it a point to examine the door knocker.

As an antiques dealer, Eduard's passion for unusual items made him quite successful in his line of work. He owned several shops across Europe, each one filled with peculiar trinkets and relics that had been passed down through generations.

One day, while visiting his sister in Paris, Eduard stumbled upon a small antique shop tucked away in the Latin Quarter. The sign above the door read "Curiosités et Antiquités," and Eduard felt an inexplicable pull to enter. Inside, he found an assortment of peculiar items that made him feel right at home.

Among the shelves, he spotted an exquisite bronze door knocker in the shape of a lion's head. It was ornate and beautifully crafted, and Eduard knew immediately that it belonged in one of his shops. After haggling with the shop owner over the price, Eduard emerged from the shop with the lion-headed door knocker safely tucked away in his bag.

Back at his own shop, Eduard carefully cleaned and restored the door knocker to its former glory. He placed it proudly on the door of one of his other stores, where it quickly became a conversation starter among customers. Word spread about Eduard Müller's incredible collection of antiques, and soon, people were coming from all over to see his wares.

As the years passed, Eduard continued to grow his business and expand his collection of unusual items. His passion for antique door knockers never faded, but he discovered a new appreciation for other curious objects that adorned the entrances of buildings across Europe. Despite his many successes, Eduard remained humble and dedicated to sharing the stories behind each item in his collection.
