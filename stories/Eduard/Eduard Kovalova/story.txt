Eduard Kovalova stepped out of the Moscow Metro, his eyes scanning the crowded platform as he waited for his train. A former KGB agent turned freelance journalist, Eduard had seen it all - from high-stakes espionage to gritty street fighting.

His latest investigation was about to take a personal turn, however. He had received a cryptic message from an anonymous source claiming to have information on his long-lost sister, Anastasia. The last time Eduard saw her was during the Soviet Union's chaotic final days; she had vanished in a brutal crackdown by the authorities.

As he waited for his train, Eduard's mind wandered back to those memories. He recalled the smell of smoke and concrete, the sound of sirens and screams. Anastasia had always been the more adventurous one, the wild child who refused to be tamed.

The train rumbled in, and Eduard climbed aboard just as it was pulling out of the station. The familiar rhythm of the wheels on tracks soothed his jangled nerves, but he couldn't shake off the sense that time was running out. If this message was genuine, every day counted.

He spent the rest of the ride scribbling notes and reviewing files in his mind, searching for any clue that might lead him to Anastasia's whereabouts. When he finally arrived at his office, a dingy but reliable spot near Red Square, Eduard dived into work, fueled by caffeine and determination.

But amidst the chaos of Moscow's streets and newspapers, something was off. A cold draft caressed Eduard's skin, carrying with it an unmistakable scent - the same one Anastasia had worn years ago.

A shiver ran down his spine as he scanned the crowded room, searching for any sign of recognition or deception. That was when he saw her, standing at the edge of the office, a vision in dark leather and steel.

For a heartbeat, Eduard forgot to breathe.

Then it clicked into place - she had to be here to give him information, but also to warn him away from something bigger than himself. His sister's message had been more than just an encounter; it was a warning.

Eduard's journalist instincts took over as he stepped forward, his voice barely above a whisper: "Anastasia? What do you want?"

The response was a simple smile - the one Eduard knew so well from their childhood. And in that instant, he knew that nothing would ever be the same again.
