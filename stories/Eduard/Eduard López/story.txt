The story of her bravery and determination in the face of overwhelming oppression captivated him, and he knew he had to learn more about this mysterious figure.

Eduard López spent countless hours tracking down leads and following up on rumors, eventually uncovering the woman's name: María. He became obsessed with learning everything he could about María, reading every book and article he could find on her life and times.

As Eduard López delved deeper into his research, he began to notice strange parallels between María's story and that of other women who had lived during this period.
