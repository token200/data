Eduard Wei stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, his eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of movement. As a former hitman turned private investigator, he had seen his fair share of darkness, but this case was different.

A wealthy businessman named Marcus had approached him with a plea for help: his daughter, Sophia, had gone missing three days ago, and the police seemed more interested in covering up the scandal than solving the case. Eduard's instincts told him that something was off, and he agreed to take on the case.

He lit a cigarette and took a long drag, his mind racing with possibilities. Sophia, 25 years old, had been studying abroad when she vanished. Her parents had received a cryptic message from an unknown number, demanding $10 million in exchange for her safe return. The police investigation was going nowhere, but Eduard knew that time was running out.

He pulled out his phone and dialed a number, connecting with his old associate, Victor. "I need your help," Eduard said, without preamble. Victor agreed to meet him at the usual spot in an hour.

As he waited for Victor, Eduard thought back on his past life as a hitman. He had done countless jobs for various clients, but something about this case resonated with him. Maybe it was Sophia's age, or the desperation in Marcus's eyes when they met. Whatever it was, Eduard knew he couldn't turn down the job.

When Victor arrived, they exchanged brief words before setting out to follow up on leads. They visited Sophia's university, talked to her friends and acquaintances, but no one seemed to have any information about her disappearance.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the city, Eduard felt a sense of unease creeping in. He had a feeling that he was being watched, that unblinking eyes were trained on him from the shadows. Suddenly, Victor grabbed his arm and pointed down a narrow street.

A black sedan pulled up, and a figure emerged. "Eduard Wei," the man said, with a hint of a smile. Eduard's instincts screamed warning, but he stood his ground, ready for whatever came next. The man handed him a small package wrapped in brown paper. Inside was a photograph of Sophia, her eyes blacked out.

The message was clear: "Look closer at Marcus." Eduard's mind began racing with questions. Who was behind this? What did they want from Sophia? He knew that he had to dig deeper, and fast.
