Ellie Esquivel was known for her fearless attitude and quick wit, which had earned her a reputation as one of the top detectives in the city. With a sharp mind and an even sharper tongue, she tackled cases that others deemed too tough or too trivial.

One evening, Ellie received a mysterious call from an anonymous source claiming to have information about a high-profile murder case that had gone cold five years ago. The caller whispered a single phrase before hanging up: "Look for the flowers."

Intrigued, Ellie began to dig into the past, pouring over old police files and interviewing key witnesses. She spent long hours poring over photographs of the crime scene, searching for any hint of what might have led her to the killer.

As she delved deeper into the case, Ellie started to notice a recurring pattern. The victim had been seen with several people on the night of the murder, but each of those individuals seemed to have an alibi that checked out. That was until she stumbled upon a small bouquet of flowers hidden away in a storage unit belonging to one of the suspects.

The flowers were from Ellie's favorite variety – yellow roses. Her gut told her that this was more than just a coincidence. The caller had said "flowers," but what if it meant something more specific? Ellie began to think about the various meanings associated with yellow roses and how they might relate to the case.

That night, under the light of a full moon, Ellie made her way to the scene of the original crime, determined to see if the flowers would lead her to some kind of clue. She searched every inch of the area, finally stopping in front of an old, abandoned greenhouse. There, nestled among the dusty plants, was another bouquet of yellow roses.

This time, there was no single word left between the blooms and the police database – but a name had appeared. One of the original suspects, who had initially seemed so innocent, now stood before Ellie with their hands clasped behind their back.

"You can't solve it all on your own," one half whispered through lips clenched together under a smile.

Ellie raised her gaze to meet his eyes and leaned in slightly, ready for whatever came next.
