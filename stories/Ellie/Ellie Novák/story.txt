Ellie Novák stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar streets of Prague. The city's Gothic spires reached towards the sky like skeletal fingers, their stone surfaces worn smooth by centuries of rain and wind.

As she made her way through the crowded station, Ellie's thoughts turned to the reason for her return: a mysterious letter from an old friend, begging her help with a family secret. It had been years since Ellie last set foot in Prague, but the memories of her childhood here remained vivid – summers spent exploring the winding streets, playing hide-and-seek among the castle walls.

Ellie's own past was marked by secrets and silence. Her parents had died when she was young, and the only family member who seemed willing to talk about them was her estranged sister, Laura. But that conversation had ended abruptly, with Laura hanging up on Ellie in a fit of rage.

Now, as Ellie walked through the city's streets, she felt a sense of restlessness growing inside her. She knew that going back would be like unwrapping old scars – tender and painful all over again. Yet, something about Laura's letter had reached out to her, calling her home.

Ellie stopped in front of a small café on Old Town Square, one where she used to meet Laura as children. Inside, the air was thick with smoke and coffee fumes, but Ellie recognized the scent of old books from behind the counter. The proprietor, an elderly woman named Mária, looked up and smiled.

"Ellie Novák! It's been far too long!"

As Ellie ordered a coffee and took a seat at a small table by the window, her eyes drifted to a newspaper clipping on the wall – Laura's photo, with a caption that read "Missing Person".

A sense of foreboding settled over Ellie. What had Laura gotten herself into? And why was she asking for Ellie's help now? The questions swirled in her mind as she took a sip of her coffee and watched the city's shadows begin to stir outside.

For Ellie Novák, Prague held secrets and whispers – some old, some new. As she finished her drink and rose to leave, the streets seemed to whisper back to her: "Welcome home."
