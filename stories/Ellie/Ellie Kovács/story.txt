Ellie Kovács stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of life. As a freelance writer, she was used to working alone, but tonight felt different. She had been struggling with writer's block for weeks, and the pressure was starting to get to her.

As she waited for her coffee, Ellie noticed a figure sitting in the corner, hunched over a laptop. There was something familiar about them, but she couldn't quite place it. When their head lifted, Ellie saw that it was none other than her old university roommate, Max.

Max and I had been inseparable during our time at university, bonding over late-night pizza and study sessions. But after graduation, we went our separate ways, each chasing our own dreams. Now, as they caught her eye, Ellie felt a spark of excitement. Maybe, just maybe, she could finally break through her creative barrier with some old-school inspiration.

Ellie made her way over to Max's table, coffee in hand, and plopped down beside them. "What brings you here?" she asked, trying to sound nonchalant despite the butterflies in her stomach.

Max smiled, their eyes crinkling at the corners. "Just working on a project," they said, gesturing to their laptop. Ellie took in the scattered notes and research papers, her mind whirling with ideas.

The two of them spent the next few hours talking, laughing, and brainstorming. Max was still witty and charming, but also kind and supportive – exactly what Ellie needed right now. As the night wore on, their conversation flowed easily, like no time had passed at all.

For the first time in weeks, Ellie felt her creative juices start to flow. She scribbled down notes as quickly as they came to her, her mind racing with possibilities. When Max stood up to leave, Ellie felt a pang of disappointment, but also gratitude.

"Thanks for meeting me tonight," she said, smiling up at them. "I think I've got it now." Max grinned back, their eyes sparkling with encouragement. "Anytime, Ellie Kovács – you know I'm always here to help."
