Growing up in a small town, she had seen firsthand how the decisions made by local leaders could impact the lives of her community. Determined to make a difference, Ellie had pursued a degree in journalism and was now working as a reporter for a major news outlet.

One day, Ellie Fernández received an assignment to cover a high-profile city council meeting.
