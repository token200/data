One evening, as Ellie Molnar sipped her whiskey at the local watering hole, she struck up a conversation with a mysterious stranger named Jack. The air was thick with tension as they exchanged stories and laughed together, their eyes locking in a way that made Ellie Molnar's heart skip a beat.

As the night wore on, Jack revealed to Ellie Molnar his passion for exposing corruption within the city's highest echelons of power.
