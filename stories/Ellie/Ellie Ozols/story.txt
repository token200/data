Ellie Ozols stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station. It had been years since she'd last set foot in this town, but the memories still lingered like the sweet scent of blooming wildflowers.

As a child, Ellie had spent summers with her grandparents on their farm just outside the station. Her grandfather, a kind and gentle man named Janis, would take her on long walks through the fields, pointing out the constellations and telling stories of his own adventures. But after her grandmother passed away, Janis had moved to the city, seeking solace in the bustling streets.

Ellie's return was not a happy one. Her mother, who had always been distant and cold, stood waiting for her by the car. "I'm glad you're here," she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "We've got some catching up to do."

As they drove through the rolling hills and endless fields of wheat, Ellie felt a sense of unease settle over her. Her mother's behavior had always been strange, but since her grandmother's death, it had grown more erratic.

The farm was in disrepair, the once-familiar fields now overgrown with weeds. Ellie's eyes stung as she took in the sight of her grandfather's old swing set, still creaking in the breeze like a worn-out heartbeat. She couldn't bring herself to touch it, afraid of what might come next.

Her mother seemed oblivious to her daughter's distress, rattling off numbers and lists like a machine. "We need to fix the fence, and the well is dry," she muttered. Ellie felt like an outsider, watching this woman she had grown up with reduce the place they both called home to mere statistics.

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the land, Ellie finally found her voice. "Can I go explore?" she asked, her tone firm but hesitant.

Her mother raised an eyebrow. "Of course, dear. You're always welcome here."

Ellie felt a pang of disappointment, but it was nothing compared to the sense of disconnection that had been building inside her since their return. She nodded, shouldering her backpack and stepping out into the fading light.
