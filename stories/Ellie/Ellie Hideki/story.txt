Ellie Hideki stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of life. She had been searching for weeks, following every lead, every hint that might bring her closer to finding her sister. The café was a small, unassuming place, tucked away in a corner of the city she barely recognized anymore.

As she waited at the bar, Ellie's mind wandered back to the days when she and her sister were inseparable. They had grown up together, sharing every secret, every dream. And then, one day, their mother had taken them to a place called "the facility", where they were subjected to experiments and treatments that left Ellie with no memory of her life before.

She ordered a coffee and took a seat at a small table by the window, watching as people bustled past outside. The barista, a friendly young woman with a pierced nose, chatted with Ellie about the weather. Ellie smiled politely, but her mind was elsewhere.

Just as she was starting to lose hope, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was a man, tall and imposing, with piercing blue eyes that seemed to bore into Ellie's soul. He sat down across from her, his gaze steady and unnerving.

"I've been looking for you," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "My name is Dr. Kim, and I'm here to tell you something about your sister."

Ellie's heart skipped a beat as she leaned forward, her eyes locked on the doctor's. "What is it?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Dr. Kim hesitated, then began to speak in a slow, measured tone. "Your sister...she was part of a experiment. One that went horribly wrong."

Ellie felt a chill run down her spine as Dr. Kim told her about the facility, about the experiments they had conducted on the children who were brought there. She listened, entranced, as the doctor spoke of her sister's bravery and determination in the face of unimaginable horror.

When Dr. Kim finished speaking, Ellie sat back, her mind reeling with emotions. She thought of her sister, of the life she might have had, of the choices that had been taken away from her. And then, with a newfound sense of purpose, she stood up, determination burning in her heart.

"I'll find her," she said, her voice firm and resolute. "I'll make sure she's safe."

Dr. Kim nodded, a small smile on his face. "I believe you can, Ellie Hideki."
