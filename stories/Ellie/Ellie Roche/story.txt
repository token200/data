Ellie Roche stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of her friend, Jack. It had been months since they'd last seen each other, and she was eager to catch up on everything he'd been up to.

As she made her way through the crowds, Ellie's mind wandered back to their last conversation. They'd been talking about starting a new business venture together - a small cafe in the heart of the city. Jack had convinced her it was a great idea, and Ellie couldn't help but feel excited at the prospect of making it happen.

Finally, she spotted Jack waiting for her by the entrance to the station. He flashed a bright smile as she approached, and Ellie felt a warmth spread through her chest. "Hey, Ells!" he called out, using the nickname only he got away with.

Ellie rolled her eyes good-naturedly and pushed him playfully on the arm. "Groan, Jack. That's so cheesy." She grinned up at him. "But I'm glad to see you. How was your trip?"

It had been a long one, but Jack had spent it preparing for their cafe venture. He'd been researching local suppliers, scouting out potential locations, and making lists of things to buy. Ellie listened intently as he filled her in on all the details, feeling a sense of pride and excitement grow inside her.

Together, they made plans for when she arrived - Jack would take her on a tour of the city, showing her all the best places to find materials and inspiration for their cafe. And then, they'd spend days huddled over spreadsheets and blueprints, working out the kinks in their business plan.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the station, Ellie knew that this was just the beginning of an incredible adventure. With Jack by her side, she felt like anything was possible. And as they walked off into the fading light, arm in arm, she couldn't help but feel grateful for the friendship and partnership that had brought them to this moment.

The future may have been uncertain, but one thing was clear - Ellie Roche and Jack were ready to take on whatever came next, side by side.
