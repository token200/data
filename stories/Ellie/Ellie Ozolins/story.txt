Rumors swirled about his troubled past and his ability to tap into the deepest recesses of the human psyche through his art. Ellie was both intrigued and intimidated by the prospect of meeting him.

As they conversed, Ellie discovered that Julian's intense focus on his craft was matched only by her own drive for truth in her writing.
