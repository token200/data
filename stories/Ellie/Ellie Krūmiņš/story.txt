Ellie Krūmiņš, the smallest but most fiery member of the Latvian pop group, Starlings. Born and raised in Riga, Latvia, Ellie's voice was a gift from her mother, who had been a singer in her youth.

Growing up, Ellie would sit for hours at home listening to old records of Latvian folk music and watching traditional dance performances.

Ellie's nerves began to get the better of her as she stepped onto the stage alongside Mārtiņš and Andris. But just as the music began, something unexpected happened.

As Ellie started to sing, she felt a sudden surge of memories from her childhood: hearing Latvian folk songs with her mother in the living room, watching traditional dance performances at cultural festivals, and practicing old songs on her grandmother's piano. These cherished moments flooded her senses, fueling an unbridled passion for music.

Ellie's voice soared, blending effortlessly with Mārtiņš' smooth vocals and Andris' masterful guitar work. The crowd erupted into applause as Starlings performed their unique fusion of traditional Latvian sounds and modern pop.
