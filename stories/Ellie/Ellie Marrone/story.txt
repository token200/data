As she delved deeper into the world of crime, Ellie discovered that the serial killer was targeting young women who were active in social justice movements. The killer's modus operandi was to leave a small, intricately carved wooden box at each crime scene, adorned with a single word: "Silence".

Ellie Marrone knew she had to tread carefully; every move she made must be calculated and precise if she wanted to catch the killer before it was too late.
