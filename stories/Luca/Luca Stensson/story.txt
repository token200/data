Luca Stensson stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the grey, rain-soaked streets of Stockholm. His eyes scanned the cityscape, his mind lost in thought as he clutched his whiskey glass to his chest. It was a habit, one that brought him fleeting moments of comfort in the midst of chaos.

As a detective with the Stockholm police department, Luca had seen it all - from murders on the streets of SÃ¶dermalm to high-society scandals at the royal palace. But despite his years of experience, he couldn't shake the feeling that there was always something just out of reach, some crucial piece of evidence or twisted motive that lay hidden in the shadows.

The phone on his wrist buzzed, breaking Luca's reverie. He turned it to silence it and picked up, listening as his partner, Anna, spoke on the other end.

"What have you got?" Luca asked, already knowing she'd found something.

"It's a body," Anna replied. "Found near the old canal. Looks like murder."

Luca cursed under his breath as he tucked the phone into his pocket. This was exactly what he needed - another bloody mess to sift through. He took a long drink of whiskey, feeling the burn all the way down.

He arrived at the scene just as Anna and their team were beginning to process it. The victim was a young woman, no more than twenty-five years old. Her eyes stared up at Luca with an unnerving intensity, as if she knew some secret he didn't.

"What's her story?" Luca asked Anna, who shook her head.

"Not even ID on her yet," she replied.

Luca nodded and began his work, methodically surveying the area and examining the body. As he worked, he felt that familiar tug - this was it, the moment where everything came together. But what did it all mean?

The hours ticked by as Luca poured over the evidence, trying to find a thread of connection between the victim and the killer. And then, like a ghostly apparition, a name flickered into existence in his mind - Erika Andersson, the missing daughter of one of Stockholm's most influential families.

Luca knew he was getting close. The question now was: how far down this rabbit hole did it go?
