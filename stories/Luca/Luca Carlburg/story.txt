Luca Carlburg stepped into the dimly lit café, scanning the room for familiar faces. It had been months since she'd last set foot in this neighborhood, and yet the smell of freshly brewed coffee and the hum of hushed conversations felt like a warm hug.

As she waited in line to order, her eyes landed on a figure sitting at the corner table, nursing a cup of black coffee. Luca's gaze locked onto hers, and she smiled before turning back to the counter to place her order.

The barista handed her a steaming cup, and she made her way over to the corner table. "Mind if I join you?" she asked, nodding toward the empty chair across from him.

He looked up, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he smiled. "Not at all. Luca Carlburg?"

Luca raised an eyebrow, a hint of surprise dancing on her lips. "The famous journalist? You know who I am?"

He chuckled and leaned back in his chair. "I do indeed. I'm Marco, by the way."

As they introduced themselves, Luca noticed that Marco seemed...different. Not unpleasantly so, but like he was hiding something behind those piercing blue eyes.

Their conversation flowed easily, touching on everything from politics to literature. Luca found herself opening up to Marco in ways she hadn't with anyone in a long time.

But as the night wore on, Luca began to sense that there was more to Marco than met the eye. He spoke of his work with a quiet passion, and yet he seemed to be holding something back.

As they parted ways outside the café, Luca couldn't shake the feeling that she'd only scratched the surface of this enigmatic man. "Marco?" she called out as he turned to leave.

"Yes?"

"I think we're just getting started, don't you?" Luca Carlburg said with a sly smile, tucking her notebook into her bag.

Marco's eyes narrowed slightly before he smiled back, a hint of mystery lingering in his expression. "I look forward to finding out."
