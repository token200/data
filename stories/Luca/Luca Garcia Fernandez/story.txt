One sunny afternoon, Luca received an email from a potential client, asking if he could plan their daughter's sweet sixteen party. Excited by the challenge, Luca accepted the job and began brainstorming ideas. He envisioned a whimsical garden party with vintage decorations and a live band to keep the guests entertained.

As he started making phone calls to vendors and confirming details, Luca couldn't help but think about his own sweet sixteen celebration. He remembered the vibrant colors of his grandma's handmade flowers and the infectious energy of his friends' laughter on that warm summer evening.
