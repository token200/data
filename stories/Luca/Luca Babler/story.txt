Intrigued, Luca Babler rushed back to the scene and discovered a small note with a single word - "Raven".

Suddenly, the pieces fell into place. The thief was not just any ordinary burglar; they were a mastermind, using their knowledge of Ravenswood's history to leave a trail of breadcrumbs for Luca Babler to follow.

With renewed energy, Luca Babler pursued the lead, determined to catch the thief and bring them to justice. As she pieced together the evidence, she couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction - another case solved by her sharp mind and quick thinking.
