And as she took the stage each night, her eyes would wander to the horizon, feeling the breeze in her hair and the music coursing through her veins.

For Luca Elisabetta Nielsen, music was more than just a hobby â€“ it was a way of life. It connected her to her soul, to the world around her, and to those who listened with an open heart.
