One evening, as Luca Webb sat in their studio, pouring over their latest photographs, they received an unexpected visit from a mysterious stranger. The man introduced himself only as "Alex," and his words sent shivers down Luca's spine.

"I've seen your work, Luca Webb," Alex said, his voice low and gravelly. "I know what drives you to create these...these masterpieces."
