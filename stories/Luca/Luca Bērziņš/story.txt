Luca Bērziņš stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the small station with a mix of nostalgia and trepidation. It had been years since he'd set foot in Riga, Latvia, but the familiar sights and sounds still managed to evoke a sense of disorientation.

As a child, Luca Bērziņš had spent countless summers exploring the city's narrow streets and bustling markets with his grandfather, who had taught him the intricacies of traditional Latvian cuisine. Now, at 25, he found himself back in Riga for reasons he'd rather not discuss.

The chill of the evening air gave way to a warm breeze as Luca Bērziņš made his way through the station, weaving past tourists and locals alike. He hailed a taxi and provided the driver with the address of his family's old apartment building, a worn stone structure that seemed to lean precariously against its neighbor.

As he stepped out of the cab, Luca Bērziņš felt a pang of uncertainty. What would he find inside? Would his parents still live there, or had they long since moved on with their lives?

The taxi driver nodded sympathetically as Luca Bērziņš paid him and watched him drive away. "Your family's been through a lot, LUCA BĒRŽIŅŠ," he called out, his voice carrying across the silent street.

Luca Bērziņš shrugged, feeling a lump form in his throat. He'd always been close to his parents, but their struggles with addiction and mental health had taken a toll on their relationship. The last time they'd spoken was several months ago, when Luca Bērziņš had received news that his grandfather's restaurant was closing due to financial difficulties.

He took a deep breath and pushed open the creaky door to the apartment building, stepping into the warm glow of a lamp-lined hallway. A faint scent of old books wafted through the air, mingling with the dust and cobwebs that seemed to cling to every surface.

The stairway was narrow and winding, leading Luca Bērziņš up to the small apartment where his family had lived for decades. As he climbed, a sense of trepidation gave way to determination, driving him forward towards answers – and perhaps, finally, some closure.
