Luca Alessandro Corbero stepped off the crowded train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the unfamiliar streets of the city he had never known. As the younger brother of notorious gangster, Giovanni "The Bull" Corbero, Luca's life was always shrouded in secrecy.

Growing up on the wrong side of the tracks, Luca learned early on how to navigate the treacherous underworld that his brother ruled with an iron fist. But unlike Giovanni, who reveled in the chaos and violence that came with it, Luca had a more introspective nature. He longed for something more – a chance to break free from the shackles of his family's legacy.

As he made his way through the city streets, Luca's thoughts turned to the small café he had heard was run by an old acquaintance. She had promised to meet him there and help him get started on his new life. Luca spotted her sitting in the corner, sipping a cup of coffee, and made his way over.

"Luca Alessandro Corbero," she said with a warm smile, standing up to greet him. "It's so good to see you again."

Over steaming cups of coffee, Maria outlined her plan for Luca. She had connections in the city that could help him start fresh – a new identity, a new job, and even a new family. For the first time in his life, Luca felt a glimmer of hope.

But as they talked, Luca couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He glanced around the café, noticing a group of rough-looking men lingering at the edge of the room. They seemed to be staring straight at him.

Maria followed his gaze and her expression turned grave. "Those are some bad men, Luca Alessandro Corbero," she whispered. "Your brother's enemies. You need to leave now."

Without hesitation, Luca gathered his belongings and fled the café, disappearing into the crowded streets as quickly as he could. For the first time in his life, Luca felt truly alone, but it was a feeling that came with a newfound sense of freedom.
