Luca Novák sat alone in his dimly lit apartment, staring blankly at the old photograph on his nightstand. The faded image showed him as a young boy, smiling and carefree alongside his parents on a family vacation to the Adriatic coast. He hadn't seen them in years, not since they'd vanished without warning during that fateful trip.

The door creaked open, and Luca's roommate, Matej, walked in with a plate of freshly baked pastries. "Morning, Luka," he said, setting down the tray beside him. "You look like you've lost your last marble."

Luca shrugged, still lost in thought. "Just thinking about my family again," he mumbled.

Matej nodded sympathetically. "I know it's tough. But you can't dwell on the past. You have to keep moving forward." He patted Luca's shoulder reassuringly. "You're doing okay, Luka. You're making a new life here."

But Luca wasn't so sure. His past was still haunting him, and he struggled to shake off the feeling of abandonment. He'd always felt like there was something missing in his life, something that only his parents could provide.

As he devoured Matej's offerings, Luca's mind began to wander back to that day by the sea. What had happened to them? Had they been in some kind of danger? And why hadn't they come back?

Matej noticed Luca's distant gaze and chimed in, "Hey, I found something for you." He rummaged through his backpack and pulled out an old folder filled with newspaper clippings and police reports. Luca took it hesitantly, unsure what to expect.

The first article was from a local news outlet, detailing the disappearance of three tourists from Croatia – two men and one woman, all in their mid-twenties. The names were listed at the bottom: Ivan, Maja, and... Lukáš Novák. Luca's heart skipped a beat as he read his own name alongside those of his parents.

A chill ran down his spine as Matej continued to rummage through the folder. There were more reports, detailing a series of strange occurrences on that fateful day – equipment malfunctioning, witnesses reporting suspicious behavior... and an eerie feeling in the air.

Luca's eyes locked onto the final article, a police press release stating that the investigation had gone cold due to lack of evidence. But one thing stood out: "All leads were exhausted, but several family members remain hopeful for a resolution."

Hope? Luca felt a glimmer of it, a spark that he hadn't felt in years. He looked at Matej, who met his gaze with an encouraging smile.

"Maybe this is our chance," Matej said quietly. "To find out what really happened to your parents. To uncover the truth."

For the first time in years, Luca felt like he was finally starting to move forward.
