Luca Casanova was known for his charisma and cunning, earning him a reputation as one of the most elusive players in the high-stakes game of cat and mouse that played out on the streets of Rome.

As the son of a wealthy family, Luca had always been taught to prioritize his own interests above all else. He had honed his skills as a thief and a con artist, using his quick wit and charming smile to talk his way past even the most skeptical of guards.

But despite his success, Luca couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He had a nagging sense that there was someone out there who knew his true identity, waiting for him to slip up so they could bring him down.

One night, as Luca was casing a potential mark in the city's oldest quarter, he caught sight of a figure lurking in the shadows. It was a woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair, her presence seeming to command attention without even trying.

Luca's instincts told him that this was his stalker, the one person who had been following him for weeks. He quickened his pace, weaving through the crowded streets as he tried to lose her in the throng of people.

But no matter how fast he ran, Luca could feel the woman's eyes on him, boring into his skin like a cold, hard stone. Finally, he ducked into a narrow alleyway, hoping to shake her off his tail.

As he paused to catch his breath, Luca caught sight of a small piece of paper tacked to the wall beside him. It was a note, scrawled in red ink: "I know who you are, Luca Casanova."

Luca's heart skipped a beat as he read the words, his mind racing with possibilities. Who could have written this? And how did they know his true name, Luca Casanova?

With a sense of trepidation, Luca knew that he had to be careful from now on. He couldn't let his guard down, not even for a moment. The game was far from over, and Luca Casanova was about to find himself in a whole lot of trouble.
