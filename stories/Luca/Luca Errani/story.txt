Luca Errani was a man with a passion for art and music. As a child, he spent hours sketching in his notebook and listening to classical music on his mother's old record player. He grew up to be a talented painter, known for his vivid depictions of the Italian countryside.

After completing art school, Luca traveled to Paris, where he became fascinated with the works of Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. He spent years studying the Impressionist masters and honing his own style, which was both modern and traditional at the same time.

One day, while wandering through a small village in Provence, Luca stumbled upon an old music shop. The owner, an elderly man named Marcel, took a liking to Luca's curious nature and offered him a job as a part-time musician. For the next few years, Luca worked tirelessly behind the counter, playing the accordion for the local tourists.

It was during this time that Luca began to develop his own unique sound, blending traditional French folk music with modern electronic elements. His music gained popularity among the expat community in Paris
