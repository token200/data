They enrolled him in private classes, where he honed his skills and developed a unique voice. After completing his studies, Luca worked as an assistant to several established artists, learning the intricacies of the art world and building relationships with collectors and curators.

One day, Luca's big break came when his work was selected for a prestigious group exhibition in Barcelona. His painting, "La Noche en el Barrio," captured the energy and diversity of the city's nightlife, earning him critical acclaim and recognition within the artistic community.
