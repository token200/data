Luca Salamanca's eyes narrowed as he watched his brother, Gusfrido, make another mistake. The two brothers were sitting at their father's lavish dinner table, surrounded by the opulent trappings of their wealthy and influential family.

As a member of the powerful Salamanca cartel, Luca was accustomed to being treated with respect, but Gusfrido's blunder had earned him a scathing rebuke from their father. The old man's voice echoed through the room, making even Luca take notice.

"Luca, take control," their father commanded, his voice dripping with authority. "Gusfrido, you have embarrassed me and our family. You will leave my office immediately."

Luca rose from his seat, a mixture of annoyance and concern swirling inside him. Gusfrido's poor decision would not only reflect on the family, but also put their entire operation at risk.

As Gusfrido hastily gathered his belongings and exited the room, Luca couldn't help but feel a twinge of guilt. His brother was impulsive and reckless, often leaping before looking, which made Luca wish he had more control over his actions.

After the meeting with their father, Luca accompanied Gusfrido to his office, where they spent the next few hours trying to rectify the damage. Together, they devised a plan to salvage what was left of their failed operation, relying on Luca's strategic thinking and experience.

Their efforts eventually paid off, and the business began to recover, though not without significant losses. The incident served as a wake-up call for Gusfrido, who understood that his brother would always be watching over him.

In that moment, Luca realized he needed to strike a balance between being protective of his family's interests and giving Gusfrido room to learn from his mistakes. He could only hope that their father wouldn't notice the strain of shouldering more responsibility for his brother's errors.

With the business on shaky ground, Luca's thoughts turned to the larger picture â€“ their family's long-term survival in this cutthroat world of crime. As the eldest sibling, he took it upon himself to lead and guide, pushing the boundaries while ensuring that the Salamanca legacy remained intact.

Luca sat back down at the dinner table, watching Gusfrido with newfound understanding. Maybe one day his brother would learn to think before acting, and their family's future wouldn't be forever shrouded in uncertainty.
