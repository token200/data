Agnès Totti was a woman with an unassuming presence, yet she commanded attention wherever she went. As the matriarch of the influential Totti family, her reputation as a shrewd businesswoman and devoted mother was well-known throughout the city.

Born into a life of privilege, Agnès had always been driven to succeed on her own terms. After completing her education at the prestigious Sorbonne, she had built a lucrative career in finance, establishing herself as one of the most respected women in her field.

Despite her professional accomplishments, Agnès's true passion lay with her family. Her husband, Giovanni, and their two children, Luca and Sophia, were her world.
