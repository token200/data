Agnès Adelberg sat alone at her desk, staring out the window as she listened to the sound of rain pattering against the panes. It was a dreary day outside, but Agnès found solace in the grey skies.

She was a writer, a chronicler of lives lived and stories untold. Her words poured onto the page like water into a parched landscape. With each sentence, she brought people to life – or, rather, breathed air into the shells they had grown tired of inhabiting.

As a child, Agnès had always been drawn to the quiet ones. The ones who kept to themselves, their thoughts and feelings locked away behind a mask of neutrality. She saw something in them that others didn't: potential for depth, hidden beneath the surface like an underground lake waiting to be discovered.

Years went by, and Agnès honed her craft. Her stories became a mosaic of lives – fragmented but beautiful – each one reflecting shards of herself she'd discarded like old jewelry. People whispered about her writing; they said it was hypnotic, weaving a spell that made you forget the world outside the pages.

Agnès didn't seek fame or adoration; she wrote because it was what kept her sane in an increasingly chaotic world. There was comfort in losing herself within others' stories, as if her very identity was dissolving like watercolors in the rain.

But today was different. Today, Agnès felt the weight of her solitude bearing down upon her. The stories, which once lifted her up like wings, now seemed suffocating – trapped within her mind like insects in a glass jar. She longed for someone to share them with, someone who'd understand that behind every character was an unfulfilled longing.

As the rain continued its relentless drumbeat against the windowpane, Agnès picked up her pen and began to write. The words flowed like tears from her eyes – raw and honest, stripped of artifice. This time, it wasn't about someone else's story; this time, it was about her own – fragile as a shell cracked open by a misstep.

The words spilled onto the page, each one an exhalation of herself into a stranger's face, until she lost track of where Agnès began and ended. That's when the world outside – with all its vibrant colors – seeped into her writing, enriching it with light, making it whole once more.

For the first time in years, Agnès felt like she was living a story within herself – not trapped by it but cradled by it, buoyant as the rain that had soothed her.
