Agnès Kiss was a force to be reckoned with in the small town of Ashwood. As the owner of the local bakery, "Sweet Delights," she was renowned for her delectable pastries and warm smile.

As she packed her bags and said goodbye to her bakery, the townsfolk rallied around her, wishing her luck on her journey. At the conference, Agnès met like-minded individuals who shared her passion for creating a more just world.

Inspired by the conversations she had at the conference, Agnés Kiss decided to launch a new initiative - "Sweet Justice," a program aimed at providing free baked goods to those in need throughout Ashwood.
