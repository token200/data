Agnès Roux stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the cool mountain air enveloping her like a gentle hug. She had been away for so long, and the familiar scent of pine and damp earth was like coming home.

As she made her way through the small station, Agnès felt a sense of nostalgia wash over her. This was where she grew up, where her mother used to take her on walks and tell stories of their ancestors who had lived in these mountains for generations.

Agnès's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps behind her. She turned to see her childhood friend, Colette, smiling at her from beneath a tousled bob of hair.

"Bonjour, Agnès!" Colette exclaimed, opening her arms wide for a hug. "It's so good to see you!"

Agnès hugged her tightly, feeling a sense of joy and belonging she hadn't experienced in years. She had left this place after college, chasing dreams and ambitions that had taken her far from the familiar rhythms of mountain life.

But now, as she stood on the platform, surrounded by the quiet beauty of the mountains, Agnès felt a restlessness stirring inside her. She had been away for too long, and it was time to come home.

As they walked out of the station together, Colette asked Agnès what brought her back to this place after all these years. Agnès hesitated, unsure how much she wanted to share with her friend.

"I just needed to get away," she said finally, shrugging. "I was feeling lost and alone in the city."

Colette nodded knowingly. "You're not alone here, Agnès. The mountains will always be home, no matter where you are in the world."

Agnès smiled, feeling a sense of peace settle over her. She knew Colette was right. This place had been a part of her since she was a child, and it would always be a part of her.

As they walked up the mountain path, Agnès felt the familiar ache of longing in her chest. But it was no longer a sadness – it was a sense of belonging, of being exactly where she was meant to be.

The mountains stretched out before them, their peaks shrouded in mist and mystery. Agnès felt a thrill run through her veins as she looked up at the sky. She knew that she had come home, not just to this place, but to herself.
