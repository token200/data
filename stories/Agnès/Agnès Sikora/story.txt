Agnès Sikora stepped into the crowded café, scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Léa, sitting alone at a small table by the window and made her way over.

As she approached, Léa looked up and smiled. "Hey, Agnès Sikora! Long time no see."

Agnès took a seat across from her, ordering a coffee as she waited for the barista to prepare it. They chatted about everything and nothing, catching up on each other's lives.

Léa had been going through a tough time lately, struggling with anxiety and feeling overwhelmed by her responsibilities. Agnès listened attentively, offering words of encouragement and support. As they talked, Agnès couldn't help but think back to their own experiences with mental health struggles in the past.

The two friends had met in art school, bonding over their shared love of painting and creativity. Over the years, they had supported each other through thick and thin, offering a shoulder to cry on and a listening ear whenever needed.

As the afternoon wore on, Léa confided in Agnès about her struggles with self-doubt and fear of failure. Agnès listened attentively, sharing her own experiences with imposter syndrome and the importance of embracing vulnerability.

"You are so much more than your fears, Léa," Agnès said, taking a sip of her coffee. "Remember that you have so much talent and potential to offer the world."

Léa nodded, looking a little more hopeful as they finished their drinks. As they prepared to part ways, Agnès handed her friend a small gift – a sketchbook filled with blank pages and a note that read, "For when the doubts creep in, remember to create."

Agnès watched as Léa took the gift, a small smile on her face. She knew that with her support and encouragement, Léa would be able to overcome her struggles and find her way again.
