Agnès Tzu-chi was a mystifying figure in the ancient city of Kaiji. Few people knew much about her, except that she possessed an uncanny ability to communicate with animals. As a child, Agnès would often be found playing with the city's stray dogs, and by adulthood, her talent had grown to include birds, reptiles, and even fish.

Agnès Tzu-chi lived in a small, secluded cottage on the outskirts of Kaiji, surrounded by a lush garden filled with herbs and flowers. The villagers whispered that she used these plants to heal not only animals but also humans, who would come from all over to seek her aid. Some said she could even see into the spirits' realm, guiding lost souls back to the afterlife.

One day, a severe storm ravaged Kaiji, knocking down trees and destroying homes. The villagers were in a state of panic, fearing for their lives. Agnès Tzu-chi emerged from her cottage, her long black hair streaming behind her like a river of night. She walked calmly through the devastation, calling out to the animals affected by the storm.

To the amazement of the onlookers, she spoke in a language all creatures could understand. A family of raccoons, swept away from their nest, perched on her shoulders as she coaxed them back home. A group of baby birds, orphaned when their nest was destroyed, nestled into the folds of her cloak.

As Agnès Tzu-chi worked her magic, the storm began to subside. The winds died down, and the rain ceased. The villagers cheered, grateful for her intervention. They realized that their enigmatic neighbor was not only a guardian of animals but also a force of nature herself.

From that day forward, Agnès Tzu-chi's reputation spread far beyond Kaiji. People came from all corners of the world to seek her help, and she continued to listen to the whispers of the spirits, guiding those in need back to balance and harmony. Her name became synonymous with compassion and power, a testament to the mysterious energies that dwelled within this mystical woman known as Agnès Tzu-chi.
