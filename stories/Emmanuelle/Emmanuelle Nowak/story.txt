Emmanuelle Nowak stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the sleepy station. It had been years since she'd returned to her hometown of Ashwood, but the familiar ache in her chest was still palpable. Her mother's passing a few months ago had left her with more questions than answers.

As she made her way through the station, Emmanuelle spotted a figure waiting for her by the old oak tree. Her brother, Matthieu, stood tall and quiet, his dark hair mussed as if he'd just rolled out of bed. He flashed her a faint smile, and Emmanuelle felt a flutter in her chest.

The two siblings exchanged hushed words as they made their way to Matthieu's car. The drive through Ashwood was a blur of memories: the bakery where their mother used to buy fresh bread, the park where they'd spent countless afternoons playing tag, the old windmill on the outskirts of town that had become their secret hideaway.

As they pulled up outside their family home, Emmanuelle felt a mix of emotions. The house looked just as it had when she was growing up – weathered and worn, but still radiating a sense of warmth and comfort. Matthieu got out to open the creaky front gate, his eyes locking onto hers.

"I've got someone I want you to meet," he said, his voice low.

Emmanuelle followed him inside, her heart racing with anticipation. The old wooden floorboards creaked beneath their feet as they made their way upstairs to Matthieu's bedroom. A woman sat on the edge of the bed, her long blonde hair cascading down her back like a river of gold.

"Mom," Emmanuelle breathed, her eyes welling up with tears.

Matthieu had found their mother's sister, Colette – a woman who'd been a constant presence in their lives as children. Colette's warm smile enveloped them both as she rose from the bed to open her arms. The three of them stood there for a moment, surrounded by the memories and emotions of their past.

As they sat down together on the creaking couch, Emmanuelle felt a weight lift from her shoulders. She knew that this was just the beginning – uncovering secrets, piecing together fragments of their mother's life, and finding closure. But for now, she was content to simply be with them, surrounded by love and the ghosts of their past.
