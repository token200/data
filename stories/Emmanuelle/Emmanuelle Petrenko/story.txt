Her father, Pierre, a sculptor himself, taught her the techniques of modeling clay and shaping stone. The family's love for art was contagious, and Emmanuelle soon found herself lost in the world of creativity.

As she grew older, Emmanuelle began to hone her skills at the Ã‰cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Her passion for painting led her to focus on abstract expressionism, a style that allowed her to convey emotions and thoughts through vibrant colors and textures.
