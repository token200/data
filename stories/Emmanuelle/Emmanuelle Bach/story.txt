Emmanuelle Bach was an enigmatic figure, known only by her alias "Echo" among the underworld circles. A master thief and forger, she had built a reputation for being untouchable, with skills that rivaled even the most seasoned con artists.

Born to a family of skilled artisans, Emmanuelle had always been fascinated by the art of deception. She began her career as a small-time pickpocket on the streets of Paris, honing her skills and learning to think on her feet. As she grew older, she turned her talents to more sophisticated crimes, using her charm and wit to infiltrate high-society circles.

But Emmanuelle's greatest talent lay in creating forgeries that were virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. She had an uncanny ability to capture the essence of a piece of art or a historical document, rendering it almost flawless. Her most prized possession was a forgery of the Mona Lisa itself, which she had sold to a wealthy collector for a small fortune.

One day, Emmanuelle received a message from a mysterious client who claimed to have information about her long-lost sister, Sophie. The two sisters had been separated at birth, and Emmanuelle had always felt like a part of herself was missing. She agreed to meet with the client in a dingy café on the outskirts of town.

As she sipped her coffee, a woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair walked into the room. "You're Echo," she said, her voice low and husky. "I've been watching you for years."

Emmanuelle's instincts told her to be wary, but there was something about this woman that put her at ease. The woman revealed that Sophie had been a talented artist in her own right, but had disappeared under mysterious circumstances after being accused of stealing a valuable masterpiece.

The two women spent hours talking, and Emmanuelle found herself opening up to the stranger like she never had with anyone before. It was as if they shared a secret language, one that only spoke to those who understood the intricacies of deception and art.

As the night drew to a close, the woman handed Emmanuelle a small package containing a sketchbook filled with Sophie's most famous works. "This is just the beginning," she said, smiling enigmatically. "There's still much to uncover about your sister's fate."

And with that, Emmanuelle Bach, or Echo, had finally found something more valuable than any forgery – the truth about her own past.
