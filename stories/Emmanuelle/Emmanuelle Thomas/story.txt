As the music swelled, Emmanuelle closed her eyes, letting the moment wash over her. She felt free, unencumbered by doubts or fears. This was what she had been born to do – to share her gift with the world, to touch hearts and minds through her art.

The final notes faded away, leaving behind a stunned silence that was eventually shattered by applause. Emmanuelle Thomas smiled, her eyes shining with tears of joy.
