They praised her ability to bring out the best in everyone, even when they were struggling themselves. For once, she smiled brightly, revealing a hint of warmth beneath her reserved exterior.

Despite her newfound appreciation from her peers, Stanisława Keiko remained true to herself. She returned to the office with a quiet confidence, as if to say that she had always been capable all along.
