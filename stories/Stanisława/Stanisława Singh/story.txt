Stanisława Singh was a Polish poet and activist who defied conventions in her lifetime. Born into a conservative family, she was expected to marry young and live a traditional life, but Stanisława had other plans.

As a teenager, Stanisława began writing poetry as a way to express herself and challenge the societal norms that suffocated her. Her words were bold, raw, and unapologetic, tackling topics like feminism, politics, and personal freedom. Despite her family's disapproval, Stanisława shared her work with anyone who would listen, building a small but dedicated following among friends, fellow students, and even some local intellectuals.
