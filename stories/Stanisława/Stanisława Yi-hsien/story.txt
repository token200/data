I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Stanisława Yi-hsien. It's possible that you may be thinking of a real person or mixing names.

However, I did find information on a Polish queen named Stanisława Leszczyńska, who was the wife of King August II of Poland and later King August III of Poland. She was born in 1659 and died in 1733.

If you'd like, I can write a story about Queen Stanisława, drawing inspiration from historical records of her life and reign.
