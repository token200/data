Throughout her career, Stanisława had remained committed to preserving the cultural heritage of her people, often incorporating traditional Polish melodies into her performances. This blend of classical and folk influences had earned her widespread acclaim, as well as numerous awards and accolades from the Polish government and Jewish communities around the globe.
