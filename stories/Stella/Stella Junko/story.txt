Stella Junko had always been fascinated by the abandoned amusement park on the outskirts of town. As a child, she would often sneak away from her chores to catch glimpses of the rickety rollercoaster and faded Ferris wheel. The once-vibrant colors had long since faded, leaving behind a haunting landscape of rust and decay.

As Stella Junko grew older, her curiosity only deepened. She spent countless hours exploring the park, imagining what it must have been like to be a child again, laughing and screaming with joy as the rides whirred to life. The locals avoided the place, whispering tales of curses and misfortune that followed anyone who dared to enter.

But Stella Junko didn't believe in superstitions. She saw the park as a testament to the fleeting nature of happiness – how quickly it could fade like the paint on an old carousel. Her own life had been marked by loss and hardship, her parents passing away when she was just a teenager. Yet, amidst the grief, Stella Junko found solace in the abandoned amusement park.

One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Stella Junko decided to take a closer look at the park's central attraction: a magnificent wooden structure adorned with intricate carvings and glistening glass lights. She approached cautiously, feeling the weight of history upon her shoulders. As she reached out to touch the gleaming surface, a sudden gust of wind swept through, extinguishing all the remaining lights.

The darkness was almost palpable, like a living entity that wrapped itself around Stella Junko's heart. Yet, instead of fear, she felt an overwhelming sense of peace. It was as if the park had finally accepted her – acknowledged the deep connections she'd forged with its crumbling structures and fading memories.

Stella Junko wandered through the shadows, letting the silence envelop her. The wind whispered secrets in her ear, and for a fleeting moment, she swore she heard the faintest sound of laughter – a distant echo of joy that seemed to emanate from the very heart of the park. In that instant, Stella Junko knew she was home.

As the night wore on, Stella Junko vanished into the darkness, leaving behind only the faintest hint of her presence: a single, gleaming button caught in a rusty wheel's mechanism, bearing an inscription that seemed almost like a message from the dead – 'For Stella Junko alone'.
