Stella Naoko was known for her sharp wit and quick tongue, but few people knew about the soft spot she kept hidden beneath her tough exterior. A Tokyo native in her mid-twenties, Stella had grown up on the streets of Shibuya, where she learned to rely only on herself.

As a child, Stella had been a skilled pickpocket, earning enough money to buy whatever she wanted from the small shops that lined the busy streets. But after being caught by the police and forced to work in a local cafe instead, she discovered a new passion â€“ writing.

Every night, Stella would scribble away in her journal, pouring out her thoughts and feelings onto the page. She wrote about her life on the streets, about the people who had hurt her and those who had helped her heal. As she grew older, her stories began to take shape into short stories and poetry, which she shared with anyone who would listen.

One night, a talented young poet named Kaito stumbled upon Stella's work at a local open mic night. Enchanted by her raw talent and vulnerability, Kaito sought out the mysterious writer behind the words that had touched his heart.

Stella was wary of strangers at first, but there was something about Kaito's kind eyes that put her at ease. As they talked long into the night, Stella found herself opening up to this stranger in a way she never thought possible. For the first time in years, she felt like someone truly understood her.

Over the next few months, Stella and Kaito grew closer, bonding over their shared love of words and stories. They spent countless hours writing together, pushing each other to be better writers and people. As their friendship blossomed, Stella began to realize that there was more to life than just surviving on the streets.

One day, as they sat in a quiet park watching the sunset, Kaito turned to Stella and asked if she would join him for a writing retreat in the mountains. With a mix of excitement and trepidation, Stella agreed. As they drove away from Tokyo, the city gave way to rolling hills and towering trees, and Stella felt a sense of peace wash over her.

For the first time in years, she knew that she was not alone.
