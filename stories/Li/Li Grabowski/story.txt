Li Grabowski sat at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of unpaid bills in front of him. As the owner of Grabowski's Garbage Disposal Services, he had always prided himself on being a master of disposal. But lately, business had been slow.

Just as Li was about to give up hope, the phone rang. It was his best friend and confidant, Steve. "Hey, buddy," Steve said, his voice muffled by the sound of laughter from the background. "I got you a gig."

Li's ears perked up. "What is it?" he asked, trying to contain his excitement.

"I know the guy who owns the Krusty Krab," Steve said, pausing for dramatic effect. "He needs someone to dispose of some... unusual trash. You in?"

Li didn't need to think twice. He was in. The next day, Li arrived at the Krusty Krab, armed with his trusty garbage disposal truck and a healthy dose of skepticism. Mr. Krabs greeted him warmly, leading him to a small dumpster in the back alley.

"What's in here?" Li asked, eyeing the dumpster suspiciously.

Mr. Krabs leaned in close, a mischievous glint in his eye. "Let's just say it's some... exotic waste."

Li hesitated for a moment before opening the lid. What he saw made him do a double take. There were jellyfish, seaweed-covered anchors, and what looked suspiciously like a plastic whale skeleton.

Just as Li was about to gag, Mr. Krabs handed him a briefcase full of cash. "Take care of it for me," he said with a grin. "And make sure it disappears into thin air."

Li's eyes widened in understanding. This wasn't just any trash disposal job. It was a magic trick.

He spent the rest of the day carefully removing each item, storing them away in a hidden compartment in his truck. As he finished up, Li couldn't help but feel a sense of pride. He had pulled off the impossible.

As he drove back to his shop, Li grinned at Steve over the phone. "You know, I think this is going to be my best year yet."

Steve chuckled on the other end of the line. "I told you, buddy. You're the king of disposal."
