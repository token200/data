Li Volkov, the infamous Russian mobster and ally of Walter White, sat in his dimly lit office, sipping on a glass of fine scotch. His piercing eyes scanned the room, taking in every detail as he pondered his next move.

It had been several months since his association with Walter White, also known as Heisenberg, had reached its peak. The money and power Li had gained from their partnership were unmatched, but at what cost? Li knew that if word got out about his involvement with the infamous meth kingpin, it would be a death sentence.

Just then, his phone rang, shrill in the quiet room. Li's eyes narrowed as he picked up the receiver. "Da?" he growled, expecting to hear one of his loyal associates.

Instead, a nervous voice spoke on the other end. "Li, sir, I have some bad news. There's been a... a situation with Hank Schrader. He's onto us."

Li's expression remained impassive, but inside, he was seething. Hank Schrader, the DEA agent who had been closing in on Heisenberg's operation for months, had finally gotten close to uncovering their web of deceit.

Without hesitation, Li sprang into action, dispatching his top enforcer to take care of Hank once and for all. The thought of losing a valuable connection to Heisenberg sent a chill down his spine, but he refused to back down.

As the night wore on, Li's resolve hardened like steel. This was war now. Anybody who got in his way would be dealt with swiftly and mercilessly. His reputation as a ruthless crime lord was well-deserved, after all.

But for a moment, there was a glimmer of doubt. What had he gotten himself into by backing Heisenberg? The profits were astronomical, but at what cost to his own soul?

Li snorted the scotch from his glass, dispelling the doubts. This was his world now, and he would stop at nothing to protect it.

With a newfound sense of determination, Li hung up the phone and picked up his cigar box. He lit a cigar, taking a long drag as the smoke curled around him like a shroud.

"War is coming," he whispered to himself. "And I'll be ready."
