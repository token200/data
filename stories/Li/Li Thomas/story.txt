Li Thomas stood at the edge of the bustling city square, her eyes scanning the crowds with a mix of curiosity and wariness. A former street artist turned unlikely mercenary, she had found herself drawn to this seedy underworld by chance and necessity.

It was on one such night that she'd stumbled upon an underground art collective hidden beneath the city's labyrinthine tunnels. The air was thick with paint fumes and desperation as a group of misfit artists conjured up rebellious masterpieces on crumbling walls. Entranced, Li had watched them at work, her fingers itching to join in.

Years had passed since then – years spent honing her skills as an illustrator, sketching portraits for the city's clandestine markets. Her art was raw and expressive, drawing power from the city's underworld. And now, after a job gone sour, Li found herself taking on odd mercenary work to make ends meet.

She spotted her contact – a scrappy young man named Jax with an ear for rumors – hovering at the edge of the square. Their conversation was hushed but urgent as he handed over a cryptic message scrawled on a crumpled piece of paper: 'Eclipse Package.'

Li's instincts told her this job would be different, perhaps even deadly. Eclipse Package was a highly sought-after artifact, said to hold secrets from Li's troubled past. As she accepted the task, a shiver coursed down her spine.

For hours, she hunted through hidden corners of the city, following whispers and shadows to unearth a seemingly innocuous storage unit. Inside, nestled between stolen luggage and discarded trinkets, lay a single wooden box bearing an intricate etching.

Opening it released a sweet scent – something like ozone and smoke – as Li's eyes widened upon uncovering a series of yellowed photographs. They depicted her long-forgotten parents, standing proudly in front of the city's ancient art district. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes; she had thought these lost memories were forever locked away.

The artifact was gone by dawn, spirited into an abandoned warehouse on the city's outskirts. Jax met her there, eyes flicking nervously between his crew and Li.

As they parted ways, he handed over a small package: a paint-dusted brush with a single stroke – hers. It contained her new signature: 'L.T.'
