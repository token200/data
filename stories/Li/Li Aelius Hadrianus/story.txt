In the sweltering heat of ancient Rome, a young slave named Li Aelius Hadrianus toiled away in the vast gardens of his wealthy owner, Marcus Tullius. With skin as dark as polished ebony and eyes that sparkled like the stars on a clear night, Li Aelius stood out among the other slaves who labored tirelessly under the scorching sun.

As he tended to the blooming flowers and vines, Li Aelius's thoughts often wandered back to his humble beginnings. Born into slavery in the distant lands of Parthia, he had been sold to Marcus Tullius as a child, along with his younger sister, Aurelia. Despite the cruel treatment he endured, Li Aelius had proven himself to be a diligent and resourceful worker, earning the respect of even the most hardened slave masters.

One day, as Li Aelius was busy pruning the rose bushes, Marcus Tullius summoned him to the villa's grand courtyard. The old man, his face weathered from years of exposure to the sun, handed Li Aelius a small pouch containing a few coins and a folded piece of parchment. "I have received an offer for you, Li Aelius," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "The centurion of the Legio X Fretrensium requires a skilled gardener to tend to their fortress gardens in Germania. If you accept this task, I will set you free and provide you with enough coin to start your own life."

Li Aelius's heart swelled with excitement as he accepted the offer. He had always dreamed of freedom, and now it seemed within his grasp. With a newfound sense of purpose, Li Aelius bid farewell to Marcus Tullius and set off on the long journey to Germania.

As he traveled north, Li Aelius marveled at the breathtaking beauty of the Rhine River and the rolling hills of the Roman province. Finally, after many days of travel, he arrived at the fortress gardens, where he was greeted by the centurion himself. With a nod of approval, the centurion assigned Li Aelius to his new duties, and the young slave-turned-gardener set about tending to the gardens with renewed enthusiasm.

Though the road ahead would undoubtedly be fraught with challenges, Li Aelius knew that he had made the right decision in leaving behind the life of a slave. He was now free to forge his own path, as Li Aelius Hadrianus, a name that would soon become synonymous with bravery and skill in the gardens of Germania.
