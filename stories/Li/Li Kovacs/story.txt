In the bustling streets of New Eden, Detective Li Kovacs navigated through the crowds with a practiced air of detachment. Her sharp eyes scanned the faces passing by, searching for any sign of trouble. As the chief forensic pathologist and lead investigator on the city's most gruesome crimes, she had seen it all.

Li Kovacs, whose full name was Li Xiaoming Kovacs, had always been driven by a sense of justice. Growing up in the sprawling metropolis, she had witnessed firsthand the harsh realities of poverty and inequality that led many to desperation. Her own family's struggles had fueled her determination to make a difference.

As she walked, her thoughts turned to the latest case: the brutal murder of a young woman whose body had been found in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. The killer had left no fingerprints, no DNA, and no leads. It was as if he had vanished into thin air.

Li Kovacs stopped at a street corner, her eyes locking onto a figure watching her from across the way. He was tall, with piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into her soul. For a moment, they simply stared at each other, the city noise fading into the background.

Without thinking, Li Kovacs turned and walked in the opposite direction. She had no intention of being intimidated by this stranger, who was likely just another faceless passerby in New Eden's sea of humanity. Still, she couldn't shake off the feeling that he was watching her, waiting for her to let her guard down.

As she disappeared into the crowd, Li Kovacs' thoughts turned back to the case at hand. She needed to focus on the evidence, not some enigmatic stranger who seemed to be lurking in the shadows. With a deep breath, she squared her shoulders and continued on her way, ready to face whatever lay ahead in pursuit of justice.

For Li Xiaoming Kovacs, there was no room for distractions. The people of New Eden deserved better than to be left in the dark, and it was up to her to shine a light into their darkest corners.
