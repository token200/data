Li Walker, a former soldier turned private investigator, sat at his desk, sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee. It had been two years since he left the military, and he thought he'd left his troubles behind. But old habits die hard, and the memories still lingered.

The knock at the door broke the silence. Li looked up to see a young woman, no more than twenty-five, standing in the doorway with a look of desperation etched on her face.

"Please, can I help you?" Li asked, setting his cup aside.

"My name is Emily," she said, her voice shaking. "I need your help. My sister went missing two weeks ago, and the police won't do anything about it."

Li raised an eyebrow. He'd dealt with cases like this before – rich families, influential connections, and a whole lot of nothing getting done.

"What makes you think I can help?" he asked, leaning back in his chair.

"Your reputation precedes you," Emily said, her eyes locked on Li's. "You were part of the special forces. I've heard stories about your...abilities."

Li sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. He wasn't proud of what he'd done in the military – the missions that had left him with scars, both physical and emotional.

"Tell me more about your sister," Li said, pulling out a notebook and pen.

Emily took a deep breath, her words spilling out like a dam breaking. "She was working as a freelance journalist, investigating some shady dealings in the city. The police say she was just missing, but I know she wouldn't have just vanished without a fight."

Li's gut told him something was off. This case didn't feel like your average missing person's case.

"I'll take the case," he said finally, tucking the pen into his pocket. "But you need to understand – this won't be easy. I'll be digging deep, and we may not find out what happened to your sister."

Emily nodded, a glimmer of hope in her eyes. Li knew that look all too well.

"Let's get started," he said, standing up from his chair. "We've got work to do."

As they stepped into the rainy night, Li couldn't shake off the feeling that this case was going to be a lot more than just another missing person's case. He had a gut feeling that Emily's sister was still out there – and that he was running out of time.
