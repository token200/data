Nurbek Rothbauer stepped out of his worn leather jacket, letting the crisp morning air fill his lungs as he surveyed the small café. It was a fixture in the city's underworld, a place where connections were made and secrets kept. He had spent countless nights within its walls, nursing whiskey and swapping stories with the regulars.

A former soldier, Nurbek had seen his share of battles. The scars on his face told the tale of a man who had faced down danger and come out on top. But it was the quiet moments, like this one, that allowed him to reflect on the choices he'd made.

As he waited for his coffee, a familiar figure slid onto the stool beside him. It was Sofia, a woman with piercing green eyes and a mischievous grin. She had been a thorn in Nurbek's side more than once, but there was something about her that drew him in.

"What brings you here today?" Nurbek asked, his voice low and even.

Sofia leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. "I have a job for you, Nurbek. One that requires your particular set of skills."

Nurbek raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. "What's the target?"

Sofia pulled out a small folder from her bag, releasing a waft of smoke as she opened it. The photographs inside showed a young woman, her eyes blackened and her skin bruised.

"This is Elena," Sofia said, her voice cold. "A high-stakes player in the city's underworld. She's been making waves, threatening to disrupt the balance."

Nurbek's expression turned grim. He knew what it meant to cross people like Elena – they didn't tolerate disobedience for long. But he also sensed a deeper game at play here.

"What's the payoff?" he asked, his eyes scanning the café as he waited for Sofia's answer.

Sofia smiled, a glint of steel in her gaze. "Enough to make it worth your while, Nurbek."

Nurbek took a sip of his coffee, his mind already racing with possibilities. He knew that taking on Elena would be a risk, but one thing was certain – this wasn't a job for the faint of heart.

With a slow nod, he extended his hand to Sofia. "I'm in."
