Nurbek Omar trudged through the dusty streets of Mogadishu, his eyes scanning the crowded market stalls for any sign of work. A young Somali man in his early twenties, Nurbek had grown up on the streets, surviving by his wits and whatever opportunities came his way.

As a child, Nurbek had watched as his family's small food cart was destroyed by rival vendors and government agents alike. His parents, both killed in the violence, had left him to fend for himself from a young age. He had learned quickly to adapt, taking on odd jobs and dodging the authorities to stay one step ahead.

But despite the hardships, Nurbek had a fierce determination burning within him. He wanted out of this life, to make something better for himself and his community. And so, he had begun to take small steps towards education, sneaking into abandoned classrooms at night to study and learn whatever he could.

As he walked, Nurbek spotted a poster plastered on the side of a building: "Engineer Wanted". He quickened his pace, his heart racing with excitement. Could this be his ticket out? He tore off a corner of the poster and stuffed it into his pocket, tucking away any contact information that might lead to an opportunity.

He made his way to the designated meeting spot - a small caf√© on the outskirts of town - where he had arranged to meet the recruiter. As he entered, Nurbek spotted a group of men huddled around a laptop, their eyes scanning the screen with varying degrees of interest.

One of them looked up, noticing Nurbek's arrival. "Ah, you must be Omar," he said, extending a hand. "I'm Ammar. I've been looking for someone with your skills - engineering experience, languages... what do you say?"

Nurbek's mind was racing. Could this really be it? The chance to leave his life on the streets behind and start anew? He smiled, trying to appear confident. "When do we start?"
