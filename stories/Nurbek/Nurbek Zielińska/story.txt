Nurbek Zielińska was a 25-year-old Polish photographer who had always been fascinated by the beauty of nature. Growing up in the Tatra Mountains, she spent most of her childhood exploring the forests and meadows with her grandfather, a skilled botanist.

As she grew older, Nurbek's love for photography only deepened. She began to capture the intricate details of the natural world through her lens, from the delicate petals of wildflowers to the majestic peaks of the mountains. Her passion earned her a scholarship to study photography in Krakow, where she honed her skills and developed a unique style that blended traditional techniques with modern technology.

After completing her studies, Nurbek set out on a journey to document the lesser-known corners of Poland. She spent months traveling through the Carpathian Mountains, capturing the stunning landscapes and meeting the people who called them home. Her photographs not only showcased the beauty of these regions but also told the stories of the communities that lived there.

One day, while shooting in a remote village in the High Tatras, Nurbek met a local shepherd named Józef. He was kind and gentle, with a warm smile that put her at ease. As they talked, Nurbek learned about Józef's life as a shepherd, his love for the land and its creatures, and his struggles to preserve traditional ways of living in a rapidly changing world.

Inspired by their conversation, Nurbek began to take photographs of Józef's daily routine – from milking cows to tending to the flock. She captured the textures of his worn leather boots, the intricate patterns on his sheepskin coat, and the way the sunlight danced across his weathered face. Her pictures not only documented Józef's life but also told a story of resilience and tradition in the face of modernity.

As Nurbek prepared to leave the village, Józef handed her a small package – a bundle of dried wildflowers he had gathered from the mountains. "For your book," he said with a smile. "Tell their story, too." From that moment on, Nurbek knew that she had found not only her passion but also her purpose as a photographer: to share the beauty and stories of the world around us.
