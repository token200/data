I couldn't find any information on a person named Nurbek Sienkiewicz. It's possible that this person is fictional or not a public figure.

However, I did find information on a Polish author named Henryk Sienkiewicz. If you would like, I can write a story about him instead.

Here's a 400-word story about the fictional character Nurbek Sienkiewicz:

Nurbek Sienkiewicz was a man of mystery and intrigue. He lived in the shadows of Warsaw's Old Town, where the cobblestone streets whispered secrets to those who dared to listen. By day, he worked as a humble baker, kneading dough into perfectly risen loaves that wafted sweet aromas through the city.

But by night, Nurbek donned a different cloak. He was a master thief, using his exceptional skills to pilfer rare and valuable artifacts from the city's wealthy elite. His targets were always the most prized possessions of Warsaw's aristocracy, and he never failed to leave behind a small token – a tiny note with a single word etched into its surface.

The word was always "Szarlotka". It was said that whenever Nurbek stole an artifact, he left it hidden in a place where only the most skilled thief could find it. And so, the legend of Nurbek Sienkiewicz spread throughout the city, striking fear and awe into the hearts of all who heard his name.

One fateful night, the Polish royal family commissioned a priceless diamond necklace to be crafted by the finest artisans in Europe. Unbeknownst to them, Nurbek had been watching their every move, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

With the full moon hanging low over Warsaw's rooftops, Nurbek slipped into the palace unnoticed, his eyes scanning the chamber where the necklace lay displayed on a velvet pedestal. With swift and silent precision, he snatched the gemstone and vanished into the night, leaving behind only the small note with the single word "Szarlotka".

The next morning, the royal family awoke to find their prized possession gone, and a mysterious message scrawled on the walls – "Nurbek Sienkiewicz was here". The legend of the thief grew, and Nurbek continued to weave his web of mystery and intrigue throughout Warsaw's streets.
