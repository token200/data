Determined to impress him, Nurbek spent the morning carefully measuring out the finest Szechuan peppers and freshest cilantro.

As Chef Thompson arrived at her shop, Nurbek Charron greeted him with a warm smile and a perfectly arranged spice rack. "Welcome, chef!" she exclaimed. "I have just the thing for you." With a flourish, she revealed a custom blend of spices that had been months in the making. And to her delight, Chef Thompson was thoroughly impressed.
