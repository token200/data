Nurbek Schafer was a name whispered among the patrons of the old tavern in Ashwood. A mysterious figure with an air of quiet confidence, few knew much about the enigmatic bartender. His piercing green eyes seemed to see right through you, as if sizing up your intentions before deciding whether to pour you a drink or turn you away.

As the sun set over the rolling hills outside, Nurbek Schafer polished a mug with a white apron, his hands moving with a practiced ease that belied the complexity of emotions beneath. He had been tending bar for nigh on ten years, watching as the town's residents came and went, each with their own stories to tell.

Tonight was no exception. A group of rowdy travelers stumbled in, laughing and clinking mugs together. Nurbek Schafer raised an eyebrow, his expression a mask of politeness, but his eyes flashing with a hint of wariness. He knew better than to get too close to strangers who drank too much.

As the night wore on, a lone figure slipped into the tavern, their face shrouded in shadows. Nurbek Schafer's instincts prickled; he'd seen that face before, though he couldn't quite place it. The air seemed to vibrate with tension as the newcomer made their way to the bar.

"I'll have what they're having," the figure said, their voice low and husky.

Nurbek Schafer poured them a drink, his movements economical and precise. "What's your name?" he asked, his tone neutral.

The stranger hesitated, before responding with a sly smile. "Just call me...Kaelin."

As Nurbek Schafer handed Kaelin their drink, he felt a jolt of recognition, like a door had creaked open in his mind. It was then that he recalled the whispers of a mysterious figure known only as Kaelin, who'd been seen in these very parts several years prior.

Nurbek Schafer's eyes locked onto Kaelin's, a spark of curiosity igniting within him. He poured himself a drink, taking a sip as he watched Kaelin disappear into the night, leaving behind only the faintest whisper of their presence.
