Born in Paris, France, she grew up surrounded by the city's rich history and vibrant culture. From a young age, Amaia knew that she wanted to make a name for herself in the world of journalism.

After completing her degree in journalism from the Sorbonne, Amaia landed an internship at a prominent news agency in Paris. She worked tirelessly, honing her skills and building relationships with sources within the industry. Her big break came when she was assigned to cover a high-profile corruption scandal involving several high-ranking officials in the French government.

Amaia's investigative reporting led her down a rabbit hole of deceit and corruption that went all the way to the top. She spent countless hours pouring over documents, conducting interviews, and gathering evidence, all while keeping her sources safe from retaliation.

As Amaia dug deeper, she began to receive threatening messages and warnings from unknown individuals. Despite the risks, she refused to back down. Her determination and tenacity earned her a reputation as one of the most fearless and respected journalists in France.

One fateful evening, Amaia received a call from an anonymous source who revealed that they had evidence of the scandal's mastermind. The source instructed her to meet at a secluded caf√© on the outskirts of Paris. Amaia arrived alone, her heart racing with anticipation.

As she waited for the source to arrive, Amaia noticed a figure lurking in the shadows. Suddenly, the figure stepped forward, revealing none other than Marcel Desailly, the corrupt official at the center of the scandal. Amaia's sources had warned her that Desailly was a ruthless man who would stop at nothing to protect his empire.

Amaia stood tall, her eyes locked on Desailly as she confronted him about his involvement in the corruption scandal. The scene ended abruptly when Desailly lunged at her with a knife. Amaia's quick reflexes saved her life, but not before she had gathered enough evidence to bring down Desailly and several other high-ranking officials.

She became known as the "Garden of Paris" journalist, a nickname that reflected her tireless pursuit of truth and justice in the city where she grew up.
