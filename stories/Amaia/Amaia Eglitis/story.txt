Amaia Eglitis stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the salty sea air filling her lungs as she gazed out at the rugged coastline. She had always felt a deep connection to this small town in Lithuania, where her ancestors had settled centuries ago.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Amaia couldn't help but think about the letter she had received just days before. It was from an old friend, inviting her to return for her grandmother's 80th birthday celebration. Her grandmother, Zita, had been like a second mother to Amaia growing up – warm, wise, and full of stories about their family's history.

Amaia had always felt a sense of restlessness, a feeling that she didn't quite fit in anywhere. But when she returned to her childhood home, she felt like a piece of herself had finally found its place. She spent the afternoon helping Zita prepare for the celebration, listening as the older woman told tales of Amaia's great-grandmother, a fierce and determined woman who had fought for the rights of Lithuanian women during the war.

As the sun began to set, Amaia helped Zita serve traditional Lithuanian dishes to their guests – pierogies, sausage, and borscht. The atmosphere was lively and warm, filled with laughter and conversation that flowed as easily as the vodka. Amaia felt a sense of belonging she had never experienced before, like she was home at last.

As the night wore on, Zita called everyone together to sing traditional Lithuanian songs. Amaia joined in, her voice blending with the others as they sang about love, loss, and resilience. It was a moment of pure joy, one that Amaia would carry with her for the rest of her life. And as she looked at Zita, her eyes shining with happiness, she knew that she had found a piece of herself in this small town, and in the women who had come before her.
