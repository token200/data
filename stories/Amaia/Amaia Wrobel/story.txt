The phone on her desk rang, breaking the silence. It was an anonymous source, offering information on a lead Amaia Wrobel hadn't considered before. She listened intently, her mind racing with possibilities as she jotted down notes and ideas. This could be it - this could be the break she needed to crack the case.

Amaia's eyes narrowed, her focus sharpened. She was closer than ever to finding Sofia. With a newfound sense of purpose, Amaia Wrobel leaned forward, ready to take on whatever lay ahead. She would not rest until she had brought justice to her sister and shed light on the dark secrets that had taken Sofia from her.
