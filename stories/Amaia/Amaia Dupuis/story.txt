Amaia Dupuis stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of saltwater and diesel fuel filling her lungs. She had spent countless summers on this beach town's railroad stop, watching the world go by from the vantage point of the tracks.

As she walked towards the faded sign that read "Tinville", the sound of seagulls grew louder, and Amaia couldn't help but smile. This was where her family had once settled, decades ago, seeking a simpler life. Her father, a sailor, had made a name for himself as one of Tinville's most reliable fishing guides. But that had been a lifetime ago.

Now, Amaia returned to the town every summer, working at her family's old bait shop and listening to the tales of the locals. She was a magnet for curious glances and whispered stories, ever since the local newspaper, The Coastal Courier, published an expos√© on her father's shady business dealings all those years ago.

Amaia's parents had long since disappeared from town, their whereabouts known only to a select few. Her mother's mysterious illness had been blamed on the exposure to toxic waste at the local shipyard, and Amaia couldn't shake the feeling that her family's dark past still lingered over Tinville like a shadow.

As she stepped into the dimly lit bait shop, its smell was redolent of old tackle and seaweed. Amaia felt a wave of nostalgia wash over her - she had spent countless hours as a child, watching schools of fish swim beneath the water's surface through the skylight above the counter.

A customer, an elderly fisherman, looked up from his rod and smiled at Amaia. "She's back," he said to no one in particular, before nodding in her direction.

The rest of the day passed slowly, with Amaia helping the locals fix broken nets and swapping stories for hours on end. But as the sun began to set over Tinville, casting a golden glow over the sleepy town, Amaia felt an itch she couldn't scratch - an urge to uncover the truth about her family's past and lay it to rest.

The question hung in the air like the scent of saltwater and diesel: what secrets had her family taken with them all those years ago? And would Amaia ever be able to face the truth, or was some part of Tinville forever lost at sea?
