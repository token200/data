Despite the backlash, Amaia stood firm, knowing that she had done nothing but report the facts. Her article sparked a national conversation about corruption and accountability, and Amaia became an overnight sensation in Latvian journalism. She was hailed as a hero by many, but also faced criticism from those who felt she had crossed a line.

As she looked out over the city of Riga, she knew that this was just the beginning of her journey – one that would take her to the highest echelons of power and back again.
