Amaia Hill stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar streets of her hometown. The small town was nestled in the rolling hills of rural Scotland, where Amaia had grown up playing in the heather and exploring the secrets of the glens.

As she walked through the village, Amaia couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her. She had left home many years ago to pursue a career in music, traveling the world and performing with various bands. But despite all the excitement and adventure, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing.

Amaia's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of laughter carrying from the nearby pub. She smiled to herself as she remembered the countless nights she had spent singing and playing guitar on the stage of this very pub. It was where she had first started to make a name for herself, and where many of her closest friends still gathered to share stories and jokes.

As she pushed open the door and stepped inside, Amaia's eyes scanned the room until they landed on a familiar figure sitting at the bar. It was her old friend, Angus, his bushy eyebrows and twinkling eyes still radiating warmth and kindness. The two of them spent hours talking about everything from music to their shared love of hiking in the Cairngorms.

Over a pint of heavy, Amaia filled Angus in on her latest projects – a new album she was working on, one that would blend traditional Scottish folk with modern influences. Angus listened intently, his face breaking into a wide grin as he exclaimed over the ideas and offered words of encouragement.

As the night wore on and the pub grew quieter, Amaia knew it was time to start thinking about leaving again. She had commitments in London for an upcoming gig, and she needed to get back to her flat and prepare for the show. As she turned to leave, Angus caught up with her at the door and pressed a small package into her hand.

"What's that?" Amaia asked, curiosity piqued.

"A wee surprise," Angus replied, his eyes twinkling. "I hope you'll wear it on stage tonight."

Amaia smiled as she tucked the package under her arm – whatever was inside, she knew she would treasure it forever.
