Amaia Perin stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the smell of saltwater and diesel fuel filling her lungs. She had been away from the coast for far too long, and it was as if the familiar rhythms of the sea were calling to her once more.

As she made her way through the crowded station, Amaia's eyes scanned the throngs of people rushing to catch their trains or buses. Few noticed the petite, raven-haired woman with piercing green eyes, but those who did couldn't help but be drawn to her intensity.

Amaia had always been a wanderer at heart, never quite finding her place in the world. After high school, she'd set off on a whim, traveling from country to country, city to city, taking on odd jobs and learning new skills along the way. She'd worked as a waitress, a bartender, even a hotel maid, but no job seemed to stick.

As she emerged onto the bustling streets of San Sebasti√°n, Amaia felt the familiar thrill of uncertainty. What would this new place bring? Would she find work, or perhaps something more?

She made her way to the old apartment she'd rented through an agency online, paying a meager sum for a small room in a crumbling beachside complex. The landlord, a gruff but kind-eyed man named Carlos, handed her a key and pointed her towards the stairs.

As Amaia climbed, the scent of saltwater gave way to the acrid tang of exhaust fumes and cooking oil. She settled onto the worn sofa, surrounded by dusty trinkets and faded photographs, and let out a deep breath.

For a moment, she just sat there, listening to the muffled sounds of the city outside her window: the wail of seagulls, the rumble of engines, the hum of conversation. It was as if the world had slowed down, revealing itself in all its complexity and beauty.

And in that moment, Amaia knew she was home.
