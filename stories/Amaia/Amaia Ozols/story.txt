Amaia Ozols stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the familiar landscape of Riga's Old Town. It had been ten years since she'd last set foot in this city, and yet the memories still lingered like the scent of old books from the nearby university library.

As a young woman, Amaia had spent countless hours lost in the pages of those same tomes, devouring stories of history and mythology that seemed to come alive within her. Her parents, both academics themselves, had encouraged her love of learning, but it was her own experiences as a child – exploring the cobblestone streets, listening to the whispers of the city's secrets – that had shaped her into the person she was today.

Now, at twenty-five, Amaia worked as a museum curator in Riga, tasked with preserving the very same stories and legends that had captivated her as a girl. Her days were filled with dusting artifacts, cataloging exhibits, and sharing tales of the city's past to visitors from around the world.

But despite the comforts of routine, Amaia couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. She'd always been drawn to the unknown, the unseen forces that shaped the world beyond the pages of a book. And so, when an unusual artifact had appeared in her care – a mysterious, hand-carved stone with strange symbols etched into its surface – she'd felt an inexplicable pull.

The stone, now safely stored away in a specially designed case, seemed to be calling to her still. Amaia spent every spare moment studying it, attempting to decipher the language and meaning behind those enigmatic markings. And yet, the more she learned, the more questions she had.

As she walked through the city's winding streets, Amaia felt the presence of Riga's ghosts – the whispers of the past echoing through her mind like a chorus of forgotten tales. She knew that she was not alone in her quest for knowledge; there were others out there, seekers of secrets and truths just as driven as herself.

The stone had awakened something within her, a sense of restlessness that threatened to upend her carefully ordered life. But Amaia Ozols was no stranger to the thrill of the unknown. With each step, she felt the pull of adventure drawing her closer – towards hidden chambers, ancient myths, and the secrets that lay just beyond the edge of town.
