Amaia Novák stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small town of Gáborje. She had been away for so long, chasing dreams in the city, that she barely recognized the place where it all began. As she made her way through the quiet streets, the familiar sounds and smells brought a mix of emotions to the surface.

Amaia Novák's thoughts drifted back to her childhood, spent playing in these very streets with her abuela by her side. She remembered the countless hours they spent exploring the surrounding hills, collecting wildflowers, and listening to stories of their ancestors. Those were the days before she left, when life was simple and full of promise.

Now, as a young adult, Amaia Novák had returned to Gáborje with a heavy heart. Her abuela had passed away, leaving her with more questions than answers about their family's past. The old house on the hill, where she spent countless summers with her abuela, now stood empty and still.

Amaia Novák took a deep breath, steeling herself for what lay ahead. She had always known that returning to this small town would be difficult, but she couldn't shake the feeling that it was time to confront the truth about her family's history. As she walked up the hill, the wind carried the faint scent of lavender, a fragrance that reminded her of countless afternoons spent with her abuela.

She pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside, her eyes adjusting to the dim light within. The house was as she remembered it – the same old wooden furniture, the same faded wallpaper, and the same sense of nostalgia hanging heavy in the air. Amaia Novák closed her eyes, taking a moment to let the memories wash over her.

For the first time since leaving Gáborje, she felt a sense of peace settle within her. It was as if she had finally come home – not just physically, but emotionally as well. As she walked through the empty rooms, Amaia Novák knew that this was where she belonged.
