Amaia Xia stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the bustling streets of Tokyo. The neon lights of the city's skyscrapers reflected off her sleek black leather jacket, and her piercing green eyes scanned the crowded sidewalks with a mix of curiosity and caution.

As a former assassin, Amaia had grown accustomed to living on the edge. She had left her past life behind years ago, but the scars still lingered. Her dark hair was tied back in a tight ponytail, and a silver earring in the shape of a snake dangled from her left earlobe.

Amaia's phone buzzed in her pocket, breaking the silence. She pulled it out and answered, her voice low and husky as she spoke to an unknown sender. "I'm here," she said, eyes darting around the crowded street.

The conversation was brief, but Amaia's instincts told her that something was off. She tucked the phone away and began to walk through the city streets, weaving past pedestrians and cars with a practiced ease.

As she turned a corner, Amaia spotted a small tattoo parlor tucked away on a side street. The sign above the door read "Raven's Wings" in elegant, cursive script. Her heart quickened â€“ this was where she was supposed to meet someone tonight.

Amaia pushed open the door and stepped inside, her eyes adjusting to the warm glow of lanterns and the scent of smoke from burning incense. Behind the counter stood a striking woman with skin like polished obsidian and hair as white as snow. The tattoo artist smiled at Amaia, offering a nod of recognition.

Amaia slid onto the couch beside the woman, her gaze locked on the intricate tattoos that adorned her arms and shoulders. "You know I'm not here to ask for a job," she said, voice steady despite the butterflies in her stomach.

The tattoo artist chuckled, holding up a small mirror to show Amaia a new design being inked onto another customer's arm. "We both know that," she replied, her eyes glinting with amusement. "But I have information, Amaia Xia. Information about your past...and the people who are still looking for you."

Amaia's grip on the couch cushion tightened as the woman's words sent a shiver down her spine. She had thought she'd left all that behind, but it seemed that fate had other plans. With a steady gaze, Amaia asked the question: "What do you know?"
