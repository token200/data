Amaia Khan sat alone in her small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and fading photographs. The dim light from the single lamp cast long shadows across the walls, echoing the darkness that had been growing inside her for weeks.

She stared blankly at the newspaper in front of her, the headline about the latest protest against the government's new policies blurring together with the rest of the text. Amaia's eyes were numb to it all – the injustice, the corruption, the endless struggle. She felt like a tiny cog in a machine that was crushing her.

Just as she was about to give up, there was a knock at the door. It was an old friend from school, Zain. He had always been the optimistic one, the one who saw the good in everything, even when it seemed lost. Amaia hadn't seen him in months, and his arrival was like a breath of fresh air.

"Hey, Amaia, I heard you were struggling," he said, as if reading her thoughts. "What's going on?"

Amaia shrugged, not wanting to burden Zain with her problems. But he just sat down next to her, not saying a word. He listened as she poured out her frustrations, her fears, and her doubts.

When she finally stopped talking, Zain stood up and walked over to the window. "You know what I think?" he said, turning back to her. "I think you're the most powerful person in this room."

Amaia raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean?"

"I mean that we all have the power to choose how we respond to these situations," Zain said. "We can let the system break us, or we can fight against it. You don't have to be a politician or a revolutionary – just one person who chooses to make a difference."

Amaia felt a spark of hope ignite within her. She looked at Zain, and for the first time in weeks, she saw a glimmer of light in the darkness.

"Thanks, Zain," she said softly. "You always know how to make me see things differently."

Zain smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "That's what friends are for, Amaia. Now, let's do something about this government – together."
