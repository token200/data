Beatriz Novak stepped into the crowded cafe, scanning the room for her friend, Sofia. The sounds of laughter and clinking cups filled the air as she made her way to the table where Sofia was already seated.

"Hey, Bey!" Sofia exclaimed, using the nickname only a few people dared to use. "I'm so glad you're here."

Beatriz smiled, taking a seat across from Sofia. "I wouldn't have missed it for the world," she replied, unwrapping her scarf and settling into her chair.

The two friends had been inseparable since college, sharing late-night conversations about life, love, and everything in between. Now, as they entered their thirties, they found themselves at a crossroads. Sofia was navigating the dating scene, while Beatriz focused on her career as a writer.

As they sipped their coffee, Sofia poured out her heart, sharing stories of her latest encounters with potential suitors. Beatriz listened attentively, offering words of wisdom and support whenever needed.

"I'm just so tired of being single," Sofia lamented, tossing back her hair in frustration. "I feel like I'm the only one still playing by the rules."

Beatriz reached out, placing a reassuring hand on Sofia's arm. "You're not alone, Bey," she said softly. "We'll get through this together."

Their friendship had been tested and proven time and again over the years. They knew each other's quirks, likes, and dislikes inside out. Beatriz, with her quick wit and sharp tongue, often provided a much-needed counterbalance to Sofia's more dramatic nature.

As they chatted on, their conversation meandered through topics both light-hearted and serious. It was this kind of connection that made their friendship so strong â€“ a bond forged in the fires of shared laughter, tears, and late-night conversations under the stars.

With a newfound sense of determination, Sofia turned to Beatriz, a glint in her eye. "You know, Bey, I think it's time I start focusing on myself again."
