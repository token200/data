Beatriz Fernández González was known to her friends as "La Vipera" - The Viper. A nickname earned from her sharp wit and tongue that could strike fear into the hearts of those who underestimated her.

As a young woman, Beatriz had grown up in the streets of Madrid, fighting for every scrap of food and survival. She learned early on to rely on her wits and cunning to get by, and her reputation as a fierce and determined individual spread quickly through the city's underworld.

Despite her tough exterior, Beatriz had a soft spot for those in need. She used her skills to help those less fortunate than herself, whether it was taking down corrupt business owners or protecting vulnerable women from exploitation.

One day, Beatriz received a message from an old acquaintance who had gotten himself into trouble with the wrong people. He begged Beatriz to meet him at a local bar and offered her a substantial sum of money if she would take care of his problem for him.

Beatriz agreed, but only on one condition - that she would get to decide what needed to be done. When she arrived at the bar, her acquaintance explained that he had made an enemy of a powerful businessman who was threatening to ruin his reputation and livelihood.

Without hesitation, Beatriz set out to gather information about the businessman and his connections. She sniffed around the city, gathering whispers and rumors, until finally, she discovered the key piece of evidence needed to take down her target.

The night of the confrontation arrived, and Beatriz slipped into the businessman's office, a sly smile spreading across her face as she watched him squirm under her accusations. The deal was done, and the acquaintance was safe - all for a price.

As La Vipera walked away from the office building, a looker in her eyes that hinted at secrets hidden beneath her tough exterior, it was clear to everyone who knew Beatriz that she would never be underestimated again.
