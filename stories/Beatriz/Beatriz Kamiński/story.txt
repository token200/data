Beatriz Kamiński stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the desolate landscape. The once-thriving coal mining town was now a shadow of its former self, the industrial buildings a dull grey that seemed to absorb the last vestiges of hope.

As a journalist, Beatriz had come to Ravenshire to uncover the truth behind the mine's tragic accident, which had killed dozens of miners just months ago. The official investigation had been closed, but rumors swirled about safety lapses and corporate negligence.

Beatriz checked her notebook for what felt like the hundredth time that day, rehearsing her lines in her head as she made her way through the empty streets. She had an interview with a local resident scheduled for later, someone who claimed to have seen something suspicious on the night of the accident.

As she walked, Beatriz noticed a figure standing by the side of the road, watching her approach. He was a young man with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair, his skin bronzed from working outdoors. A small tattoo of a snake coiled around his right wrist.

"Hi," he said softly, falling into step beside her.

"I'm Beatriz Kamiński. I'm investigating the mine accident."

He hesitated before responding, "I didn't want to talk to anyone. But you...you seem different."

Beatriz raised an eyebrow. "What makes me different?"

The young man took a deep breath and began to speak in a low, urgent tone. "My brother was one of the miners who died. I think something wasn't right about that accident."

Beatriz's ears perked up as he spoke, her journalist instincts on high alert. This could be the lead she'd been searching for.

As they walked, Beatriz and the young man, whose name was Kael, discussed the mine's history, its troubled past, and the strange occurrences that had been happening around town since the accident. It was clear that there was more to this story than met the eye.

With every step, Beatriz felt her determination growing. She would uncover the truth behind Ravenshire's tragedy, no matter what it took. And with Kael by her side, she knew they could face anything.
