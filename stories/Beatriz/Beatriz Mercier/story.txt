Beatriz Mercier stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the crisp mountain air filling her lungs as she gazed out at the snow-capped peaks rising above the station. She had been away for five years, and yet the rugged beauty of this place still took her breath away.

As a young woman from the city, Beatriz had always felt suffocated by the concrete jungle that was her home. But after the loss of her mother to illness, she found solace in this small town, nestled deep in the mountains where her father lived and worked as a forester. It was here that she had grown up, playing in the woods and learning the ways of nature from her father.

Now, at twenty-five years old, Beatriz felt restless again. Her life had taken a predictable path - college, career, and eventually, marriage to a man who had left her feeling empty and unfulfilled. But after a painful divorce, she had found herself back in this tiny town, where the familiar rhythms of life still held a allure.

As she walked through the snow-covered streets, Beatriz felt the weight of her decisions lifting. She had come here seeking solace, but what she found was a sense of belonging that she hadn't known in years. Her father welcomed her back with open arms, and soon, she found herself joining him on his forest walks, collecting sap and learning new skills.

The snow fell gently as Beatriz walked through the forest, feeling the peacefulness of this place seep into her bones. She thought about the choices that had led her here - the ones that had kept her in the city, away from the beauty of nature and the quiet contentment it brought her.

For a moment, she considered staying. Leaving behind the life she knew, embracing the uncertainty of this new path. But as she looked around at the familiar trees and the silence of the forest, Beatriz realized that home was where the heart was - and hers had been here all along.

She turned to walk back towards her father's cabin, feeling a sense of peace settle over her like a shawl. The journey ahead would be long, but she knew now that she was exactly where she needed to be.
