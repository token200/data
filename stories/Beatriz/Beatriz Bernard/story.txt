Despite the harsh realities, the festival was alive with energy, music, and laughter. Beatriz saw the resilience of the people, their determination to rebuild and thrive despite overwhelming odds. Her camera told a different story – one of hope and resistance.

When she presented her photographs to the organization, they were met with tears and applause. The images showed not just poverty and desperation but also strength, community, and humanity. Beatriz's work sparked conversations about inequality, justice, and social change.
