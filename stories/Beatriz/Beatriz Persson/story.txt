Beatriz Persson stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee and staring intently at his laptop screen.

She slid into the seat across from him, her bright blue eyes locking onto his warm brown ones. "Hey," she said softly, running a strand of curly blonde hair behind her ear.

"Beatriz," he replied, not looking up. "I'm glad you made it."

Beatriz raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the hint of nervousness in his tone. She knew him well enough to recognize when he was uneasy. What was going on?

Their café dates had become a staple of their friendship, and Beatriz loved how they could talk about anything under the sun while sipping on coffee and eating croissants. But lately, Marcus – her coworker and confidant – seemed distant, preoccupied.

"Hey, what's wrong?" Beatriz asked, leaning in closer.

Marcus hesitated before turning to face her. "It's just...I've been going through some stuff," he confessed, his voice barely above a whisper. "I don't know if I can share it with you."

Beatriz's heart went out to him. She had seen the way he'd been struggling since his breakup last year – the late nights spent working on projects, the reluctance to leave his apartment, the general aura of sadness that clung around him.

"Of course, Marcus," she said gently, reaching out to take his hand in hers. "You can tell me anything."

Marcus took a deep breath and began to open up, sharing stories of anxiety attacks and crippling self-doubt. Beatriz listened attentively, her expression softening with empathy.

As they talked, the café around them faded into the background – the hum of conversation, the clinking of cups, the laughter of patrons. It was just the two of them, lost in their own little world of understanding and support.

When Marcus finally finished speaking, Beatriz pulled him into a warm hug. "I'm here for you," she whispered, her words filled with conviction. "We'll get through this together."

Marcus smiled weakly, his eyes shining with gratitude. For a moment, they just sat there, holding each other tight, the world outside receding like an invisible tide.

And when Beatriz finally pulled back, Marcus looked up at her, his face etched with determination. "Thanks, Beatriz," he said firmly. "You're not just my friend – you're my rock."

Beatriz's heart swelled with pride and love for this brave, vulnerable man who'd confided in her. She knew that no matter what life threw their way, they would face it together, side by side.
