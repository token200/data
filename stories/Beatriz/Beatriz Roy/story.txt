Beatriz Roy stepped into the dimly lit café, scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Sofia, sitting by the window, sipping a cup of coffee. Beatriz made her way over, exchanging warm smiles with the barista as she passed.

As she reached Sofia's table, Beatriz noticed the worn notebook and pen lying on the table. "What are you working on?" she asked, curiosity getting the better of her. Sofia looked up, her eyes sparkling with excitement. "Just some poetry," she replied, tucking a stray lock of hair behind her ear.

Beatriz sat down across from Sofia, intrigued by the creative process unfolding before her. She watched as Sofia scribbled lines on the page, her hand moving with fluid precision. The air was filled with the scent of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of jazz music playing in the background.

Sofia began to read her poem aloud, her voice weaving a spell over Beatriz. "In moonlit nights, I find my peace," she recited, "a world where time stands still, and worries cease." The words echoed within Beatriz's own heart, resonating with a deep understanding.

As they sipped their coffee, the conversation turned to Beatriz's latest art project. She explained her vision of creating an immersive installation that would transport viewers into a surreal dreamscape. Sofia listened intently, offering words of encouragement and constructive criticism.

As the evening drew to a close, Sofia closed her notebook and leaned back in her chair. "You're going to create something truly remarkable, Beatriz Roy," she said with conviction. Beatriz smiled, feeling a surge of gratitude towards her friend. She knew that without Sofia's unwavering support, her artistic endeavors would falter.

As they parted ways, Beatriz felt invigorated by the encounter. The café's warm atmosphere and Sofia's creative energy had rekindled her passion for art. She left with a renewed sense of purpose, eager to bring her vision to life.
