Beatriz Straume stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. As she waited in line to order, she noticed a young artist sketching on her notebook. There was something about his concentration that drew Beatriz Straume to him.

She took a seat at the bar and perused the menu, her mind wandering back to her childhood summers spent by the fjords of Norway. The sound of the waves had always been soothing, and she often found herself returning to it as an adult. The waitress arrived with a steaming cup of coffee, and Beatriz Straume took a sip, feeling the warmth spread through her veins.

As she sipped her coffee, the young artist from earlier caught her eye again. This time, he was looking up from his sketchbook, their eyes meeting for a brief moment before he looked away. Beatriz Straume felt a spark of curiosity ignite within her. She finished her coffee and left a generous tip, feeling compelled to strike up a conversation.

She approached the young artist, who introduced himself as Magnus. They struck up a conversation about art and music, their words flowing easily as they discovered shared interests. As the afternoon wore on, Beatriz Straume found herself drawn into Magnus's world, her mind filled with the vibrant colors of his paintings.

As the sun began to set outside, casting a golden glow over the café, Magnus asked Beatriz Straume if she'd like to join him for a walk along the fjord. The air was crisp and clean, filled with the scent of saltwater and blooming wildflowers. They strolled in comfortable silence, the only sound being the gentle lapping of the waves against the shore.

Beatriz Straume felt a sense of peace wash over her as she walked alongside Magnus, feeling like she'd finally found someone who understood her creative soul. She glanced down at her watch, realizing it was getting late. As they parted ways, Beatriz Straume smiled to herself, knowing that she would see Magnus again soon.
