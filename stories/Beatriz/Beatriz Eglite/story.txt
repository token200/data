Beatriz Eglite stepped into the grand ballroom, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of her long-lost love, Alexander. The year was 1850, and the British aristocracy had gathered to celebrate the wedding of the Duke's daughter. Beatriz, a renowned opera singer, had received an invitation from Alexander himself, who had sent word that he would be in attendance.

As she made her way through the crowd, Beatriz couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. Her and Alexander's love had been forbidden by his family, and she knew that if they were to be discovered together, their lives would be ruined.

Just as Beatriz was starting to lose hope, she heard a low, familiar voice behind her. "Beatriz Eglite," he whispered, as she turned around to see Alexander standing before her, his piercing blue eyes locking onto hers.

The room seemed to fade away as Beatriz's heart skipped a beat. She felt like she had been transported back in time, their love rekindled like a flame that refused to be extinguished. Without a word, Alexander took Beatriz's hand and led her out of the ballroom, into the cool night air.

As they strolled through the gardens, the sound of music and laughter grew fainter, replaced by the gentle rustling of leaves beneath their feet. Beatriz felt free, like she could breathe again after years of hiding her love for Alexander from the world.

"Beatriz Eglite," Alexander whispered again, his voice filled with emotion, "I have been searching for you everywhere. I was afraid that our time had run out."

Beatriz smiled, her eyes shining with tears. "We can't be together, Alexander," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "But tonight, in this moment, let us forget about everything else and just be."

Alexander's face lit up with joy, and he pulled Beatriz into his arms, their lips meeting in a kiss that left them both breathless. As they stood there, wrapped in each other's arms, Beatriz knew that she would never let Alexander go again.
