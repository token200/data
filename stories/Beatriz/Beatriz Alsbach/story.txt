Beatriz Alsbach stepped into the bustling café, scanning the room for her friend, Léa. She spotted Léa sipping on a latte by the window and made her way over, exchanging warm smiles with everyone she passed.

As Beatriz took a seat across from Léa, they both ordered their usual drinks – a cappuccino for Beatriz Alsbach and a green tea for Léa. The conversation flowed easily, covering everything from their latest art projects to the latest gossip about their friends.

But as the afternoon wore on, Beatriz couldn't help but feel a pang of restlessness. She had always been driven by her passion for photography, and lately, she'd been feeling stifled in her current role at the magazine. The thought of breaking free from her comfortable – if unfulfilling – position was both thrilling and terrifying.

Léa, sensing Beatriz's unease, probed gently. "So, what's on your mind, Bea?" she asked, using the affectionate nickname only a few people dared to use.

Beatriz hesitated before taking a deep breath. "I'm thinking of quitting my job at the magazine," she confessed. "I want to pursue photography full-time."

Léa's eyes widened in surprise, but also with excitement. "That's amazing! You've always been talented, Bea – why hold yourself back?"

As they talked, Beatriz felt a weight lift off her shoulders. With Léa's support and encouragement, she began to see the possibilities. She could travel, experiment with new techniques, and showcase her work on a global stage.

The hours flew by as they sipped their drinks and discussed every detail of Beatriz Alsbach's hypothetical future. From building a website to scouting out potential clients, the conversation covered it all.

As the café began to close, Léa reached across the table and took Beatriz's hand. "You have my full support, Bea," she said with conviction. "I'll be right behind you every step of the way."

Beatriz smiled, feeling a surge of gratitude towards her friend. With Léa by her side, she knew that nothing was impossible – not even taking the leap and turning her passion into a career.
