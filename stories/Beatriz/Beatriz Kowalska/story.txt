Beatriz Kowalska stepped out of the rain and into the cramped, dimly lit café. The smell of stale coffee wafted through the air as she made her way to the back table, where a lone figure sat huddled in the corner.

It was Leon, her partner in crime, her confidant, and her fellow escape artist. Beatriz slid onto the chair across from him, shaking the raindrops from her long, raven-black hair.

"What's on your mind?" she asked, her voice husky with a hint of amusement.

Leon raised an eyebrow, his piercing blue eyes sparkling in the dim light. "I've been thinking," he said, his voice low and measured. "We're getting too old for this."

Beatriz laughed, a throaty sound that sent shivers down Leon's spine. "What are you talking about? We're just getting started."

Leon sighed, running a hand through his short, dark hair. "I'm thinking of retiring," he said bluntly.

Beatriz's eyes narrowed. "Retiring? From what?"

"From the game," Leon replied, his voice barely above a whisper.

Beatriz leaned forward, her elbows on the table. "You mean the art of thievery, of deception, of seduction?"

Leon nodded, a small smile playing on his lips. "Exactly."

Beatriz's gaze locked onto his, her eyes flashing with excitement. "And what about us? What happens to Beatriz Kowalska when she retires from the game?"

Leon shrugged, a hint of sadness creeping into his voice. "I don't know," he admitted.

Beatriz's smile grew wider, her teeth glinting in the dim light. "That's why we'll never retire," she said, her voice full of conviction.

As they talked, the café patrons began to filter out, one by one, until it was just Beatriz and Leon left. The rain pounded against the windows like a rhythmic heartbeat, as if urging them on.

Beatriz leaned in closer, her voice taking on a conspiratorial tone. "We'll create something new," she whispered. "Something even more thrilling than our last job."

Leon's eyes widened, his face illuminated by a spark of excitement. "What have you got in mind?" he asked, his voice trembling with anticipation.

Beatriz's smile grew wider still, her lips curling up in a mischievous grin. "I've been thinking about it," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.
