Alice Abdykadyrova was a young journalist who had just arrived in Kyiv, Ukraine, to start her new job at a local newspaper. Born and raised in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, she had always been fascinated by the stories of war and conflict that her grandfather used to tell her when she was a child. After completing her degree in journalism from the University of Westminster, Alice felt an overwhelming urge to work on the ground in Ukraine, where she could make a difference.

As she stepped off the train at Kyiv's main station, Alice felt a mix of excitement and nervousness. She had heard stories about the resilience of the Ukrainian people, but she was also aware that this country was no stranger to conflict and hardship. Her colleagues welcomed her warmly and showed her to her small flat near the city center.

Alice threw herself into her work, starting with writing about everyday life in Kyiv for readers back home. She spent long hours interviewing local business owners, shopkeepers, and community leaders, trying to capture the essence of this vibrant city. But it wasn't long before she found herself drawn to more serious stories – ones that exposed corruption, government scandals, or human rights abuses.

Her big break came when she managed to land an exclusive interview with a whistleblower from the Ukrainian secret services. The story was explosive and drew attention not just in Ukraine but internationally as well. It marked Alice's arrival on the journalism scene and earned her recognition within her industry.

Despite the success of this piece, Alice knew that there was more work to be done. She continued to write about issues affecting marginalized communities, such as Roma and LGBTI individuals who faced systemic persecution in Ukraine. Her reporting sparked heated debates among politicians but also brought some much-needed attention to these underreported stories.

Alice's years working in Kyiv took a toll on her physical health – the stress of reporting on conflict zones, chronic fatigue, and a host of other issues took its toll. However, Alice remained committed to her work, driven by a conviction that every voice matters, especially those of the overlooked.

One evening as she sat at her desk typing away in a crowded coffee shop near downtown Kyiv, Alice couldn't help but think about how far she had come from Tashkent and her grandparents' stories of struggle. Her reporting was no longer just about telling someone else's story; it was now about shedding light on the often-invisible lives of ordinary people caught up in a world of conflict.
