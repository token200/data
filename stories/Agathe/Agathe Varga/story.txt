Agathe Varga stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. The small town of Ravenswood was not exactly known for its tourist attractions, but Agathe had come to visit her estranged grandmother, Élise Varga.

As a child, Agathe had spent summers with her grandmother, listening to tales of their family's past and the secrets that lay hidden beneath the surface. But after her parents' untimely death, Agathe was sent to live with her wealthy aunt in the city, leaving her grandmother behind. The two had remained estranged ever since.

Agathe hailed a taxi, giving the driver the address of her grandmother's old cottage on the outskirts of town. As they wound through the rolling hills and verdant forests, Agathe felt a mix of emotions: guilt for abandoning her grandmother all those years ago, and curiosity about what had become of the woman who had once been such an important part of her life.

The taxi dropped Agathe off at the cottage, a small, weathered bungalow that seemed to lean drunkenly against its neighbor. A faint scent of baking wafted from within, mingling with the earthy smell of the forest. Agathe's stomach growled in anticipation as she pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside.

Élise Varga sat on the couch, her eyes fixed intently on Agathe as she entered. For a moment, they simply stared at one another, the air thick with unspoken words. Then Élise rose from the couch, her movements slow and deliberate. "Agathe," she said, her voice husky and familiar.

The two women sat down in armchairs facing each other, their hands clasped tightly together as they began to talk. Agathe learned of her grandmother's life since she'd left: the losses she'd endured, the secrets she'd kept hidden, and the quiet strength that had carried her through it all. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the room in a warm, golden light, Agathe felt a deep connection to this woman who had been both mother and stranger.

Over steaming cups of tea, they talked long into the night, their conversation weaving together threads of love, regret, and forgiveness. It was a fragile beginning, but as the stars twinkled outside, Agathe knew that she'd come back to Ravenswood, to Élise Varga, again and again.
