Agathe Krumina stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee and lost in thought. As she approached, he looked up, a hint of surprise crossing his features.

"Agathe," he said, standing up to greet her.

"It's been too long, Étienne," Agathe replied, smiling. "I hope you're doing well."

Étienne, her childhood friend and confidant, nodded and invited her to join him. They sat down at a small table by the window, and Agathe took a sip of her own coffee.

As they chatted, Agathe couldn't help but notice the changes in Étienne's demeanor since their last meeting. He seemed more introspective, more troubled. She asked him what was wrong, and he hesitated before speaking.

"I'm not sure," he said finally. "I just feel like I'm drifting, like I'm losing my sense of purpose. I've been feeling this way for months now."

Agathe listened attentively, her expression sympathetic. "You're not alone in that feeling, Étienne," she said gently. "We all go through phases like that at some point in our lives."

Étienne shook his head, but Agathe could see the gratitude in his eyes. She reached out and took his hand, a gesture of support and comfort.

"You know I'm here for you, Étienne," she said. "I've always been here for you."

As they talked, Agathe's thoughts wandered back to her own life. She had been doing well, too, but not without its challenges. Her career was taking off, but the pressure was mounting. She felt like she was losing herself in the process, like she was just a cog in a machine.

Étienne noticed the tension in her body and squeezed her hand reassuringly. "You're strong, Agathe," he said. "You can handle anything that comes your way."

Agathe smiled, feeling a sense of gratitude towards Étienne. She knew that she could count on him, no matter what. As they finished their coffee and prepared to part ways, Agathe felt a sense of hope. Maybe, just maybe, she was starting to find her way again.
