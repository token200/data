Agathe Keiko stood at the edge of the city, gazing out at the endless expanse of skyscrapers that pierced the sky like shards of glass. She felt small and insignificant, a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of time. Yet, it was precisely this sense of insignificance that drew her to art.

As a child, Agathe had spent hours sketching the intricate details of streetlights, lost in the swirling patterns of neon and steel. Her parents had encouraged her passion, but as she grew older, the expectations placed upon her began to weigh heavier. Her father, a renowned businessman, wanted her to follow in his footsteps – to attend university, secure a high-paying job, and build a successful career.

But Agathe's heart belonged to art.

She spent countless nights sneaking away from family gatherings to sketch in abandoned alleyways, the city lights casting an otherworldly glow on her face. It was there that she found solace, lost herself in the creative process, and allowed her imagination to run wild.

One fateful evening, as she stood at the edge of the city, Agathe noticed a peculiar figure lingering on the periphery – an elderly man with wispy hair and piercing blue eyes. He watched her with an air of quiet understanding, his gaze never wavering from hers. She sensed that he too was an artist, one who saw the world through a different lens.

Over time, the man, whom Agathe came to know as Kaito, would occasionally appear beside her in hidden corners of the city. Together they would sketch and discuss the intricacies of light and shadow, color and texture. For the first time in years, Agathe felt seen, truly understood by someone who shared her passion.

As the nights passed, their conversations turned from art to life, with all its complexities and mysteries. Agathe found herself drawn into Kaito's world – a realm where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blurred. And though she still carried the weight of her family's expectations, she knew that she would never be able to conform.

In those fleeting moments with Kaito, Agathe discovered her true self – an artist, lost in the beauty of the city, searching for meaning in every swirl of color and light.
