Agathe Salvini stepped out of her small, cluttered apartment and onto the bustling streets of Rome. Her bright green eyes scanned the crowds, searching for someone – anyone who could understand her. As an outsider, a stranger in a city that seemed to hold its breath waiting for her, she felt like a ghost hovering on the periphery.

Born out of wedlock, Agathe had always been the forgotten child. Her mother's secrets and scandals had long since faded into the shadows, leaving only whispers of "illegitima" and "estranea". The city seemed to have taken its toll on her – every face a reminder that she was an imposter, an unwelcome guest in a world where family bonds were sacrosanct.

She wandered aimlessly through the winding streets, dodging tourists and locals alike. No one asked about her or cared; no one wanted to befriend a stranger who didn't belong. The anonymity was suffocating. With each step, Agathe felt herself becoming more invisible, more lost.

As she turned onto Via del Corso, Agathe spotted him – a young man with piercing blue eyes and an untamed mane of curly brown hair. He sat on a bench, scribbling in a notebook, completely absorbed in his own world. For the first time that day, Agathe felt a spark of recognition.

She approached him hesitantly, her footsteps quiet on the cobblestones. The young man looked up, startled, as if he'd sensed her presence long before she reached him. Their eyes locked in a fleeting moment of connection – Agathe saw herself reflected back at him, saw someone who understood what it meant to be invisible.

"You're writing poetry," Agathe said, reaching out with an extended hand.

He took it without hesitation. "I'm trying," the young man replied softly.

Agathe smiled wryly, feeling the contours of her loneliness soften. For the first time in as long as she could remember, she felt seen. The words of a stranger resonated deep within her – in his blue eyes, Agathe saw a glimmer of hope, a chance to forge new connections, to shed the invisible cloak that had shrouded her for so long.

"Would you like to write with me?" he asked, his voice laced with genuine interest. Agathe's response came effortlessly: "Si."
