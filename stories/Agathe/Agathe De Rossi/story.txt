As a child, she would spend hours sketching the beauty of the Mediterranean coast, where her family would summer.

As Agathe De Rossi grew older, her passion for art only intensified. She studied at some of the most prestigious institutions in Paris and Rome, where she was mentored by some of the greatest artists of her time.
