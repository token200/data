Agathe Kovalenko sat in her small apartment, sipping a cup of lukewarm tea as she stared out the window at the grey cityscape. It was a chilly autumn evening, and the rain pattered against the panes like a melancholy rhythm.

As an archaeologist, Agathe had spent her career uncovering the secrets of the past, but lately, she'd found herself feeling disconnected from it all. The thrill of discovery had worn off, replaced by a sense of monotony and disillusionment. She felt like she was just going through the motions, day in and day out.

Agathe's mind began to wander as she thought about her research on the ancient civilizations that once thrived along the Volga River. She'd spent years studying the artifacts and texts, trying to piece together the stories of long-lost cultures. Her colleagues often joked that she had a Ph.D. in "Kovalenko-itis" – the affliction where you became so consumed by your own research that you forgot how to live.

Agathe sighed, feeling a pang of frustration. She'd always been driven by a passion for discovery, but now it seemed like that drive had turned inward, fueled by her own doubts and fears. As she gazed out at the rain-soaked streets, she wondered if anyone would even notice if she just disappeared.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was her friend and colleague, Dr. Petrov. He poked his head in, a concerned look on his face. "Hey, Agathe, how's it going? I saw your post about the latest excavation site – are you okay?"

Agathe hesitated, unsure of how to respond. She didn't want to burden her friend with her doubts and fears, but at the same time, she couldn't deny that something was off. "I'm fine," she said finally, forcing a smile onto her face. "Just feeling a little... stuck."

Dr. Petrov nodded sympathetically. "We all get there sometimes. But you're one of the most talented people I know, Agathe Kovalenko – what's going on? Is everything okay?"

For a moment, Agathe felt like opening up to her friend, sharing all her doubts and fears. But then she pushed them back, determined to keep her personal life separate from her work. "I'm just tired," she said finally, standing up to usher Dr. Petrov out of the apartment. "Let's grab some dinner instead."

As they walked through the rainy streets, Agathe couldn't shake the feeling that she was stuck in a rut – and she had no idea how to get out.
