Agathe Balodis stepped out onto the windswept patio, her eyes scanning the darkening sky. The sun had dipped below the horizon hours ago, but she couldn't shake the feeling that it was still watching her. As a psychologist specializing in trauma and PTSD, Agathe was no stranger to the darkness that lurked within human minds.

She took a deep breath, letting the crisp sea air fill her lungs, and began her daily ritual of walking along the beach. The rhythmic crashing of waves against the shore was meditative, washing away the thoughts that plagued her own mind. Her patients often struggled with feelings of guilt and shame, but Agathe knew she had her own demons to wrestle.

As a child, Agathe's parents had been involved in a tragic car accident. She was just eight years old when it happened, and the memories of that day still lingered in her mind like an open wound. Her father's death had sent her mother spiraling into depression, leaving Agathe to care for her younger siblings alone.

The weight of those responsibilities had taken its toll on Agathe. As she grew older, she became increasingly withdrawn, struggling to connect with others. It wasn't until she stumbled upon the world of psychology that she found a new purpose – helping others heal from their own traumas.

Tonight was no exception. As she walked along the beach, Agathe felt the familiar tug of anxiety in her chest. She knew it was coming, this wave of self-doubt that threatened to crash over her at any moment. But she'd learned to recognize its patterns, to anticipate its arrival like a storm brewing on the horizon.

Agathe stopped walking, gazing out into the darkness. The stars twinkled above, their light piercing the shadows like diamonds. She felt small and insignificant in the face of it all – yet, paradoxically, connected to something greater than herself. This was what her patients needed, she thought – a sense of perspective, a reminder that they were not alone.

She turned back towards the house, feeling the familiar ache in her chest begin to recede. Tomorrow, Agathe would face another day as a psychologist, helping others navigate their own dark waters. But tonight, on this windswept beach, she allowed herself a moment of stillness – a fleeting respite from the turmoil that churned within. The stars watched over her, and for a brief, shining instant, so did Agathe.
