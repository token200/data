Agathe Petrovich sat alone in her dimly lit apartment, surrounded by the remnants of a life once lived. Her eyes wandered to the old piano in the corner, its keys yellowed with age and dust. She hadn't played it in years, not since her mother passed away.

As a child, Agathe had spent countless hours at the piano, her fingers dancing across the keys as she learned to play Chopin's Nocturnes and Debussy's Preludes. Her mother had been her teacher, guiding her hand through the intricate passages and coaxing out a beauty that belied her age.

But life had other plans for Agathe. Her parents had died in a tragic accident when she was just a teenager, leaving her an orphan with no family to care for her. She had been forced to abandon her dreams of becoming a concert pianist and make a life as a secretary instead.

As the years went by, Agathe's fingers grew stiff and unforgiving, her touch lacking the finesse that once characterized her playing. But on nights like this, when the world outside seemed to fade away, she would close her eyes and let herself be transported back to those halcyon days at the piano.

Tonight was no different. As she sat with her head in her hands, memories of her mother flooded her mind â€“ the way her fingers had cradled hers during lessons, the sound of her voice as she coaxed out a particularly difficult phrase, the smell of the music room filled with old books and wood polish.

As Agathe's eyes began to prickle with tears, she rose from her chair and approached the piano. Her hands hesitated over the keys for a moment before coming to rest on the worn ivory of the B-flat key. She placed her fingers on the keys and let out a soft breath as the sounds of her past poured through her.

The music was raw and rough at first, but with each passing moment, it grew smoother, more refined. Agathe's mother had always said that the piano was like a canvas, waiting for the brushstrokes of life to bring color and vibrancy to its empty spaces.

And in this moment, as the notes spilled from her fingers like tears, Agathe felt the truth of those words. The piano was alive, pulsing with a rhythm that beat within her own chest. For one fleeting instant, she forgot about her loneliness and let herself be lost in the music, her mother's gentle guidance still echoing through her very soul.
