As news of her heritage spread, Agathe Flavius Vespasianus found herself swept up in a whirlwind of intrigue. Senators vied for her attention, each hoping to claim the favor of this newfound connection to their esteemed ancestor. Amidst the chaos, she encountered a rugged yet charming gladiator named Marcus.

Agathe Flavius Vespasianus's presence proved a game-changer, allowing Marcus to access levels previously inaccessible.

As whispers of their budding relationship reached the ears of Emperor Titus himself, a storm brewed around them. With danger lurking in every shadow, they knew that only strength and cunning could protect them from those who sought to exploit her noble heritage. And yet, it was Agathe Flavius Vespasianus's unyielding determination and Marcus's unwavering loyalty that proved their greatest asset.
