I think you meant David Tennant, not Davide Saldana. However, I can still provide you with a story about the actor Michael B. Jordan and a different character. 

Here's an alternate story:

It was a chilly evening in Los Angeles when Michael B. Jordan strolled into the iconic Paramount Studios. As he made his way to the casting room, he couldn't help but think about his next big role. He had just completed filming for "Creed III" and was eager to take on something new.

As he entered the casting room, a familiar face greeted him - none other than Marvel's own Captain America, played by Chris Evans. The two actors exchanged warm smiles, and Michael B. Jordan couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement.

"So, what's on your mind?" Chris asked, noticing Michael B. Jordan's intense focus.

"I'm thinking about my next role," he replied, "something that will challenge me as an actor."

Just then, the casting director walked in with a folder full of scripts. "We have something that might interest you," she said with a smile.

As they began to read through the scripts, Michael B. Jordan's eyes scanned the pages, searching for the perfect role. After what felt like an eternity, he finally found it - a complex and intriguing character in a new sci-fi film.

With a sense of excitement, he turned to Chris Evans and said, "I think I've got this one." Chris smiled and nodded in agreement.

As they wrapped up their meeting, Michael B. Jordan couldn't help but feel grateful for the opportunity to take on this new challenge. He left the studios feeling inspired and ready to dive into his next role.

Michael B. Jordan's talent and dedication had once again paid off, earning him a spot as one of Hollywood's most sought-after actors.

As he walked out of the studio, he couldn't help but think about how far he had come since his early days on "Friday Night Lights." Michael B. Jordan was truly living his dream, and it felt amazing.
