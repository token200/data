Davide Kalnina stepped into the dimly lit art gallery, scanning the room for any signs of life amidst the vibrant artwork on display. As an art critic and journalist, she knew that every exhibit was a gamble, but this one had her intrigued. She spotted a figure by the bar and made her way towards them.

"Mind if I join you?" Davide Kalnina asked, nodding towards the empty stool beside the stranger.

The man turned to face her, his eyes locking onto hers with an air of curiosity. "Not at all," he replied, offering her a small smile. "I'm Max."

Davide Kalnina slid onto the stool, signaling the bartender for a whiskey on the rocks. As they sipped their drinks in silence, she couldn't help but notice the faint hum of conversation emanating from the crowd.

"So, what brings you to this exhibit?" Davide Kalnina asked, breaking the silence.

Max leaned back in his chair, his gaze drifting towards the artwork on display. "I'm an investor," he explained. "Looking for something that will spark a new trend."

Davide Kalnina's journalist instincts kicked in, and she zeroed in on Max's words. "A new trend?" she repeated. "What makes you think this exhibit has what it takes to start something?"

Max chuckled, his eyes glinting with amusement. "Let's just say I have a feeling about Davide Kalnina â€“ your instincts rarely lead astray."

Davide Kalnina felt a flush rise to her cheeks as Max spoke, the compliment striking a chord within her. She smiled wryly, acknowledging the praise.

As they chatted on, the crowd began to disperse, and the gallery lights flickered brighter. The exhibit's curator emerged from the shadows, a bespectacled woman with a knowing smile. "I see you've met Max," she said, nodding towards Davide Kalnina. "He's looking for something big."

Davide Kalnina raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the curator's enigmatic tone. As they left the gallery together, Davide Kalnina couldn't shake off the feeling that this was just the beginning of a story that would leave her with more questions than answers.
