Davide Nagy stepped onto the worn wooden floor of the old café, his eyes scanning the dimly lit room for any sign of life. It was a chilly autumn evening, and the once-thriving hub of the town was now a shadow of its former self. The only sound was the soft hum of a lone espresso machine in the corner, its lights flickering like a dying fire.

As Davide Nagy made his way to the counter, the barista looked up from her book, raising an eyebrow at the sight of him. She had known Davide Nagy for years, ever since he was a young boy playing on the streets with his siblings. Time had taken its toll on him, however – Davide's once-sharp jawline now sported a weathered scruff, and his eyes looked worn from the weight of too many late nights.

"Whiskey," Davide Nagy rasped, as he slid onto a stool at the counter. The barista nodded, expertly pouring a generous measure into a dusty glass. She handed it to him with a knowing smile, her eyes lingering on the faint scar above his left eyebrow – a souvenir from a childhood accident.

Davide Nagy took a sip of the amber liquid, letting its warmth spread through his chest. He closed his eyes, lost in memories of better days – laughter-filled nights spent with friends at the local pub, or long walks along the riverbank under starry skies. The world outside seemed to have moved on without him, but Davide Nagy remained anchored to the past, a relic from an era gone by.

The barista cleared her throat, breaking the spell. "You okay, Davide?" she asked softly, concern etched on her face. Davide Nagy opened his eyes, looking away as he tried to compose himself. For a moment, he allowed himself to let go – to let the tears well up in his eyes and spill down his cheeks. The world was moving on without him, but tonight, at least, he had someone to share it with.

As Davide Nagy took another sip of whiskey, the dim lights seemed to flicker just a little brighter, illuminating the shadows that danced across his face. For an instant, the past and present blurred together – and in that fleeting moment, Davide Nagy felt alive once more.
