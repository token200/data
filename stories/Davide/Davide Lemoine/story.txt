Davide Lemoine sat alone at his desk, staring blankly at the computer screen in front of him. As the founder and CEO of NovaTech, he was used to being surrounded by the hustle and bustle of a thriving company, but today he just felt lost.

It had been three years since NovaTech had landed the deal with SpaceX, catapulting them into the stratosphere of innovative tech companies. Davide had always dreamed of making a difference in the world through technology, and this partnership had made it happen.

But as the months went by, Davide began to feel like he was losing himself in the process. The company's success had brought new employees on board, more resources, and more pressure. He found himself constantly on call, trying to keep up with the demands of a growing business.

One evening, while working late in his office, Davide received an unexpected visit from his estranged mother, Sylvie. She was an artist, always chasing her dreams, but had never pursued them as fiercely as Davide did.

"Sylvie," he said, looking up from his screen, "what are you doing here?"

"I came to remind you of what's truly important," she replied softly. "Your work is great and all, but it's just that – a job. What about your passions? Your art?"

Davide felt a pang in his chest as he remembered the countless hours he had spent painting as a child. He used to love expressing himself through colors and shapes, but life had gotten in the way.

Sylvie handed him an old sketchbook filled with his childhood artwork. As Davide flipped through the pages, memories came flooding back – the joy of creating something from scratch, losing himself in the process.

"Pick one," Sylvie said. "Whatever you want to create, pick it."

Davide closed the book and looked up at his mother. "I don't know if I can just leave all this behind," he said hesitantly.

Sylvie smiled knowingly. "You don't have to leave it behind entirely. You just need to remember what made you start NovaTech in the first place – to make a difference. Not just through tech, but through art."

As Davide sat there, the sketchbook still in his hands, he felt a weight lifting off his shoulders. He knew that he couldn't turn his back on NovaTech, but maybe it was time to reignite the passion he once had for art.

The next morning, Davide woke up with a renewed sense of purpose. It wouldn't be easy, but he was ready to find that balance between his work and his art – and make sure his company stayed true to its roots as well.
