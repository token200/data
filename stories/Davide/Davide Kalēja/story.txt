Davide Kalēja was a man with a past as rugged as his weathered skin. His eyes, a piercing shade of indigo, had witnessed the harsh realities of life, and yet, they sparkled with an inner fire that defied age. A former soldier, Kalēja had seen battles in distant lands, fought for causes he didn't fully understand, but ultimately lost what truly mattered.

Years after his discharge, Kalēja found himself wandering through the crowded streets of New Eden, a city built on reclaimed land from a devastated coastal town. The sound of seagulls filled the air as he walked along the shore, the wind whipping his wild hair into a frenzy. He stopped at a small café, ordering a cup of black coffee that burned his tongue.

The barista, a young girl with bright pink streaks in her hair, watched him with an intensity that made Kalēja uncomfortable. "You're one of them, aren't you?" she asked, nodding towards the sea. Her voice was barely above a whisper.

Kalēja's eyes narrowed. How did she know? He had tried to erase his past, but it seemed the memories followed him everywhere. "What do you mean?"

The barista leaned in closer. "I've seen pictures of you, Davide Kalēja. In the old war zones, where the soldiers used to go to forget their troubles. You were one of them, weren't you?" Her words were laced with a mix of pity and understanding.

Kalēja took a long sip of his coffee, letting the bitterness wash over him. The memories came flooding back – the screams of the wounded, the stench of smoke and blood, the faces of those he had lost. But there was one face that still haunted him – a girl with a bright smile and piercing green eyes.

"What do you want from me?" Kalēja asked, his voice low and rough.

The barista's gaze drifted out to sea. "I just wanted someone to talk to, Davide. Someone who understands what it means to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders."

For a moment, Kalēja felt seen, understood. It was a fleeting sense of connection in a life that had long since lost its purpose. He nodded at her and turned back to the shore, letting the ocean wash over him once more. In that moment, he knew he couldn't stay away from his past forever – but it was a decision for another day.
