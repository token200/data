Davide Weber sat alone at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of unpaid invoices in front of him. As the owner of Weber's Woodworking, he had once been passionate about creating beautiful furniture pieces that brought joy to people's homes. But over the past few years, the financial struggles had taken a toll on his motivation.

He rubbed his tired eyes and sighed, wondering how it had come to this. His late father, Giovanni, had taught him everything he knew, but after he passed away, Davide struggled to keep up with the workload alone. The bills piled up, and the loans had grown bigger, too. He felt like he was drowning in debt.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was Sofia, his 10-year-old daughter, who had just started at a new school. She was full of energy and excitement as she bounded into the workshop, dropping her backpack onto the floor.

"Dad, I'm home!" she chirped, giving him a big hug. "I missed you today!"

Davide forced a smile and tried to focus on the task at hand – trying to come up with a plan to save his business. But as he watched Sofia's infectious enthusiasm, something inside of him shifted.

"Hey kiddo, want to help me make some new plans?" he asked, gesturing to a blank sheet of paper in front of him.

Sofia nodded eagerly and sat down beside her father, watching with wide eyes as he began to scribble out ideas. Together, they brainstormed ways to reduce costs, market his wares more effectively, and connect with customers on social media.

For the first time in months, Davide felt a spark of hope. Maybe it was okay not to have all the answers right now. Maybe, just maybe, having Sofia by his side could be exactly what he needed to turn things around.

As they brainstormed, Davide noticed something remarkable – the more creative and imaginative Sofia became, the more inspired her father seemed to become. He began to see possibilities that had eluded him for years.

"You know, kiddo," he said with a grin, "I think we might just have a new business plan on our hands."

Sofia squealed in delight, bounding over to give her dad another hug. As they hugged, Davide knew that things were about to change. The future was bright, and for the first time in years, he felt like he had a purpose beyond paying bills.
