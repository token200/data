As he left the source's safe house, Davide Fuentes couldn't shake the feeling that he had just stepped into a trap. But he was ready for whatever came next, driven by his unwavering commitment to uncovering the truth and bringing those responsible to justice.

For Davide Fuentes, the stakes were high - but he was willing to risk everything to see it through.
