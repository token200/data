I couldn't find any information on a person named Davide Isakova. It's possible that you may have misspelled the name or that Davide Isakova is a private individual and not a public figure.

However, I can suggest some famous individuals with similar-sounding names:

* David Isaacson: An American politician who served as the Chairman of the White House Transition Team under President Barack Obama.
* David Isaac: A South African cricketer who played for the South Africa national team in the 1970s and 1980s.

If you'd like, I can write a story about one of these individuals or create a fictional character with the name Davide Isakova. Please let me know!
