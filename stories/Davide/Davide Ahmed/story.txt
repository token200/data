Davide Ahmed sat alone in his small, cluttered office, staring blankly at the stack of bills and financial reports in front of him. As the owner of Ahmed's Auto Repair, he had always prided himself on being a hard worker and providing for his family, but lately, things had been tough.

The economy was struggling, and more and more customers were opting to take their cars elsewhere. Davide felt like he was constantly juggling bills and expenses, just trying to keep the shop afloat. His wife, Leila, had been working double shifts at her own job just to make ends meet, but it still wasn't enough.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was his oldest son, Amir, who had just graduated from high school and was looking for a summer job. "Hey, Dad, what's going on?" he asked, noticing the look of worry on Davide's face.

Davide sighed and rubbed his temples. "Just trying to make ends meet, kiddo. The shop is struggling."

Amir nodded sympathetically. "I know how you feel, Dad. I've been feeling a little lost myself since graduation. I don't want to go back home and just sit around all summer."

Davide looked up at his son, his eyes welling up with tears. He had always wanted Amir to succeed more than anything, but now it seemed like the road ahead was looking bleaker by the day.

Just then, there was another knock at the door. It was Amir's younger sister, Sophia, who had just finished her first year of college and was home on summer break. "Hey, Dad! Can I show you something?" she asked excitedly, holding up her phone to reveal a photo of a sleek new car.

Davide raised an eyebrow. "What's that supposed to be?"

Sophia grinned mischievously. "It's the design for a new car I want to build in my engineering class! I think we could start our own business and take Ahmed's Auto Repair by storm!"

Amir and Davide exchanged a look, both of them seeing something there that neither had noticed before. Maybe this was exactly what they needed - a fresh perspective and a new challenge.

With newfound determination, Davide put down the bills and turned to his children. "You know what? I think Sophia's onto something here. Let's do it!"
