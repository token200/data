Here is a character profile for Davide Aber:

And here is a short story based on this character:

Davide Aber's camera was always at the ready, capturing the beauty of the world around him. As a freelance journalist and photographer, he had traveled to some of the most remote corners of the globe in search of his next big story.

One day, while wandering through the dusty streets of Marrakech, Morocco, Davide stumbled upon a small, family-owned coffee shop. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted out into the street, enticing him to come inside. As he sat down at a small table, he noticed an old man sitting in the corner, sipping a cup of coffee and watching him with piercing green eyes.

"Welcome, young man," the old man said in a thick Moroccan accent. "My name is Hassan. What brings you to our humble coffee shop?"

Davide introduced himself and explained that he was looking for inspiration for his next story. Hassan listened intently, nodding his head as Davide spoke. When Davide finished, Hassan leaned forward and began to tell him a tale of the city's hidden history.

As they sipped their coffee together, Davide learned about Marrakech's rich cultural heritage and the struggles of its people. He also discovered that Hassan was more than just a simple coffee shop owner - he was a keeper of secrets and stories.

Over the next few days, Davide returned to the coffee shop again and again, learning more about the city and its people from Hassan. As their friendship grew, so did Davide's passion for storytelling.

Eventually, Davide had enough material to write a compelling article about Marrakech's hidden history. The piece was published in a prominent magazine, earning him recognition as one of the top freelance journalists in the industry.

As he sat at his desk, typing away on his computer, Davide couldn't help but think back to Hassan and their conversations over coffee. He knew that he owed a debt of gratitude to the old man for sharing his stories and inspiring him to find his true calling as a journalist.

And so, Davide continued to travel, capturing the beauty of the world through his camera lens and telling the stories that needed to be told.
