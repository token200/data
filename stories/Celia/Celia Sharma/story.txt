Celia Sharma sat alone in her small apartment, staring blankly at the walls as tears streamed down her face. It had been three months since she'd received the devastating news: her mother's cancer had progressed to stage four, and there was nothing more that could be done.

As she sat amidst the sea of photographs and mementos, Celia felt a deep sense of loss wash over her. She couldn't imagine a world without her mother by her side, sharing stories and laughter around dinner tables, or simply being a listening ear when needed. The thought was almost too much to bear.

Celia's mind wandered back to the countless memories she'd shared with her mother - the first time they'd taken a trip together, the birthday celebrations, and even the silly fights that always seemed to end in hugs. Her mother had been more than just a parent; she was Celia's best friend and confidante.

As she continued to sob, Celia's thoughts turned to the upcoming funeral. She couldn't bring herself to think about it now, but eventually, she knew it would be inevitable. She wondered what her mother would want for her in this difficult time - would she want her to be strong, or would she want her to be free to grieve?

The doorbell rang, interrupting Celia's emotional reverie. It was her best friend, Rachel, who had stopped by to offer condolences and companionship. As they sat together on the couch, sipping tea and sharing stories of their own mothers, Celia began to feel a sense of comfort wash over her.

Rachel reminded her that her mother would always be with her in spirit, guiding her through the tough times and celebrating the good ones. Celia smiled weakly, feeling a glimmer of hope for the first time since receiving the news.

As the evening drew to a close, Rachel hugged Celia tightly. "I'm here for you, Celia Sharma," she said softly. "We'll get through this together."
