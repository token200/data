Celia Roux stood at the edge of the old wooden dock, her eyes fixed on the horizon as the sun dipped into the ocean. She was a woman of mystery, with an air of quiet confidence that drew people to her. Her raven-black hair was tied back in a loose bun, and her bright green eyes sparkled with a hint of mischief.

Celia Roux had always been drawn to the sea, finding solace in its vastness and power. As a child, she would spend hours listening to her grandfather's tales of the ocean's secrets and hidden treasures. Now, as a young adult, she felt an insatiable restlessness, as if there was something more out there for her.

As she gazed out at the waves, Celia Roux felt a sudden jolt of excitement. She had received a cryptic message from an old acquaintance, inviting her to meet him on this very dock. The note read: "Come alone, and come prepared." Celia's instincts told her that something was amiss, but she couldn't shake the feeling that this meeting might be the key to unlocking a long-buried secret.

She took a deep breath, steeling herself for what lay ahead. As she made her way along the dock, the sound of seagulls filled the air, and the smell of saltwater and seaweed wafted on the breeze. Celia Roux's heart beat faster with every step, her senses heightened as she approached the appointed meeting spot.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was a tall, dark-haired man, his eyes gleaming with an otherworldly intensity. "Celia Roux," he said, his voice low and husky. "I've been waiting for you." Celia's mind reeled as she tried to process what was happening. Who was this stranger, and what did he want from her? She steeled herself, ready to face whatever lay ahead, knowing that her life would never be the same again.
