Celia Nurlanov stepped out of the crowded metro station and onto the bustling streets of Ashgabat, her eyes scanning the chaotic scene before her. As a foreign correspondent for a major international news network, she had grown accustomed to navigating unfamiliar cities, but there was something about this Turkmenistan capital that unsettled her.

A native of Kazakhstan, Celia Nurlanov had always felt a sense of disconnection from her own culture, content instead to observe and report on the lives of others. Her full name, written in elegant script on a small leather-bound card she kept in her wallet, seemed to mock her as she walked – "Celia Nurlanov", a combination of Kazakh and Turkmen that sounded like a joke.

She had been sent to Ashgabat to cover the recent announcement of a new monument to the country's founder, Saparmurat Niyazov. Rumors swirled that the monument would be a grandiose tribute to the late leader, who had died just last year. Celia Nurlanov was determined to get to the bottom of the story, but she knew it wouldn't be easy.

As she made her way through the crowds, she noticed a young woman watching her from across the street. The girl's eyes seemed to bore into Celia's skin, and for a moment, they locked gazes. Celia felt a shiver run down her spine as the woman nodded slightly and turned away.

The next day, Celia Nurlanov found herself at the construction site of the new monument, surrounded by workers in bright yellow vests and foremen who seemed determined to keep her at bay. She began to dig for information, talking to locals and trying to piece together the rumors that had spread like wildfire through the city.

Despite the language barrier and the awkwardness of it all, Celia Nurlanov felt a spark of connection to this place and its people. For the first time in her career, she felt like she was getting close to something real – but at what cost? As she packed up her camera equipment and headed back to her hotel, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was walking into a trap, one from which she might never escape.

Her full name echoed through her mind like a mantra: Celia Nurlanov, a stranger in a strange land, searching for truth in a city where it seemed impossible to find.
