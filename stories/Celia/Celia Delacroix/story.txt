Celia Delacroix stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. As a private investigator with a knack for solving even the most puzzling cases, she had seen her fair share of shady characters and cryptic clues.

She spotted a figure sitting in the corner, shrouded in shadows, and made her way towards them. The air was thick with tension as their eyes locked, and Celia Delacroix's instincts told her that this was someone important.

"Celia Delacroix," a low voice rasped from across the table. "I've been expecting you."

Celia raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the man's bold statement. "Expecting me? How did you know my name?"

The figure pushed back its chair, revealing a gaunt face with sunken eyes. "Let's just say I have... connections," he said, his voice dripping with menace.

Celia's hand instinctively went to her gun, but she kept it hidden beneath the table. She had dealt with people like this before – men who seemed harmless on the surface but harbored secrets that could get her killed.

"So, what do you want?" Celia asked, trying to keep her tone neutral.

The man leaned forward, his eyes glinting in the dim light. "I have information about a case you're working on," he said, producing a small folder from his jacket pocket. "One that could change everything."

Celia's curiosity was piqued. She opened the folder, revealing a stack of documents and photographs that made her heart skip a beat.

"Who are you?" she asked, her eyes narrowing as she tried to read between the lines.

The man smiled, revealing crooked teeth. "Just someone who wants to see justice served," he said, before vanishing into thin air like a ghost.

Celia Delacroix was left staring at the empty chair, her mind reeling with questions and theories. Who was this mysterious man? And what did he want from her?

As she walked out of the café, Celia knew that this case had just gotten a lot more complicated – and intriguing.
