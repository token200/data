In the sweltering heat of ancient Rome, a young slave named Celia Flavius Vespasianus toiled away in the gardens of a wealthy patrician. Despite her humble station in life, Celia possessed an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and a sharp mind that rivaled those of the most learned philosophers.

As she tended to the lush greenery and vibrant flowers, Celia would often steal glances at the scrolls and texts scattered about the garden, devouring every word like a starving animal. Her favorite pastime was to imagine herself as the great stateswoman and leader, Julia Domna, who had once held the reins of power with such finesse.

One fateful day, a sudden downpour swept through the city, causing the nearby fountain to overflow its banks. As Celia watched in horror, her carefully tended garden began to flood, threatening to destroy everything she had worked for. In a flash of inspiration, she grabbed a nearby bucket and began to salvage what she could, her mind racing with thoughts of engineering and architecture.

As the waters receded, Celia Flavius Vespasianus stood amidst the devastation, her eyes shining with determination. She knew that this was no ordinary setback, but rather an opportunity to prove herself. And so, with the help of a kindly old architect, she set about designing a new system for harnessing the power of the fountain, one that would not only restore her garden but also benefit the entire city.

As word of her ingenuity spread, Celia's status among the patrician elite began to rise. She became known as the "Salvage Queen" and was soon in demand as a consultant on various projects throughout Rome. Her name was whispered in awe by those who had witnessed her remarkable transformation from humble slave to brilliant engineer.

Years later, as Celia Flavius Vespasianus looked out upon the sprawling metropolis she had helped shape, she knew that she had truly become the Julia Domna of her dreams â€“ a leader, a stateswoman, and a testament to the power of determination and hard work.
