Csaba Totti was a man with a reputation for being one of the most charming con artists in Budapest's underworld. With piercing green eyes and chiseled features, he could charm his way into (and out of) even the toughest of situations.

Born to a family of pickpockets and swindlers, Csaba had learned the art of deception from a young age. He began his career as a street urchin, scamming tourists on the famous Vörösmarty tér square. As he grew older, Csaba honed his skills, eventually working for some of Budapest's most notorious crime lords.

But Csaba was different from the other con artists. While they were content to swindle and deceive, Csaba had a more nuanced approach. He saw himself as an artist, using his talents to create elaborate schemes that would leave his marks both impressed and relieved.

One night, Csaba received a call from a wealthy businessman, looking for someone to help him "invest" in a lucrative deal. Csaba was intrigued by the promise of easy money and agreed to meet with the businessman.

Over a drink at a trendy bar on the Pest side of the river, Csaba listened intently as the businessman outlined his plan. It seemed that the businessman had discovered a rare gemstone hidden deep within the Hungarian countryside, and he needed someone to help him extract it from the rock face without disturbing its delicate structure.

Csaba saw an opportunity too good to pass up. He proposed a series of fake negotiations with potential investors, using his charm and charisma to convince them that the deal was worth millions. Meanwhile, Csaba would secretly assemble a team of experts to "extract" the gemstone from the rock face, all while keeping the businessman in the dark.

As the night wore on, Csaba's scheme took shape. He convinced several wealthy investors to buy into the deal, raking in hundreds of thousands of euros before anyone suspected a thing. The businessman was overjoyed, unaware that he had just been played by one of Budapest's greatest con artists.

Csaba smiled to himself as he watched the businessman leave, knowing that his reputation as the greatest con artist in Budapest was now officially cemented. But little did he know, a rival crime lord was watching him from the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike...
