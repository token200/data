Csaba Nowakowska sat alone at the café, nursing a cup of black coffee. Her dark hair was tied back in a messy bun, and her eyes seemed to hold a thousand stories. She had always been the type to keep people at arm's length, never revealing too much about herself.

A Hungarian writer, Csaba Nowakowska had made a name for herself with her haunting short stories that captured the essence of human isolation. Her writing was like a mirror held up to society, reflecting the darkest corners of the human heart.

As she sat there, lost in thought, a young journalist, Emma, walked into the café. She was new to the city, and Csaba's latest novel had been recommended to her as a must-read for any aspiring writer. Emma had always been drawn to stories about outsiders, people on the fringes of society.

Csaba noticed Emma sitting down across from her, sipping a cup of tea. Their eyes met, and for a moment, they just stared at each other. Csaba's expression softened, revealing a hint of vulnerability beneath her tough exterior.

"Mind if I join you?" Emma asked, breaking the silence.

"Not at all," Csaba replied, gesturing to the empty chair across from her.

The two women struck up a conversation, discussing everything from writing to their shared love of literature. Csaba opened up to Emma in ways she rarely did with anyone else. She spoke about her own experiences as an outsider, growing up as a child of immigrant parents in a predominantly white community.

As the hours passed, the café began to close, but Csaba and Emma remained engrossed in their conversation. It was as if they had known each other for years, not just minutes.

Eventually, Emma glanced at her watch and realized she had spent more time in the café than she thought possible. "I should probably get going," she said, reluctantly gathering her belongings.

Csaba nodded, but didn't move. "Wait," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Come back soon. I'd like to show you something."

Emma hesitated for a moment before nodding, and Csaba disappeared into the night, leaving her with more questions than answers.
