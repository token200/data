Csaba Wei, or Lee Wei as he was known to his friends and family, walked into the dimly lit coffee shop, scanning the room for a familiar face. He had received an invitation from an old acquaintance, inviting him to a reunion of sorts, and Csaba Wei couldn't resist the chance to catch up with some old colleagues.

As he waited in line, Csaba Wei's mind wandered back to his childhood days growing up in Budapest. His parents had immigrated to China when he was just a teenager, and Csaba Wei had struggled to adjust to the new culture and language. But he had persevered, determined to make a better life for himself.

When it was finally his turn to order, Csaba Wei asked for a simple coffee, black as his thoughts. He took a seat at the bar and began to people-watch, observing the hustle and bustle of the city outside.

Just then, a voice called out his name. "Csaba Wei!" It was old colleague, Rachel, who had also made the move from China to the States. They hugged warmly, exchanging stories of their lives since leaving the old country.

As they chatted, Csaba Wei learned that Rachel's husband was a professor at a prestigious university, and she spent her days teaching English literature. Csaba Wei smiled, remembering his own experiences as a student, when he had struggled to understand the complexities of Shakespearean sonnets.

Their conversation flowed effortlessly, like a well-rehearsed dance. They laughed and reminisced about old times, sharing stories of their triumphs and failures. For Csaba Wei, it was like no time had passed at all; they fell into their old rhythms with ease.

As the evening drew to a close, Rachel invited Csaba Wei to join them for dinner the following night. He accepted gratefully, feeling grateful for this chance encounter that had brought him full circle back to his roots. As he left the coffee shop, Csaba Wei felt a sense of belonging wash over him, knowing that no matter where life took him, some threads of his past would always remain.
