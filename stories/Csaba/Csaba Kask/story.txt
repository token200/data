Csaba Kask was a man with a reputation for being untouchable. A former Special Forces operative turned mercenary, he had a history of getting out of sticky situations alive. His skills in hand-to-hand combat and marksmanship were the stuff of legend among his peers.

One day, Csaba Kask found himself on the wrong side of the law once again, this time in the small town of Ravenswood. He had been hired by a mysterious client to retrieve a valuable artifact from a local museum. The catch? The museum was heavily guarded and the artifact was said to be cursed.

Csaba Kask wasn't one to believe in curses, but he did have a healthy respect for the unknown. As he snuck into the museum under the cover of night, he could feel eyes upon him. He moved swiftly and silently, avoiding security cameras and guards with ease.

Finally, he reached the artifact - a small, intricately carved box made of solid gold. Csaba Kask carefully lifted it from its display case, feeling a strange tingling sensation in his fingers. Suddenly, the lights flickered and the air seemed to chill.

Despite the ominous atmosphere, Csaba Kask remained focused on his mission. He quickly made his way back out of the museum, box in hand, and hailed a taxi on the street corner. As he sped away from Ravenswood, he couldn't shake the feeling that he had left something behind - or someone.

The mysterious client was waiting for him at the agreed-upon drop-off point, a seedy bar on the outskirts of town. Csaba Kask handed over the box, receiving a fat sum of money in exchange. As he turned to leave, he noticed a figure watching him from across the room - a woman with piercing green eyes and long, raven-black hair.

Csaba Kask's instincts told him that this was no ordinary client. He made a mental note to keep a low profile for the rest of his days, knowing that there were those who would stop at nothing to get what they wanted - and he had just become their next target.
