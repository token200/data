Csaba Bernard stepped out of his worn leather satchel, the scent of old books and pipe tobacco wafting up to greet him. He stretched his lanky frame, yawned, and shuffled towards the café where he knew a warm cup of coffee awaited.

As a retired professor of ancient languages, Csaba had spent most of his life studying the forgotten tongues of the past. His eyes sparkled with excitement as he pored over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls, unraveling secrets that few others dared to touch. But now, in his golden years, he'd traded academia for a simpler, more peaceful existence.

Inside the café, Csaba spotted an old acquaintance, József, hunched over a newspaper. They exchanged warm greetings, Csaba's eyes scanning the room for familiar faces before settling on József's. The retired schoolteacher nodded towards the back of the café, where a frail figure sat shrouded in shadows.

Csaba recognized the elder as his old friend, Éva Szabo, a woman he'd known since their university days. Éva had always been an enigma – her eyes twinkling with secrets and stories that few dared to share. She beckoned Csaba over with a bony finger, her frail body seeming to sag under the weight of time.

As Csaba approached, Éva's hands fluttered through his hair, like a mother stroking her child's locks. "Csaba, my friend," she whispered, her voice barely audible, "I have found something."

Éva pulled out an ancient, yellowed scroll from beneath her shawl and unrolled it on the small table between them. The parchment was worn and frayed, but Csaba's trained eyes could discern the intricate script scrawled upon its surface.

"The letters," Éva began, her voice growing stronger with each word, "they speak of a forgotten language – one hidden within the very fabric of our tongues. A dialect so old that even I dare not share it with anyone."

As Csaba's mind grasped at the significance, the air in the café grew heavy, and the shadows seemed to deepen around Éva. The two friends sat transfixed, lost in the mystery of Éva's discovery.

The hours passed like wisps of smoke, each one slipping away from them like grains of sand. And when the sun dipped below the city's rooftops, casting the café into a soft, twilight glow, Csaba Bernard knew that this was only the beginning of his greatest adventure yet – an odyssey to unravel the secrets hidden within the forgotten language.

Csaba smiled, the corners of his eyes crinkling with excitement. He leaned in closer to Éva and whispered, "Tell me more."
