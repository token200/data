Csaba Dolera stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the unfamiliar station. He had been on the move for weeks, trying to escape the memories that haunted him. As a former member of the elite Hungarian Special Forces unit, Csaba Dolera had seen things no man should ever have to see. The scars on his body and mind still lingered.

He made his way through the crowded station, dodging tourists and locals alike. Csaba Dolera's gaze locked onto a small caf√© across the street, its worn sign creaking in the gentle breeze. He pushed open the door, and the bell above it let out a tired clang.

Inside, the air was thick with the smell of stale coffee and yesterday's cigarettes. Csaba Dolera slid onto a stool at the counter, his eyes adjusting to the dim light. The bartender, a gruff old man with a scruffy beard, looked him up and down before nodding in recognition.

"Csaba Dolera," he said, his voice low. "I've heard of you."

Csaba Dolera's expression remained neutral, but a spark of curiosity flickered to life within him. How did this stranger know his name?

The bartender poured Csaba Dolera a cup of black coffee, and he took a sip, feeling the bitter flavor wash over him. It was a taste he had grown accustomed to in recent months.

"What do you want to know?" Csaba Dolera asked, his voice firm.

The bartender leaned in close, his eyes glinting with a mixture of curiosity and concern. "I've heard stories about your time in the Special Forces," he whispered. "Stories about the things you saw, the things you did."

Csaba Dolera's gaze drifted out into the crowd, his mind wandering to the memories he had tried so hard to forget. He knew that he would never be able to escape them completely, but maybe this stranger could help him find some semblance of peace.

"Tell me more," Csaba Dolera said finally, his voice barely above a whisper.

The bartender nodded, and began to speak in hushed tones, revealing secrets that Csaba Dolera had long suppressed. As he listened, the weight on his shoulders seemed to grow lighter, ever so slightly.
