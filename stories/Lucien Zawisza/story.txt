Lucien Zawisza stood at the edge of the rooftop, his eyes scanning the rain-soaked streets below. The neon lights of the city reflected off the wet pavement like a mirage, casting a gaudy glow over the concrete jungle. He lit a cigarette, inhaling the smoke as he watched the world go by.

As a private investigator, Lucien had seen it all - from missing persons cases to corporate espionage. But there was something about this job that drew him in, like a moth to flame. Perhaps it was the thrill of the chase, or the puzzle to be solved. Whatever it was, he was hooked.

Tonight was no exception. A wealthy businessman named Marcus had hired Lucien to investigate a string of mysterious break-ins at his high-rise office building. The security team had been stumped, and Marcus was offering a hefty sum for someone who could crack the case.

Lucien took a long drag on his cigarette, feeling the cool breeze on his face as he pondered the task ahead. He was no amateur sleuth, but there were always loose ends to tie up and mysteries to unravel. His latest project seemed like a good place to start.

He pulled out a notebook and began jotting down notes as he surveyed the rooftop. The wind whipped through his hair, sending it flying in every direction. Lucien laughed wryly - only in New York City could you get blown around by a gust of wind.

As he worked, his mind wandered back to the case itself. Who was behind the break-ins? And what were they after? Marcus seemed genuinely worried, but there had to be more to it than just some opportunistic thief.

The sound of footsteps interrupted Lucien's reverie. He looked up to see a petite woman with striking green eyes and jet-black hair walking towards him. She flashed a smile as she approached.

"You must be Lucien Zawisza," she said, extending a hand. "I'm Sophia, the CEO's niece."

Lucien raised an eyebrow but shook her hand firmly. "Nice to meet you, Sophia."

Sophia leaned against the railing, her eyes glinting with intelligence. "So, what do you make of it? Can you help my uncle solve this mystery?"

Lucien snorted, blowing out a stream of smoke. "I don't make promises, kid. But I'll give it a shot. When can we start digging?"

Sophia smiled again and nodded. "How about now? We've got no time to waste."

With that, Lucien's eyes snapped back into focus. He exhaled slowly, feeling the familiar rush of adrenaline course through his veins. The game was on, and he was ready to play.
