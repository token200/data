Levi Junko stood atop the ruined city, his eyes scanning the desolate landscape below. The once-thriving metropolis was now nothing but rubble and ash, a testament to the devastating power of war. As a member of the Scout Regiment, Levi had seen his fair share of battles, but this one still haunted him.

He thought back to the early days, when he had first joined the regiment with such high hopes and idealism. He had been convinced that they were fighting for a noble cause - to reclaim Wall Maria from the Titans. But as time went on, Levi began to realize that it was all just a facade. The Titans were simply a distraction from the real enemy: humanity's own greed and shortsightedness.

Levi's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps behind him. He turned to see Armin, his captain and friend, approaching him with a determined look on his face.

"Levi, we've received word that the Titans are mobilizing," Armin said, his voice low and urgent. "We need to gear up and prepare for the battle ahead."

Levi nodded curtly, already knowing what needed to be done. He followed Armin as they made their way back to the regiment's base, his mind racing with strategies and tactics.

As they arrived at the base, Levi was greeted by the familiar sight of his comrades, all busy preparing for the impending battle. There was Hange, tinkering with her latest contraption, while Erwin stood at the center of it all, directing the troops with a calm, authoritative air.

Levi's thoughts turned to Erwin, and he couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness. His captain had always been like a father figure to him, guiding him and pushing him to be his best self. But now, Erwin was nowhere to be found - either in body or in spirit.

The battle began, and Levi led the charge alongside Armin and Hange. The Titans roared as they approached, but Levi's trained eyes picked out weaknesses and vulnerabilities that others might miss. He sliced through the monsters with ease, his blades slicing through flesh and bone alike.

As the day wore on, the casualties mounted, but Levi's focus never wavered. He knew that this was only the beginning - that the real battle lay ahead, in the depths of Wall Maria itself.

And yet, even as he fought on, a part of Levi couldn't help but wonder: what was the point of it all? Was this endless struggle against the Titans truly worth fighting for?

Only time would tell. For now, Levi Junko stood tall, his blades flashing in the sunlight as he charged forward into the unknown.
