Aleksandra Molnár stepped out of the worn wooden door and onto the rain-soaked streets of Budapest. The sound of the city was always alive, but tonight it seemed particularly vibrant, like the notes of a solo piano piece swirling through her mind.

As she walked, the dim streetlights casting long shadows behind her, Aleksandra felt the weight of her memories settle around her shoulders. It had been ten years since she'd left this city, leaving behind the only home she'd ever known. Ten years since she'd fled with a suitcase full of secrets and a heart heavy with grief.

Aleksandra's thoughts turned to her parents, who still lived in Budapest, their small apartment a testament to the life they had built together. She remembered her mother's laughter as she cooked dinner in the kitchen, the scent of paprika wafting through the air. Her father's words of encouragement as he helped her with her violin, his hands gentle on her shoulder.

As she turned a corner, Aleksandra caught sight of the Danube River stretching out before her, its dark waters glinting like a snake in the moonlight. She felt an overwhelming urge to run towards it, to lose herself in the currents and let go of the pain that had been holding her back for so long.

Aleksandra took a deep breath and began to walk along the riverbank, feeling the cool mist on her skin as she passed by the boats and the people. She felt alive again, like the city was awakening something within her. As she walked, the memories came flooding back – the lessons at school, her friends, the moments of joy that had made her feel like she was flying.

Eventually, Aleksandra found herself in front of a small café on the riverbank. It was a place where her parents used to take her when they were young, sipping coffee and watching the sun rise over the city. She pushed open the door, feeling a sense of belonging that had been missing from her life for so long.

As she took a seat at the bar, Aleksandra noticed a piece of paper on the table, scribbled with a message in familiar handwriting – her mother's. "Come home," it read. "We're waiting."
