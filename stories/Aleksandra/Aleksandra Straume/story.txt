Aleksandra "Lexi" Straume stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. She had been away for months, studying abroad in Germany, and was finally returning home to Portland, Oregon. The crisp Pacific air enveloped her as she breathed it in deeply, feeling a sense of relief wash over her.

As she made her way through the crowd, Lexi's thoughts turned to her family and friends back in Portland. Her parents, Joris and Astrid Straume, had been worried sick about her while she was away, but they had also encouraged her to take this opportunity to explore her passions and interests. Lexi's best friend, Rachel Kim, had promised to meet her at the station and drive her home.

After a quick stop at the post office to send a package to Joris and Astrid, Lexi hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of her family's house in the Pearl District. As they drove through the city, Lexi felt a sense of nostalgia wash over her. She had spent countless hours exploring these streets as a child, discovering hidden cafes and bookstores, and watching the sunset over the Willamette River.

The taxi pulled up in front of her parents' house, and Lexi leapt out, eager to give them a hug. Her mother, Astrid, was waiting on the porch with a bouquet of flowers, while her father, Joris, carried a large basket filled with treats from the markets.

"Welcome home, Lexi!" her mother exclaimed, as Lexi flung herself into their arms.

Over the next few days, Lexi settled back into life in Portland. She spent hours catching up with Rachel, and began to think about her future plans. With her degree in environmental studies complete, she was determined to make a difference in her community.

As she looked out the window of her family's house, watching the sun set over the city, Lexi felt grateful for this second chance. She knew that she had grown and learned so much during her time abroad, and she was eager to bring those experiences back to Portland, and share them with her loved ones.
