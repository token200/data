As a renowned private investigator in Latvia's capital city, Riga, she had built a reputation for being one of the best in the business. Her sharp mind and quick wit made her an invaluable asset to her clients, who came from all walks of life.

One evening, as Aleksandra Lāce walked along the winding streets of Old Town, she received a cryptic message from a wealthy businessman named Viktor. He requested her presence at his mansion on the outskirts of the city, claiming he had information about a valuable artifact that was being stolen. Intrigued, Aleksandra Lāce agreed to meet him.
