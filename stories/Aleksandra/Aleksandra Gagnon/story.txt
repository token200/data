Aleksandra Gagnon stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. As she waited in line, her mind wandered to the reasons that brought her here tonight. It had been months since her departure from Montreal, and the memories still lingered.

As she ordered her coffee, Aleksandra's gaze fell upon a figure sitting alone at a corner table. The same person who had written to her, pouring their heart out about their struggles and passions. She felt an inexplicable pull towards them, as if fate was nudging her in their direction.

With a newfound sense of determination, Aleksandra approached the table, her heels clicking on the floorboards. The stranger looked up, startled by her sudden arrival. Their eyes locked, and for a moment, time stood still.

"Mind if I join you?" Aleksandra asked, trying to sound nonchalant despite the butterflies in her stomach.

The stranger shook their head, a hint of surprise still lingering on their face. "Not at all," they replied, pushing a chair out from under the table.

As Aleksandra sat down, the air seemed to thicken with tension. She reached for her coffee, but instead found herself lost in the stranger's piercing green eyes. It was as if she had known them for years, not just minutes.

Their conversation flowed effortlessly, like a well-rehearsed dance. Aleksandra discovered that this person, who introduced themselves as Luna, shared her passion for literature and art. The connection was undeniable, and before she knew it, the night had slipped away into a whirlwind of laughter and shared stories.

As the café began to close, Aleksandra knew she couldn't leave yet. "I'm so glad I found you," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Luna's smile lit up the dimly lit room. "Me too, Aleksandra Gagnon." The way they said her name sent shivers down her spine – it was as if they knew secrets that only they shared.
