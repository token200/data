Aleksandra WÃ³jcik stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station. She had been away for what felt like an eternity, and the familiarity of the place was a comforting feeling. The bustling streets of Krakow were still just a short walk away.

As she made her way through the crowd, Aleksandra's thoughts turned to the reason she'd come back. Her grandmother, Babcia, lay bedridden in the hospital, her once-sharp mind clouded by the illness that had taken hold. Aleksandra had promised to be there for her, and now that promise was all that kept her going.

She hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of her family's old townhouse. The worn wooden floor creaked beneath her feet as she entered, and the smell of old books and baking wafted through the air. Her grandmother had always been a fierce cook, and the scent transported Aleksandra back to lazy summer afternoons spent playing hide-and-seek in the kitchen.

Aleksandra knocked on the door, and her mother answered with a mixture of relief and exhaustion. "You're here," she said, a small smile spreading across her face. "We were worried you wouldn't make it."

Aleksandra hugged her mother tightly, feeling a wave of emotions wash over her. She had always been close to her grandmother, who had taught her the stories and legends of their people. Now, as she stood in this familiar space, Aleksandra felt a sense of purpose wash over her. She would be here for Babcia, no matter what.

The rest of the day was a blur of hospital visits and long conversations with her mother, but Aleksandra barely noticed. Her focus was on getting closer to her grandmother, on holding onto the memories and stories that had been passed down through generations. As she sat by Babcia's bedside, Aleksandra's eyes locked onto hers, filled with love and determination. "I'll be here for you, Babcia," she whispered, her voice barely audible over the beeping machines. And in that moment, she knew she would do anything to ensure her grandmother received the care and love she deserved.
