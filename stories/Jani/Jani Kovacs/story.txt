Jani Kovacs sat in her dimly lit apartment, staring out the window as the rain poured down on the streets below. A former detective with the Los Angeles Police Department's Special Cases Division, Jani had seen her fair share of darkness and despair. But after a particularly grueling case had left her shaken, she'd decided to leave the force and start fresh.

As she sipped her coffee, Jani's mind wandered back to the events that had led her to this point. The memories still lingered, like open wounds on her psyche. She thought about her partner, Detective Murphy, who had been killed in the line of duty just a few months prior. The pain of his loss still felt fresh, and she often found herself wondering what could have been if he were still alive.

Jani's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her phone buzzing on the coffee table. It was an anonymous number, but Jani knew better than to ignore it. She answered, her heart rate picking up as she heard a low, gravelly voice on the other end.

"Detective Kovacs," the voice said, "I think I can help you find some answers."

Jani's eyes narrowed. Who was this person, and how did they know her name? But something about their tone put her at ease, so she asked, "What do you have to say?"

The voice hesitated before speaking. "There are things that didn't add up on your case with Murphy. Things that could explain why he died the way he did."

Jani's ears perked up, and she felt a spark of interest ignite within her. This could be it â€“ the break she'd been searching for. "Tell me more," she said, leaning forward.

The voice paused once more before responding, "Meet me at the old warehouse on 5th and Main if you want to know the truth."

Jani's instincts told her this was a risk worth taking. She grabbed her jacket and headed out into the rain, ready to face whatever lay ahead. As she disappeared into the night, one thing was certain: Jani Kovacs was about to uncover some secrets that would change everything.
