Jani Kovács stood alone on the edge of the frozen lake, her eyes fixed on the dark silhouette of her boat. The cold air stung her cheeks as she breathed in, the scent of pine and woodsmoke carried on the wind. It was a crisp autumn morning, the kind that made you want to stay inside with a warm cup of coffee.

But Jani wasn't one for cozy comforts. She was a wanderer at heart, always drawn to the unknown, the untamed. As a child, she'd spent hours exploring the forests and fields around her village, collecting strange stones and leaves, dreaming of adventures beyond the horizon.

Years later, as a seasoned sailor, Jani had grown restless in the familiar rhythms of village life. She set out on her own, charting a course for the open sea. The wind and waves became her companions, teaching her patience and resilience. Her boat, a sturdy vessel named Éva, had become an extension of herself.

Now, as she stood before Éva, Jani felt the familiar thrill of anticipation. She'd heard whispers of a hidden cove on this lake, sheltered from the wind by towering trees and overgrown with lichen. Some said it was cursed, while others claimed to have seen the ghostly outlines of ancient rituals in its depths.

Jani didn't believe in curses or ghosts, but she did know that there was something alluring about the unknown. She pushed off Éva's bow and stepped aboard, feeling the wooden hull creak beneath her feet. The engine roared to life as she cast off, leaving the lake's quiet shore behind.

The sun climbed higher in the sky, casting long shadows across the water. Jani felt a sense of freedom with each stroke of the oars, as if the very rhythm of the waves was teaching her secrets she'd never heard before. She rowed on, lost in thought, until Éva rounded a bend and the trees parted to reveal a hidden cove.

The air was thick with mist, veiling the shore in mystery. Jani felt an electric shiver run down her spine as she gazed into the heart of the cove. Was it indeed cursed? Or perhaps something more – a promise, a secret, or a doorway to other worlds?

Jani leaned forward, her eyes drinking in the secrets hidden within the veil of mist and water.
