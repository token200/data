Jani Sundberg stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the small town that had once been her home. It was hard to believe it had been ten years since she'd left, chasing a dream of becoming a writer. Now, as she walked through the quiet streets, Jani felt a sense of nostalgia wash over her.

She had returned to Ravenswood for one reason: to attend her mother's funeral. The news had come as a shock, and Jani couldn't bear the thought of facing this small town without her. Her mother, Hanne Sundberg, had been more than just a parent - she was Jani's best friend and confidante.

As Jani made her way to the cemetery, she felt a mix of emotions swirling inside her. She missed her mother's warm smile and infectious laughter, but also the weight of their complicated past. They'd never been close, not like other families, and Jani often wondered what could have been if they had.

The mourners parted as Jani approached the grave, and she felt a lump form in her throat as she gazed at the weathered headstone. Her mother's name was emblazoned on it in bold letters: Hanne Sundberg. Jani took a deep breath and began to speak, sharing stories of their time together - the late-night conversations, the laughter-filled afternoons, and the quiet moments of comfort.

As she spoke, Jani felt a sense of peace settle over her. It was as if her mother was listening from beyond the grave, her presence warm and comforting. The sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the cemetery, and Jani knew that this was where she needed to be - surrounded by memories, and the people who cared for her.

With tears streaming down her face, Jani placed a hand on the headstone, feeling a sense of closure wash over her. She knew that her mother would always be with her, in spirit if not in body. And as she walked away from the grave, Jani Sundberg felt a renewed sense of purpose - to carry on her mother's legacy, and to write the stories that had been locked away inside her for so long.
