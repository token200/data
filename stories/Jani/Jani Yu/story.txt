The sun had long since set on the bustling streets of Korriban, casting a dark and ominous glow over the planet's twisted landscape. Jani Yu, a young apprentice to the Sith Lord Darth Maul, walked alone through the shadows, her lightsaber humming softly in her hand.

As she navigated the narrow alleys, Jani couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. She had always been sensitive to the dark side's influence, and lately, it seemed like an unseen presence was closing in around her.

Jani Yu stopped at a small cantina on the outskirts of town, ordering a cup of wine as she slid onto a stool at the bar. The bartender, a gruff but friendly Twi'lek named Greez, raised an eyebrow as Jani settled beside him.

"What brings you out tonight, young one?" he asked, his voice low and conspiratorial.

Jani hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. She was still learning to navigate the complex web of Sith politics, and she didn't want to draw unnecessary attention to herself. But there was something about Greez's kind eyes that put her at ease, and she found herself opening up to him about her growing unease.

As they talked, Jani couldn't help but think back to her days as a Padawan learner on the Jedi Temple world of Coruscant. She had been so full of hope and idealism then, believing in the noble cause of peace and justice that the Jedi were sworn to uphold. Now, as an apprentice to Darth Maul, she was forced to confront the harsh realities of the dark side.

Jani Yu sipped her wine thoughtfully, feeling a sense of disconnection wash over her. She wondered if she had made a terrible mistake by joining the Sith, or if there was still a chance for redemption within its twisted ranks.

Greez watched her with a sympathetic expression, and Jani knew that he understood more than he let on. As the night wore on, she left the cantina with a newfound determination: to navigate the treacherous landscape of Sith politics without losing herself completely in the process.
