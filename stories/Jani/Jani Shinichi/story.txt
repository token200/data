Jani Shinichi sat alone in her small apartment, staring blankly at the wall as she tried to process her emotions. It had been three months since she'd received the letter from her estranged father, informing her that he was leaving Japan and never coming back. Jani's heart ached with every passing day, wondering if she would ever see him again.

As she wandered around the room, running her fingers over the familiar contours of the wooden furniture, Jani's mind began to wander back to her childhood. She remembered the countless hours spent playing hide-and-seek in the attic with her father, laughing and giggling as they chased each other through the dusty trunks and forgotten treasures.

Her eyes landed on an old photograph that she had tucked away in a drawer. It was a picture of Jani and her father, taken on one of their many adventures together. She remembered how he had made her laugh with his silly impressions and jokes, and how he had always been there to support her no matter what.

Jani's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her phone ringing. It was her best friend, Emily, calling to check in. Jani hesitated for a moment before answering, not wanting to burden Emily with her sorrow. But as she began to talk, she found herself opening up about her feelings and her fears.

Emily listened attentively, offering words of encouragement and support. "You're strong, Jani," she said. "You can get through this. Your father may be gone, but his love for you will always remain."

Jani felt a lump form in her throat as she listened to Emily's words. She realized that she had been holding onto anger and resentment towards her father, rather than the love and forgiveness that she truly needed. As she hung up the phone, Jani made a decision - it was time to let go of the past and move forward with an open heart.

With newfound determination, Jani stood up and began to tidy up her apartment, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. She knew that her father may be gone, but his legacy lived on through her, and she was determined to make him proud.
