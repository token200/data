Jani Avendano stepped out of her small apartment and onto the bustling streets of Los Angeles. As a freelance graphic designer, she spent most of her days hunched over her laptop, trying to make ends meet. But on this particular morning, Jani felt a sense of restlessness wash over her. She needed a change of scenery.

She walked down to the local park and settled into a quiet corner, watching as people jogged by or played with their kids. The sun was shining, casting a warm glow over everything. For a moment, Jani forgot about her deadlines and worries, letting the peacefulness of the surroundings seep into her bones.

As she sat there, a young girl approached her, clutching a sketchbook in one hand and a pencil in the other. "Excuse me," the girl said, looking up at Jani with big brown eyes. "I'm trying to draw you."

Jani smiled, feeling a pang of curiosity. "What makes you want to draw me?" she asked.

The girl hesitated before answering. "You look like someone who's been through a lot. But still, you're happy."

Jani was taken aback by the girl's insight. She had always tried to put on a brave face for the world, but sometimes it felt like everyone could see right through her.

Just then, Jani's phone buzzed with a text from her best friend, Maria. "Hey, girl! What's up? Need any help with anything?" Jani smiled, feeling grateful for Maria's constant support. She had been struggling to make ends meet lately, but Maria always seemed to know just what to say.

"Actually, I think I need a change of scenery," Jani replied, typing out the message. "I'm going to take some time off and focus on my art."

Maria responded with a string of enthusiastic emojis and a promise to come visit soon. As Jani finished her text, she felt a sense of excitement wash over her. Maybe this was exactly what she needed â€“ a chance to rediscover herself and pursue her passions.

With renewed energy, Jani stood up and began to walk away from the park. She knew that life wouldn't be easy, but for now, she just wanted to take things one step at a time, and see where the universe took her next.
