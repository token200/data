Jani Roberts stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Rachel, huddled in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee. Jani made her way over, her long brown hair swinging with each step.

As she sat down beside Rachel, Jani couldn't help but notice the look of concern etched on her friend's face. "What's wrong?" Jani asked, her voice soft and gentle.

Rachel hesitated before speaking. "I got a letter from my mom today," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "She's not doing well, Jani. She needs me to come back home."

Jani's expression softened further as she reached out and placed a reassuring hand on Rachel's arm. "I'm so sorry, Rach. What are you going to do?"

Rachel sighed, her shoulders sagging under the weight of the news. "I don't know," she admitted. "Part of me wants to go back, but another part of me is scared."

Jani nodded understandingly, recalling her own experiences with family struggles. She had always been close to her parents, but their divorce when she was 16 had left a deep scar. She knew how hard it was to navigate those kinds of situations.

As they sipped their coffee in silence, Jani's mind began to wander back to her own life. She was working on her degree in photography, trying to build a career that would take her away from the struggles of her past. Her parents had always encouraged her passion for art, but she knew she needed to make a name for herself.

The café door swung open, and Jani's gaze landed on a figure she hadn't seen in months – her ex-boyfriend, Alex. Their breakup had been messy, but Jani had moved on. She smiled wryly to herself as she watched him interact with the waiter, his carefree nature a stark contrast to Rachel's woes.

As the evening drew to a close, Jani stood up, determination etched on her face. "I'll be here for you, Rach," she said firmly. "We'll figure this out together."
