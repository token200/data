Jani Becker sat alone in her small apartment, staring blankly at the wall as she tried to shake off the feeling of emptiness that had been following her for weeks. A successful event planner in her late 20s, Jani had always been known for her meticulous attention to detail and ability to bring people together, but lately, she'd been struggling to find meaning in her work.

As she sipped on a cup of lukewarm coffee, Jani's mind wandered back to the previous night's wedding. She had spent hours ensuring every detail was perfect, from the intricate flower arrangements to the carefully curated playlist, and yet, as she watched the happy couple exchange their vows, she couldn't shake off the feeling that it all felt so... routine.

Jani's phone buzzed with an incoming text from her best friend, Emily. "Hey girl, what's going on? You've been MIA for days," it read. Jani smiled wistfully as she typed out a response, telling Emily about her latest existential crisis and asking if she could meet up for brunch.

As she waited for Emily to arrive, Jani began to tidy up her apartment, trying to shake off the feeling of restlessness that had been building inside her. She put away the last of the cleaning supplies and took a deep breath, letting out a sigh as she settled onto the couch.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. "Hey, Jani!" Emily exclaimed, flopping down beside her on the couch. The two friends spent the next few hours talking about everything from their jobs to their love lives, and for the first time in weeks, Jani felt like she could finally exhale.

Over coffee and pancakes, Jani confided in Emily about her latest fear: that she was losing herself in the process of planning other people's special days. Emily listened attentively, nodding along as Jani spoke. "You don't have to lose yourself in your work, Jani," she said finally. "Maybe it's time you started planning something for yourself."
