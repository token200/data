Eveliis Nurlanov was born on a chilly winter morning in the remote region of Kyrgyzstan. His early years were spent in the shadow of his older brother, who had left home to pursue a better life in the cities. As the youngest of five siblings, Eveliis grew up with a sense of restlessness, longing for adventure and something more.

As he entered adolescence, Eveliis discovered his passion for photography. He spent countless hours capturing the breathtaking landscapes and rugged beauty of the Kyrgyz countryside on film. His brother, now a successful businessman in Bishkek, encouraged Eveliis's talent, providing him with cameras and lessons from renowned photographers who had traveled to their village.

With each passing year, Eveliis's portfolio grew, showcasing the harsh yet majestic world he called home. He won several local competitions and attracted attention from art schools in nearby cities. Yet, his heart remained tied to the rural landscape where he was born.

One summer, Eveliis received an invitation to exhibit his work at a prominent gallery in Moscow, alongside some of Russia's most celebrated photographers. It was a life-changing opportunity that would take him far beyond the borders of Kyrgyzstan for the first time.

The months leading up to his departure were filled with anxiety and excitement as Eveliis packed and prepared for this leap into the unknown. He bid farewell to his family, promising to stay connected through phone calls and letters. As he settled into Moscow's bustling streets, Eveliis marveled at the skyscrapers, museums, and street art that seemed to pulse with a different energy.

Upon arrival, Eveliis was warmly received by gallery owner, Maria Mikhailova, who saw potential in his unique perspective on the world. Over dinner one evening, she shared stories of Soviet-era photography, which sparked curiosity within him about the politics and social landscape of Russia during that era.

The exhibition itself became a defining moment for Eveliis â€“ an opportunity to connect with art historians, critics, and photographers who had inspired him throughout his journey. Critics praised his evocative photographs, often referring to his "Kazakh landscapes as modern-day analogues to Chagall." His Kyrgyz roots resonated deeply in the Russian audience, as they began to appreciate Eveliis's unique voice.

Though Eveliis knew he might never return to the remote region where he was born, a piece of him would forever be connected to that frozen tundra, echoing back at him through photographs and memories. The once restless child had grown into an accomplished photographer with a deeper understanding of his roots, forever changed by his time in Moscow.
