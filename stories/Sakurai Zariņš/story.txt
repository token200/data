Sakurai Zariņš stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. He had been traveling for days, and the familiar sight of his homeland's landscape was a welcome respite from the unfamiliar faces he'd encountered on his journey.

As a renowned detective, Sakurai Zariņš was no stranger to solitude. His years spent tracking down some of Japan's most elusive felons had left him with few close friends and even fewer allies. But as he made his way through the station, he sensed that something was off.

The train station was usually bustling with activity - merchants hawking their wares, travelers rushing to catch their connections, and local folk exchanging gossip over steaming bowls of noodle soup. Yet today, there was an unsettling silence.

Zariņš's instincts told him that someone had been here recently, perhaps even just hours ago. He followed the faint scent of incense and old books to a small tea house tucked away in a corner of the station. The sign above the door read "Kobayashi-san's Teahouse."

"Ah, Detective Sakurai," Kobayashi-san said in a low, measured tone. "I've been expecting you."

Zariņš's hand instinctively went to the can of pepper spray hidden beneath his jacket. He had dealt with many unsavory characters in his line of work, but there was something unnerving about Kobayashi-san's calm demeanor.

"What do you want, Mr. Kobayashi?" Zariņš asked, trying to keep his tone neutral.

"I believe our paths have crossed for a reason," the old man replied, his eyes glinting with an otherworldly intensity. "You see, Detective, I've been tracking a rather... unsavory individual myself."

Zariņš's curiosity was piqued. "Who is it?"

Kobayashi-san leaned forward, his voice taking on a conspiratorial tone. "Someone you least expect, yet perhaps know all too well."

With those enigmatic words, the door to the tea house swung open once more. In strode Yumi Saito
