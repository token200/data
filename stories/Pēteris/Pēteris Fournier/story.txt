The owner of the café, an elderly woman named Jelena, noticed Pēteris's sketchbook lying open on a nearby table. Intrigued by his art, she approached him with a curious smile and asked if she could see more of his work.

With this newfound success came opportunities that had never previously arisen in his life. He traveled to more distant lands, meeting fellow artists and absorbing new ideas, always refining his craft with each passing day. Pēteris Fournier's passion remained unwavering, a testament to the enduring power of art to touch hearts and minds.
