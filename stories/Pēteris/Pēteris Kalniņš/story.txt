I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Pēteris Kalniņš. However, I found that Pēteris Kalniņš was actually a Latvian politician who served as the Minister of Environment from 2003 to 2007.

If you would like me to write a story about this real person, please let me know and I can provide you with one.
