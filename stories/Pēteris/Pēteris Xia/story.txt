Pēteris Xia sat on the worn wooden dock, his eyes fixed on the flickering candles that cast eerie shadows on the water. He had always been drawn to this place, where the sea and sky seemed to blend into an endless expanse of darkness.

As a child, Pēteris would sneak out at night with his grandmother, who told him stories of their ancestors' bravery and magic. They said that the Xia family held secrets hidden within the depths of the ocean, waiting for those brave enough to unlock them.

Years went by, and Pēteris became increasingly restless. He felt an unshakeable pull towards the sea, a sense that there was something more out there for him. His grandmother had passed away when he was young, but his memories of their nights on the dock remained vivid.

Now, as a grown man, Pēteris found himself back at this very spot, feeling lost and disconnected from the world around him. He took a deep breath, letting the salty air fill his lungs, and began to recite an ancient incantation that only his grandmother had taught him.

The words seemed to awaken something within him, and he felt a surge of energy course through his veins. The candles on the dock flickered faster, casting wild patterns across the water's surface. Pēteris closed his eyes, allowing himself to be pulled into the depths of the ocean.

In that moment, he was transported back to a time when magic was real, and his ancestors' secrets lay hidden in plain sight. He saw the Xia family crest – an intricate design of waves and stars – etched on a glowing stone beneath the waves.

The vision shifted, revealing Pēteris himself as a young boy, playing with the same candles on the dock. His grandmother smiled at him from beside him, her eyes twinkling with mischief.

Pēteris' eyes snapped open, and he was back on the dock, surrounded by the eerie silence of the night. But something had changed within him – a sense of purpose had been awakened. He stood up, feeling lighter, freer. The waves seemed to be calling him, urging him to explore their depths.

With newfound determination, Pēteris stepped into the darkness, leaving behind the flickering candles and his own world. The sea stretched out before him like an endless canvas, waiting for him to unlock its secrets.
