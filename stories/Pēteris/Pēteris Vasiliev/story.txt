Rumors swirled about Pēteris Vasiliev's origins, with some claiming he hailed from the streets of Riga, while others whispered that he was a descendant of a noble family. One thing was certain, however: Pēteris Vasiliev had an uncanny eye for rare and valuable art pieces.

One evening, Pēteris Vasiliev found himself in front of the grand Louvre Museum in Paris. He had received a cryptic message about a newly acquired Monet watercolor that he simply could not resist acquiring. As he watched from the shadows, a security guard walked by, oblivious to his presence.

Without hesitation, Pēteris Vasiliev sprang into action, expertly picking the lock on a side door and slipping inside.
