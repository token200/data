As a highly skilled operative, he had worked for top-secret government agencies and private corporations alike. Rafael's exceptional talent for infiltration and deception made him the go-to agent for high-stakes missions.

One fateful night, Rafael Balode received a cryptic message from his handler, beckoning him to a remote location deep in the heart of Eastern Europe.

Upon arrival, Rafael Balode spotted a figure cloaked in shadows. As he approached, the figure stepped forward, revealing none other than his old acquaintance, Victor Kuznetsov.
