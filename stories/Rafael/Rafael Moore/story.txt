Rafael "Rae" Moore stepped out of his small studio apartment, blinking in the bright morning light. He rubbed the fatigue from his eyes, already dreading the long day ahead. As a freelance writer and editor, Rae's work was irregular, and he often found himself juggling multiple projects with limited pay.

But today was different. Today, he had an appointment with his favorite barista, Luna, at the local café on the corner. She always had a smile and a warm cup of coffee waiting for him, just to see if he needed a boost.

Rae made his way through the bustling streets, dodging pedestrians and cars as he walked. He passed by the park where he used to play guitar with friends, but now it seemed too crowded and noisy. The music scene in the city had changed since they'd left college; Rae was no longer part of it.

As he pushed open the door to the café, Luna looked up from behind the counter, a sparkle in her eyes. "Hey, Rae! Your usual?" she asked, nodding toward the coffee pot.

Rae smiled, feeling a pang of gratitude for this small ritual that kept him sane. "Yeah, please."

Luna handed him a steaming cup and asked about his day. Rae hesitated, unsure how much to share. But there was something about Luna's listening ears that made him open up.

"I had an audition yesterday," he said, pouring himself a cup of coffee. "For a novel I'm working on. I don't think I got it."

Luna nodded sympathetically. "Don't worry, Rae. You'll get another chance. And in the meantime, you've got your words. That's what matters."

Rae took a sip of his coffee, feeling the warmth spread through his chest. Luna was right; his writing was his salvation. It gave him a sense of purpose when everything else seemed uncertain.

As he left the café and began walking home, Rae felt a weight lift off his shoulders. He didn't know what the future held, but for now, he had his words, his music, and the people who understood him. And that was all that mattered.
