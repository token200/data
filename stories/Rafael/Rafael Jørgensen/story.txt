Rafael Jørgensen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the salty sea air filling his lungs. He had been away from Copenhagen for months, but the feeling of being landlocked never truly left him. As he made his way through the crowded station, he spotted a familiar figure waiting by the entrance – Sofia, his sister.

Sofia was the glue that held their chaotic family together, always ready with a warm smile and a clever quip to defuse even the most tense of situations. She had taken it upon herself to organize Rafael's return, booking him on the train from Odense and arranging for a driver to meet them at the station.

As they hugged, Sofia asked about his journey – a mix of city breaks in Rome and hiking excursions in the mountains. He was quiet about his true destination: the small fishing village where their father grew up. Rafael had always felt a connection to the sea, and he hoped that being back here would help him reconnect with his roots.

Their driver, Jørgen, greeted them warmly and handed Sofia a battered leather suitcase. 'You've got it all,' she said, as they climbed into the truck. The drive took hours, but Rafael watched the landscape unfold outside – sandy beaches, quaint villages, and vast expanses of open water.

As they arrived in their father's old village, the smell of saltwater and fish wafted through the air. Rafael's stomach twisted with a mix of excitement and nerves. They had always been tight-knit, but he knew that his return would stir up more than just emotions.

Their father sat on the porch, sipping tea as they pulled up. His eyes lit upon Rafael, and for a moment, time seemed to stand still. The tension between them was palpable, but it was not as raw as Rafael had feared.

Over dinner, their father asked about his work in Rome – architecture, he said. 'You're good at building things.' Rafael smiled, though inside he felt restless. This was what he needed – to build something new, to find a sense of belonging in this world.
