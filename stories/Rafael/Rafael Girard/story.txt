Rafael Girard stepped into the crowded café, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. He spotted her in the corner, sipping a coffee and staring at her phone with an air of quiet contemplation. As he made his way towards her, she looked up, their eyes meeting briefly before quickly returning to her screen.

"Hey," Rafael said softly, taking a seat across from her.

Aurélie Girard – Rafa's younger sister – barely looked up, but a hint of a smile played on her lips. "What brings you here?"

Rafa shrugged, ordering their usual coffee from the waitress. "Just thought I'd drop by and see how my sister was doing."

Aurélie chuckled, setting her phone aside. "You're always dropping by to check up on me, Rafa. You should call me next time."

Their mother had passed away when they were teenagers, and since then, the siblings had been inseparable. They shared a love of literature, music, and coffee – in that order.

As they sipped their coffee, Rafa told Aurélie about his latest writing project, a short story about a young poet struggling to find her voice. Aurélie listened attentively, offering suggestions and words of encouragement.

"You're so talented, Rafa," she said, "but sometimes I worry you take on too much. You get lost in the characters and their stories."

Rafael smiled wryly. "Maybe a little. But that's what makes writing worth it – getting lost in someone else's world for a while."

Aurélie nodded understandingly. "I know exactly what you mean. Sometimes I feel like I'm just going through the motions, like my life is missing something more."

Rafa reached out and covered her hand with his. "You're not alone, Aurélie. We're in this together, always. And if writing's not working for you, maybe we can find something else to channel our creativity into – painting, or photography...?"

Aurélie's eyes sparkled at the suggestion. "That sounds like a plan."

As they chatted and laughed, Rafa felt a sense of contentment wash over him. Being around his sister made everything feel right with the world. In a chaotic universe, sometimes it was enough to have someone who understood you – and shared your quirks.

For a moment, as they sat in the café, sipping their coffee and enjoying each other's company, Rafa felt grateful for this life they'd built together. A complicated one, perhaps, but his sister by his side made all the difference.
