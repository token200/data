Rafael Dahir stepped off the plane in Cairo, his worn leather passport fluttering out of his pocket as he made his way through customs. A nomad at heart, Rafael had been all over the world - from the dusty souks of Marrakech to the neon streets of Tokyo - but there was something about Egypt that drew him back.

As a photographer, Rafael had spent years capturing the beauty and brutality of the Arab world for publications around the globe. But he'd never lost his sense of wonder at the ancient ruins that crisscrossed this land like veins on a map. The pyramids of Giza, the temples of Luxor - all of it held a magic that captivated him still.

Rafael made his way to his contact in Cairo, a fixer named Amir who had promised to set up a shoot for him in the desert. As they navigated the crowded streets of downtown, Rafael's eyes scanned the faces of the people passing by - old men in fezzes, women in niqabs, children playing with scraps of paper.

Eventually, they arrived at Amir's office, a cramped apartment above a kebab stand on the outskirts of town. Over a plate of steaming food, Amir outlined Rafael's plans for the shoot: to follow the Nile River from Cairo to Alexandria, capturing the ever-changing face of Egypt along the way.

Over the next few weeks, Rafael and Amir traveled north, camera in hand, documenting everything from rural villages to urban sprawl. The sun beat down on them relentlessly, but Rafael was in his element - capturing images that told a story of hope and resilience in the face of adversity.

As they approached Alexandria, Rafael's thoughts turned to the city's famous library, where papyrus scrolls had once held secrets of the ancient world. He couldn't wait to explore its hallowed halls, to unravel the mysteries hidden within its dusty pages. The Nile River unwound before him like a shimmering ribbon, and he felt alive.

In that moment, Rafael knew that his photographs would speak for themselves - a testament to the enduring spirit of Egypt, land of pharaohs and pyramids, but also of people and places that refused to be forgotten.
