Rafael Briedīte was a man with a passion for photography and a keen eye for detail. He spent most of his days wandering the streets of Riga, Latvia, capturing the beauty in its intricate architecture and vibrant street art scene.

One sunny afternoon, Rafael set up his camera on a small hill overlooking the Daugava River. As he framed the shot, he noticed an elderly woman sitting alone on a bench, gazing out at the water. She seemed lost in thought, her eyes fixed on some distant memory.

Rafael's curiosity got the better of him, and he packed up his camera to approach the woman. He introduced himself and asked if she would be willing to pose for a photograph. To his surprise, she agreed, and together they struck a pose overlooking the river.

As Rafael snapped photos, the woman began to open up about her life. She told him about her childhood in Riga, growing up during the Soviet era, and how she had always been fascinated by the city's rich history. Rafael listened intently, taking mental notes of the stories she shared.

The afternoon sun began to set, casting a warm glow over the city. Rafael packed up his camera, and the woman thanked him for capturing her essence on film. As they parted ways, Rafael couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude for the unexpected encounter.

Over the next few weeks, Rafael found himself returning to the same bench, hoping to catch another glimpse of the elderly woman. He would bring her small gifts – flowers or chocolates – and ask if she would be willing to pose again. Slowly but surely, their friendship grew.

Rafael's photographs of the woman became some of his most prized possessions. He titled them "Daughters of Riga," a nod to the city's complex history and the women who had lived through it. As he looked through the images, Rafael felt a deep connection to the woman and the city she called home.

Years went by, and Rafael Briedīte continued to capture the essence of Riga through his lens. But for him, there was no greater joy than sharing those moments with the women who had become like family – including the one he had met on that sun-drenched hill overlooking the Daugava River.
