Rafael Olsson stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It had been months since he'd left Stockholm, fleeing the memories that haunted him in the city he once called home.

As a detective, Rafael had seen his fair share of darkness, but nothing could have prepared him for what happened to his sister, Emma. Her murder still lingered in his mind like an open wound, and he'd become consumed by the need for justice.

The stationmaster, a gruff old man with a thick beard, looked up from his newspaper as Rafael approached. "You must be the one looking for room 314," he said, nodding towards a small, rundown hotel across the platform.

Rafael nodded, feeling a sense of trepidation wash over him. He had arrived in the town of Ã…re with little more than a suitcase and a vague idea of what he was looking for. The locals were tight-lipped about Emma's murder, and Rafael suspected that there was more to the story than anyone was letting on.

As he checked into his room, Rafael couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He looked around, but the hotel seemed deserted. Shrugging it off as nerves, he began to unpack, his mind wandering back to Emma's final days.

He had been so close to solving her case when she disappeared. The evidence had pointed to a serial killer, but Rafael was convinced that there was more to it than met the eye. He had spent countless hours poring over files and interviewing witnesses, but every lead seemed to end in a dead-end.

Just as he was starting to lose hope, Rafael's phone rang. It was an unknown number, but something about the tone on the other end sent a shiver down his spine. "Detective Olsson?" the voice said. "I think I have information about your sister's murder."

Rafael's heart skipped a beat as he leaned in closer to the receiver. "Who is this?" he demanded.

"I'll tell you," the voice replied, its tone dripping with menace. "But first, come see me at the old warehouse on the outskirts of town. Come alone."

With that, the line went dead. Rafael's mind was racing as he looked around his room once more. He knew that he had to follow this lead, no matter how small it seemed. The game was on, and he was ready to play.
