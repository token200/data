Laurent Chih-chieh stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station. He had been waiting for this moment for what felt like an eternity â€“ a chance to leave behind the past and start anew in the city of Paris.

As he made his way through the crowded streets, Laurent's mind wandered back to his life in Taipei, where he had grown up surrounded by the vibrant sounds and smells of traditional Taiwanese cuisine. But it was time for him to spread his wings and explore the world beyond the familiar streets of his childhood home.

Laurent Chih-chieh took a deep breath of the crisp French air and felt a sense of excitement wash over him. He had always been drawn to the art of perfumery, and he hoped to find success as an apprentice to one of the city's renowned fragrance houses.

After inquiring about available positions at several perfume shops, Laurent was finally led to the doorstep of House de Rochas, one of Paris's most esteemed fragrance makers. The imposing stone building seemed to exude an air of sophistication, and Laurent couldn't help but feel a sense of pride as he pushed open the heavy wooden door.

As he entered the fragrant workshop, where rows of gleaming glass bottles lined the shelves like sentinels, Laurent was greeted by the kind-eyed perfumer, Madame Dupont. She welcomed him with a warm smile and invited him to introduce himself.

"I am Laurent Chih-chieh," he said, extending his hand in greeting. "I've come to learn the art of perfume-making from you."

Madame Dupont's eyes sparkled as she shook his hand. "Bienvenue, Laurent Chih-chieh. I think we will get along just fine."
