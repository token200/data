Born into a family of Polish nobility, Laurent had always been destined for greatness. His parents, Countess Zofia Zielińska and Duke Jan Zieliński, had instilled in him the importance of honor, duty, and diplomacy from a young age. As he grew older, Laurent's natural aptitude for languages, history, and politics only deepened his passion for public service.
