His artwork often incorporated themes of nature and humanity, reflecting his own philosophical outlook on life.

Laurent's songwriting process was similarly introspective. He drew inspiration from personal experiences, observations, and philosophical debates, weaving these elements into songs that were both deeply personal and universally relatable. As a result, Echoes in the Night built a devoted fan base, who connected with Laurent's music on a profound level.
