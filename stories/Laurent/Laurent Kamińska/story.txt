After completing his studies, Laurent set up his own studio in a small warehouse in the East End, where he spent years experimenting with new techniques and pushing the boundaries of traditional printmaking.

Laurent's breakthrough came with the exhibition of his "Kokoszka" series, a collection of vibrant, abstracted depictions of Polish folk heroes. The show was a critical and commercial success, earning him international recognition and invitations to showcase his work at major museums and galleries around the world.

Despite his success, Laurent remained committed to his artistic vision, refusing to compromise his unique style for mainstream appeal. He continued to produce innovative works, often using unconventional materials and techniques to create complex, layered images that rewarded close attention and multiple viewings.

As his reputation grew, so did the demand for his work. Collectors and institutions clamored for pieces by Laurent Kamińska, willing to pay top dollar for a glimpse of his unique genius. And yet, despite the accolades and fame, Laurent remained true to himself, always seeking to push the boundaries of what was possible with art.

Today, Laurent's works can be found in museums and private collections around the world, a testament to his enduring influence on modern art. His legacy continues to inspire new generations of artists, a reminder that innovation and risk-taking are essential ingredients for true creativity and success.
