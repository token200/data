Blazej Sikora had always been a free spirit, never content to be tied down by conventional expectations. As a young man, he had traveled the world, working odd jobs and living out of a backpack.

As Lily sat in his chair, watching as the images came to life on her skin, Blazej couldn't help but think about how far he'd come.
