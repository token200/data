As a child, Blazej Muti had always been fascinated by the mysteries of the universe, spending hours poring over his father's old books on geology. It was as if he had been born with a sense of wonder, a curiosity that drove him to explore and discover new things. And now, at the age of 35, Blazej Muti felt like he was finally finding his place in the world.

The next few days were a blur of activity, as Blazej Muti set out to explore the rugged terrain, collecting samples and making notes.
