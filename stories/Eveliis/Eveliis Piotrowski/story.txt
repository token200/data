Born to a family of modest means, Eveliis had always felt the weight of expectation on her shoulders. She was determined to forge her own path, one that would shatter the conventions of her humble upbringing.

As a young woman, Eveliis spent countless hours poring over dusty tomes in the local library, devouring tales of adventure and bravery. Her imagination ran wild with stories of swashbuckling heroes and daring exploits. She longed to break free from the shackles of her mundane life and embark on a quest for glory.

One fateful evening, Eveliis stumbled upon a cryptic message scrawled on a crumbling wall in the city's oldest quarter. The words "Follow the moonlit path" seemed to leap off the stone, beckoning her towards a world beyond the familiar. With a sense of trepidation and excitement, she set out into the night, following the silvery glow of the moon as it led her deeper into the heart of the city.
