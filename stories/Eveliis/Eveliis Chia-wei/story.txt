Eveliis Chia-wei was a name whispered in hushed tones among the elite of Shanghai's underworld. A former opera singer turned high-stakes thief, she had built a reputation for being untouchable.

With her porcelain skin and raven-black hair, Eveliis seemed like an ethereal creature from a bygone era. But those who crossed her path quickly discovered that beneath her delicate features lay a mind as sharp as her wit and a tongue as venomous as the snake she was named after in Cantonese.

Eveliis's latest mark was the prized Heihe Pearl, a gemstone said to grant its owner unparalleled influence over the city. She had spent months casing the temple where it was kept, studying the guards' routines and waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

The night of the heist arrived like a thief in the night itself – dark, silent, and full of possibility. Eveliis slipped into the temple undetected, her silk robes barely rustling as she navigated the shadows. She snatched the pearl from its pedestal and turned to make her escape.

But just as she reached the door, a figure appeared out of nowhere, blocking her path like an unyielding stone wall. It was a man – tall, imposing, and with eyes that seemed to bore into Eveliis's very soul.

For a moment, they locked gazes, their breaths suspended in anticipation. Then, without warning, the man spoke – his voice low, husky, and dripping with malevolent intent.

"You're not taking anything tonight, Chia-wei," he growled, his hand resting on the hilt of a gleaming dagger at his waist.

Eveliis's smile was like a razor's edge – cold, calculated, and deadly. "I'm not here to steal from you, friend," she purred, her voice like honey dripping over poison. "I'm just here to collect what's mine."

And with that, the game was on.
