One fateful night, Eveliis Hébert received a cryptic message from an anonymous source claiming to have evidence of Sasquatch existence. The message read: "Meet me at the old oak tree at midnight. Come alone."

Eveliis Hébert was skeptical, but her curiosity got the better of her. She made her way to the designated location, her heart racing with anticipation. As she approached the ancient tree, a figure emerged from the shadows.
