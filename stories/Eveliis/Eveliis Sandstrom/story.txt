But it was Eveliis's unique voice and stage presence that truly set the band apart. Her ability to connect with audiences on a deep level earned her a loyal following, and she became known for her boundary-pushing performances, which often featured aerial stunts and pyrotechnics.

She was known for her activism, using her platform to raise awareness about social justice causes and environmental issues. In interviews, she spoke candidly about her struggles with anxiety and depression, using her music as a tool for healing and self-discovery.
