Eveliis Kovacs stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar smell of coal smoke and damp earth filling her lungs. She had returned to her hometown of Szeged, Hungary, after years away, and the sense of nostalgia washed over her like a wave.

As she made her way through the bustling station, Eveliis's eyes scanned the crowd, searching for a glimpse of familiar faces. Her thoughts turned to the letters she had received from her estranged brother, Attila, who lived in Szeged now. She had been hesitant to come back at first, but something about his words had resonated with her, making her feel like it was time to reconnect.

Eveliis made her way through the streets of Szeged, taking in the familiar sights and sounds. The old houses stood tall, their balconies adorned with colorful flowers and the scent of baking bread wafting from the kitchens. She passed by the town square, where children played in the shade of the centuries-old oak tree, laughing and chasing each other.

As she walked, Eveliis couldn't help but think about her childhood, growing up on this very street. Her parents had been musicians, and their home was always filled with music and laughter. She remembered spending hours listening to Attila play his violin, the sound of the instrument weaving in and out of the rhythms of Hungarian folk songs.

Eveliis stopped in front of her childhood home, a mix of emotions swirling inside her. She took a deep breath, feeling a sense of trepidation wash over her. What would she find inside? Would Attila be waiting for her?

She pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside, calling out into the silence. The answer came from above, Attila's voice echoing down from the room where she knew he waited.

"Eveliis?" his voice was cautious, unsure of what to expect.

Eveliis smiled, a sense of peace washing over her. "Attila," she replied, her voice barely above a whisper.

The door creaked open, and Eveliis stepped into the warmth of her brother's presence, feeling like she had finally come home.
