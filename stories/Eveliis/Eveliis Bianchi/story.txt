Born into a family of modest means, Eveliis had always been drawn to the world of academia. She spent hours poring over books in her father's small library, devouring tales of mythological creatures and legendary heroes. As she grew older, her fascination with the past only intensified, and she began to seek out new sources of knowledge.
