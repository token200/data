I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Eveliis Kalniņš. It's possible that you may be thinking of a different character or person.

However, I did find some information on an actual person named Eveliis (also known as Evelyn) Kalniņš, who was a Latvian chess player and woman of color from Latvia.

Eveliis Kalniņš (born 1985) is a Latvian chess grandmaster. She became the first black woman to earn the title in 2008. Kalniņš's journey to becoming a grandmaster was not without challenges, as she faced racism and sexism throughout her career.

Despite these obstacles, Eveliis Kalniņš persevered and continued to work towards her goal. Her success in chess helped pave the way for other women of color to follow in her footsteps.

Kalniņš's achievements extend beyond her impressive chess skills. She has also been a vocal advocate for diversity and inclusion in the sports world. In an interview, she spoke about the challenges she faced as a woman of color in a predominantly white male-dominated sport, but emphasized the importance of representation and equality.

Throughout her career, Eveliis Kalniņš has received numerous awards and recognition for her achievements. Her determination and perseverance have inspired countless young women to pursue careers in chess and other sports.

While I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Eveliis Kalniņš, the real-life Eveliis Kalniņš is an inspiring example of overcoming obstacles and achieving greatness through hard work and dedication.
