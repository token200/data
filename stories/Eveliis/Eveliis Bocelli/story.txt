I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Eveliis Bocelli. However, I believe you may be referring to Andrea Bocelli, a renowned Italian tenor.

If that's the case, here's a story based on his life:

It was a crisp autumn evening in Tuscany when young Alessandro Bocelli, later known as Andrea, first discovered his love for music. He had been born with congenital glaucoma, which left him partially blind, but it was this same blindness that allowed him to tap into the world of sound in ways others couldn't.

As a child, Alessandro's father, Fernando, a police officer, would often play opera records at home, and it was here that he found solace. The music became his escape from the darkness that surrounded him. By the time he was 12 years old, Alessandro had begun singing in local choirs, finding joy in the rich, emotive voices of opera singers like Luciano Pavarotti.

But life was not always easy for the young singer. His health problems persisted, and by the age of 16, he had been told that his condition would only worsen if he ever sang professionally. Yet, he refused to give up on his dreams. With the help of a pioneering surgeon who specialized in eye surgery, Alessandro underwent multiple operations that allowed him to regain partial vision.

Years later, at the tender age of 20, Andreas made his professional debut with Verdi's La Traviata at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna. The success was overwhelming, and from that moment on, his career soared. But more importantly, he never forgot the struggles he had faced, using his platform to raise awareness about blindness and support for those living with visual impairments.

Throughout his illustrious career, Andrea Bocelli has become synonymous with passion, artistry, and generosity of spirit. And though his journey was not without its challenges, it is a testament to the human will to overcome adversity and achieve greatness, even in the face of darkness.
