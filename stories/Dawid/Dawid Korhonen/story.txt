Dawid Korhonen sat alone in his dimly lit room, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and flickering candles. He was a writer, known for his dark and twisted tales that often left readers shivering with unease. His latest story, "The Shadow in the Mirror," had been getting rave reviews, but Dawid couldn't shake off the feeling that it was all just a facade.

As he poured over his notes, a chill ran down his spine. He couldn't explain why, but the words on the page seemed to shift and twist, like living things. The protagonist, a young woman named Sophia, had been stalking through the forest when she stumbled upon an old mirror. And now, Dawid was wondering if he'd made a terrible mistake by making it the focal point of his story.

Dawid's mind wandered back to his childhood, growing up in a small village on the outskirts of Helsinki. He remembered the eerie silence that hung over the forest like a shroud, and the way the trees seemed to loom over him like sentinels. His grandmother used to tell him stories of the old days, when the mirror was said to have been a portal to another world.

As he delved deeper into his research, Dawid began to uncover some disturbing facts. The mirror had indeed been said to have been created by an ancient tribe that worshipped dark deities. It was rumored to grant wishes, but at a terrible cost. Those who gazed into its depths would be consumed by their own darkest desires.

Dawid's eyes widened as he realized the eerie similarities between Sophia's story and his own research. He'd been drawn to the mirror like a moth to flame, tempted by its dark power. The more he read, the more he became convinced that he had unleashed a malevolent force into the world.

With a sense of dread creeping over him, Dawid gathered up his notes and extinguished the candles. In the darkness, he whispered a single phrase, hoping against hope that it would ward off the evil that lurked within: "Vastaa kuolemaasi." ("Answer my death.")

The silence that followed was oppressive, like a weight crushing down on him. Dawid knew then that his story had become all too real. The mirror loomed in his mind's eye, its surface rippling with an otherworldly energy.

And as he drifted off to sleep, Dawid couldn't shake the feeling that Sophia was watching him from the shadows, her eyes fixed on him with a cold, calculating gaze...
