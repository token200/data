Dawid Yang stepped off the crowded train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the bustling streets of Seoul. As a detective with the Seoul Metropolitan Police Department's cybercrime unit, he had seen it all – from online scams to identity thefts.

But today was different. Today, Dawid had a case that had all the makings of a classic whodunit: a wealthy businessman had been murdered, and all evidence pointed to an online rival as the prime suspect.

Dawid made his way through the crowded streets, weaving past street vendors and pedestrians as he made his way to his office. His assistant, Jina, looked up from her computer as he entered the room.

"Morning, Dawid," she said with a smile. "I've got the latest on the case. The victim's rival, Lee Jae-ho, has been identified as the prime suspect."

Dawid nodded, taking a seat in front of his desk. "What's the story?"

Jina pulled up the file on her computer screen. "According to the evidence, Lee Jae-ho had been in a heated online dispute with the victim over business dealings. He was also seen lurking around the victim's office building on the night of the murder."

Dawid frowned. "That's interesting. But I still need to see the digital evidence for myself."

Jina nodded and began typing away on her computer, pulling up the latest emails and chat logs between Lee Jae-ho and the victim.

As Dawid scrolled through the messages, his eyes widened in surprise. The dispute had been much more personal than he had initially thought. Both men had been involved in a high-stakes online auction, with both parties willing to do whatever it took to win.

But as he delved deeper into the digital trail, Dawid began to notice something strange. A small thread of code, hidden in plain sight, seemed to be pointing to someone else entirely...

Dawid's eyes narrowed as he realized that this case was far from over. There were still pieces missing, and he had a feeling that the killer was still out there, watching him.

He leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers together as he began to formulate a new theory. This case would take more than just digital sleuthing – it would require old-fashioned detective work.

And Dawid Yang was ready for whatever came next.
