As a member of the club, Dawid's work began to gain recognition, with several of his shots featured in the university's annual exhibition.

His photographs began to spark conversations about the human condition, and he became known not only for his technical skill but also for his ability to capture the essence of his subjects.

As Dawid Ruiz Garcia's reputation grew, so did his ambition. He went on to complete a master's degree in photography, and his work continued to garner international attention.
