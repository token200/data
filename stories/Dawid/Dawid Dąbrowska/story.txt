Dawid DÄ…browska, also known as the "White Eagle", was a Polish aviator and bomber pilot during World War II. Born on November 10, 1913, in Warsaw, Poland, Dawid grew up with a passion for flying. He became one of the most decorated Polish pilots of all time.

During his training, Dawid learned that if he were to be shot down behind enemy lines, he had to pretend to be a German pilot and surrender to avoid being captured as a Poles. This was due to the strict German rule against collaborating with or sympathizing with other nations during wartime.

Dawid flew 65 missions in the Soviet Union before his unit was forced to retreat. He later joined a group of Polish pilots known as "Chromatics," which flew combat missions behind enemy lines, pretending to be Germans and dropping bombs on German forces from low altitudes.

In 1943, Dawid's aircraft took off on what he knew would be his final mission. His unit was tasked with attacking a Soviet military base in Ukraine. Despite his fear of not returning home or seeing his family again, Dawid flew his aircraft as bravely and as best he could. He successfully dropped the bombs and then attempted to escape.

During his escape, Dawid made an emergency landing on the ice, but his plane caught fire after it took off again. The pilot managed to get out of the aircraft before it crashed into a nearby river. Dawid escaped without major injuries but was unable to recover any wreckage from his damaged aircraft due to being in the middle of nowhere.

It took Dawid four days for someone to find him after he had walked for hours through the snowy forest, suffering extreme cold and exhaustion. He eventually reached safety in Ukraine where Soviet forces were not present at that time. When Dawid returned home, he found out his mother had passed away while he was on a mission.

He went back to Poland from Ukraine.
