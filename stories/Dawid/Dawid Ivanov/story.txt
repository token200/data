One day, while on assignment in rural Japan, Dawid received an unusual request from a local village elder to document their traditional festival. The villagers were known for their vibrant costumes and intricate dances, and Dawid saw this as the perfect opportunity to showcase his skills.

As he set up his camera equipment in the small village, Dawid was struck by the serenity of the surroundings. The rolling hills, adorned with cherry blossoms, seemed to stretch on forever.
