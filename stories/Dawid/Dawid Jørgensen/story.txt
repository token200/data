Dawid Jørgensen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station. He had been traveling for hours, lost in thought as he gazed out at the unfamiliar landscape. The smell of saltwater and damp earth filled his nostrils, a familiar scent that brought him back to his childhood summers spent by the coast.

As he made his way through the crowds, Dawid's mind wandered back to his past. Growing up on the island of Bornholm in Denmark, he had always felt a sense of restlessness, a desire to explore beyond the rocky shores and rolling hills of his homeland. He had left as soon as he was old enough, eager to make his mark on the world.

Now, at 25, Dawid found himself in Copenhagen, a city that seemed to stretch on forever with its endless streets and buildings. He had landed a job at a small publishing house, working late nights alongside fellow book lovers as they poured over manuscripts and plotted their next move.

Despite the excitement of his new life, Dawid couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. He felt like he was just going through the motions, his dreams and aspirations left to gather dust in the attic of his mind. As he walked through the city streets, he felt a sense of disconnection, as if he was observing himself from afar.

Just then, Dawid's phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number. He hesitated for a moment before opening it, and his heart skipped a beat as he read the message: "Meet me at Café Løven, 7pm. Come alone." The words seemed to leap off the screen, like a lifeline thrown across the vast expanse of his uncertainty.

Dawid's mind racing, he made his way to the café, wondering who could have sent him such an enigmatic message. As he pushed open the door and stepped inside, the familiar scent of coffee and baked goods enveloped him, transporting him back to a time when life was simpler. He spotted a figure in the corner, shrouded in shadows.

With a sense of trepidation and excitement, Dawid made his way towards them, feeling like he was stepping into the unknown once more. As he approached, a voice whispered his name, and everything seemed to come alive.
