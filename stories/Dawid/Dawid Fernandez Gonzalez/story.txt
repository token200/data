I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Dawid Fernandez Gonzalez. It is possible that you may be thinking of a different person or character.

However, I can suggest some alternatives:

* If you're referring to the evangelist and motivational speaker David Ferrer González, here's a story about him:
David Ferrer González, also known as "El Loco" (The Madman), was a Spanish evangelical preacher who became famous for his aggressive door-to-door evangelism style. Born in 1949 in Barcelona, Spain, Fernández began preaching the Gospel at a young age and quickly gained a following.

As he traveled from town to town, Ferrer González would often engage in loud, energetic, and sometimes chaotic sermons that left audiences both mesmerized and intimidated. His unorthodox methods and charisma earned him a reputation as one of the most effective evangelists of his time.

Despite facing criticism and controversy for his methods, Fernández remained committed to spreading the message of Christianity through any means necessary. He became particularly known for his bold approach to reaching out to people, often using humor, drama, and even physical demonstrations to convey his message.

Throughout his life, Fernández's passion and conviction inspired countless people around the world to consider faith. His influence extended beyond his native Spain, and he traveled extensively throughout Latin America, Africa, and Asia, preaching to millions of people.

As a highly respected figure in the evangelical community, Fernández continued to spread the word of God until his passing in 2007. Today, his legacy lives on through the countless lives he touched and the communities he helped establish.
