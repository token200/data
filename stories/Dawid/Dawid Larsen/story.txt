Dawid Larsen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the quiet station. He had been away for so long, it felt like a lifetime since he'd set foot in this small town. As he made his way through the crowds of people, he spotted her - standing by the old caf√©, sipping a coffee.

Astrid Hansen smiled as she saw Dawid approach. "Long time no see," she said, her voice warm and familiar.

Dawid returned the smile, feeling a sense of belonging wash over him. He had thought about Astrid often during his time away, wondering what she'd been up to while he was chasing his dreams in the city.

"Dawid Larsen," Astrid said, using his full name for the first time all day. "It's been too long."

They walked together through the town, catching up on old times and sharing stories of their adventures since they'd last seen each other. Dawid told her about his struggles as a writer, the doubts that had crept in and threatened to derail him. Astrid listened attentively, offering words of encouragement and advice.

As they strolled, Dawid couldn't help but think about how much he missed Astrid's insight and wisdom. She had always been his rock, the one person who truly understood him. He knew she was the reason he'd returned to this small town, seeking refuge from the city's noise and distractions.

They eventually arrived at the old lake house where Dawid had spent many summers as a child. Astrid had helped him restore it after his parents' passing, and now it stood as a testament to their enduring friendship.

As they sat on the porch, watching the sun set behind the trees, Dawid turned to Astrid and said, "I'm so glad I came back, Dawid Larsen." He knew that no matter where life took him next, he could always count on Astrid to be there for him.
