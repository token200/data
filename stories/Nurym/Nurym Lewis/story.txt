Nurym Lewis walked into the small café, scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Jamie, sitting in the corner sipping on a cup of coffee. As she approached, Jamie looked up and flashed a warm smile.

"Nurym Lewis! Long time no see!" Jamie exclaimed, setting down their cup.

Nurym returned the greeting with a hug, feeling a sense of comfort wash over her. She slid into the booth across from Jamie and ordered a cappuccino.

The two friends chatted for hours, catching up on each other's lives. Nurym had been busy with work, taking on new projects at the design firm where she worked as a graphic designer. Jamie, on the other hand, had just finished his degree in photography and was looking to start building a portfolio.

As they talked, Nurym couldn't help but notice the way the sunlight streaming through the window highlighted Jamie's eyes. She felt a flutter in her chest, but quickly pushed the feeling aside. After all, she and Jamie were just friends.

Despite their lingering feelings for each other, Nurym had come to realize that her friendship with Jamie was more important than any romantic interest. They had been through too much together, supporting each other through thick and thin.

As they finished up their drinks, Jamie reached across the table and took Nurym's hand. "I'm so glad we ran into each other today," he said, his voice low and sincere. "You mean a lot to me, Nurym Lewis."

Nurym felt a lump form in her throat as she squeezed his hand gently. "I feel the same way about you, Jamie," she replied, smiling up at him.

In that moment, Nurym knew that their friendship was something special – something worth holding onto. She leaned forward and kissed Jamie softly on the cheek, feeling a sense of peace wash over her.

As they left the café together, arm in arm, Nurym knew that no matter what the future held, she and Jamie would face it side by side, as friends and confidants to each other's hearts.
