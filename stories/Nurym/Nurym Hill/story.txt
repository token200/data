Nurym Hill was an enigmatic figure who had lived on the outskirts of town for as long as anyone could remember. The once-thriving coal miner's daughter now spent her days tending to a garden that seemed to thrive under her care, despite the neglect it received from the rest of the world.

Rumors swirled about Nurym Hill's past - some said she was cursed by a mischievous spirit for abandoning her family's mine after a tragic accident took her brother's life. Others whispered that she possessed ancient knowledge passed down through generations of coal miners, which allowed her to coax life from even the most barren of soil.

Despite the whispers and warnings, Nurym Hill remained steadfast in her dedication to her craft. She would often be seen walking among the rows of her garden, pruning the weeds and gently watering the shoots that sprouted under her care.

It was on one such evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the landscape, that Nurym Hill's past came back to haunt her. A stranger appeared at the edge of the garden, his eyes scanning the space with an intensity that made her skin prickle. As he approached, Nurym Hill could see the faint markings on his wrist - a symbol etched into the flesh in the same pattern as those found on the ancient coins she had inherited from her father.

Nurym Hill's instincts screamed at her to flee, but something about the stranger's gaze stayed her feet. She watched as he knelt beside one of her prized shoots and gently brushed away the dirt that encased it, his fingers trembling with an otherworldly energy. For a moment, the air seemed to vibrate with possibility - and then, just as suddenly, everything was still.

"You're Nurym Hill," the stranger whispered, his voice carrying on the breeze. "I've been searching for you."

Nurym Hill's eyes narrowed, her mind racing with questions. Who was this man? And what did he want from her now?
