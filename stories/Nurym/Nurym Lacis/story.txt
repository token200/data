Nurym Lacis stepped off the bus and onto the worn pavement of the small town's central square. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows behind the dilapidated buildings, giving the scene a melancholy air. As a photographer, Nurym had spent years traveling the world, capturing its beauty and brutality through her lens. But it was this tiny town in Eastern Europe that had drawn her back to her roots.

Growing up, Nurym's family had lived here, their small bakery a staple of the community. Her parents had passed away when she was just a teenager, leaving her alone to care for the shop. But as much as she loved the place, Nurym couldn't shake the feeling that she didn't belong here anymore. She'd always been drawn to the world beyond its borders, and now, as a successful photographer in her 30s, she felt an itch to create something new.

Nurym's eyes scanned the square, taking in the faded signs of long-forgotten businesses. She spotted an old watchmaker's shop with a cracked window, and her mind began to wander to possibilities – perhaps a story about this forgotten town and its people? As she walked past the bakery, now closed and boarded up, she felt a pang of nostalgia. This was where it all had begun for her.

She set up her camera on a nearby bench, adjusting the settings as the light changed with each passing moment. The square slowly filled with locals, each one telling a different story through their eyes. There was the elderly woman selling flowers from a cart; the young couple sharing a laugh outside the empty movie theater; and the old man polishing his reflection in a dusty windowpane.

As Nurym snapped her shots, she began to see this town – and herself – anew. She realized that home wasn't just where you were born or raised, but wherever your heart led you. The images that would come from this shoot would be ones of hope, resilience, and the power of storytelling. And for Nurym Lacis, it was a reminder that no matter where life took her next, some places – like this small town in Eastern Europe – would always hold a piece of her heart.
