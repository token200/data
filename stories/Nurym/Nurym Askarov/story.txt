Nurym Askarov stepped off the crowded bus and onto the worn pavement of the old district. As he made his way through the maze of narrow streets, the smell of fresh bread wafted from the nearby bakery, enticing him to come inside. Nurym Askarov took a deep breath, savoring the familiar scents that reminded him of his childhood.

A native of Tbilisi, Georgia, Nurym Askarov had returned to his hometown after years abroad, seeking solace in the familiarity of his youth. His days were spent wandering the streets, reminiscing about old friends and lost loves. The city seemed to have aged with him, but its beauty remained unchanged – a patchwork of crumbling stone buildings and vibrant street art.

As he turned a corner, Nurym Askarov spotted an old friend, Sopo, sitting on a bench outside the local café. She was sipping a cup of strong tea, her eyes fixed on the horizon as if lost in thought. Nurym Askarov approached cautiously, not wanting to disturb her reverie. "Sopo, what's wrong?" he asked softly.

She turned to him, and their eyes met for a moment before she smiled wistfully. "Just thinking about my childhood," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "The summers spent playing in the park, the winters snuggled up by the fireplace...it feels like a lifetime ago."

Nurym Askarov nodded sympathetically, knowing that Sopo's life had taken a different path after leaving Tbilisi. He sat down beside her, and they sat in silence for a moment, watching as children played in the park across the street.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the city, Nurym Askarov stood up, his joints creaking slightly from years of disuse. "I'll see you around, Sopo," he said with a smile, and continued on his way, lost in thought as he wandered through the old district, surrounded by memories of his past.
