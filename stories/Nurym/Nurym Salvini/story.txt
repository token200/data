Nurym Salvini sat alone at the small café on the corner, nursing a lukewarm coffee. His eyes wandered out to the rain-soaked streets of Tokyo, where he had spent countless hours as a young man, chasing his dreams of becoming a great artist.

As a child, Nurym had been fascinated by the works of Hokusai and Hiroshige, the famous Japanese ukiyo-e artists. He spent every spare moment studying their techniques, practicing their styles on scraps of paper and canvas. His parents, both struggling musicians themselves, encouraged his passion for art, even when it seemed like a pipe dream.

But Nurym persevered. He moved to Tokyo after high school, determined to make a name for himself in the cutthroat world of modern Japanese art. For years, he worked as an assistant to various artists and galleries, honing his skills and learning everything he could about the industry.

Finally, at 35, Nurym's big break came. A prominent collector stumbled upon one of his pieces in a small gallery in Shimokitazawa, and was blown away by its unique blend of traditional Japanese techniques with modern styles. The next thing Nurym knew, he was exhibiting his work alongside some of Tokyo's most renowned artists.

But success had come at a cost. Nurym's personal life had become increasingly complicated – the long hours, the constant pressure to create something new and innovative, the weight of expectation from those around him. His relationships suffered, his friendships dwindled to almost nothing.

As he sat in the café, lost in thought, Nurym couldn't help but wonder if it was all worth it. Was this the life he had truly wanted? He looked down at his hands, covered in paint and ink stains, and felt a pang of sadness. It seemed like so much of what mattered had slipped through his fingers.

The door to the café creaked open, and a young woman with bright pink hair walked in, shaking the rain from her coat. She spotted Nurym and smiled, making her way over to his table. "Nurym-san?" she asked, using the honorific suffix that only a select few used.

Nurym nodded, feeling a mix of emotions as he watched the woman sit down across from him. Maybe it was time to re-evaluate what truly mattered in life. Was it the art itself, or something more? Only Nurym knew for sure.
