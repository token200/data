Nurym Kalnins stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, gazing out at the unfamiliar streets of Riga, Latvia. As an ethnologist, she had spent years studying the cultural heritage of the region, but nothing could have prepared her for the rush of excitement that came with finally setting foot in the city.

Born and raised in Moscow, Nurym Kalnins had always felt a sense of disconnection from the culture that surrounded her. Her Latvian grandmother, Agnese, would regale her with stories of their ancestors' bravery and resilience during World War II, sparking a sense of pride and curiosity within Nurym.

As she made her way through the winding streets, Nurym couldn't help but notice the intricate patterns on the buildings and the way the light danced across the cobblestone pavement. She felt a deep connection to this place, as if her own roots were stirring beneath the surface.

Her plan was to spend several weeks immersed in the local culture, studying the art, music, and traditions of Latvia. She had arranged to stay with a family in the old town, who promised to introduce her to the rich tapestry of Latvian life.

That evening, Nurym Kalnins sat at a wooden table in the family's cozy apartment, surrounded by steaming plates of traditional dishes and the sound of lively chatter. As she sipped a glass of kvass, she listened intently as her host mother, Juta, told tales of the city's history and the struggles of its people.

Nurym felt her heart swell with emotion, knowing that this was where her own story began â€“ among the people and places that had shaped her grandmother's experiences. She knew that this trip would be a journey of discovery not only about Latvia but also about herself, and she was eager to uncover the secrets hidden beneath the surface of this beautiful city.

With each passing moment, Nurym Kalnins felt her sense of belonging grow stronger, as if the very essence of Latvian culture was seeping into her being. She knew that this trip would be one she would never forget, and that it would forever change the way she saw herself and her place in the world.
