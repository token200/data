Maria Straume stood at the edge of the fjord, her long blonde hair whipping in the wind as she gazed out at the grey water. She was a woman of stark contrasts - soft features and sharp edges, a gentle soul with a fierce determination burning within.

As a journalist, Maria had always been drawn to the darker corners of society. Her latest assignment took her to the seedy underbelly of Oslo's nightlife, where she was determined to uncover the truth behind the city's most recent string of murders.

Maria's eyes narrowed as she watched the shadows dance across the water. She knew that this case would be different from the others - there was something about it that resonated deep within her. Perhaps it was the way the victims were all young women, or the eerie sense of connection between them. Whatever it was, Maria felt an inexplicable pull to unravel the tangled threads of the mystery.

She pulled out her notebook and began to scribble notes as a figure emerged from the darkness. It was a man, tall and imposing, with piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into Maria's very soul. She felt a shiver run down her spine as he approached her - there was something about him that made her skin crawl.

"Can I help you?" Maria asked, trying to keep her tone even.

The stranger smiled, revealing razor-sharp teeth. "My name is Helge," he said, his voice low and menacing. "And I think we need to talk."

Maria's heart pounded as she watched Helge lead her away from the water's edge. She knew that she was taking a risk by following him - but something about this man drew her in, like a moth to flame.

As they walked through the deserted streets, Maria felt a sense of unease growing within her. Who was Helge, really? And what did he want with her? But despite her fear, she couldn't help feeling drawn to the darkness that surrounded him - it was as if she had stumbled into a world she knew not of.

Maria's instincts told her to turn back now, while the going was still good. But something about Helge's words made her pause - and then take a step forward. Into the unknown.
