Maria Makinen stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the crowded station for any sign of her friend. She had been waiting for what felt like an eternity to meet up with Sofia Rodriguez, and she was starting to get anxious.

As she made her way through the throng of passengers, Maria's phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out to see a text from Sofia: "Hey Mari, where r u? I just arrived!"

Maria smiled as she quickened her pace, her long dark hair bouncing with each step. She spotted Sofia across the station and waved enthusiastically.

When they finally met up, Maria was greeted with a warm hug from Sofia. "Sorry about that," Sofia said, holding out her phone to show Maria the text she had just sent. "I got held up at the airport."

Maria chuckled and handed the phone back to Sofia. "No worries, I know how it is. You're here now, though!"

Sofia grinned mischievously. "Yeah, I'm finally in your city. Let's get this adventure started!"

The two friends made their way through the station, laughing and chatting as they went. They had plans to explore the city, try new foods, and take in all the sights.

As they walked, Maria couldn't help but feel grateful for her friendship with Sofia. They met in college, bonding over their shared love of literature and music. Since then, they had been inseparable.

Sofia noticed Maria's far-off gaze and asked what was on her mind. "Just thinking about how lucky I am to have you as a friend," Maria said, smiling at Sofia.

Sofia smiled back, her eyes shining with affection. "I feel the same way about you, Mari. We make an amazing team."

As they continued their adventure, Maria knew that this trip was going to be one for the books â€“ thanks to her friend and partner in crime, Sofia Rodriguez.
