She remembered why she had started this fight in the first place: to protect those who couldn't protect themselves. With renewed determination, she threw herself back into work, finding new ways to present the case and gather evidence.

As the trial approached, Maria Briedis felt a sense of pride and purpose that she had never felt before. She knew that her hard work would be worth it if she could secure justice for her clients.

The courtroom erupted in cheers as Maria Briedis stood tall, a smile on her face.
