Maria Sundberg stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. As she had planned, she was here alone, with no one to meet or await her arrival. The only sound was the distant hum of a motorcycle, its engine growing louder as it approached.

Maria lit a cigarette and took a long drag, feeling the familiar rush of nicotine coursing through her veins. She exhaled slowly, watching as the smoke curled upwards into the crisp morning air. This was what she had come for – solitude, freedom from the expectations that came with being Maria Sundberg, daughter of the influential businessman, Henrik Sundberg.

As a child, Maria had always felt suffocated by the weight of her family's legacy. Her father's ruthless business dealings and her mother's high-society antics had created a world where every move she made was scrutinized and judged. She longed to break free from that life, to forge her own path and make her own mistakes.

The motorcycle roared into view, its rider tossing Maria a look as he pulled up beside the platform. It was Viktor, an old friend from her rebellious days. He grinned at her, his eyes sparkling with mischief, and Maria couldn't help but smile in return.

Viktor leaned against the bike, watching as Maria flicked out her cigarette. "You're really doing this," he said, his voice low and serious. "Leaving it all behind."

Maria nodded, feeling a sense of resolve wash over her. She was leaving the life she had known for so long behind, embracing a future where she could make her own decisions and create her own mistakes.

As they stood there, the only sound the distant hum of the motorcycle, Maria felt a weight lift from her shoulders. For the first time in her life, she felt truly free – free to be herself, without apology or expectation. And as Viktor pulled off into the distance, Maria Sundberg knew that she would never go back.
