But it wasn't until the day Aivars faced off against the reigning champion, Kamilbek, that she gained widespread recognition. The match was intense, with both wrestlers giving it their all, but in the end, Aivars emerged victorious, pinning her opponent to the mat.

The crowd erupted into cheers, and from that moment on, Aivars Baktybekova was a household name. People came from all over Turkmenistan to witness her incredible skills firsthand, and she became an inspiration to young wrestlers everywhere.

Despite her fame, Aivars remained humble and dedicated to her craft. She spent hours each day training, perfecting her technique and pushing herself to new heights. Her hard work paid off, as she continued to dominate the Kurultai scene, earning a reputation as one of the greatest wrestlers in history.

But Aivars' success wasn't limited to the wrestling ring. She became an ambassador for Turkmen culture, traveling the world to share her heritage with others. Wherever she went, she brought with her a message of unity and strength, inspired by the ancient traditions of Kurultai.

One day, while on a trip to Europe, Aivars received an invitation from the President of Turkmenistan himself, inviting her to perform at a grand ceremony in honor of the country's 75th anniversary. Aivars was hesitant at first, but something about the opportunity resonated with her.
