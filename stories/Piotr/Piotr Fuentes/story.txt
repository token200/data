Piotr Fuentes stepped off the stage, his guitar slung low across his body. The crowd's applause still resonated in his ears as he scanned the room for familiar faces. That was what it was – a warm and inviting crowd. He had played these clubs before, but there was something different about this one.

The opening chords of "Black No. 1" drifted through the air, like the promise of something new. Piotr felt alive, plugged in, his music coursing through him like electricity. The song built, swirling with emotion and tension until it burst into a frenetic solo. He closed his eyes, letting the notes dance on his fingers.

It was more than just music for Piotr; it was an escape. A way to leave the darkness behind and find solace in the light. Growing up, he'd seen things that no kid should ever have to witness – loss, pain, and heartache. But his art had become his refuge, a shield against the world's cruelty.

After the show, Piotr wandered through the crowd, shaking hands and exchanging smiles with fans. They spoke of their own struggles, their own losses, but Piotr listened without offering words of comfort. He just nodded and smiled, because sometimes silence was enough.

Later that night, as he walked out into the chill evening air, Piotr spotted a figure waiting by his car. It was Leticia, her dark hair pulled back in a ponytail, her eyes shining with an unspoken understanding. She never asked questions; she just knew when to show up and listen.

"Pietro?" she said softly, using the old country name he'd let fall from his lips over years of being on stage.

He turned, letting his shoulders slump against the doorframe of his car. "¿Qué pasa?" Leticia had always been there for him; the one constant in a life of turmoil.

Leticia pulled up beside him, leaning against the side panel of her own vehicle, parked at an angle to create a makeshift barrier between them. The tension from the stage still pulsed through Piotr's veins, but with Leticia by his side, he felt it ease. It was as if they shared some hidden understanding, one that allowed them to move forward without explanation.

They drove in silence for miles, lost in their own thoughts and memories. Eventually, they pulled into a deserted parking lot near the river, and parked, sitting with only the flickering moonlight between them.

"¿Por qué siéntate aquí conmigo?" Piotr asked finally, the words spilling out like a prayer.

Leticia's hand drifted to his, her fingers intertwining with his in a gentle caress. "Porque siempre estoy aquí," she replied softly.
