Piotr Olsen stepped off the plane and onto the bustling airport tarmac, his eyes scanning the unfamiliar landscape. He had been in contact with his old friend, Ivan, for weeks, begging him to meet up while he was in town. As a former KGB agent turned private investigator, Piotr had seen his fair share of dark alleys and backroom deals.

Ivan, it seemed, had gotten himself into trouble once again. "Piotr, my old friend," Ivan said, as he clapped him on the back, "I'm so glad you're here."

Over a whiskey in Ivan's cramped office, Piotr listened intently as his friend recounted his latest predicament. It seemed that Ivan had stumbled upon a lucrative scheme to smuggle rare and valuable artifacts out of Russia, courtesy of some influential connections. However, he soon discovered that the line between right and wrong was blurred.

"What did you think would happen if we got caught?" Piotr asked, raising an eyebrow as Ivan scratched his head.

"Hey, at least we'd be set for life," Ivan shrugged. "But I gotta admit, it's been a while since I've felt that kinda... rush."

Piotr shook his head, his mind racing with the implications. This was the same Ivan who had always prided himself on being squeaky clean and unconnected to anything shady.

"Ivan, listen," Piotr began, taking a sip of his own drink, "I may have some connections myself. But this kind of thing can't just be left to chance."

"Ah, come on, Piotr," Ivan pleaded, his voice tinged with desperation. "It's not like I'd get caught up in it. It's all very... innocent." The innocence was laughable; Piotr knew Ivan too well.

Just then, a knock came at the door, interrupting their conversation. It was Zoya, Ivan's beautiful and enigmatic girlfriend, with an air of quiet confidence that always unnerved Piotr.

"Zoya," he said smoothly, "what can I do for you?"

"Just making sure Ivan doesn't get himself into any more trouble," she shot back, a hint of amusement dancing in her eyes.
