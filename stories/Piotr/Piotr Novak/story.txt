Piotr Antoni Novak was a man with a passion for art and music. As a young boy growing up in Warsaw, Poland, he spent countless hours exploring the city's museums and galleries, soaking up the vibrant colors and textures of the works on display. His love of art only grew stronger as he matured, and he went on to study fine art at the prestigious Academy of Fine Arts.

After graduating, Piotr worked as a freelance artist, taking on commissions from clients across the city.
