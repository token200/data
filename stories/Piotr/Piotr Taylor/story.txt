He swiftly dispatched the guards, using his agility and stealth to evade their clumsy attempts at apprehension. With the painting safely in hand, he made his escape, slipping back into the shadows as quickly as he had emerged.

Back in his hidden lair, Piotr Taylor Taylor carefully examined the Manet, admiring its intricate details and vibrant colors. He knew that this piece would fetch a handsome sum at auction, and Mr. Finch was willing to pay top dollar for it.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was his trusty sidekick, Lena. "Piotr, we have a problem," she said, her voice laced with concern. "The police are closing in on us. We need to get out of here, now."

Without hesitation, Piotr Taylor sprang into action.
