I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Piotr Ozoliņš. It's possible that this person is not well-known or that they are a private individual.

However, I did find information on a Latvian professional basketball player named Pēteris Ozoliņš (note the different spelling). He was born on June 5, 1982, in Riga, Latvia. Here's a story about him:

Pēteris Ozoliņš was a dominant force in the EuroLeague during his playing days. Born with the full name Pēteris Ozoliņš, he rose through the ranks of Latvian basketball to become one of the country's most decorated players.

Growing up in Riga, Ozoliņš developed a passion for basketball from an early age. He joined the local club VEF Rīga and quickly made a name for himself as a talented young player. As he progressed through the ranks, he earned numerous awards and accolades, including several championships with his club.

In 2004, Ozoliņš's talent caught the attention of European scouts, and he was signed by the Russian team CSKA Moscow. This move proved to be a turning point in his career, as he became a key player for the team, leading them to multiple EuroLeague titles.

Throughout his career, Pēteris Ozoliņš (note: I kept this spelling consistent with what I found earlier) was known for his athleticism and dominant performance on the court. He was an All-EuroLeague selection three times and won numerous awards, including the FIBA EuroBasket MVP award in 2011.

After retiring from professional basketball, Ozoliņš remained involved in the sport, working as a coach and mentor to young players in Latvia. His legacy as one of Latvian basketball's greatest players continues to inspire new generations of athletes.
