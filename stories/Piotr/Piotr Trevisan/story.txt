Piotr Trevisan stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the city skyline. The soft glow of the moon cast a silver light on the towering skyscrapers, and for a moment, he felt like he was floating above it all.

As a child, Piotr had always dreamed of flying. He would spend hours playing with his makeshift wings, made from cardboard and twine, in the park behind his family's old townhouse. But life had taken him on a different path. Growing up in a family of engineers, he had learned to build things – machines that could fly.

But they never took off without someone else on board.

Years ago, Piotr had stumbled upon an abandoned hangar in the outskirts of the city. It was there that he built his first prototype, using scraps and parts he'd salvaged from old planes. The project had consumed him for months – every waking moment spent tinkering with wires, engines, and propellers.

The day it finally flew was like nothing Piotr had ever experienced before. Tears of joy streaming down his face, he held onto the control stick as the machine soared above the trees. It wasn't perfect – there were crashes, setbacks, and doubts that crept in when the engine sputtered or lost power. But with every try, Piotr learned more about aerodynamics, about balance, and about himself.

Now, at 40 years old, Piotr Trevisan stood on his rooftop perch, looking out over the city he'd helped build into a thriving metropolis. The wind rustled through his hair as he pulled his coat tight around him, the sound of wheels clicking against pavement echoing in the distance.

It was time to take flight again.

His eyes locked onto a sleek black plane parked on the helipad nearby. Piotr had spent months designing its aerodynamic lines and optimizing its engine for quiet operation. Tonight was the night he would test it out – the first solo flight since his last successful test about five years ago.

He took a deep breath, feeling the familiar tug of excitement in his chest. This time, there wouldn't be someone to hold onto; this time, Piotr Trevisan would fly for himself alone.

Without hesitation, he climbed down from the rooftop and into the cockpit, letting out a soft hum as the engines came alive beneath him. The city lights blurred together in a colorful smear as he lifted off the ground, soaring higher with every passing second...
