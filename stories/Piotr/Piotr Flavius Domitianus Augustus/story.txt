Born into a family of modest means, Piotr had always been driven by a desire for adventure and wealth. He honed his skills as a fighter, earning the respect of his comrades-in-arms. But it was not until he caught the eye of the great Roman general, Titus, that his true potential was revealed.

Titus saw something in Piotr that set him apart from the rest – a fierce determination and unwavering loyalty. He took the young mercenary under his wing, training him in the art of warfare and instilling in him the values of honor and duty.
