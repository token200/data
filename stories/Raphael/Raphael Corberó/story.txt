I couldn't find any information on a person named Raphael Corberó. Could you provide more context or clarify who this character is? If you'd like, I can create a story based on a fictional character with that name.

However, if you're looking for a story about a different person named Raphael, there is a well-known Spanish actor and dancer named Rafael Nadal's friend, but most famously there is Raphael Corberó (Rafael is sometimes misspelled as "Rafael" or "Raphaële"), however I couldn't find any information on a notable character with that name.

If you'd like to create a fictional character and provide more context about who Raphael Corberó is, I can certainly help write a story for them.
