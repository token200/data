One stormy evening, as the rain lashed against the city's windows, Raphael Nachtnebel received an unexpected visit from a mysterious woman named Lena. Her eyes gleamed like stars in the dim light, and her voice was as sweet as honey when she spoke of a shared past, one that threatened to upend everything he thought he knew about himself.

As they danced together under the strobing lights, Raphael Nachtnebel's grip on his mask began to slip, ever so slightly.
