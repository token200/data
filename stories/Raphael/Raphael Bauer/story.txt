Raphael Bauer stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out at the neon-lit cityscape below. As a former mercenary and private security contractor, he had seen his fair share of violence and bloodshed. But after the events of that fateful night in New Orleans, Raphael felt like he was running on empty.

He took a deep breath, letting the cool night air fill his lungs as he scanned the rooftops for any signs of movement. His latest mission had just gone south, and now he found himself on the run from both the authorities and rival factions.

Raphael's phone buzzed in his pocket, breaking the silence. He pulled it out to see a text message from an unknown number: "Meet me at the Red Door bar on 5th Street if you want to live."

He raised an eyebrow. Who was this mysterious sender, and what did they want with him? Raphael's instincts told him to be cautious, but his curiosity got the better of him.

He slipped off the rooftop and into the crowded streets, weaving through pedestrians as he made his way to the Red Door bar. As he entered, a familiar face caught his eye: Samantha "Sam" Thompson, an old flame and fellow mercenary turned rogue agent.

She smiled as Raphael approached, and he knew right away that she was in on whatever this was. "Raphael, it's been a while," she said, sliding onto the stool next to him.

"What do you want, Sam?" he asked, ordering a whiskey at the bar.

"I heard you were looking for work," she replied, sipping her own drink. "I might have something for you. There's a job coming up that requires your... particular set of skills."

Raphael raised an eyebrow. What kind of mission would warrant his services? Before he could ask, Sam handed him a folder containing more information.

As Raphael scanned the contents, his eyes widened in surprise. This wasn't just any job – it was high-stakes espionage, counter-terrorism, and possibly even assassination.

"Tell me more," he said, his mind already racing with strategies and contingency plans.

Sam leaned in close, her voice barely audible over the music. "Let's just say this one has personal stakes for you, Raphael."

For a moment, Raphael forgot about the danger, the risk, and the uncertainty. All he felt was excitement, anticipation. This could be it – his ticket out of hiding and back into the game.

"I'm in," he said, with a nod.
