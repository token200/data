Raphael Xia sat at his desk, sipping his tea as he stared out the window at the rain-soaked streets below. A renowned detective in the city of New Haven, Xia had solved some of its most baffling cases with ease and precision. His calm demeanor was a stark contrast to the chaos that often surrounded him.

As he pondered the latest puzzle before him, his phone rang, shrill in the quiet morning air. "Detective Xia," he answered, his voice firm but polite.

"Raphael, we've got a body," his partner, Detective Thompson, said on the other end of the line. "Looks like a professional hit."

Xia's eyes narrowed as he set down his tea cup. He had been waiting for a case like this. A professional hit? This could be the break he needed to crack a string of seemingly unrelated murders that had been plaguing the city.

He arrived at the scene with Thompson, and Xia's trained eye took in every detail. The victim was young, barely out of his teens. A single bullet wound to the chest, no signs of struggle or forced entry. This was a carefully planned assassination.

As they collected evidence and began questioning witnesses, Xia's mind worked overtime to piece together the clues. He knew that the key to solving this case lay in understanding the motivations behind the hit. Who had ordered it? And why?

The rain continued to fall as Xia walked back to his office, lost in thought. His partner had mentioned something about a possible connection between this murder and an old case from five years ago. Xia made a mental note to look into that.

Back at his desk, he began researching the new lead, his eyes scanning the stack of files in front of him. Raphael Xia was on the case, and nothing would stop him from uncovering the truth. The rain-soaked streets outside seemed to fade away as he delved deeper into the mystery, driven by his unyielding determination for justice.

The game was afoot, and Detective Xia was ready to play.
