Raphael Salamanca stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the bustling streets of Albuquerque. As a master thief and cunning con artist, he had made a name for himself in the city's underworld. His eyes scanned the crowded sidewalks, searching for any sign of his mark.

Raphael Salamanca was known for his ruthless efficiency and unparalleled skills in deception. He had built a reputation as one of the most feared and respected figures in the city's criminal elite. His long black hair and sharp jawline only added to his intimidating presence.

As he made his way through the throngs of people, Raphael Salamanca's trained ears picked up on the sound of footsteps behind him. He spun around, his hand instinctively reaching for the gun holstered at his hip. A tall, imposing figure emerged from the shadows, flanked by two burly bodyguards.

"Raphael Salamanca," the stranger said, his voice low and gravelly. "I've been looking for you."

Raphael Salamanca's eyes narrowed as he took in the stranger's garb - a crisp black suit and tie, unlike anything he had seen on the city streets before. "What business do you have with me?" he asked, his tone neutral.

The stranger smiled, revealing a hint of gold tooth. "I represent...a client," he said, his eyes glinting with amusement. "One who is willing to make you a very generous offer for your particular set of skills."

Raphael Salamanca raised an eyebrow. He had dealt with enough players in the city's underworld to know that any offer that seemed too good to be true was likely a trap. But there was something about this stranger that didn't quite add up.

"What kind of offer?" he asked, his voice tinged with curiosity.

The stranger leaned forward, his eyes locked on Raphael Salamanca's. "One that could make you richer than you ever thought possible," he whispered. "But it comes with a price, one that you may not be willing to pay."

Raphael Salamanca's gaze lingered on the stranger for a moment before he nodded, a slow smile spreading across his face. "I'm listening."
