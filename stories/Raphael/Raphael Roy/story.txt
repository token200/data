Raphael Roy was a man shrouded in mystery, with an air of quiet confidence that commanded attention. A former hitman for a London-based crime lord, he had retired from the game five years ago to open his own pub in the heart of the city. The sign above the door read "The Red Lion," and it was here that Raphael spent most of his days pouring pints and sharing stories with the locals.

Raphael's past was complicated, and he preferred it that way. Few people knew much about him beyond his association with the underworld, and he liked it that way. But those who did know him had come to respect his code of honor – a strict set of principles that governed every decision he made.

One night, as Raphael polished a mug with a dirty rag, the door swung open and a young woman slipped in, her eyes scanning the room until they landed on him. She was a looker, with long, curly brown hair and piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into his soul. Raphael raised an eyebrow, intrigued.

The woman approached him slowly, her movements fluid and confident. "Raphael Roy?" she asked, her voice husky and seductive.

Raphael nodded, wiping the sweat from his forehead with a grin. "What can I get you?"

"I'm looking for someone," she said, her eyes locking onto his. "Someone who knows about... things."

Raphael's expression turned serious, but he kept his tone light. "Things? You mean like a particular brand of whiskey or perhaps the best way to cook a plate of fish and chips?"

The woman smiled, and Raphael felt his heart skip a beat. He knew that look – it was the same one he had seen on the faces of his old victims, before they met their maker.

"Let's just say I'm looking for someone with... particular skills," she said, her voice dripping with promise.

Raphael leaned in, his eyes glinting in the firelight. "I might know a thing or two about that," he whispered, his breath caressing her ear.

The woman's smile grew wider, and Raphael knew that he was in trouble – but he wasn't complaining. He poured himself another pint, and together they talked long into the night, their conversation weaving a spell of intrigue and desire. It seemed that Raphael Roy's secrets were still safe, for now.
