Arianna Eglitis stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. She had been traveling for hours, and was finally within reach of her destination: the small coastal town where she would spend the summer working as a waitress.

As she made her way through the crowds, Arianna couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her. This was where she grew up, where her family had spent countless summers playing in the waves and collecting seashells. She had left for college a few years ago, eager to explore the world beyond her hometown, but now she was back, seeking refuge from the stresses of adulthood.

Arianna's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her name being called. "Eglitis!" It was her coworker, Emily, beckoning her over to the hostess stand. Arianna smiled and made her way over, exchanging a quick hello with Emily before taking her place among the waiting customers.

As the day wore on, Arianna settled into a comfortable routine, chatting with the regulars and keeping track of orders with ease. She was in her element, and felt a sense of contentment wash over her that she hadn't experienced in months.

After a long afternoon of work, Arianna headed back to her small apartment, feeling exhausted but exhilarated. She changed into a pair of worn sweatpants and collapsed onto the couch, letting out a sigh of relief as she finally allowed herself to relax. For a few moments, she just sat there, watching the sun set over the ocean through the window.

As she drifted off to sleep, Arianna couldn't help but feel grateful for this little slice of heaven she had discovered. She was home, and that's all that mattered right now. With a smile still on her face, she let the sound of the waves lull her into a well-deserved rest.
