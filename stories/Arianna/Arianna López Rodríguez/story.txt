Arianna López Rodríguez stepped into the dimly lit café, scanning the room for her friend, Sofia. The air was thick with the smell of freshly brewed coffee and the hum of hushed conversations. Arianna spotted Sofia sitting alone at a small table by the window, nursing a cup of coffee.

As Arianna approached, Sofia looked up, a mixture of excitement and nervousness on her face. "Hey, Ari! I'm so glad you're here," she said, using Arianna's nickname. Arianna smiled warmly and took a seat across from Sofia. "What's going on? You sounded really uptight when we talked last night."

Sofia sighed, collecting her thoughts before speaking. "I had the most surreal conversation with my ex-boyfriend today. He just called out of nowhere, saying he was sorry for how things ended between us." Arianna raised an eyebrow. "Sorry? That's a pretty vague apology if you ask me."

The two friends spent the next hour dissecting Sofia's feelings about the situation. Arianna listened attentively, offering words of encouragement and skepticism when needed. As they talked, Arianna couldn't help but think back to her own experiences with past relationships.

Arianna López Rodríguez had once been hurt by someone who claimed to love her, only to ghost her after a few months of dating. The experience had left her guarded and wary, making it difficult for her to open up to others. But as she listened to Sofia's story, Arianna realized that this was exactly why they needed to talk – to process their emotions and come out stronger on the other side.

As they finished their coffee, Sofia looked determined. "I'm not going to waste my time on him anymore. I deserve better than some half-hearted apology." Arianna grinned, feeling a sense of pride and solidarity with her friend. "That's the spirit, amiga! You got this." And with that, the two friends clinked cups together in a toast to new beginnings.
