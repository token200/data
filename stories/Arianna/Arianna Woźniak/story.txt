Arianna Woźniak stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him at the corner table, nursing a cup of coffee and staring intently at his laptop screen. She made her way over to him, weaving through the throng of people.

As she reached his side, he looked up, a hint of surprise in his eyes. "Hey," he said, closing his laptop. "I didn't expect you."

Arianna smiled, settling into the chair across from him. "I know I'm not exactly the most punctual person." She pulled out a small notebook from her bag and flipped through its pages, stopping at a particular entry. "But I've been working on this project for weeks, and I think I finally have it sorted."

Her companion raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. "What's the project?"

Arianna took a deep breath, launching into an explanation of her novel-in-progress. As she spoke, her eyes sparkled with excitement, and he found himself getting drawn in. He listened attentively, asking questions and making suggestions.

The hours passed, the café growing quieter as the lunch rush subsided. Arianna wrote feverishly, fueled by their conversation and her own creativity. Her companion, a writer himself, offered words of encouragement, helping to push her through the tough spots.

As they prepared to leave, he turned to her with a smile. "You know, you're not half bad yourself." Arianna laughed, feeling a warmth spread through her chest. It was moments like these that reminded her why she loved writing – for the connection it gave her to others, and the sense of purpose it provided.

The two of them strolled out into the afternoon sun, their footsteps in sync as they walked back to Arianna's small apartment. She knew he'd be leaving soon, but for now, they savored the present moment together.

As they reached the entrance, her companion paused, turning to face her once more. "You know what?" he said, his voice low and conspiratorial. "I think your story needs a bit of work." Arianna grinned mischievously, knowing exactly what he meant.
