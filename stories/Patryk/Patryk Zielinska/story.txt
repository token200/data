Patryk's eyes seemed to gleam with a mischievous spark whenever he was plotting his next heist, and those who crossed him knew better than to underestimate him.

One fateful night, Patryk Zielinska set his sights on the most valuable treasure in Warsaw: the priceless Diamond of Poland, housed in the city's crown jewel museum.
