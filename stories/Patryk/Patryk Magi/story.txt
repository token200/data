One evening, as Patryk Magi sat in a cozy café on the outskirts of town, sipping a rich cup of coffee and watching the stars twinkle to life above, he was approached by an old friend, Janek. "Patryk Magi," Janek said, his voice low and conspiratorial. "I've heard rumors about your latest project. What's really going on?"
