Patryk Moreno Martinez was known for his passion for photography and his ability to capture breathtaking moments on film. Born in the small town of San Juan, Puerto Rico, Patryk grew up surrounded by vibrant colors and lively rhythms that would later influence his artistic style.

As a young man, Patryk spent countless hours exploring the streets of Old San Juan, camera slung over his shoulder, soaking up every detail of the city's rich history. He was particularly drawn to the crumbling colonial buildings, their weathered facades telling stories of centuries past. Patryk saw beauty in the worn stones and intricate carvings, and he sought to freeze these moments in time.

After completing his studies at the University of Puerto Rico, Patryk set out into the world, camera in hand, determined to capture the essence of the Latin American experience.

Yet despite his success, Patryk remained true to his roots. He continued to shoot in Puerto Rico, using his camera as a way to share stories about the island's people, traditions, and struggles. His images were more than just snapshots; they were windows into the soul of the region.
