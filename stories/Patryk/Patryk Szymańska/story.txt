One day, while browsing through a local art gallery, Patryk stumbled upon an exhibition featuring the work of Polish street artists. The bold colors and edgy styles caught his attention, and he felt an instant connection to their work. He spent hours admiring the pieces, imagining how they could be incorporated into his own design projects.

Inspired by what he had seen, Patryk decided to take his photography skills to the next level. He set up a makeshift studio in his small apartment, investing in a few basic camera equipment and editing software. For weeks, he honed his craft, practicing his composition and color palette.
