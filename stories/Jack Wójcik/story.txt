Jack Wójcik trudged through the wet streets, his eyes fixed on the pavement ahead. The rain poured down like a relentless curtain, casting a gray mist over the city. He'd been walking for what felt like hours, but he still had no clear destination in mind.

It wasn't that Jack didn't know where he was going – it's just that every place seemed to blend together after a while. His small apartment on 5th Street, the diner downtown, his part-time job at the hardware store... they all started to feel like variations of the same monotony.

As he turned onto Main Street, Jack spotted the neon lights of Mike's Tavern beckoning him inside. He'd been there often enough before – the bartender knew his name, and the regulars knew not to sit near him during Steelers games.

The door swung open with a jolt as Jack pushed it wide. The smell of stale beer and stale air wafted out, enveloping him like a familiar shroud. Mike himself greeted Jack from behind the bar, wiping down a mug with a rag that might have seen better days.

"What can I get ya, Jack?" Mike asked, his voice low and soothing.

Just coffee, for now. Black. And a booth in the corner.

As he sipped his coffee, Jack's gaze wandered around the tavern, taking in the faded photographs on the walls, the sports memorabilia scattered about, and the few patrons huddled over their drinks like solitary islanders. It was a comforting space, one that never changed or surprised him – not like the world outside.

The rain pounded against the windows, casting rhythmic shadows across the floor. Jack watched it, mesmerized by the steady beat. His mind began to wander, drifting back to memories of his childhood in Poland, before he'd immigrated with his parents when he was a teenager.

Their small apartment near the Vistula River had always been noisy – not just from the sounds of the river itself, but from the endless chatter and laughter of their family. Jack's father used to tell him stories about the old country, where music flowed as naturally as the rivers, and people sang together like a single entity.

For a moment, the rain outside seemed to carry those echoes – memories long buried resurfaced, swirling through his mind like wisps of smoke. Jack felt a strange sense of longing wash over him, like he'd been living someone else's life up until now.

But as quickly as it had risen, the feeling subsided. Reality snapped back into place, and Jack was left with the damp streets outside, Mike's Tavern's worn booths, and his own steady routine.

He paid his tab and stood to leave. Outside, the rain showed no signs of letting up – but something within Jack shifted. The streets didn't seem so gray, the people passing him by seemed more real, and for an instant, he caught a glimpse of the city as it truly was: messy, alive, and pulsing with its own rhythm.

Jack Wójcik walked out into that downpour, not knowing where he was headed next – but sensing that this time, it would be somewhere new.
