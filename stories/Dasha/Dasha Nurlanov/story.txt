Dasha Nurlanov stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the dimly lit station. The air was thick with the smell of decay and neglect, but she didn't notice. She had grown accustomed to such places.

As a detective with the Moscow Metro Police Department, Dasha had seen her fair share of crime scenes, from petty thefts to gruesome murders. But there was something about this particular case that nagged at her. A young woman, barely out of her teens, had gone missing in the very same station where she now stood.

Dasha's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps behind her. She turned to see a tall, lanky man with sunken eyes and a gaunt face. He introduced himself as Viktor, a local informant who claimed to have information about the missing girl.

"I know what happened to her," Viktor said, his voice barely above a whisper. "She was seen arguing with someone in this very station. Someone who...who was already known to the police."

Dasha's eyes narrowed. She had been investigating the same case, but had hit a dead end. Could this be the break she needed? She pulled out her notebook and began to take notes.

As they walked through the station, Viktor pointed out various landmarks and shared stories about the people who worked there. Dasha listened intently, taking it all in. She was a detective, after all, and this case was personal now.

They stopped at a small caf√© on the platform, where Viktor ordered two cups of black coffee. As they sipped their drinks, Dasha leaned in closer to him. "Tell me more about the girl," she said, her voice low.

Viktor hesitated before speaking. "She was involved with someone who...who had connections to the wrong side of town." He glanced around nervously, as if fearful of being overheard.

Dasha's instincts told her that this was more than just a random street crime. This was something bigger, something that could put her own life at risk. She made a mental note to look deeper into Viktor's background and see if he had any hidden motives.

As they finished their coffee, Dasha stood up, her eyes locked on the exit. "I think it's time we got out of here," she said, tucking her notebook away. The game was afoot, and Dasha Nurlanov was ready to play.
