Dasha Mäkinen stepped off the plane and into the Helsinki airport, her long dark hair tied back in a ponytail as she scanned the crowd for any sign of trouble. As a former KGB agent turned freelance operative, she'd seen her fair share of danger, but something about this mission had her on edge.

Her client was a wealthy businessman with ties to the city's underworld, and Dasha was here to retrieve a valuable piece of intel that he claimed would bring him great success - or perhaps even a taste of justice. She didn't know what to believe, but she knew one thing for sure: she'd do whatever it took to get the job done.

As she made her way through customs and into the city streets, Dasha's instincts screamed at her that something was off. The Finnish capital seemed eerily quiet, the snow-covered buildings looming above like sentinels. She spotted a black sedan parked outside a nearby café, its engine purring softly as it waited for her arrival.

Dasha ducked inside, shaking the snow from her coat as she slid onto a stool at the bar. The bartender, a gruff but affable Finlander named Juhani, raised an eyebrow as she ordered a vodka shot. "What brings you to Helsinki, miss?" he asked, his voice low and measured.

Dasha smiled, a hint of mischief dancing in her eyes. "Just passing through," she said, her English flawless but with just the slightest hint of accent. Juhani raised an eyebrow, his expression skeptical, but Dasha could see the faintest glimmer of curiosity behind his gaze.

She downed the vodka shot, feeling the liquor burn its way into her veins as she listened to Juhani's friendly chatter about the city and its secrets. For a few blissful minutes, Dasha forgot about the danger that lurked outside, lost in the warm glow of Finnish hospitality.

But only for a moment.

As she finished her drink, Dasha spotted a figure watching her from across the room - a tall, imposing man with eyes that seemed to bore into her very soul. Her heart skipped a beat as she recognized the look: this was no ordinary bystander.

Dasha's instincts screamed at her to get out of there, fast, but something about the stranger's expression held her in place. For once, she felt truly lost for words.
