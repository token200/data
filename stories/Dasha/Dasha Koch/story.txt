Dasha Koch stepped off the Metro train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the crowded station. A journalist by trade, she had seen her fair share of bustling hubs, but there was something about this place that felt different. Perhaps it was the weather - a gray, Moscow-style gloom that seemed to seep into every pore.

As she made her way through the throng, Dasha's mind began to wander. She was waiting for a source, a man known only as "The Informant" who had promised to reveal some dirt on a high-ranking official. It was a long shot, but Dasha had a hunch that this could be the break she needed.

She spotted him across the room, his back to her as he sipped a lukewarm cup of coffee at a small table by the window. There was something about him that seemed... off. Maybe it was the way he avoided eye contact or the nervous habit of tapping his foot under the table.

Dasha approached him cautiously, not wanting to spook him into flight just yet. As she reached his side, he looked up and caught her gaze for a fleeting instant before looking away again.

"You're Dasha Koch," he said finally, his voice low and hesitant.

"That's right," she replied, producing her journalist's ID from her bag.

He nodded and took a deep breath before launching into the story. It was explosive - allegations of corruption that went all the way to the top, and a web of deceit that had ensnared some of Moscow's most powerful figures.

Dasha listened intently, her mind racing with questions and follow-up leads. This could be it - the big scoop she had been working towards for months.

As they parted ways, The Informant handed Dasha a small USB drive containing evidence to back up his claims. "Be careful," he whispered. "This won't sit well with anyone."

Dasha nodded, already thinking about how she would spin this story to her readers. She made her way back to the station exit, the gray Moscow gloom seeming a little less oppressive by the minute.

For the first time in months, Dasha felt like she was onto something big. And as she stepped out into the chill evening air, the promise of a long night ahead filled her with a thrill of excitement.
