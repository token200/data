As she sat at her desk, staring blankly at the computer screen in front of her, an idea suddenly struck her - she would pay a visit to one of her sources who had been tight-lipped about the whole affair. Taking a deep breath, Dasha picked up her phone and dialed the number, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.

With renewed determination, Dasha Jarvinen set out on a mission to uncover the truth, no matter what it took - and she was determined to bring it all back down to earth.
