Eva Errani stood at the edge of the rooftop, the wind whipping her dark hair into a frenzy as she gazed out over the city. The neon lights of Tokyo's skyscrapers reflected off the wet pavement below, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the concrete.

As a member of the elite Japanese mafia, Eva was no stranger to danger and deception. But tonight, she felt restless, her mind consumed by the events of the past week. Her latest mark, a wealthy businessman named Shinji, had been too easy, too predictable. The thrill of the heist had worn off, replaced by a dull sense of boredom.

Eva's phone buzzed in her pocket, shrill and insistent. She pulled it out to see a text from her boss, Ryota: "Meet me at the club on Shinbashi Dori at midnight. We need to discuss your next move."

Eva raised an eyebrow as she typed out a quick response: "I'll be there." She slipped the phone back into her pocket and turned to leave the rooftop, but not before casting a glance over her shoulder.

In the shadows, a figure watched her go with interest. It was Taro, a former colleague who had been quietly seething against Eva's latest move - stealing his idea for a high-stakes heist and passing it off as her own.

Eva made her way to the club in silence, her eyes scanning the crowded room as she searched for Ryota. The DJ spun a hypnotic beat, but Eva was too far gone to notice. She had an itch to scratch, and she knew just how to do it.

As she reached Ryota's table, he raised his glass in a silent toast: "To your next big score, Eva." But before she could respond, a voice interrupted from the shadows behind him - "Not so fast, boss. I think it's time we had a little chat about loyalty."

Eva's eyes narrowed as Taro emerged from the darkness, a sly smile spreading across his face. She knew she was in for a fight, and she was ready to take on anyone who stood between her and what she wanted most - success.
