Eva Romanova stood alone in the dimly lit alley, her eyes scanning the crowded streets of Manhattan. It had been years since she'd last walked among humans, and yet the city felt just as familiar as it had all those years ago.

She adjusted the silver pendant around her neck, a gift from her friend Natasha. A small token of their complicated past, one that still lingered in Eva's mind like an open wound.

As she turned to leave, a figure emerged from the shadows. His eyes gleamed with a knowing intensity, and for a moment, Eva felt the familiar thrill of recognition. "Sergei," she whispered, her voice barely audible.

He smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "Eva. It's been too long."

They walked in silence, their footsteps echoing off the buildings as they navigated the winding streets. Sergei knew the city like the back of his hand, and he led Eva to a small caf√© tucked away on a side street.

 Inside, the air was thick with the scent of coffee and baked goods. Sergei ordered for them both, and as they waited for their drinks, Eva asked the question that had been plaguing her for weeks. "What do you know about her?"

Sergei's expression turned guarded. "Who's 'her'?"

Eva's eyes narrowed. "You know exactly who I'm talking about. The one who left without explanation, leaving me to pick up the pieces."

Sergei sighed, his shoulders sagging in a familiar gesture. "I've tried, Eva. But I don't know what you're looking for. Maybe she's not even alive anymore."

The words cut through Eva like a knife. She had always assumed that her sister was dead, but now she wasn't so sure. A spark of determination ignited within her, and for the first time in years, Eva felt truly alive.

As they finished their drinks and parted ways, Sergei handed her a small folder filled with files and photographs. "Be careful, Eva," he warned. "The world isn't always kind to those who've been left behind."

Eva smiled, tucking the folder into her bag. She knew that she had a long road ahead of her, but for the first time in years, she felt like she was on the right path.
