Eva Lācis stepped out of the small café, her eyes scanning the bustling streets of Riga's Old Town. As a historian and museum curator, she knew every nook and cranny of this ancient city, but today she was on a mission to uncover a long-forgotten secret.

Rumors had been circulating among the local art community about a hidden collection of medieval artifacts, said to be hidden within the walls of the Riga Castle. Eva's instincts told her that this was no mere myth, and she was determined to find out if it was true.

She walked through the castle gates, her footsteps echoing off the stone walls as she made her way to the museum wing. As curator of the National History Museum, Eva had spent years studying the history of Latvia, but she had never stumbled upon any mention of such a collection.

As she reached the display case where the medieval artifacts were kept, Eva noticed a small inscription on the wall - "For those who seek the truth." She smiled to herself, knowing that this was more than just a coincidence. The inscription seemed to be a message from someone who shared her passion for history.

Eva began to search the museum's archives, searching for any mention of the collection or its possible location. Hours passed as she sifted through dusty files and ancient documents, but finally, she stumbled upon an entry that made her heart skip a beat - "Collection donated by Eva Lācis herself".

It turned out that Eva's own great-grandmother had been a prominent collector and historian, who had amassed this collection over several decades. The artifacts were too fragile to be displayed in the public museum, so they had been hidden away for safekeeping.

Eva beamed with excitement as she realized that she was standing in front of the very collection she had spent her whole life searching for. She carefully made a note on the inscription, now knowing that it was more than just a message - it was a promise from someone who shared her passion and dedication to history.
