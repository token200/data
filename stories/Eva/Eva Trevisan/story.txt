Eva Trevisan stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It had been months since she'd left this sleepy town, and yet the familiarity of it all still lingered in the air. As Eva Trevisan, she was used to feeling like an outsider, a ghost haunting the edges of people's lives.

As she walked through the station, the sound of her heels echoed off the walls. She had always been drawn to the darkness, the mystery that lay just beyond the surface of things. And this town, with its crumbling buildings and overgrown gardens, was like a mausoleum come to life.

Eva Trevisan made her way to the local pub, the same one where she'd spent countless hours as a teenager sipping whiskey and listening to the locals' tales of old. The bartender looked up as she walked in, his eyes narrowing slightly before he nodded and said, "The usual?"

"Make it a double," Eva Trevisan replied, sliding onto a stool at the bar.

As the night wore on, the pub filled with familiar faces, all chatting and laughing like they'd never been apart. But Eva Trevisan knew better. She saw the hidden stories behind every smile, every joke, every whispered secret.

She sipped her drink, lost in thought as the world around her dissolved into the shadows. It was a talent she'd honed over the years, this ability to see beyond the surface. And it had made her a loner, a ghost who haunted the edges of people's lives like a shadow.

As the night drew to a close and the patrons began to disperse, Eva Trevisan slipped out into the cool night air, the darkness enveloping her like a shroud. She walked alone, the stars above twinkling like ice chips in the sky.

In this world of shadows and secrets, Eva Trevisan was queen. And she knew that she would never be seen again, her presence only felt by those who knew to look for it.
