Eva Arjona stepped into the dimly lit tavern, the smell of stale ale and sweat wafting through the air. She had heard whispers of a hidden underground market within the city's walls, where rare artifacts and forbidden knowledge could be found. As a skilled thief and collector, Eva was always on the lookout for the next big score.

As she made her way to the bar, a hooded figure emerged from the shadows, their eyes locked onto hers. "Eva Arjona," they whispered, their voice husky and mysterious. "We've been expecting you."

Eva's hand instinctively went to the dagger at her waist, but she hesitated, intrigued by the stranger's words. "Expecting me? How did you know my name?"

The figure pulled back its hood, revealing a woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. "I'm Arianna," she said, with a nod of respect. "And I have information about the artifact you seek."

Eva's interest was piqued, and she leaned in closer to Arianna. "What do you know?"

Arianna smiled, her eyes glinting with amusement. "Let's just say that I have... connections within the market. Information about a rare gemstone, hidden away for centuries. It's said to grant immense power to its owner."

Eva's heart skipped a beat at the mention of power. She had always been drawn to the allure of forbidden knowledge and treasures. But she knew the risks involved – the gemstone was likely guarded by powerful forces who would stop at nothing to keep it from falling into the wrong hands.

Arianna handed Eva a small parchment with a cryptic message scrawled upon it. "Meet me at the old windmill on the outskirts of town, midnight. Come alone."

Eva nodded, her mind racing with possibilities. She tucked the parchment into her pocket and turned to leave, but not before casting a sly smile at Arianna. "I'll be there," she whispered.

As Eva vanished into the crowd, Arianna watched her go, a mixture of excitement and trepidation coursing through her veins. She knew that Eva Arjona was a force to be reckoned with – both on and off the streets. But was she ready for what lay ahead? Only time would tell.

The tavern's patrons were unaware of the game being played behind their backs, but one thing was certain: Eva Arjona had just taken a step closer to uncovering the secrets hidden within the city's ancient walls – and nothing would ever be the same again.
