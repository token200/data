Eva Laine stepped out of the rain and into the cozy café on the corner. She shook her hair, sending droplets flying in all directions, before making her way to the counter. The barista, a friendly woman named Rachel, greeted her with a warm smile.

"Hey, Eva! What can I get for you today?" Rachel asked, wiping down the counter with a white apron.

Eva Laine smiled, "Just a coffee, please. Black."

Rachel nodded and began to brew a fresh pot. As she waited, Eva Laine took a seat at a small table by the window, watching as people walked by on the rain-soaked street.

She was lost in thought, her mind preoccupied with the argument she had with her sister earlier that day. It seemed like every time she turned around, there was another issue to deal with. Her parents were getting older, and Eva Laine felt the weight of responsibility bearing down on her shoulders.

Just as Rachel returned with Eva Laine's coffee, her phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out, hesitating for a moment before answering.

"Hey, what's up?" she asked, already knowing that it was her sister, Ava.

Their argument had been heated, but Eva Laine knew better than to let it simmer for long. "We need to talk about Mom and Dad," she said, her voice firm but calm.

Ava sighed on the other end of the line. "I know. I just don't want to lose them."

Eva Laine felt a pang in her chest as she listened to Ava's words. She knew exactly what her sister meant – losing the people you love was one of life's greatest fears. But Eva Laine also knew that they couldn't keep putting off the inevitable.

As she finished her coffee, Eva Laine stood up and made her way back out into the rain. It wasn't going to be easy, but she was determined to support Ava through this difficult time. And with a deep breath, she squared her shoulders and walked forward, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
