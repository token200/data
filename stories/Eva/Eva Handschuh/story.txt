Eva Helga Handschuh was known for her unyielding determination and unwavering passion for social justice. As a prominent activist in Berlin's underground art scene, she had built a reputation for pushing boundaries and challenging the status quo.

One fateful evening, Eva stood atop a makeshift stage in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of Kreuzberg, addressing a sea of curious onlookers.
