Eva Schillaci stepped out of her small, cramped apartment and onto the bustling streets of Rome. Her dark hair was pulled back into a tight ponytail, revealing a smattering of freckles across her cheeks and nose. She adjusted her worn leather jacket, a token from a past life that still held a hint of rebellion.

As she walked through the winding alleys, Eva's mind wandered to the argument she'd had with her sister, Lucia, the night before. The tension between them was palpable, like a thick fog that refused to lift. They'd always been close, but their differing paths in life had driven a wedge between them.

Eva had given up on her dreams of becoming a photographer years ago, settling for a steady job as a freelance writer instead. Lucia, on the other hand, had become a successful artist, her paintings sought after by collectors and museums alike. The weight of that success hung over Eva like a shadow, making her feel inadequate.

She stopped in front of a small caf√©, where she'd agreed to meet with her old friend, Leo. A fellow writer and poet, Leo had always been the voice of reason in their friendship. As she pushed open the door, the bell above it rang out, announcing her arrival.

Leo looked up from his coffee, a hint of a smile on his face. "Eva, darling! I've got just the thing to lift your spirits." He handed her a small package wrapped in brown paper and twine. "I found this on my last trip to the countryside. It's supposed to have healing properties."

Eva unwrapped the paper to reveal a small crystal nestled in a bed of velvet. The crystal seemed to hum with an otherworldly energy, drawing her in like a magnet.

"Leo, it's beautiful," she said, feeling a sense of wonder wash over her.

He leaned back in his chair, a faraway look in his eyes. "Sometimes, we just need to listen to the stillness inside ourselves. That's what this crystal is all about."

Eva looked at Leo, and for a moment, they were two old souls lost in time, their differences forgotten. The fog of tension began to lift, replaced by a sense of peace that settled deep within her chest.

"I think I need that," she said softly, tucking the crystal into her jacket pocket.

Leo smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "That's exactly what you do, Eva. You listen."
