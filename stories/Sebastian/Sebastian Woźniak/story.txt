Sebastian Woźniak sat in the dimly lit corner of the crowded café, nursing his lukewarm coffee. His eyes scanned the room, taking in the familiar faces of friends and acquaintances all engaged in their own conversations. As a freelance journalist, he was used to being alone, but it didn't mean he enjoyed it.

Sebastian's gaze drifted towards a young woman with bright pink hair, typing away on her laptop at a small table by the window. He watched as she expertly navigated a complex article, her fingers flying across the keyboard with a speed and precision that belied her youth.

He knew that girl – or rather, she knew him. They had met just last week at a local literary event, where he was booked to read an excerpt from his latest piece. She had been fascinated by his work, and they had struck up a conversation about everything from the meaning of life to their shared love of 80s punk rock.

Now, as he watched her, Sebastian couldn't help but feel drawn to her again. Her name was Lena, and she seemed to possess an energy that drew people in – even someone like him, who had grown accustomed to being a loner.

Sebastian's phone buzzed on the table beside him, breaking his reverie. He picked it up, expecting another message from an editor or potential client. But instead, there was a text from Lena herself: "Hey, want to grab dinner and talk about something other than writing for a change?"

He smiled, feeling a spark of excitement he hadn't felt in weeks. For one night, at least, Sebastian Woźniak could put aside his journalist's hat and just be himself.

As he made his way through the crowded café, Sebastian couldn't help but wonder what Lena had to say – or more importantly, what she wanted from him. Was it something as simple as a friendly dinner conversation, or was there more at play? Either way, he was willing to find out.

The lights and sounds of the café faded into the background as Sebastian made his way towards Lena's table, feeling an energy he hadn't felt in years building inside him like a promise. For one night, at least, he could forget about his solitary life and just be present – with someone new.
