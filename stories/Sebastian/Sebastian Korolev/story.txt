Sebastian Korolev, a man shrouded in mystery, stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the bustling streets of Moscow. His piercing blue eyes scanned the crowded square, his gaze lingering on the faint hum of activity as people went about their day.

As a retired KGB agent, Sebastian's life had been one of secrecy and deception. He had spent years mastering the art of disguise and manipulation, earning him the nickname "The Ghost" among those who knew him. But after a decade of working in the shadows, Sebastian had decided it was time to lay down his guns and retire.

Or so he told himself.

In reality, Sebastian's past still haunted him, and the memories of his most high-stakes missions lingered like open wounds. The Russian Revolution, the fall of Berlin, and the countless lives he had altered with a single phone call – all these haunted dreams came flooding back as he walked through the streets, blending in seamlessly with the crowds.

As he made his way to the café where they would meet, Sebastian couldn't shake off the feeling that someone was watching him. He glanced over his shoulder, but the sea of faces seemed to blend together, revealing nothing. Yet the nagging sense persisted.

Sebastian's meeting partner, a former CIA operative named Rachel, had agreed to meet him for coffee at 3 pm sharp. The topic of their discussion would be sensitive, and Sebastian knew that Rachel was one of the few people he could trust.

He entered the café, his eyes scanning the room until they landed on Rachel's familiar figure sitting by the window. Her long blonde hair cascaded down her back like a river of gold as she sipped a cup of coffee, her expression unreadable behind sunglasses.

Sebastian took a seat across from her and signaled for a waiter to bring over two cups of black coffee. As they began their discussion, Sebastian couldn't help but notice that Rachel seemed more agitated than usual. Her eyes darted about the café, her lips pressing together in a tight line.

"What is it, Rachel?" Sebastian asked, sensing something was amiss.

For a moment, she didn't respond, her gaze locking onto his like a trap had been sprung. Then, in a voice barely above a whisper, she spoke the words that would set Sebastian's world spinning out of control: "We've received intel about your past, Korolev. Intel that threatens to expose everything you thought you'd left behind."

Sebastian's eyes narrowed as he reached for his cup, his mind racing with the implications. This was not what he had expected from their meeting today.
