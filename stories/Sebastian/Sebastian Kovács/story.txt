Sebastian Kovács stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the dimly lit station. It had been years since he'd set foot in Budapest, but the city's rhythms remained familiar to him. As a young man, he'd spent countless hours exploring its winding streets, listening to its music, and drinking coffee at tiny cafes.

Now, as a middle-aged man with grey hair and worn eyes, Sebastian returned to the city he once called home for one reason: his estranged father's funeral. His mother had sent him an invitation weeks ago, but Sebastian hadn't expected the full extent of family obligations that came with it – including caring for his father's old apartment.

As he made his way through the crowded station, a young girl caught his eye. She couldn't have been more than twelve years old, and she was rummaging through a discarded suitcase in search of something. Her bright blue eyes sparkled as Sebastian approached her, and she straightened up, clutching an old guitar case.

"Where are you from?" Sebastian asked, taking the suitcase from her.

"I...I don't know," she replied hesitantly. "My mom said I could ask here."

Sebastian smiled softly. "You can stay for a while, if you want. There's room in my apartment."

Over the next few days, Sebastian found himself drawn to the girl – whose name was Szofi – and her story. She'd been living on the streets, surviving off scraps and playing music to make ends meet. Her talent was undeniable, but it seemed like no one took notice.

Sebastian saw echoes of his own life in Szofi's eyes. He remembered his early days as a musician, when dreams were raw and anything seemed possible. He began to wonder if he'd sold himself short by giving up on music for stability.

One evening, as they sat together in Sebastian's apartment, listening to the night sounds outside, Szofi handed him an old CD – a collection of folk songs from his homeland.

"Play it," she said, her eyes shining.

Sebastian did. The haunting melodies and tales carried them back to their own pasts, and for a moment, they both forgot about struggles and loss. They were back in Budapest's streets, chasing dreams with music as their compass.

As the night wore on, Szofi began to sing, her voice like a spark of light in the darkness. Sebastian listened, his eyes locked onto hers, feeling something stir within him – something that had been sleeping for years.
