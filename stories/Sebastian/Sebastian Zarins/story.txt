Sebastian Zarins's latest mark was a wealthy socialite named Isabella, who had unwittingly set herself up for exploitation by flaunting her wealth on social media.

And when that moment arrived, he pounced, effortlessly manipulating Isabella into handing over her prized possession – a rare diamond necklace.

As Sebastian Zarins slipped away with his prize, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of admiration for Isabella's naivety. It was almost... flattering, in its own way. He made a mental note to keep an eye on her, if only out of curiosity.

Back at his safehouse, Sebastian Zarins carefully cleaned and polished the necklace before displaying it proudly in his collection of pilfered treasures. It was just another notch on his belt, another testament to his unparalleled skills as a thief. As he admired his reflection in the mirror, a wry smile spread across his face.
