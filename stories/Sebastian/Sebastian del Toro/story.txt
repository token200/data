Sebastian del Toro was a man shrouded in mystery. Few people knew much about his past, and even fewer had seen him smile. But those who had were forever changed by the encounter.

Born to a family of modest means, Sebastian grew up on the streets of Barcelona. He quickly learned to rely on his wits and cunning to survive, earning himself a reputation as a skilled thief and scoundrel. As he honed his skills, Sebastian's natural charisma and charm drew people in, making it easy for him to manipulate those around him.

Years passed, and Sebastian del Toro became known as one of the greatest thieves of all time. His exploits were whispered about in hushed tones, and his name was mentioned alongside those of the most infamous outlaws. But despite his success, Sebastian's personal life remained a mystery.

He had few close friends and no family to speak of. His relationships with others were transactional at best, with Sebastian using people for their own gain before discarding them like trash. Yet, there was something about him that drew people in, making them want to be around him even when they knew better.

One night, Sebastian del Toro found himself in a high-stakes poker game, surrounded by the city's most powerful and wealthy individuals. With his quick wit and silver tongue, he won hand after hand, but at a cost: with each victory, his reputation grew, making it harder for him to keep his true nature hidden.

As the night wore on, Sebastian realized that his game was up. He had lost more than just money; he had lost himself in the process of playing the part. In that moment, Sebastian del Toro understood that his greatest heist was not the one he pulled off with his cards, but the one he pulled off within himself.
