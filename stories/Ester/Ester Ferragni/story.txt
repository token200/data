Her designs reflected this confident spirit, often featuring vibrant colors, striking patterns, and a fearless attitude that inspired those around her.

As her star continued to rise, Ester Ferragni found herself at the forefront of the fashion world. She was in demand by top models, celebrities, and influencers, all clamoring for her attention.
