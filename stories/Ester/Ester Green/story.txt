As the night of the show approached, Ester's nerves began to get the better of her. What if no one showed up? What if they didn't like her work? The doubts swirled in her mind like a stormy sea, threatening to capsized her confidence.

But when the doors finally opened and the crowd flooded in, Ester was surprised by their overwhelming enthusiasm for her art.
