Ester had always been passionate about baking, and it showed in every detail of her work. From the perfectly piped borders on her croissants to the intricate designs on her wedding cakes, Ester's pastries were a true labor of love.

One day, a new family moved into the house at the end of the street. The mother, Sarah, was a food blogger, and she had heard about Ester's bakery from a fellow blogger. She decided to pay Ester a visit, hoping to discover some inspiration for her own blog.

Ester welcomed Sarah with open arms, offering her a warm smile and a sample of her latest creation: a lemon drizzle cake that was sure to impress even the most discerning palate. As they chatted, Ester discovered that Sarah was not only a food blogger but also a talented writer, and she had a proposal for her.
