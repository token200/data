She taught them how to knead dough, mix batter, and decorate pastries with intricate designs. The girls listened intently, their eyes wide with excitement, as Ester shared stories of her own adventures in the kitchen.

As the day wore on, Ester's patisserie became a hub of activity, with customers lining up for slices of empanada and cups of coffee. Amidst the chaos, Ester Fernandez Garcia shone like a star, her infectious enthusiasm and warm smile spreading joy to all who entered her shop.
