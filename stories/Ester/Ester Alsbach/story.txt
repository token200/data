Ester Alsbach was a woman with a passion for botany and a knack for getting lost in the woods. Growing up in a small village on the outskirts of a dense forest, she had spent countless hours exploring the winding trails and hidden clearings that crisscrossed the landscape. As a child, her parents would often joke that she had been born with a sprig of wild rosemary tucked behind her ear, for she seemed to have an innate sense of direction.

As Ester grew older, her love of botany only deepened. She spent hours pouring over dusty old books in the village library, learning about the medicinal properties of various plants and the ancient rituals that had been performed around them. Her favorite subject was the rare and elusive silverbloom, a flower said to bloom only once every ten years under the light of a full moon.

One summer, Ester decided to embark on a solo expedition into the heart of the forest in search of the elusive silverbloom. She packed a small bag with provisions, slung a basket over her arm, and set off early one morning, determined to find the flower before anyone else did. The journey was long and arduous, but Ester pressed on, driven by her curiosity and determination.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the forest floor, Ester finally caught sight of a shimmering light up ahead. She quickened her pace, her heart racing with excitement, until she emerged into a clearing and saw it - the silverbloom, its delicate petals glowing like moonlight in the fading daylight. Ester Alsbach felt as though she had stumbled upon a treasure trove, and she knew that this discovery would be one to remember for the rest of her life.
