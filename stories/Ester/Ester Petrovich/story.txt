As a renowned detective in the city of Ashwood, Ester Petrovich had solved some of the most baffling cases that had stumped the authorities.

One drizzly evening, as the rain poured down on the streets of Ashwood, Ester Petrovich received an unusual visit from a young woman named Sophia. Sophia was frantic, claiming that her sister, Emily, had gone missing and she suspected foul play.
