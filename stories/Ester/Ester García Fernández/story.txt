Ester García Fernández, known to her friends and family as "La Llorona de la Costa," was a woman with a storied past. Born in the coastal town of San Mateo, she spent most of her childhood playing on the sun-kissed beaches and listening to the salty tales of her abuela, who claimed to have seen the ghost of a young girl wandering the shore.

As Ester grew older, her fascination with the sea only deepened. She became an expert in marine life, spending hours studying the creatures that lived beneath the waves. Her passion led her to pursue a degree in marine biology, and she soon landed a job at the local aquarium.

Tragedy struck when Ester's fiancé, Juan, was killed in a tragic sailing accident. Devastated by his loss, Ester found solace in the ocean. She began to spend more time on the water, searching for any sign of her lost love. Her friends and family grew concerned, but Ester couldn't shake off the feeling that Juan was still out there, waiting for her.

One fateful evening, as the sun dipped into the sea, Ester spotted a figure in the distance. She rushed to the shore, her heart pounding with excitement. As she drew closer, the figure began to take shape – it was a young girl, no more than ten years old, dressed in a flowing white gown.

In that moment, Ester felt an overwhelming sense of recognition. The ghostly apparition was none other than the abuela's legend, come to life. The little girl beckoned Ester towards her, and as she reached out a hand, the girl vanished into thin air.

From that day on, Ester became known as "La Llorona de la Costa," a woman haunted by the memory of her lost love. She continued to spend her days studying the ocean, searching for any sign of Juan's spirit. Her friends and family would often join her on these midnight strolls along the shore, where they would hear Ester whispering stories of the sea and its secrets.

As the years went by, Ester's legend grew. Locals began to speak of the ghostly woman who wandered the beach, searching for a love that had been lost forever. And though Ester never found her Juan, she knew that his spirit lived on in the waves, guiding her towards the truth about their love and the mysteries of the ocean.
