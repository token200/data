Ester Kovacs stepped into the small, dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of her acquaintance, Zara. It was a chilly autumn evening, and the flickering candles cast eerie shadows on the walls as Ester made her way to the bar.

As she ordered a cup of black coffee, a low hum of conversation filled the air, punctuated by the clinking of cups and saucers. Ester took a seat in the corner, lost in thought, trying to shake off the lingering sense of unease that had been plaguing her for weeks.

Just as she was starting to relax, Zara slid into the seat across from her, her dark hair neatly styled and her eyes sparkling with warmth. "Ester, darling!" Zara exclaimed, waving a hand in greeting. "I'm so glad I caught up with you tonight."

The two women chatted for hours, discussing everything from art to politics, their conversation flowing effortlessly as they delved into topics that had been on Ester's mind since her last visit to Budapest.

Zara, it seemed, was working tirelessly to promote the emerging Hungarian art scene, and Ester found herself enthralled by her friend's passion. As the night wore on, Zara regaled Ester with stories of her latest gallery openings, and the two women laughed together over a particularly hilarious anecdote about a notorious art collector.

As they sipped their coffee and smoked cigarettes, the atmosphere grew cozy and intimate, like that of an old friend. Ester couldn't help but feel grateful for Zara's presence in her life – she was more than just a friend; she was a confidante, a partner in crime, and a fellow traveler.

As the café began to close, Zara leaned in close, her voice barely above a whisper. "Ester Kovacs, I have something to tell you," she said with a mischievous grin. Ester's heart skipped a beat as she realized that this conversation was about to take an unexpected turn.
