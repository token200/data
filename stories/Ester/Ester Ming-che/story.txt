Ester Ming-che, a master tea blender, spent her days perfecting her craft, coaxing flavors from leaves that few others could unlock.

As they sipped steaming cups of tea together, Lily learned about Ester's journey, from childhood spent in the rolling hills of Taiwan to her early days as an apprentice in Hong Kong.

Intrigued by Ester's stories and passion for her craft, Lily asked if she could assist with blending. Ester agreed, recognizing potential in the young artist.
