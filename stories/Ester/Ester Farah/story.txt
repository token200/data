Ester Farah sat in her small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and faded photographs. She stared blankly at the worn-out armchair in front of her, the one that had been her constant companion for years. It was as if it held a secret, a story only she could hear.

Ester's life had taken a drastic turn after her mother passed away a year ago. Her mother, a renowned author, had left behind a mysterious will that revealed a shocking truth. Ester inherited not only her mother's belongings but also a novel – one that Ester was certain did not belong to her mother.

As she delved deeper into the pages of the book, Ester discovered that it was written from multiple perspectives: those of the protagonist, Emilia, and several people who claimed to be close friends. But one name kept popping up – Lucas Thompson, a man Ester had never heard of before.

Intrigued, Ester decided to investigate further. She spent countless hours scouring the city for any mention of Lucas or his connection to her mother's book. It wasn't until she stumbled upon an old café in the quiet part of town that she found what she was looking for – a small inscription etched into the back cover.

"To my dearest, Emilia,

I'm sorry I couldn't be there when you needed me most. But know that you are not alone. Lucas will take care of you. He always does."

A shiver ran down Ester's spine as she read those words. Who was this man? And why had her mother left such a cryptic message for her?

Ester spent the rest of the evening devouring every detail in Emilia's story, trying to piece together what really happened to her character. As she read, she began to see parallels between Emilia and herself – both strong-willed women who had struggled with difficult circumstances.

As the night drew to a close, Ester finally felt like she was getting closer to uncovering the truth about Lucas and her mother's book. She knew that she still had a long way to go, but for the first time in months, she felt a sense of hope. Maybe, just maybe, she would find answers to all the questions she had been searching for.

With a newfound determination, Ester closed her eyes, taking one last look at the worn-out armchair before standing up to begin her journey.
