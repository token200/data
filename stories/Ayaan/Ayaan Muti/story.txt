I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named "Ayan Muti". However, I can create a new character and write a short story about them. Here's a 400-word story:

The Island of Echoes

Ayaan Muti stood at the edge of the island, her long black hair whipping in the wind as she gazed out at the endless blue waters. The air was heavy with the scent of blooming frangipani, and Ayan felt an eerie sense of peace wash over her.

She had been drawn to this island for reasons she couldn't quite explain. As a child, she would have dreams of a place like this - a tiny speck of land surrounded by water, with secrets hidden beneath the surface. Her parents, scientists who spent their days studying the oceans, had always been cryptic about where they'd found it.

As Ayan stepped onto the sandy shore, her feet felt lighter, as if she was floating above the ground. The waves caressed the beach in a soothing melody, and she closed her eyes, letting the sound wash over her.

The island seemed to hum with energy - a vibration that resonated deep within Ayan's chest. She had always been sensitive to such things, feeling like an instrument attuned to the natural world. Her mother used to say it was because of her mixed heritage - her Indian father and her Scottish mother had left their mark on her in ways she could only begin to understand.

As she walked along the beach, Ayan noticed something peculiar. The shells, the pebbles, even the sea glass seemed to be aligned with an intricate pattern - as if the island itself was trying to communicate a message.

Suddenly, she heard the sound of whispers. Not just any whispers, but soft, raspy voices that seemed to carry on the wind. Ayan's heart quickened as she recognized the language - it was an ancient dialect, one her mother had studied for years.

The words grew louder, more distinct, and Ayan realized with a start that they were speaking directly to her. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she replied, her voice barely audible over the sound of the waves.

The whispers ceased, leaving behind an unsettling silence. Ayan took a deep breath, feeling the island's energy swirl around her like a vortex. She knew in that moment that she was exactly where she was meant to be - on this mysterious island, listening for the secrets it held beneath its surface.
