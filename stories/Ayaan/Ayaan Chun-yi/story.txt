The stranger was known only by his alias, "The Shadow," and was rumored to be a master of the deadliest martial arts style in the world.

But despite his formidable abilities, Ayaan refused to back down, drawing on every ounce of strength and determination within her.

In the end, it was Ayaan Chun-yi who emerged victorious, her spirit and willpower proving stronger than any opponent.
