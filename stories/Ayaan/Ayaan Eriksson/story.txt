Ayaan Eriksson walked into the small café on the corner of Main Street, scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Lena, sipping on a latte in the corner and made her way over.

"Ayaan Eriksson, what brings you here?" Lena asked, setting down her cup as Ayaan sat down across from her.

"Just needed a break from work," Ayaan replied, ordering a coffee from the barista. "I've been stuck on this project for weeks."

Lena nodded sympathetically. "You know I'm always here to listen. What's going on?"

Ayaan took a sip of her coffee before launching into a detailed explanation of her struggles with the project. Lena listened attentively, offering words of encouragement and advice.

As they chatted, Ayaan couldn't help but notice the way the sunlight streaming through the window highlighted Lena's bright blue eyes. She felt a flutter in her chest, but quickly pushed the feeling aside. She and Lena had been friends for years, and she didn't want to risk complicating their relationship.

After finishing her coffee, Ayaan pulled out her phone to check on some work emails. Lena leaned back in her chair, watching her with a curious expression.

"Hey, Ayaan Eriksson," Lena said softly. "You okay? You seem a little...distracted."

Ayaan smiled wryly. "Just thinking about work, I guess. But thanks for checking in on me."

Lena nodded, but Ayaan could tell she was still curious. She changed the subject, asking Lena about her latest art project. As they talked, Ayaan felt a sense of comfort and ease wash over her.

As the afternoon wore on, the café began to empty out. The barista started cleaning up, and Ayaan realized it was almost time for her to go back to work. She stood up, brushing off her pants.

"Thanks for the coffee, Lena," she said, smiling at her friend. "I owe you one."

Lena grinned, standing up to hug Ayaan tightly. "Anytime, Ayaan Eriksson. That's what friends are for."
