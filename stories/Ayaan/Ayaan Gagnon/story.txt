Ayaan Gagnon stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the bustling streets of Tokyo's Shinjuku district. The neon lights reflected off the wet pavement, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across her face. She squinted, shielding her eyes from the intensity.

As she walked, the sounds of the city swirled around her: chatter, car horns, and wailing sirens in the distance. Ayaan Gagnon navigated through the crowded sidewalks with ease, her eyes scanning the crowds for any sign of trouble.

A former mercenary, Ayaan had retired from the business after a stint on a particularly messy job went sideways. She'd been hired to extract a valuable piece of tech from a heavily guarded facility in Eastern Europe, but things hadn't gone according to plan. The extraction team had been ambushed, and Ayaan Gagnon had found herself fighting for survival alongside her comrades.

The memory still haunted her sleep, but she'd left that life behind, choosing instead to work as a freelance security consultant for those who couldn't afford the big-name firms. Tonight's gig was no different – a small startup in need of some extra eyes and ears.

As she turned a corner, Ayaan spotted her mark: a sleek black sedan with tinted windows parked outside the entrance to the office building. She recognized the logo emblazoned on the side – this was her client, a shady tech firm that catered to the upper echelons of society.

Without hesitation, Ayaan Gagnon approached the sedan, her hand resting on the grip of her gun holstered beneath her jacket. She knocked twice, then stepped aside as the door slid open. The driver's eyes flickered towards her before darting back to the road.

"Evening," she said, her voice low and even.

The passenger door creaked open, revealing a suited individual with a cold stare. "Ayaan Gagnon," he drawled. "We've been expecting you."

Without further ado, Ayaan stepped into the sedan, ready to take on whatever the night had in store for her. As the doors closed behind her, she couldn't help but think that this job would be another notch in her belt – another reminder of the skills she'd honed as Ayaan Gagnon, mercenary extraordinaire.
