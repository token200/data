Ayaan Thomas walked into the dimly lit coffee shop, scanning the room for her friend, Leela. She spotted Leela sitting by the window, sipping on a cup of hot chocolate, and made her way over to join her.

"Ayaan, I'm so glad you're here," Leela said, as Ayaan sat down beside her. "I've been thinking, we need to plan a trip together."

Ayaan's eyes lit up at the suggestion. She had always loved traveling with Leela, and she couldn't wait to start planning their next adventure. "Where did you have in mind?" she asked, as they perused the menu.

Leela thought for a moment before responding. "I was thinking of taking us to India," she said. "We can explore the cities, try all the delicious food, and relax on the beaches."

Ayaan's face lit up at the mention of her home country. She had always loved India, and she couldn't wait to share that love with Leela. "That sounds amazing," she said, as they ordered their drinks and began to plan.

As they sat there, sipping their coffee and discussing their plans, Ayaan couldn't help but think about how much this trip meant to her. She had always been close to Leela, and she knew that this trip would be a special one. As a child, Ayaan Thomas had spent countless hours exploring the streets of Mumbai with her grandmother, learning about the history and culture of the city.

Now, as an adult, Ayaan was eager to share that same sense of wonder and curiosity with Leela. She knew that this trip would be a chance for them to bond over their shared love of travel and exploration, and she couldn't wait to see what adventures they would have.

As they finished up their drinks and prepared to leave, Ayaan turned to Leela with a smile. "Thank you for planning this trip," she said. "I know it's going to be an amazing adventure."

Leela smiled back at her. "I couldn't imagine doing it without you," she replied. And as they walked out of the coffee shop, side by side, Ayaan knew that this was just the beginning of a new chapter in their friendship.
