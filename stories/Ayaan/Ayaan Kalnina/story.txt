Ayaan Kalnina was a young and ambitious journalist, determined to make a name for herself in the cutthroat world of investigative reporting. Born into a family of journalists, she had always been fascinated by the power of storytelling and the ability to uncover hidden truths.

Growing up, Ayaan spent countless hours poring over books and documentaries on some of history's most infamous scandals. Her parents, both seasoned reporters themselves, encouraged her curiosity and taught her the importance of accuracy and integrity in journalism. As she entered adulthood, Ayaan set out to follow in their footsteps, earning a degree in journalism and landing her first job at a small local newspaper.
