Ayaan Valja stepped into the crowded marketplace, her eyes scanning the vibrant stalls for any sign of trouble. As a skilled mercenary, she had been hired by the local guild to keep an eye on things and put out any fires that might arise.

As she wove through the throngs of people, Ayaan's gaze landed on a group of shady-looking characters huddled in the corner. They seemed to be discussing something in hushed tones, their eyes darting nervously about as if they feared being caught.

Ayaan's instincts told her that these men were up to no good, and she made a mental note to keep an eye on them. She walked over to their table, her hand resting lightly on the hilt of her sword.

"Can I help you gentlemen?" she asked, her voice firm but friendly.

The group looked up at her, their faces flushing with embarrassment. "Just discussing some business," one of them stammered.

Ayaan raised an eyebrow. "I see. Well, in that case, I think it's time for me to take my leave." She turned to walk away, but the men quickly jumped up from their seats and began to follow her.

"Hey, wait a minute!" one of them exclaimed. "We didn't mean to bother you."

Ayaan smiled sweetly at him. "I'm not bothered, I just need to get back to my guild. But if you're looking for me, I'll be at the Black Dragon Inn tonight, having a drink and enjoying some music."

The men exchanged uneasy glances before quickly dispersing, leaving Ayaan alone once again.

As she walked away from the marketplace, Ayaan Valja felt a sense of satisfaction wash over her. She had kept the peace, and no one had been harmed. It was just another day on the job for this skilled mercenary. With a smile to herself, she disappeared into the crowd, ready to face whatever adventures lay ahead.
