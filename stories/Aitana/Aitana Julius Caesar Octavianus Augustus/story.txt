Aitana Julius Caesar Octavianus Augustus, or simply Aitana to her friends, was no ordinary Roman citizen. Born into the imperial family, she was the youngest daughter of Emperor Augustus and a direct descendant of the legendary Julius Caesar.

Growing up in the palace, Aitana was surrounded by opulence and excess, but she never let it go to her head. She was well-versed in every subject imaginable, from politics to poetry, and had a keen interest in the arts. Her love for music led her to play the lyre with remarkable skill, and she often entertained her family and guests with enchanting melodies.

Despite her privileged upbringing, Aitana's life wasn't without its challenges. She struggled with the pressures of royal life, feeling suffocated by the constant scrutiny and expectation placed upon her. Her parents, the emperor and his queen, often clashed over their differing opinions on how to rule, leaving Aitana feeling torn between her duty as a member of the imperial family and her own desires for independence.

As she grew older, Aitana became increasingly restless, yearning to experience life beyond the palace walls. She began sneaking out at night, exploring the city and observing its people from afar. Her nocturnal adventures sparked a sense of curiosity within her, driving her to learn more about the world beyond Rome's grandeur.

One fateful evening, while walking through the market district, Aitana stumbled upon a group of traveling performers – musicians, dancers, and acrobats. Entranced by their talents, she watched from the shadows as they captivated the crowd with their lively routines. Inspired by their passion and creativity, Aitana approached them and asked if she could join their troupe.

The performers welcomed her with open arms, recognizing in her a kindred spirit who shared their love for art and self-expression. Together, they performed across Rome's streets, entertaining crowds with music, dance, and acrobatics. For the first time in her life, Aitana felt truly free – no longer bound by royal duties or expectations.

As word of her performances spread, Aitana became known as "La Principessa della Folla" (The Princess of the Crowd). Her unique blend of imperial heritage and artistic passion captivated audiences from all walks of life. Though she remained true to her Roman roots, Aitana Julius Caesar Octavianus Augustus found a new sense of purpose in her life – one that defied the conventions of her upbringing and allowed her to dance under the stars, free and unencumbered.
