As she began her career, Aitana quickly made a name for herself as a tenacious and driven reporter, never afraid to take on the tough stories that others might shy away from. Her bosses took notice, and soon she was assigned to cover some of the most high-profile cases in the city, including corruption scandals and police brutality incidents.
