Aitana Bērziņš was a young and ambitious journalist living in Riga, Latvia. She had always been passionate about storytelling and was determined to make a name for herself in the competitive world of journalism.

Growing up in a small town on the outskirts of Riga, Aitana had grown up surrounded by stories of her family's history and the struggles of her community. Her parents, both former Soviet-era dissidents, had instilled in her a love of truth-telling and a desire to expose corruption and inequality.

She continued to write and report on the issues she cared most about, always seeking out new sources and perspectives to add depth and complexity to her stories.
