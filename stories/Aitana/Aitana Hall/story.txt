Over the next few weeks, Aitana sought out Blackwood, eager to learn from him and discuss her work. Her parents were dismayed by her sudden interest in the critic's opinions, but Aitana knew that this was where she belonged – among those who understood the value of art.

As her reputation grew, so did Aitana Elena Hall's connection to the art world. Galleries began to take notice of her work, and soon she found herself exhibiting alongside some of the most prominent artists in the region.
