Aitana Becker stood at the edge of the cliff, her feet digging into the cool sand as she gazed out at the vast expanse of turquoise water. The wind whipped through her dark hair, carrying with it the cries of seagulls wheeling overhead.

It had been ten years since Aitana left her life in New York behind, trading the bright lights of Manhattan for the tranquil beaches and rugged coastline of Portugal. She'd always felt suffocated by the city's relentless energy, the endless noise and chaos that seemed to claw at her skin like a thousand needles.

Here, she could breathe again. The air was crisp and clean, filled with the scent of salt and seaweed. Aitana loved watching the sun set over the ocean, the colors deepening from pink to gold as the stars began to twinkle in the evening sky.

As she stood there, lost in thought, a figure emerged from behind her. It was her friend, Sofia, who'd arrived just that morning from Lisbon. The two had met on a surfing trip five years ago, and their friendship had grown stronger with each passing day.

"Aitana, what's wrong?" Sofia asked, sliding onto the sand beside her. "You look like you're lost in another world."

Aitana smiled wryly. "I just can't stop thinking about it," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "My ex, Alex, he...he wanted to come back into my life."

Sofia's expression turned sympathetic. "Tell me more."

Aitana sighed, her shoulders sagging beneath the weight of her memories. It was a complicated story â€“ one that involved broken hearts and bitter rivalries, but ultimately, it boiled down to this: Aitana had made a choice to walk away from the only life she'd ever known.

"I couldn't stay," she said, shaking her head. "I needed to get out while I still could."

Sofia wrapped an arm around Aitana's shoulders, pulling her close. "You made the right decision, amiga," she said softly. "Here, you're free. You can start anew, with a clean slate and a heart that's finally yours to own."

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the sky in a soft, golden light, Aitana felt the weight of her doubts begin to lift. She smiled up at Sofia, feeling a sense of gratitude wash over her.

"Thanks for listening," she said, squeezing her friend's arm tight.

Sofia smiled back, her eyes shining with love and understanding. "Anytime, Aitana. I'll always be here to listen."
