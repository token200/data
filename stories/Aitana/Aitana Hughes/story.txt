Aitana Hughes stood at the edge of the ocean, the salty spray misting her skin as she gazed out at the endless blue horizon. She felt small and insignificant, yet at the same time, connected to something much larger than herself.

As a child, Aitana had spent countless hours exploring the rugged coastline near her home in Cornwall, collecting seashells and watching the tides ebb and flow. Her parents, both artists, had encouraged her curiosity, teaching her to see the world through the lens of creativity.

Now, as a young adult, Aitana was struggling to find her place in the world. She'd studied fine art at university, but the doubts that plagued her lingered. Was she good enough? Did anyone care about her work?

Aitana's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of seagulls wheeling overhead. She felt a sense of longing wash over her – to be free, to soar on the wind currents like they did.

As she stood there, lost in thought, Aitana noticed a figure walking towards her along the beach. It was an old woman, dressed in faded jeans and a flannel shirt, her hair tied back in a messy bun.

"Hello, love," the old woman said, with a warm smile. "I see you're lost in thought again."

Aitana shook her head, feeling a lump form in her throat. The old woman nodded sympathetically.

"I know how that feels," she said. "When I was your age, I felt like I was drowning in uncertainty. But then I realized that the answer wasn't out there – it was within me all along."

Aitana looked at the old woman in surprise. How did she know? She took a deep breath and let her gaze fall on the ocean once more.

"Show me," Aitana said, her voice barely above a whisper.

The old woman chuckled and nodded. "Come with me."

Together, they walked along the beach, watching as the light danced across the waves. The old woman showed Aitana how to see the beauty in the imperfections – the way the sand was worn smooth by the tide, the way the sunlight highlighted the curves of a shell.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the ocean, Aitana felt something shift inside her. It was as if she'd finally found the answer to her doubts, though she wasn't entirely sure what it was.

"What's this?" she asked the old woman, as they stood side by side on the beach.

"Your true self," the old woman replied, with a gentle smile. "You've just been waiting for someone – or something – to help you see."

Aitana smiled back at her, feeling a sense of peace settle over her like the sea itself.
