Her mother, Sofia, encouraged her creativity, even setting up a small studio for Aitana to work on her craft.

As Aitana grew older, her talent became apparent, and she began to receive recognition at local art competitions. However, it was not until she moved to Madrid that her true potential was revealed.

One day, while walking through the Prado Museum, Aitana stumbled upon a painting by Velázquez that seemed to speak directly to her soul.
