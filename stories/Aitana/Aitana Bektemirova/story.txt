Aitana Bektemirova stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the crowded station. She had been waiting for this moment for months, ever since she'd received the letter inviting her to join the prestigious art academy in Moscow.

As a child, Aitana Bektemirova had spent hours sketching the intricate patterns of her Kazakhstani homeland.

Inside, the atmosphere was electric – students from all over the world mingled and laughed, their creative energies palpable. Aitana Bektemirova's eyes scanned the room, searching for faces that seemed familiar, yet somehow new.

For a moment, Aitana Bektemirova forgot about her nerves and let herself be swept up in the whirlwind of new experiences waiting for her.
