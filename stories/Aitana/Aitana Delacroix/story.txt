Aitana Delacroix stepped into the dimly lit jazz club, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him across the way, sipping on a whiskey at the bar, his piercing blue eyes locked onto hers like a magnet. It was Max, her old flame who had left without a word three years ago.

Aitana's heart skipped a beat as she made her way through the crowd, her heels clicking against the floor. She had often wondered what had become of him, if he ever thought about her too. As she approached the bar, Max looked up and their eyes met in a flash of recognition.

"Aitana," he said softly, his voice barely audible over the music. "It's been a long time."

Aitana felt a shiver run down her spine as she slid onto the stool beside him. "Max," she replied, her voice husky from disuse.

They chatted for hours, catching up on lost time and sharing stories of their lives since they'd parted ways. Aitana learned that Max had been traveling the world, working as a photographer, and Aitana discovered that she had started her own fashion label after leaving college.

As the night wore on, the conversation turned to their past, and the reasons behind Max's departure. Aitana listened intently, feeling a mix of emotions - hurt, anger, but also a glimmer of hope.

"I'm sorry," Max said finally, his eyes locked onto hers. "I was young and foolish, and I didn't know how to handle my feelings."

Aitana nodded, her heart still heavy with the memories of what could have been. "I understand," she said softly. "But I've moved on, Max. I've found my own way."

Max smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "I'm glad to hear that, Aitana Delacroix," he said, his voice full of warmth and affection.

As they parted ways outside the club, Aitana felt a sense of closure, like a chapter had closed in her life. She knew that she would always carry a piece of Max with her, but she was ready to move forward, into a brighter, bolder future.
