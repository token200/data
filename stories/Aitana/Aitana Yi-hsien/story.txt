Aitana Yi-hsien was known as the most talented and elusive opera singer in all of Taipei. Her voice was like honey, smooth and rich, with just the right amount of huskiness to send shivers down the spines of her audience.

Born into a poor family, Aitana had grown up singing on the streets of Taipei, earning coins from passersby and entertaining children at weddings and other celebrations. But she knew that if she wanted to make a real name for herself, she needed more than just a pretty voice – she needed training and experience.

Aitana traveled to Seoul, where she studied under some of the best vocal coaches in Korea. She learned the intricacies of traditional Korean opera, as well as the subtleties of modern pop music. Her dedication was unwavering, and soon her talent began to attract attention from around the world.

But Aitana's success came with a price. She became increasingly reclusive, unable to handle the constant scrutiny and pressure that came with being a star. Her relationships suffered, and she found herself torn between her love of music and her need for solitude.

One night, at a sold-out concert in Taipei, Aitana felt like she was on the verge of losing herself completely. The audience was mesmerized by her performance, but as she took her final bow, she felt like she was staring into an abyss – a void that seemed to stretch out before her like an endless desert.

In that moment, Aitana knew that she had two choices: she could let the fame and adoration of the crowd consume her, or she could take control of her own destiny. She chose the latter, walking off stage alone and into the night, determined to rediscover herself and find a balance between her passion for music and her need for peace.

It was a decision that would change Aitana's life forever – one that would lead her down a path of self-discovery and creativity, and ultimately earn her a reputation as one of the most innovative and boundary-pushing opera singers in history.
