I couldn't find any information on a historical figure named Aitana Huffington. However, I believe you may be thinking of Arianna Huffington, an American columnist and entrepreneur.

Arianna Huffington is best known for founding The Huffington Post in 2005. Here's a story about her:

It was a crisp winter morning when Arianna Huffington walked into the New York Times' office, determined to pitch her idea. She had spent months researching and refining her concept for an online news site that would focus on blogs rather than traditional articles.

The room fell silent as she approached the editor-in-chief's desk. "I want to start a blog-based news site," she said confidently. "It will be fast, free, and feature stories from all over the world."

At first, they were skeptical. They thought she was crazy for thinking that people would read their thoughts online instead of waiting for traditional news sources to break the story. But Arianna's infectious enthusiasm and conviction won them over.

She left the office with a signed contract, ready to take on the challenge of building something new from scratch. Over the next few years, The Huffington Post grew rapidly, attracting millions of readers who were hungry for fresh perspectives and opinions online.

As the site's popularity soared, Arianna became one of the most influential women in media. She was invited to speak at conferences and events, sharing her insights on the future of news and its place in society.

Arianna's success wasn't limited to The Huffington Post, however. In 2016, she published her bestselling book, "Thrive: The Third Metric to Redefining Success and Creating a Life of Well-Being, Wisdom, and Wonder." The book introduced the concept of the third metric – in addition to money and power, success should also be measured by one's well-being, wisdom, and relationships.

Today, Arianna Huffington is still at the forefront of media and self-help. She has founded Thrive Global, a wellness-focused news site that focuses on personal growth and well-being. Her legacy as a pioneer in digital media continues to inspire new generations of entrepreneurs and thought leaders.

As for her pitch in 2005, it marked the beginning of an incredible journey – one that would change the face of journalism forever.
