Aitana Bak was known for her extraordinary gift – she could see into the past with uncanny clarity. Her ability had been passed down through generations of her family, but it was Aitana Bak who had honed it to perfection. With a mere glance, she could transport herself back in time, witnessing events that had shaped her present.

Aitana's days were spent studying the history of Spain, seeking insight into the events that influenced her people. Her knowledge was unparalleled, and her expertise earned her recognition within academic circles. However, Aitana Bak knew that there was more to life than mere scholarship.

One fateful evening, while pouring over ancient texts in a dusty library, Aitana stumbled upon an obscure diary belonging to a young woman named Catalina. As she delved into the yellowed pages, she discovered a tale of love, loss, and sacrifice. The words spoke directly to her heart, resonating with a deep connection that went beyond mere curiosity.

Aitana Bak felt an inexplicable urge to meet Catalina's great-granddaughter, who lived in a small village on the outskirts of Barcelona. The woman, Sofia, was said to possess an innate connection to the past as well. Aitana traveled to the village, eager to learn more about her own heritage and discover whether she shared the same extraordinary gift.

Sofia welcomed Aitana Bak with open arms, recognizing the familiarity in their conversation. As they spent the next few days together, Aitana discovered that Sofia's connection was rooted in their shared family lineage. The two women embarked on a journey through time, revisiting pivotal moments from Aitana Bak's own history.

Through these shared experiences, Aitana came to understand the true extent of her gift and the weight it carried. With Sofia by her side, she found solace in knowing that she was not alone in her ability. Together, they forged an unbreakable bond, united by their love for history and a desire to unravel its secrets.

As Aitana Bak stood beside Sofia, gazing into the past, she realized that her gift had led her to something far more valuable – a sense of belonging and connection with those who understood her. In this moment, Aitana knew that her legacy would live on through Sofia, and that their shared journey would weave an unbreakable thread of history between them.
