Mireille Korolev was known for her striking features and razor-sharp wit. As a renowned detective in Paris, she had earned a reputation for solving cases that had stumped others for years. Her clients adored her, often referring to her as "The Sphinx" due to her enigmatic nature.

One rainy evening, a young woman named Sophie stormed into Mireille's office, frantic about her missing sister. The detective listened intently, her eyes never leaving Sophie's face. When the girl had finished speaking, Mireille leaned back in her chair and began to pace around the room.

"I need you to think back to the last time your sister was seen," she said, her voice low and soothing. "Did anything unusual happen that day? Any arguments or disagreements?"

Sophie racked her brain, trying to recall even the smallest detail. After a few moments of silence, Mireille nodded. "I'll need you to come with me to the station tomorrow, along with your sister's address book and any other relevant documents."

The next morning, Mireille Korolev arrived at Sophie's flat, accompanied by a team of investigators. They began reviewing Sophie's contacts, searching for any clues that might lead them to her missing sister. As they sifted through the pages, one name stood out: Alexei Petrov.

Mireille's eyes narrowed as she read the entry in question. "This is someone we need to talk to," she said, making a note on her pad.

That evening, Mireille Korolev met with Alexei at a quaint café in Montmartre. He seemed nervous, glancing over his shoulder as if he feared being watched. Mireille's instincts told her that this was the break they had been waiting for.

"So, Mr. Petrov," she said, her voice firm but controlled, "what do you know about Sophie's disappearance?"

Alexei hesitated before speaking, his words spilling out in a rush. "I didn't mean to hurt anyone," he whispered. "I just got caught up in something I couldn't get out of."

Mireille Korolev listened attentively, her expression unreadable. She knew that she had solved the case, but there was still much work to be done. With Alexei as their primary suspect, they would need to prove his guilt beyond a shadow of a doubt.

As the rain pattered against the café windows, Mireille Korolev's mind whirled with possibilities. She was determined to uncover the truth behind Sophie's disappearance, no matter what it took.
