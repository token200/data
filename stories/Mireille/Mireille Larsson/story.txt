Mireille Larsson stepped into the small, dimly lit café on the outskirts of town. The air was thick with the scent of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of hushed conversations. As she took a seat at the counter, her eyes scanned the room, searching for a familiar face.

It had been years since Mireille, a renowned detective, had returned to her hometown after a stint in Paris. She had left behind the glamour and excitement of the French capital, but also the chaos that came with it. The quiet, seaside town was a welcome respite from the noise and distractions of city life.

As she sipped on her coffee, Mireille's gaze fell upon a figure sitting in the corner, shrouded in shadows. She recognized the telltale signs of someone trying to keep a low profile – the slight tensing of shoulders, the deliberate avoidance of eye contact. Her instincts told her that this person was hiding something.

Without breaking stride, Mireille slid onto the stool next to the stranger and introduced herself. The air seemed to thicken as they exchanged pleasantries, but Mireille's sharp eyes picked up on every subtle cue. She noticed the faint bruise on their jawline, the way they shifted uncomfortably in their seat.

As she leaned forward, her voice taking on a gentle yet firm tone, "I think you're hiding something from me," she said. The stranger hesitated before nodding ever so slightly.

Without warning, Mireille slid a small notebook onto the counter and flipped it open to a blank page. She began to sketch, her pencil moving with quick, confident strokes as she brought out a rough outline of the person across from her.

"You see, I've been doing this for years," she said, " piecing together the smallest details, letting the art speak for itself." The stranger's eyes narrowed as they watched Mireille bring their likeness to life on paper.

As she finished the sketch, Mireille turned it over and slid a small photograph under the plate. It was an old-school black-and-white shot of a young couple embracing – the same couple from the bruise on the stranger's jawline.

The stranger's expression transformed from guarded to guilty. "I wasn't trying to hide anything," they stammered, as Mireille leaned in closer. With each passing moment, her eyes seemed to bore into their soul, revealing the truth that lay hidden beneath the surface.

"You have a choice now," she said softly, her words piercing through the air like a cold breeze on a winter's night.
