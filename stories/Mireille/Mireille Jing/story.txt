As a child, she would spend hours rummaging through thrift stores, collecting eclectic trinkets and peculiar artifacts that seemed to hold secrets of their own. Her parents, both artists themselves, encouraged her creative pursuits, but it was not until she stumbled upon a mysterious old camera in a dusty antique shop that Mireille Jing's true passion began to take shape.

Together, they embarked on a series of expeditions into the city's lesser-known neighborhoods, seeking out stories that others might overlook. As their collaboration deepened, so did their mutual understanding of the human experience. They began to explore themes of identity, community, and social justice through Mireille Jing's photographs and writings.
