Mireille Altmann stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. It had been five years since she'd left Berlin, fleeing the Nazi regime that had once called Germany home. Now, as a young refugee in Paris, she was determined to build a new life for herself.

As she made her way through the crowds, Mireille's thoughts turned to her family. Her parents and younger brother had been killed in the Nazi purge of German Jews, leaving her alone and adrift. But even in the midst of such loss, Mireille had found strength in her art. She had always been a talented painter, but it was only when she'd fled Germany that she'd discovered true passion.

Mireille's eyes landed on a small studio apartment above a bakery on Rue de la Paix. It was a tiny space, but it was hers alone, and the smell of freshly baked bread wafting from below filled her with warmth.

She spent the next few hours unpacking and settling in, taking breaks to gaze out at the Seine River, its waters glinting in the afternoon sun. As night began to fall, Mireille set up her easel and paints on a small table by the window, feeling a sense of peace wash over her.

As she worked, the sounds of Paris drifted through her door: laughter from the bakery below, the wail of a saxophone from a street corner, the gentle chime of bicycle bells. Mireille lost herself in her art, the strokes and colors blending together as the world outside receded.

It was only when her brush paused that she noticed a figure standing on the fire escape outside her window, watching her paint. A young man with piercing green eyes and dark hair, he stood motionless for a moment before disappearing into the shadows.

Mireille felt a shiver run down her spine as she packed up her paints. Who was this stranger, and what did he want? But instead of fear, she felt a spark of curiosity ignite within her. Perhaps, in this new city, Mireille had found not just a place to hide, but a chance to rediscover herself – and maybe, just maybe, find love.

As the night deepened, Mireille returned to her canvases, feeling the colors come alive on their own. She smiled, knowing that even in the darkest of times, there was always hope to be found in the beauty of art – and perhaps, just perhaps, in the eyes of a stranger who had caught her gaze.
