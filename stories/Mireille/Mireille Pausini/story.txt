I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Mireille Pausini. It's possible that you may have misspelled the name or that this character is not well-known.

However, I did find information on an Italian singer and songwriter named Adriano Celentano and another famous Italian singer-songwriter named Eros Ramazzotti, but also another Italian musician known as Pausini, Luciano's colleague Mirella.
