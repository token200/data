There, she honed her craft alongside some of the best dancers from around the world. Under the guidance of esteemed instructors, Mireille refined her technique and expanded her repertoire.

Years of intense training paid off when Mireille Sadyrbaeva made her debut as a principal dancer with the Bolshoi Ballet. Her performance in Swan Lake was met with critical acclaim, with reviewers praising her ethereal beauty and technical precision.
