One crisp autumn evening, Mireille Valja received a visit from the wealthy socialite, Mrs. Harrington. The elegant woman was frantic, claiming that her prized diamond necklace had been stolen during a charity gala at the local mansion. As Mireille listened intently to the story, she nodded along, taking mental notes and making subtle inquiries.

Mireille Valja began her investigation by interviewing the guests who had attended the gala. She spoke with the charming host, Mr. Smith, and his beautiful wife, Sophia. Both seemed genuinely distraught over the theft, but Mireille noticed a faint hint of desperation in their eyes.
