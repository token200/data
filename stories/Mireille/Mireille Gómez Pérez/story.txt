Mireille Gómez Pérez sat at her desk, sipping a cup of strong coffee as she stared out the window. She was a detective with the Miami PD, and this case had been eating away at her for weeks. A young woman had gone missing in the Little Havana neighborhood, leaving behind only a cryptic note that read: "They're watching me."

Mireille's mind wandered back to the notes she'd received from the girl. Each one was more disturbing than the last, as if the writer was trying to convince herself - and anyone who would listen - of her own paranoia. The detective had been tasked with finding out what had really happened to the girl, but every lead seemed to end in a dead-end.

Just then, her phone rang. It was the Miami PD's chief, calling to tell Mireille that she'd finally cracked the code on the cryptic messages. "What is it?" Mireille asked, leaning forward in her chair.

"It's all about the letters," the chief said, his voice filled with excitement. "They're not just random words - they're a map."

Mireille's eyes widened as she listened to the chief explain. The letters formed a pattern on a map of Little Havana, leading to a small alleyway near Calle Ocho. According to the chief, this was where the missing girl had last been seen.

With newfound determination, Mireille grabbed her keys and headed out into the bright Miami sunlight. She followed the map through the winding streets, taking in the vibrant colors and sounds of the neighborhood. As she walked, the air grew thick with an eerie feeling - as if they were being watched.

Finally, Mireille arrived at the alleyway marked on the map. It was narrow and dark, but something about it seemed...off. Suddenly, a gust of wind blew through the alley, sending trash flying in all directions. In the center of the street, Mireille spotted a small piece of paper with a message scrawled on it: "I told you so."

With shaking hands, Mireille picked up her phone and dialed the chief's number. The girl had left her one final message - a warning that she knew Mireille would be coming for her. But where was she now? And who could have written those cryptic notes?

As the detective pondered these questions, the wind died down, leaving only an oppressive silence in its wake.
