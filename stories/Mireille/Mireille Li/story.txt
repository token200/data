Mireille Li was a young and ambitious journalist who had always been driven to uncover the truth. Born in the vibrant streets of Montreal, she had grown up surrounded by the city's diverse cultures and cuisines, which had instilled in her a keen sense of curiosity and determination.

Her hard work and dedication quickly paid off, and she was soon promoted to full-time reporter. She covered a wide range of topics, from politics to social issues, but her true passion lay in investigative journalism.
