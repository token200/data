Mireille Salamanca was a woman on the run. Her past had caught up with her, and she couldn't stay in one place for too long without being recognized. She had heard rumors that her uncle, Gus Fring's successor, Hector Salamanca, was seeking revenge for his brother's death.

As she walked through the crowded streets of Albuquerque, Mireille kept a low profile. She wore a hat and sunglasses to conceal her face, but it didn't matter – she knew people who knew people. The desert sun beat down on her as she quickened her pace, checking her watch for what felt like the hundredth time.

Mireille had been a loyal associate of Gus Fring's, carrying out his orders with precision and loyalty. But when Gus met his demise, Hector Salamanca had seen an opportunity to take revenge. And Mireille knew she was next on his hit list.

She ducked into a small café, ordering a cup of coffee as she scanned the room for any signs of trouble. The patrons were too engrossed in their own lives to notice her, and Mireille breathed a sigh of relief.

But as she sipped her coffee, a chill ran down her spine. A man at the next table caught her eye – his gaze was fixed intently on her, and Mireille knew he had seen her before. She tried to brush it off as mere coincidence, but the connection was too strong.

The man stood up, signaling for the waiter to bring him another cup of coffee. As he approached Mireille's table, she could see the recognition in his eyes. It was Hector Salamanca, come for his revenge.

"You've been running for a long time, Mireille," Hector said, his voice low and menacing. "But you can't hide forever."

Mireille tried to reason with him – explaining that Gus had set her up, that she wasn't responsible for his death. But Hector wouldn't listen. He pulled out a gun, pointing it at her head.

"I'll give you one chance to talk," he said, his eyes glinting with cruelty. "Tell me where I can find my brother's killer."

Mireille closed her eyes, bracing herself for the worst. She knew she was running out of time, and that Hector Salamanca would stop at nothing to get what he wanted.
