Mireille Pérez Sánchez was a young and ambitious journalist, known for her fearless approach to storytelling. Born in the vibrant city of Havana, Cuba, Mireille had grown up surrounded by the sounds and rhythms of Afro-Cuban music, which would later influence her passion for exploring the complexities of Latin American culture.

One day, while researching a story on the struggles faced by Afro-Cuban women in the rural countryside, Mireille stumbled upon an obscure community center that seemed to be operating outside of the mainstream. The center was dedicated to preserving traditional African rhythms and dances, which were under threat from the encroaching forces of globalization.

Intrigued, Mireille spent hours interviewing the center's director, a wise and aged woman named Abuela Rosa, who shared with her the rich history and cultural significance of these forgotten traditions. As she delved deeper into the story, Mireille found herself increasingly drawn to the community and its leader.

With her trusty camera and notebook in hand, Mireille set out to capture the vibrant spirit of Abuela Rosa's community center.
