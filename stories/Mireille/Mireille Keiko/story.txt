Mireille Keiko stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar station. She had never been to Tokyo before, and the bright neon lights of the city seemed to overwhelm her senses. As a young geisha, she was accustomed to the tranquil gardens and serene temples of Kyoto, not the bustling streets of this modern metropolis.

Mireille's thoughts were consumed by her upcoming appointment with a wealthy client. She had been booked as his mistress for the night, and he had promised to pay handsomely if she performed well. It wasn't the first time she'd worked in this capacity, but it was the most unsettling so far.

As she made her way through the crowded station, Mireille's thoughts turned to her fellow geisha back home. She missed their quiet discussions over tea and the soft laughter that filled the air. In Tokyo, women seemed to be constantly on the move, never staying in one place for long.

She hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of the client's mansion. The ride was short, but Mireille's anxiety grew with every passing second. She hadn't told anyone about her trip to Tokyo, not even her oji-san (geisha teacher), who would have been shocked by her decision to leave.

When she arrived at the mansion, Mireille was greeted by a burly doorman who escorted her through a maze of corridors and finally into a lavish living room. The client waited for her in an armchair, sipping whiskey and smoking a cigar. He eyed her with interest as she curtsied low.

The evening passed in a blur of polite conversation and empty gestures. Mireille's mind wandered back to Kyoto, imagining the soft chirping of crickets outside her window and the scent of incense wafting through the air. But when the night drew to a close, she found herself trapped between a cruel client and a promise he had made.

With a heavy heart, Mireille packed her bags and slipped out into the Tokyo night, her thoughts a jumble of confusion and longing for home.
