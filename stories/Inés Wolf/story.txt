Inés Wolf stepped out of her small Parisian apartment, taking in the crisp morning air as she gazed up at the rooftops. She was a woman with a secret: by day, she worked as an ordinary bookstore clerk, surrounded by dusty tomes and the musty scent of old paper. But by night, she donned a black cloak and prowled the city's hidden corners, using her knowledge of the books to uncover its deepest mysteries.

As she walked through the winding streets, Inés felt a thrill of excitement coursing through her veins. Tonight was different; tonight was the night of the rare book auction at the prestigious House of Books. The room would be filled with collectors and enthusiasts, all vying for possession of the most valuable and elusive volumes.

Inés had spent weeks researching, pouring over catalogues and scouring the city's underground marketplaces for clues. She knew that tonight was her chance to make a name for herself in the world of rare books, to prove that she was more than just a humble clerk.

As she arrived at the auction house, Inés felt her heart pounding in her chest. The air inside was thick with anticipation, the scent of old leather and sandalwood filling her lungs. She took her place among the other bidders, her eyes scanning the shelves as the auctioneer began to speak.

"Inés Wolf bids one thousand francs for this rare edition of Rimbaud's 'A Season in Hell'."

Inés raised an eyebrow, surprised by her own audacity. But she was not one to back down from a challenge. She bid again and again, each time pushing the envelope with increasing fervor.

Finally, after what seemed like hours, the bidding slowed and came to a close. Inés had won the auction, securing possession of a beautiful, if rare, copy of Baudelaire's 'Les Fleurs du Mal'. As she left the auction house, her prize clutched tightly in her arms, she felt a sense of triumph wash over her.

But as she walked back through the city streets, Inés couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The shadows seemed to move and twist around her, like living things. She quickened her pace, her heart pounding in her chest.

And then, suddenly, everything went black.

Inés found herself standing in a dimly lit room, surrounded by rows of bookshelves that stretched up into the darkness. A figure loomed over her, its face hidden behind a veil of shadows.

"Welcome, Inés Wolf," it said, its voice low and husky. "You have proven yourself to be a worthy collector. But now, you must prove yourself to be a true student."

Inés felt a shiver run down her spine as the figure reached out and took the book from her hands. She knew that she had stumbled into something much larger than herself, something that would change her life forever.

And with that, everything went black once more.
