In the quaint town of Krakow, Poland, a young woman named Władysław María lived a life filled with mystery and intrigue. Her parents, both renowned artists, had passed away when she was just a child, leaving her to navigate the world on her own. Władysław María's striking features – piercing green eyes and raven-black hair – often led people to mistake her for a boy, but those who looked closer saw a strength and determination in her gaze.

As a young adult, Władysław María had become an apprentice to the town's most skilled artisan, learning the intricacies of woodworking and metalwork. Her natural talent soon surpassed that of her peers, and she began to take on commissions from the townspeople. Word of her exceptional craftsmanship spread quickly, drawing attention from travelers and traders passing through Krakow.

One fateful evening, a charismatic stranger arrived in town, seeking Władysław María's expertise. He introduced himself as Count Różycki, a nobleman from a neighboring kingdom, who had heard tales of the young woman's remarkable skills. Impressed by her work, he commissioned a custom-made sword with intricate designs that mirrored his family crest.

As Władysław María worked tirelessly on the commission, she found herself drawn to the Count's charismatic presence and charming smile. Their conversations flowed effortlessly, touching upon art, history, and philosophy. The more time they spent together, the more Władysław María realized her feelings for the Count went beyond mere admiration.

The day the sword was completed, Count Różycki presented it to Władysław María with a bouquet of wildflowers and a request to join him on a journey across the kingdom. As she accepted his offer, the young woman's heart swelled with excitement and trepidation. With her full name whispered in her ear – Władysław María – the Count revealed a small, intricately carved wooden box containing a note from an unknown sender, addressed to Władysław María alone.

The contents of the note remained a mystery, but Władysław María knew that this journey would be one of self-discovery and transformation. With her full name etched in her memory, she set off into the unknown, ready to forge a new path and uncover secrets hidden within herself.
