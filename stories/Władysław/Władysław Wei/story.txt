Władysław Wei stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the cityscape as the sun dipped below the horizon. A whiskey glass clutched in one hand, he took a sip, letting the amber liquid burn down his throat.

As a retired spy, Władysław had seen it all – the high-stakes games, the double agents, and the endless betrayals. He'd lived a life most people could only dream of, and yet, he felt empty, like a shell of a man.

Władysław's thoughts drifted back to his early days as a KGB agent. He was young and idealistic, convinced that his work would change the world. But the truth was far from it. The espionage game was brutal, with allegiances shifting like sand between one's fingers. Władysław had played both sides, sometimes wearing a false smile to conceal his true intentions.

Over the years, he'd accumulated secrets and scars, each one etched into his mind like a scar on his skin. He knew that if anyone were to uncover his past, it would all come crashing down. So, Władysław had vanished from the espionage scene, only to resurface as an art dealer in the exclusive circles of Manhattan.

Here, he could blend in, wearing masks of respectability and charm. But on nights like these, when the city lights twinkled outside his office window, Władysław couldn't shake the feeling that he was still trapped in a web of deceit.

A faint sound from below roused him from his reverie – footsteps, muffled but unmistakable. He watched warily as one of his employees, Jacek, approached him with an odd look on his face.

"Sir, I need to talk to you about something," Jacek said hesitantly.

Władysław raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. "What is it?"

Jacek leaned in close, glancing around nervously before speaking in a hushed tone: "I've been looking through some of your old files, sir. I think there's more to this art market than you're letting on."

Władysław's gut dropped as the words hit him like a ton of bricks. Could it be? Was someone onto him? He raised an eyebrow at Jacek, searching for signs of betrayal.

But all he saw was genuine concern in Jacek's eyes. For a moment, Władysław wondered if maybe, just maybe, he wasn't alone after all.

He took another sip of his whiskey, feeling the weight settle on his shoulders – or rather, lift it off his chest for an instant, leaving him with more questions than answers.
