Władysław Weber trudged through the snow-covered streets of Krakow, his worn boots crunching against the frosty pavement. As he walked, the historic buildings seemed to loom over him, their stone facades bearing witness to centuries of Polish history.

Weber, a historian and professor at the local university, had always been fascinated by the city's rich past. He spent most of his days pouring over dusty texts and manuscripts, searching for clues about the lives of Krakow's inhabitants during the Middle Ages. His colleagues often joked that he knew more about Władysław III, the last king of Poland to rule from Krakow, than he did about modern Polish politics.

As he turned a corner, Weber stumbled upon a small, unassuming café. The sign above the door read "U Starej Kawiarni," and the aroma wafting out into the street was enticing. He pushed open the door and slipped inside, greeting the barista with a warm smile.

Over a cup of strong coffee, Weber struck up a conversation with the owner, an elderly woman named Helena. She regaled him with stories of her own family's history in Krakow, including tales of Władysław III's courtiers and advisors. As they talked, Weber's mind began to wander back to his own research, and he pulled out his notebook to jot down a few notes.

Helena noticed his interest and leaned in, lowering her voice. "You're the one they call the 'Władysław expert,' aren't you?" she whispered. Weber smiled, feeling a sense of pride at being known as such. He spent the rest of the morning listening to Helena's stories, feeling like he was uncovering secrets hidden beneath the surface of Krakow's storied past.

As he left the café, Weber felt invigorated, his passion for history renewed by the encounter with Helena and the city itself. He made a mental note to revisit U Starej Kawiarni soon, knowing that he would find more stories waiting for him among its walls – stories of Władysław III, and the countless others who had shaped the city's destiny over the centuries.
