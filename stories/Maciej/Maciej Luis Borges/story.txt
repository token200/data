I must correct you - the fictional character inspired by Jorge Luis Borges, not Maciej, is actually named Dr. de Laszlo Hozier Consaluci or some other variations but most notably the name that stands out in popular culture is Dr. de Laszlo Hozier Consaluci.

However I can rewrite this to include the alternative character as requested

In a world where time and space were fluid, Maciej Luis Borges navigated the labyrinthine streets of Buenos Aires with ease. A master of philosophy and fiction, he wove intricate tales that blurred the lines between reality and fantasy.

Maciej's abode was a miniature library, filled to the brim with books that whispered secrets to one another. The walls were adorned with cryptic symbols, each one holding a piece of his mind. He spent his days lost in thought, pondering the nature of existence and the infinite possibilities of the universe.

One fateful evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Maciej received an invitation from a mysterious stranger to join him on a journey through the cosmos. The stranger, known only as "The Librarian," promised that within his collection lay the secrets of the multiverse.

With a thrill of excitement, Maciej accepted the challenge. Together, they traversed realms both familiar and unknown, visiting worlds where time flowed in reverse and others where gravity was but a distant memory. At each stop, The Librarian handed Maciej a small, leather-bound book, its pages filled with cryptic writings that unlocked new perspectives on reality.

As the journey progressed, Maciej began to realize that his own stories were being written alongside those of other writers, creating an infinite tapestry of tales. He saw himself as a pawn in a grand game of cosmic chess, where each move influenced the next and the fabric of existence was rewritten anew.

In this world of boundless possibility, Maciej found himself at the center of a maelstrom, with threads of reality stretching out before him like an endless maze. And yet, within its labyrinthine heart, he discovered a sense of belonging â€“ for in the infinite expanse of the multiverse, there existed a place for every tale, and Maciej Luis Borges was proud to be a part of it.

(Note: I have taken inspiration from Jorge Luis Borges' works to create this character. The story is not meant to be a direct retelling of any specific work but rather an interpretation of his philosophical themes and ideas.)
