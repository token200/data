Days turned into weeks, and still, no one had been caught in the act. But Maciej was relentless, convinced that he could crack the case if he kept digging. And then, like a bolt of lightning on a stormy night, it came to him – a seemingly trivial detail that would lead him to the thief.

With newfound confidence, Maciej pieced together the evidence and tracked down the culprit. The stolen items were recovered, and the thief was brought to justice. The people of Šiauliai hailed Maciej as a hero, and his reputation as one of the finest detectives in Lithuania solidified.
