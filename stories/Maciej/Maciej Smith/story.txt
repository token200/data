As he looked out over the town, now seeing it through the eyes of his ancestors, Maciej knew that he had finally found his place in the world.

Years later, as Maciej Smith sat in his office, surrounded by photographs and mementos from his family's past, he smiled knowing that his great-grandfather John would be proud.
