Maciej Wagner stepped into the dimly lit tavern, the smell of smoke and ale wafting through the air. He had heard rumors of a mysterious patron who met with him in this very place, but he never expected to be summoned himself. As he made his way to the bar, a figure emerged from the shadows.

"Maciej Wagner," a low voice said, "we've been waiting for you."

The patron, an elderly man with piercing green eyes, gestured for Maciej to take a seat at a small table in the corner. Over a cup of steaming coffee, they began their discussion.

"You're one of our most skilled assassins, Maciej," the old man said. "But I think it's time you used your talents for something more... meaningful."

Maciej raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the sudden change in tone. "What do you mean?" he asked.

The patron smiled, a small, enigmatic smile. "There's a matter of great importance that requires your attention. A powerful noble has been murdered, and we believe it was no accident. We need someone with your... particular set of skills to uncover the truth behind his death."

Maciej nodded, intrigued by the challenge. He had always prided himself on being able to handle any situation, but this one felt different. There was a sense of justice involved, something that went beyond simple coin.

The patron handed him a small folder containing details of the case. Maciej scanned it quickly, his eyes narrowing as he took in the names and faces. It seemed like a complex web of intrigue, with fingers pointing to every corner of society.

"I'll take on the job," Maciej said finally, tucking the folder into his belt. "But I want one thing: answers."

The patron nodded once, his green eyes glinting in the dim light. "You'll have your answer when you uncover the truth, Maciej. But be warned: this case is not for the faint of heart."

Maciej smiled, a cold, calculated smile. He knew that he was about to step into a world of shadows and deception, but he was ready.
