Maciej Weber stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out at the glittering cityscape below. He took a long drag on his cigarette, feeling the familiar burn in his lungs as he surveyed the concrete jungle.

Weber was a man with no particular destination in mind. He had grown tired of the monotony of his daily routine – working as an accountant for a small firm in Warsaw's Old Town. The numbers and spreadsheets that filled his days were nothing more than a means to an end, a way to support himself until he could find something more.

But what was that more?

Weber thought back to his childhood, spent exploring the forests and hills of rural Poland with his grandfather. They would spend hours sitting by the fire, listening to stories of the old country's heroes and villains. His grandfather had been a sailor, and Weber had always felt the call of the sea.

Now, as he stood on this rooftop, the wind whipping his hair into a frenzy, Weber felt it stirring within him once more. He tossed his cigarette to the ground and began to walk along the edge of the roof, feeling the familiar thrill of the unknown.

He passed by the office buildings, their windows reflecting the flickering lights of the city below like a sea of glassy eyes. The sounds of car horns and chatter carried up to him, a cacophony of humanity that made his heart ache with longing.

Weber spotted a figure walking towards him from across the street – a young woman with a scarf tied loosely around her head and a guitar slung over her shoulder. She smiled as she approached, her eyes crinkling at the corners.

"Where are you headed?" Weber asked, feeling a spark of recognition ignite within him.

She hesitated for a moment before answering, "I'm on my way to the train station. I've got a ticket to Gdańsk."

Weber's heart skipped a beat as he watched her disappear into the crowd. He knew that place – the city where his grandfather had once sailed the Baltic Sea. It was a long shot, but something about the woman's words resonated deep within him.

Without another thought, Weber set off in pursuit of the train station, feeling the wind and rain whipping at his face as he went. For the first time in years, he felt alive, like anything was possible on the open road ahead.
