Aoki Wójcik was a free spirit, always chasing the wind and never staying in one place for too long. Born into a nomadic tribe in the vast steppes of Mongolia, they learned to adapt and thrive in any environment. Aoki's parents were skilled horsemen and traders, traveling from village to village, exchanging goods and stories.

As a child, Aoki would often sit at their mother's feet, listening intently as she spun tales of ancient myths and legends. They were especially drawn to the story of the great sky warrior, Tengri, who had battled the forces of darkness to bring light and order to the world. Aoki felt an unshakeable connection to this myth, as if they too could harness the power of the wind.

Growing up, Aoki honed their skills as a skilled archer and horseman, accompanying their parents on long journeys across the steppes. They developed a keen sense of observation and intuition, able to read the subtle signs of nature that only came with spending years under the vast expanse of the sky.

One day, while out on a hunting trip, Aoki stumbled upon an ancient relic hidden deep within a rocky outcropping. The artifact was unlike anything they had ever seen before – intricately carved wooden figurines depicting Tengri and his celestial companions. It was as if fate had led them to this moment, and Aoki knew in that instant that their destiny lay not on the steppes, but in the realm of myth and legend.

From that day forward, Aoki Wójcik dedicated themselves to mastering the ancient arts, delving deep into the mysteries of the wind and the spirits. They became a respected shaman among their people, using their gifts to heal the sick and calm the restless. Though they still roamed the steppes as a free spirit, Aoki knew that their true calling lay in harnessing the power of the mythic forces that had brought them to this moment.
