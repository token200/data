Aoki LeBlanc sat at his desk, sipping on a cup of lukewarm coffee as he stared blankly at the latest batch of memos from his boss. Another day, another mountain of paperwork to sift through. The 17-year-old student felt like he was drowning in a sea of bureaucratic red tape.

As the leader of the Resistance against the oppressive government that controlled New Orleans, Aoki's days were usually filled with more excitement than administrative tasks. But after the loss of his brother, Sébastien, to the brutal regime's forces, Aoki had taken on a new role: the de facto leader of the group.

Despite his youth, Aoki was determined to keep his people safe and fight for their freedom. He spent most nights planning strategies with his trusted allies, brainstorming ways to outsmart the government's intelligence agents. His days were filled with organizing rallies, spreading propaganda, and trying to evade capture.

But despite the thrill of the resistance, Aoki couldn't shake off the feeling that he was losing himself in the process. He had always been the quiet type, content to observe and listen before acting. But now, he felt like a public figure, expected to lead by example. The pressure was suffocating him.

Just as Aoki was about to give up on his coffee, a knock at the door broke the silence. It was Renard, one of Aoki's closest friends in the Resistance. "Hey, boss," Renard said with a grin, flopping down into the chair across from Aoki. "Got some good news for you."

Aoki raised an eyebrow. "What is it?"

"We managed to get our hands on a map of the city's sewer system," Renard said, producing a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket. "If we can sneak down there and dig up some key evidence, I think we might be able to expose the government's corrupt officials for good."

Aoki's eyes lit up with excitement as he took the map from Renard. This was what it meant to fight for a cause – not just reading memos all day, but using his skills to make real change happen.

He crumpled the coffee cup in his hand and stood up, determination coursing through his veins once again. "Let's do this," Aoki said, a smile spreading across his face.
