Aoki Hideki sat alone in his small apartment, staring blankly at the wall as he tried to make sense of it all. As the son of a wealthy businessman, he had always been expected to follow in his father's footsteps and take over the family company. But Aoki Hideki had other plans.

He was an artist, and for years, he had secretly honed his craft, sneaking away from family gatherings and social events to paint and draw. It was a passion that brought him joy, but also made him feel like an outsider among his own people.

As he sat there, Aoki Hideki's mind wandered back to his childhood, when his parents had first encouraged his creative pursuits. They had seen the potential in him, and had supported him every step of the way. But as he grew older, they began to pressure him more and more to focus on business, rather than art.

Aoki Hideki felt a pang of resentment towards them. Why couldn't they see that this was what truly made him happy? That his paintings were not just random scribbles on canvas, but actual expressions of his soul?

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was his best friend, Takashi. "Hey, Hideki, what's going on?" he asked, noticing the look of despondency on Aoki Hideki's face.

Aoki Hideki sighed, showing Takashi the sketchbook he had been working on. "I don't know what to do," he said. "My parents are always telling me I need to focus on business, but my heart is here."

Takashi nodded thoughtfully. "You need to follow your own path, Hideki. That's what matters most." Aoki Hideki smiled slightly, feeling a weight lift off his shoulders.

For the first time in years, he felt like he could finally breathe. Maybe it was time for him to take control of his life, and pursue his passion for art, no matter what anyone else thought. As he looked at Takashi, Aoki Hideki knew that he had made up his mind: from now on, he would be an artist, not just a businessman's son.

With renewed determination, Aoki Hideki closed the sketchbook and stood up, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
