Aoki Bąk's eyes scanned the crowded town square, his gaze lingering on each face as he searched for any sign of trouble. It was a sunny afternoon, with children playing tag and laughter filling the air, but Aoki Bąk knew that beneath the surface, something was off.

As he approached the local saloon, a commotion caught his attention. A young woman, her eyes red from crying, stood at the bar, pouring drinks for the patrons. Aoki Bąk's instincts told him that this woman needed help, and he quickly made his way over to her.

"Ma'am, what seems to be the problem?" Aoki Bąk asked, his deep voice calm but firm.
