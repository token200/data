Aoki Sten stood at the edge of the dusty road, her worn leather boots scuffling against the dry earth. The sun beat down upon her weathered face, casting a deep crease between her brows. Her eyes scanned the horizon, searching for any sign of life.

It had been months since she'd last seen a soul, and the solitude was starting to get to her. She'd grown accustomed to the stillness, but it wasn't enough to fill the void within. Aoki's thoughts often wandered back to the village where she'd once called home, the warmth of laughter and camaraderie now nothing more than a distant memory.

A faint plume of smoke rose from the nearby forest, drawing her attention. She watched as a figure emerged, walking towards her with an air of quiet determination. A young man, perhaps twenty winters old, with skin bronzed by the sun and eyes that shone like dark stars.

As he drew closer, Aoki noticed the weight of his pack, heavy with supplies. His movements were deliberate, every step calculated to ensure his survival. She sensed a hunger within him, a drive to reach his destination, no matter the cost.

"Greetings," she said, her voice low and gravelly from disuse. The young man turned, his gaze lingering on hers before flicking away to survey their surroundings.

"I'm passing through," he said finally, his tone neutral. "Seeking refuge in a nearby town."

Aoki nodded, her thoughts racing with the prospect of company. "I'll escort you," she offered, without expecting an answer.

The young man hesitated, then nodded curtly. Together, they set off down the road, the silence between them comfortable, like old boots worn smooth by years of walking together.

As the sun began to dip towards the horizon, casting a golden glow over the landscape, Aoki felt a sense of belonging wash over her. It wasn't much, but it was enough to keep her heart from turning to dust. She glanced at her companion, his profile strong and steady, his eyes fixed on some point beyond their shared horizon.

Together, they walked into the unknown, the vast expanse of nothingness stretching out before them like an endless sea.
