Aoki Gagnon stepped out of the mist-shrouded alleys of Tokyo's Shinjuku district, her piercing green eyes scanning the crowded streets below. Her dark hair was pulled back into a tight ponytail, revealing a smattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose. A slender figure in a black leather jacket and fitted jeans, she moved with an air of quiet confidence.

As a private investigator, Gagnon had seen it all - from the seedy underbelly of Tokyo's red-light district to the high-stakes world of corporate espionage. Her latest case was no exception: a wealthy businessman had hired her to track down his missing daughter, a 25-year-old socialite with a reputation for reckless behavior.

Gagnon's gaze landed on a figure watching her from across the street - a tall, imposing man with a shaved head and a cruel smile etched into his face. She recognized him as Takeshi, a former associate of the businessman's who had gone rogue several months ago. Gagnon's instincts told her that Takeshi was hiding something, but she needed more evidence before she could move forward.

She lit a cigarette, exhaling a stream of smoke as she began to weave through the crowd. Her eyes locked onto Takeshi, who raised an eyebrow in response. Gagnon smiled, a small, enigmatic smile that seemed to say "I know what you're thinking".

As she reached the other side of the street, Gagnon spotted a small caf√© tucked away between two towering skyscrapers. She ducked inside, ordering a whiskey on the rocks from the bartender as she scanned the room for Takeshi.

He was sitting in the corner, sipping on a coffee and eyeing her with a mixture of curiosity and hostility. Gagnon took a seat opposite him, her eyes never leaving his face. "You're looking for something," she said, her voice low and even. "Or someone."

Takeshi shrugged, his smile growing wider. "Maybe both."

Gagnon leaned forward, her cigarette dangling from her lips. "Tell me more."
