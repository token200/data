As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the city, Aoki's attention turned to the matter at hand: the proposed trade agreement with the neighboring kingdom of Babylon. They had spent months negotiating with their ambassadors, and now it was time to put the final touches on the deal.

With a wave of their hand, Aoki summoned their trusted advisor, the wise and aged Senator Lucius. "Lucius, I need you to review the terms one last time," they said, their voice firm but measured.

Lucius nodded, his eyes scanning the parchment before him. "It is acceptable, Your Majesty. The Babylonians will provide us with a significant influx of goods, including the precious spice known as saffron."

Aoki's face lit up with excitement at the mention of saffron, their favorite spice. They had always been known for their refined taste, and this agreement would bring great prosperity to their people.

As the night wore on, Aoki sat in silence, lost in thought. They pondered the weight of their responsibilities, knowing that their decisions would shape the fate of their empire for generations to come.
