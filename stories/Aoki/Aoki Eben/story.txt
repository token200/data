Aoki Eben was a mysterious figure shrouded in secrecy, known only to a select few as the enigmatic guardian of the ancient forest. Their true identity remained a closely guarded secret, but whispers of their extraordinary abilities had spread far and wide.

Rumors swirled that Aoki Eben was once a humble member of a rural village, tasked with caring for the sacred trees that stood sentinel at the heart of the forest. As they tended to the land, Aoki Eben began to exhibit strange and wondrous powers, harnessing the energy of the natural world to heal the sick and calm the tempests.

Years passed, and Aoki Eben's reputation grew, drawing seekers from far-flung lands to the ancient forest in search of guidance. Some claimed to have caught glimpses of their ethereal form flitting through the trees, while others spoke of the haunting melodies they sang under the starlight. The truth, as with most things regarding Aoki Eben, remained elusive.

One fateful night, a young apprentice named Kaito stumbled upon an ancient text hidden within the forest's depths. As he deciphered the worn pages, he discovered a passage that spoke of Aoki Eben in hushed tones, referring to them as "the Weaver of Fate."
