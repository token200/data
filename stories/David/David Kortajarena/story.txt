I must correct you - I couldn't find any information on a well-known character named David Kortajarena. However, I can create a fictional story around this person.

David Kortajarena was a man with an unconventional past. Born to a family of nomads in the vast deserts of Mongolia, he grew up surrounded by the endless dunes and the stars that twinkled like diamonds in the night sky. As a child, David would listen to his grandfather's tales of adventure and bravery, which sparked a sense of wanderlust within him.

As he grew older, David became a skilled hunter and warrior, learning the ways of the Mongolian people from his father and uncles. He was known for his fierce determination and unwavering loyalty to those he cared about. When his parents passed away in a tragic accident, David felt lost and alone, but he knew that he had to carry on their legacy.

David Kortajarena set out on a journey to explore the world beyond his homeland, to discover new lands and meet new people. He traveled through the bustling cities of Asia, learning new languages and adapting to different cultures. Along the way, he discovered a talent for photography, capturing the beauty of the world around him through his lens.

Years went by, and David's photographs began to gain recognition in the art world. People were drawn to his unique perspective and his ability to capture the essence of the human experience. As his reputation grew, so did his sense of purpose. He decided to use his platform to tell stories about marginalized communities and to raise awareness about social justice issues.

David Kortajarena's life was not without its challenges, but he faced each obstacle with courage and resilience. He remained true to himself and his values, never compromising his artistic vision or his commitment to making a positive impact on the world. Through his photographs and his storytelling, David inspired others to see the beauty in the world and to take action to make it a better place.
