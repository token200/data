David González Fernández, or Dávida as he was known to his friends, had always been the quiet one in the group. A software engineer by profession and an avid enthusiast of indie music and astronomy, he kept to himself, but when it counted, he would shine.

On a fateful night, while stargazing at a remote hilltop overlooking his hometown of San Cristóbal de las Casas, Dávida's life changed forever. It was as if the stars aligned in a peculiar pattern that night – a rare lunar eclipse caught his attention, and as he gazed into its ethereal glow, he felt an unexplainable sense of purpose.

Determined to uncover the secrets hidden within the cosmos, Dávida embarked on an unlikely adventure to find out more about this anomaly. His pursuit led him to a small antique shop tucked away in a quiet alleyway near his home. The store was dusty and dimly lit but exuded an aura of mystique that drew Dávida in.

There, he stumbled upon an ancient tome bound in worn leather and adorned with symbols he recognized from the stars above – the celestial map etched into the pages reflected the very pattern he had seen during that night's lunar eclipse. The shopkeeper revealed to him that this book contained an ancient dialect known only to a select few.

Entranced, Dávida purchased the tome and began to decipher its cryptic texts. His fascination led him down an uncharted path of self-discovery, intertwining his profession with his passion for astronomy, leading to groundbreaking discoveries in the field of interstellar communication. 

With time, as more people learned about his incredible breakthroughs, the quiet Dávida transformed into a celebrated figure in academia. Though his newfound fame humbled him and led some to speculate that he must have relied on prior knowledge or hidden backing, David knew better – for deep down, his heart belonged to those stars.
