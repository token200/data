As he wandered through the streets of his hometown, he would often stop to take in the intricate details of architecture, people-watching, and snapping pictures of anything that caught his eye.

One day, while out on a shoot, David Lopez Rodriguez stumbled upon a small, family-owned bakery. The smell of freshly baked bread wafted out onto the sidewalk, enticing him to come inside. He was greeted by the owner, an elderly woman named Maria, who welcomed him with a warm smile.

As he browsed the shelves, David Lopez Rodriguez couldn't help but be captivated by the array of pastries on display. His eyes landed on a tray of perfectly golden croissants, and he knew he had to capture their beauty on film. Maria noticed his interest and offered to let him take a few shots.
