A gentle touch on his arm brought him back to the present. "Ah, David Kalēja," a soft voice said, "welcome to our humble abode." A woman with long, raven-black hair smiled up at him, her eyes sparkling with warmth. "Please, come in. I am Lady Sophia. We've been expecting you."

David's gaze followed her as she led him deeper into the manor, taking in the opulent furnishings and glittering tapestries. He had always found the Kalējan family's love of luxury to be both fascinating and exhausting.

As the evening drew to a close, Lady Sophia rose from her seat, a small smile playing on her lips.

David's eyes locked onto hers, his mind already racing with possibilities. He knew that his full name, David Kalēja, was not just a reminder of his family's legacy – it was also a key to unlocking the secrets of power and influence that lay hidden in the shadows of their society.
