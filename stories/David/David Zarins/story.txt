David Zarins stepped into the dimly lit jazz club, his eyes scanning the room for a glimpse of his old friend, Jack. The air was thick with smoke and the sounds of Miles Davis's "So What" filled the air. David made his way to the bar, ordering a whiskey on the rocks as he waited for Jack to arrive.

As he sipped his drink, David couldn't help but think back to their college days, when they spent countless nights exploring the city, attending underground music shows, and debating philosophy with their friends. They had been inseparable, two peas in a pod, bound together by their love of art and music.

Just then, Jack appeared at the bar, his eyes scanning the room until they landed on David's face. He smiled, and made his way over to join him. "Hey, Davy!" he exclaimed, using the nickname only he knew how to pronounce correctly.

David rolled his eyes good-naturedly. "Just call me Zarins, Jack," he said with a chuckle. The two friends sat down at a table, ordering more drinks and catching up on each other's lives.

As they talked, David couldn't help but notice the way Jack's hair was graying at the temples, or the way his eyes seemed to hold a deeper wisdom now that he was in his fifties. He knew that Jack had been through some tough times recently - losing his wife, struggling with addiction - but it was clear that he was still the same vibrant, charismatic person who had captivated David's heart all those years ago.

As the night wore on and the music grew louder, David felt a sense of gratitude wash over him. He was grateful for this chance to reconnect with an old friend, to relive some of the best moments of his life. And he knew that as long as Jack was by his side, he could face whatever came next.

"I'm glad we're doing this, Davy," Jack said, clapping David on the back. "We need more nights like these." David smiled, feeling a sense of closure and renewal wash over him.
