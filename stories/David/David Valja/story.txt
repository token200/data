As a young boy, David Valja had grown up on the streets of New York City, surviving by his wits and his fists.

He had once been a nurse, working in some of the toughest hospitals in the city, where he had seen firsthand the devastating effects of poverty and neglect.

But something had changed within him, something that had driven him out of the medical profession and into the shadows. Some said it was the loss of a loved one, others that it was the weight of his own guilt. Whatever the reason, David Valja had disappeared from sight, leaving behind only whispers and speculation.

Years went by, and the rumors about David Valja grew more and more outlandish. Some claimed he was working as a private investigator, while others said he was a high-stakes thief or a vigilante. But one thing was certain: wherever David Valja went, trouble followed close behind.

Despite all this, there were those who believed that beneath the tough exterior, David Valja still held onto his sense of compassion and justice. They whispered among themselves about the mysterious figure who seemed to be watching over them, a guardian angel in disguise.
