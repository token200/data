I couldn't find any information on a person named David Liepiņa. It's possible that you may be thinking of a different person or the name is not well-known.

However, I did find information on a professional tennis player from Latvia named Janis Liepiņs (also known as Jan Lieps and later as Jan Lienderts) who was born in 1896 but is also known by his married surname as Liepiņs.
