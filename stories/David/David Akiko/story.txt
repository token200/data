As David grew older, his fascination with photography only deepened. He spent countless hours learning about lighting, composition, and technique, honing his skills through years of practice and experimentation. His friends and family were always eager to be his subjects, and he took great pride in capturing the essence of each person he met.

After completing his degree in fine arts, David Akiko decided to pursue a career in photography full-time. He started by taking on freelance projects, photographing local events and weddings, before eventually landing a job at a prominent advertising agency.
