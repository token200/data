I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named David Krūmiņa. It's possible that this character is not well-known or doesn't exist in popular culture. However, I can create a story about a fictional character with this name.

David Krūmiņa was a brilliant and resourceful scientist who lived in the small town of Riga, Latvia, during the early 20th century. He was born into a family of modest means, but his natural curiosity and love for science drove him to pursue a career in physics.

As a young man, David spent countless hours studying the works of famous scientists like Einstein and Curie. He was particularly fascinated by the concept of relativity and its implications on time and space. His dedication paid off when he landed a scholarship to study at the University of Zurich, where he earned his Ph.D. in physics.

After completing his education, David returned to Riga and began working at the local university as a lecturer. However, he soon became disillusioned with the lack of resources and support for scientific research in Latvia. He decided to take matters into his own hands and founded a small laboratory in his home, where he conducted his own experiments and investigations.

David's work focused on developing new technologies that could improve people's lives. He spent years researching alternative energy sources and creating innovative solutions for renewable energy. His passion and perseverance paid off when he developed a revolutionary new device that harnessed the power of solar energy.

As news of David's invention spread, he became an overnight sensation in Latvia. The government took notice of his work and offered him a lucrative contract to develop more sustainable energy solutions. David's success also attracted international attention, and he was soon invited to present his research at conferences and symposia around the world.

Despite his fame and fortune, David remained humble and dedicated to his craft. He continued to work tirelessly in his laboratory, always pushing the boundaries of what was possible. His legacy lived on long after his passing, inspiring generations of scientists and engineers to follow in his footsteps.

Years later, a young scientist named Maria discovered an old notebook belonging to David Krūmiņa. As she flipped through its pages, she found cryptic notes and sketches that revealed the secret behind David's groundbreaking invention. She spent years studying the notebook, pouring over David's theories and calculations, and eventually developed her own innovative solution to harnessing solar energy.

David's story serves as a testament to the power of human ingenuity and determination. Even in the face of adversity, a brilliant mind can change the world.
