I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named David Saldana. However, I did find information on a real-life actor named Michael B. Jordan and another actor named Diego Luna's co-star Michael Shannon doesn't have a relation to the name 'David' that is publically known.

But if you're interested in reading about the full-time male model and actor named David Saldana then here's a short story:

David Saldana was more than just a pretty face, although his stunning features did make him a sought-after model. As a supermodel, he had walked down some of the biggest runways in the world, gracing the covers of top fashion magazines and working with the most renowned photographers.

But David's passion wasn't limited to modeling alone. He had also dabbled in acting, landing roles in various films and TV shows. His breakout role came when he played the lead in a critically acclaimed independent film that earned him critical acclaim and recognition in the industry.

As his career took off, so did his personal life. David Saldana found himself juggling between modeling shoots and filming schedules, but he never let it get to him. He was always up for a challenge and used his downtime to pursue new interests and hobbies.

One of those passions was photography. David had always been fascinated by the art of capturing moments and beauty through the lens, and he spent countless hours honing his skills as a photographer. His passion project was documenting street culture and urban landscapes, which later became a successful side venture for him.

As his modeling career continued to thrive, David's love for photography only grew stronger. He eventually decided to combine both passions by taking on more behind-the-scenes work in the fashion industry, working closely with stylists, directors, and other creatives to bring visual masterpieces to life.

Throughout it all, David Saldana remained humble and grounded, never losing sight of his roots or the reason he got into modeling in the first place: to express himself creatively. And as he looked back on his journey so far, he couldn't help but feel grateful for the opportunities that had come his way.
