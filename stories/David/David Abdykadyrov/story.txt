David Abdykadyrov was a man of mystery, with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair that always seemed to be perfectly messy. A brilliant engineer by trade, he had a way of thinking outside the box that often led to innovative solutions.

Born in the bustling city of Almaty, Kazakhstan, David grew up surrounded by the sounds and smells of traditional Kazakh cuisine.
