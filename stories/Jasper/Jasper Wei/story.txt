Jasper Wei was known for his unwavering passion for photography. As a young boy, he would spend hours gazing through his father's old camera, mesmerized by the way it captured life's precious moments. Years later, Jasper had turned that childhood fascination into a career, traveling the world and capturing breathtaking images that told stories of their own.
