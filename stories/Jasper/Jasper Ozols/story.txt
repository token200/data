As he walked through the streets, Jasper Ozols noticed a group of children playing tag near the park. Their laughter and shouts filled the air, drawing attention away from the drabness that often surrounded him. He quickened his pace, eager to capture the vibrant colors of their playtime.

Upon arriving at his studio, Jasper Ozols set up his easel and began to paint. The strokes were bold and expressive, as if trying to match the energy of the children he had seen earlier. Hours passed, and the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the room.
