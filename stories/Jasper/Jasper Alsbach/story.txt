Jasper Alsbach stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the quaint station. It was a far cry from the bustling cities he had grown accustomed to in Berlin. As a former thief, Jasper had found himself on the run from the law, but it seemed that his past had finally caught up with him.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Jasper had left his life of crime behind and decided to use his skills for good. He now worked as a private investigator, using his expertise to help those in need.

As he walked out of the station, Jasper noticed a figure watching him from across the platform. It was a young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She beckoned to him, her hand lingering in the air before dropping back down.

Jasper's instincts told him to be cautious, but there was something about this woman that drew him in. He approached her cautiously, his eyes locked on hers.

"Who are you?" Jasper asked gruffly, trying to sound more confident than he felt.

"My name is Sophia," the woman replied, a small smile playing on her lips. "And I have information about your past."

Jasper's heart skipped a beat as he searched his memory for any clues. He had managed to leave his old life behind, but it was clear that Sophia knew more about him than she was letting on.

"What makes you think I'm connected to...whatever it is you're talking about?" Jasper asked, trying to stall for time.

Sophia chuckled and pulled out a small photograph from her pocket. "This," she said, holding up the image of a young woman with an uncanny resemblance to himself. "This is your sister."

Jasper's eyes widened as he took in the picture. He had always known that his parents were part of a famous family, but he had never heard of any siblings.

"Sophia, where did you get this?" Jasper demanded, his mind racing with questions.

Sophia smiled again and handed him another photograph. "This is your mother," she said, her eyes sparkling with intrigue.

Jasper's world was turned upside down as he stared at the two photographs. It seemed that his past had caught up with him after all.
