Jasper Zariņš crouched behind the worn stone wall, his eyes scanning the abandoned streets of Riga. The city was bathed in the golden light of sunset, but the atmosphere felt heavy with foreboding. As a former KGB agent turned freelance "fixer", Jasper had seen it all - the corruption, the deceit, and the violence.

He adjusted his earpiece, listening to the voice on the other end. "Jasper, we have confirmation that the package has arrived at the agreed meeting point."

Jasper's gut tightened as he recognized the voice of his contact, Viktor. The package was a rare artifact, one that could change the course of history - or get him killed.

As he watched, a sleek black sedan pulled up to the curb. Jasper recognized the license plate number - it belonged to Viktor's men. He waited until they got out, then slipped forward, his eyes locked on the driver.

"Viktor," he said, his voice low and even.

The older man turned, a look of surprise crossing his face before he smiled. "Jasper. I see you made it."

Jasper nodded, his hand instinctively reaching for his gun. "I did. But we need to talk."

The two men walked down the street, their footsteps echoing off the buildings. They reached Viktor's office and stepped inside.

"What do you know about the artifact?" Jasper asked, his eyes scanning the room.

Viktor leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers together. "It's a rare gemstone, one that holds great historical significance."

Jasper raised an eyebrow. "Historical significance? You mean like the kind of thing that could start a war?"

Viktor shrugged. "That's what I'm trying to tell you, Jasper. This gemstone is worth millions - and it's in your possession now."

Jasper snorted. "You think I'm some kind of fool? I don't sell out for money."

Viktor leaned forward, his eyes glinting with a cold light. "I didn't ask you to sell out, Jasper. I asked you to protect it."

The air seemed to thicken as Jasper looked at Viktor. He knew that look - the one that said "now or never".
