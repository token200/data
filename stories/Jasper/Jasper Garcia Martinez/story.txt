As a child, Jasper had been fascinated by the way words could evoke emotions and paint vivid pictures. His parents, both literature enthusiasts, encouraged his passion for writing, gifting him a worn copy of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass when he was just eight years old. From that moment on, Jasper was hooked.
