Jasper's heart racing, he made his way through the crowd, his eyes locked on the box. As he approached, a figure slipped away into the shadows. But Jasper was hot on their heels, driven by a determination to solve the case and bring justice to the victims.

In the end, it was Jasper Ming's keen mind and sharp instincts that led him to the thief - a disgruntled former artist seeking revenge against the city he felt had wronged him.
