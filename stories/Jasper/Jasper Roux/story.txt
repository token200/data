Jasper René Roux stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit tavern, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a high-ranking officer in the South African Police Service's Special Task Force, Jasper had seen his fair share of violence and corruption, but this particular case was different.

A local politician had been found dead, with no signs of forced entry or struggle. The only clue was a small note on the desk, bearing the message: "You'll never find me." Jasper's gut told him that this was more than just a simple murder - it was a warning, left by someone who knew exactly how to manipulate the system.

Jasper took a seat at the bar and ordered a whiskey, his mind racing with possibilities. He had been working on this case for weeks, but every lead seemed to end in a dead-end. As he sipped his drink, he noticed a figure in the corner of the room, watching him intently. Jasper's instincts told him that this was the person he needed to talk to.

He walked over to the figure, who looked up as he approached. It was a woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair, dressed in a fitted leather jacket. "Can I help you?" she asked, her voice low and husky.

"My name is Jasper René Roux," he said, his hand extended in greeting. "I'm working on a case involving the death of a local politician. And you are...?"

"I'm Ava Moreno," she replied, taking his hand in hers. "And I might know something about your case."

Jasper's eyes narrowed as he studied her face. There was something about her that didn't add up - but he wasn't quite sure what it was yet. He leaned back in his chair, his eyes locked on hers. "Tell me everything," he said, his voice firm.

Ava smiled, a small smile that hinted at secrets and lies. "Let's just say that I have connections with the kind of people who might be involved in this murder," she said. "And I might be willing to share them... for a price."

Jasper raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. He knew that working with Ava would be a risk - but he also knew that sometimes, taking those risks was necessary to get the job done.
