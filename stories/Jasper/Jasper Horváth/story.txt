Jasper Horváth stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of his estranged sister, Sophia. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and worn leather armchairs, a familiar smell that transported him back to their childhood.

As he waited in line, a young artist caught his eye, scribbling furiously in a notebook as she sipped on a cup of black coffee. Jasper couldn't help but be drawn to her intensity, the way her brow furrowed in concentration as if trying to solve a puzzle. He placed an order for a coffee and slid onto a stool at the counter, watching the artist as she worked.

Sophia Horváth walked in a few minutes later, her hair styled in a messy bob that framed her heart-shaped face. Jasper's gaze met hers, and he felt a flicker of tension. They had been estranged for years, ever since their parents' death in a tragic accident. The memory still lingered, like an open wound.

The artist looked up from her notebook, catching Jasper's eye and offering a warm smile. "Mind if I join you?" she asked, nodding towards the empty stool beside him. Jasper hesitated for a moment before shaking his head, allowing her to take a seat.

As they chatted, Jasper found himself drawn into the artist's world, listening intently as she spoke about her passion for art and the stories behind each piece. The conversation flowed effortlessly, like a river meandering through the countryside.

Sophia slid onto the stool opposite him, her eyes locking onto his with a mixture of sadness and longing. "Jasper Horváth," she whispered, as if using his full name would make the past disappear. He nodded, a small smile creasing his lips, and they sat in silence for a moment, two people navigating their complicated history.

The artist interrupted the spell, asking Jasper about his work – or lack thereof. His own creative pursuits had stalled, like a project left unfinished. The conversation flowed on, a gentle stream that carried them both deeper into the café's depths, where the past and present blurred together.
