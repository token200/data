One day, while wandering through the streets of New Orleans, Finn stumbled upon a small jazz club tucked away on Bourbon Street. The sounds of lively music drew him in, and he decided to step inside for a closer look. That's where he met Emily, a beautiful singer with a voice like honey and gold. Entranced by her performance, Finn couldn't help but take out his camera and snap a few photos, hoping to capture the essence of that magical moment.

As fate would have it, Emily noticed Finn's photography skills and struck up a conversation about art and music. They exchanged numbers, and before long, they were meeting for coffee every week, discussing everything from their creative pursuits to their dreams and aspirations.
