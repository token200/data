Finn Novák stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the bustling streets of Prague's Old Town. As the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the historic buildings, Finn felt a sense of belonging wash over them. This was their city, after all – the place where they had grown up, learned to navigate its winding streets, and made countless memories with friends.

Finn Novák, now in their early twenties, was no longer the wide-eyed teenager they once were. They had grown into a confident young artist, with a passion for capturing the beauty of Prague's architecture on canvas. Tonight, Finn was on their way to meet a potential buyer for one of their pieces – a stunning depiction of Charles Bridge, with its ornate Gothic spires reaching towards the sky.

As they walked, Finn couldn't help but feel a sense of pride in their work. They had spent countless hours perfecting their craft, experimenting with different techniques and styles until they found something that truly felt like them. And now, it seemed, that hard work was starting to pay off. The buyer, a prominent art dealer from Vienna, was said to be impressed by Finn's unique perspective on the city.

Finn Novák turned a corner onto Wenceslas Square, their eyes scanning the crowded street for any sign of their meeting. Suddenly, they spotted the dealer's assistant, a friendly-looking woman with a clipboard and a warm smile. "Ah, Finn! Right on time," she said, holding out her hand for a handshake.

The next hour flew by in a blur as Finn discussed their art, the market, and everything in between. They knew every word, every sentiment, and every question that needed to be asked. It was almost as if they had done this before – which, of course, they had.

When the meeting finally came to an end, Finn Novák felt a sense of accomplishment wash over them. Not just because they had secured a sale, but because they knew that this was just the beginning. They were building a reputation for themselves as a talented young artist, and the world was starting to take notice. As they walked away from the meeting, arm in arm with their friend and confidant, Rachel, Finn felt grateful to be living their dream. And they knew that no matter where life took them next, Finn Novák would always call Prague home.
