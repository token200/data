Finn Koskinen sat at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of papers in front of him. As a renowned detective and owner of Koskinen Investigations, he had seen it all - from petty thefts to high-stakes murders. But despite his years of experience, Finn couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off about this latest case.

The victim, a young woman named Sarah Johnson, had been found dead in her apartment with no signs of forced entry or struggle. The only clue was a small note left on the kitchen counter with the words "I'm watching you" scrawled in red ink. Finn's gut told him that this was no ordinary crime scene.

As he delved deeper into the investigation, Finn discovered that Sarah had been receiving strange letters and phone calls in the weeks leading up to her death. The messages were always unsigned, but they seemed to be hinting at a dark secret from her past. Finns' mind was racing with possibilities - had she been blackmailing someone? Was she involved in something illicit?

Finn Koskinen took a deep breath and focused on the task at hand. He spent hours reviewing the security footage, interviewing witnesses, and scouring Sarah's social media profiles for any clues. But no matter how hard he looked, he couldn't find anything concrete.

Just as Finn was about to call it a day, his phone rang. It was an anonymous caller, speaking in a low, menacing tone. "You're getting close, Koskinen," the voice said. "But you'll never uncover the truth." The line went dead before Finn could respond.

He sat back in his chair, his mind racing with possibilities. Who was this person? And what did they know about Sarah's death? Finns' determination was renewed - he would get to the bottom of this case, no matter what it took. For Sarah Johnson, and for justice.
