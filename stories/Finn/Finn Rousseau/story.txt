Finn Alexander Rousseau was a young and ambitious journalist, known for his fearless approach to storytelling. Born and raised in the vibrant city of New Orleans, Finn had always been drawn to the world of journalism, where he could share the stories of those who needed to be heard.

As a child, Finn spent hours listening to his grandfather's tales of adventure and bravery, which sparked a fire within him that would one day drive him to pursue a career in journalism.
