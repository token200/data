Finn Errani stepped off the last bus of the evening, his eyes scanning the dimly lit streets of New Haven. It was a city that never slept, but for him, it felt like everyone else had already gone home for the night. He yawned, stretching his lean frame as he made his way through the crowds.

As a freelance journalist, Finn had grown accustomed to the late-night rhythms of the city. But tonight felt different. Tonight was the night he'd been working on a story all week – a tip about corruption in the city's government that he knew could shake things up.

He ducked into a small café nearby, the bell above the door jingling as he entered. The air was thick with the smell of stale coffee and yesterday's cigarettes. Finn smiled wryly to himself; this place had seen it all.

"Hey, Finny," the owner, Sal, called out from behind the counter. "You're late again."

Finn chuckled, sliding onto a stool at the bar. "Sorry, Sal. I lost track of time."

Sal shrugged, expertly pouring Finn a steaming cup of coffee. "That's what happens when you're chasing down a story."

The journalist took a sip of his coffee, feeling the caffeine kick in as he began to outline his plan. He'd spend the next few hours poring over documents and making phone calls – trying to verify the tip without raising any suspicions.

As the night wore on, Finn's mind whirred with theories and plot twists. He knew it was a long shot, but sometimes you had to take risks to get the story. And this one felt like it could be big.

Just as he was about to leave, the door swung open once more. A figure slipped inside, shrouded in shadows. Finn's gut tightened; something didn't feel right.

The newcomer slid onto the stool beside him, voice low and gravelly. "Finn Errani. I've been looking for you."

For a moment, they just stared at each other, Finn trying to read the intentions behind those piercing blue eyes. But before he could react, the figure spoke again – with an urgency that sent a shiver down his spine.

"Finn, listen to me. The story you're working on? It's not what you think it is."

And with that, everything changed.
