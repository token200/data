Finn Jensen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. It had been years since she'd last set foot in Ravenswood, but the familiar scent of damp earth and decaying leaves still lingered in the air. Finn's full name, Fenelope Augusta Jensen, echoed through her mind as she made her way to the small café where she'd agreed to meet a friend.

As she pushed open the creaky door, a bell above it rang out, and the proprietor looked up from behind the counter. "Finn! Long time no see!" he exclaimed, setting aside his newspaper.

Finn smiled, taking a seat at the bar. She ordered a cup of black coffee and watched as her friend, Emily, settled into the booth across from her. The two had grown up together, exploring the woods and sharing secrets. Now, as adults, they'd drifted apart, but their friendship remained strong.

Over steaming cups, Emily filled Finn in on the latest news: a new business was opening down by the river, and the town was abuzz with excitement. Finn listened intently, her mind whirling with ideas for her own photography project. She'd always been drawn to capturing the beauty in Ravenswood's overlooked corners – the way the sunlight filtered through the trees, or the intricate patterns of frost on a winter morning.

As they chatted, Emily mentioned her own plans: to take up gardening again, after years away from the hobby. Finn's eyes lit up; she had just the thing for Emily. From her bag, she produced an old camera lens, one she'd salvaged from a recent shoot and was itching to test out.

"You're always so good with plants," Finn said, handing over the lens. "Maybe you can capture their beauty on film?"

Emily's face lit up as she took the lens, inspecting it carefully before nodding. The two friends laughed, the past few years seeming to melt away in that moment. Fenelope Augusta Jensen was at peace, surrounded by the people and places she loved.
