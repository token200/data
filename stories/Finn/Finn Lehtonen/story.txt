Finn Alexander Lehtonen was a 25-year-old Finnish professional ice hockey goaltender who had made a name for himself in the NHL. Born and raised in Helsinki, Finland, Finn grew up playing hockey on the streets and in local leagues, determined to make it to the top.

As a teenager, Finn's talent and work ethic earned him a spot on the national team, where he quickly rose through the ranks. He spent several years honing his craft in Europe, playing for clubs like SK Lehen and KooKoone in Finland, before being scouted by NHL teams.

The Minnesota Wild selected Finn with their first-round pick in the 2015 draft, and he made his professional debut at just 18 years old. Over the next few seasons, Finn established himself as one of the top rookie goaltenders in the league, earning a starting spot in the Wild's lineup and helping the team make a deep playoff run.

As Finn's career took off, so did his international success. He became a key player for Finland at the World Championships, helping his country win two silver medals and earn a spot in the tournament final. His impressive performances earned him a call-up to the Finnish national team's Olympic training camp, where he ultimately made the cut for the 2018 Winter Olympics.

In the years that followed, Finn continued to develop as a player, refining his technique and building his confidence between the pipes. He became known for his exceptional positioning, quick reflexes, and ability to make spectacular saves on game-winning goals.

Despite facing setbacks and injuries along the way, including a serious knee injury in 2019 that kept him out of action for six months, Finn persevered and emerged stronger than ever. In 2021, he signed a lucrative contract extension with the Wild, cementing his status as one of the top goalies in the league.

Throughout his career, Finn Lehtonen remained committed to his Finnish heritage and community, using his platform to raise awareness for important social causes. With his sights set on another season of competition, Finn looked forward to continuing to make his family – including his parents, Sari and Antti, who had supported him every step of the way – proud.
