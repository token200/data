Finn Straume sat at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of files in front of him. As the lead detective on the homicide unit, he had seen his fair share of gruesome crime scenes, but nothing could have prepared him for the latest case.

The victim was a young woman, found strangled in her apartment with no signs of forced entry or struggle. The only clue was a small note left at the scene, bearing a cryptic message that read: "You'll never find me".

Finn Straume rubbed his tired eyes, trying to shake off the fatigue that had been building up all day. He knew he needed to get back into the zone, focus on the details, and find any connection between this victim and the others.

As he began to review the case files, Finn Straume's mind wandered back to his past. Born as Finn Johannsen, but changing his name to Straume after a tumultuous childhood, he had always struggled with identity. But as a detective, he found solace in solving puzzles, unraveling mysteries, and bringing closure to families.

The note on the desk caught his attention again. "You'll never find me". It was almost taunting him, daring him to fail. Finn Straume's competitive streak kicked in, and he became determined to crack this case wide open.

He spent the next few hours interviewing witnesses, scouring the crime scene for any potential leads, and poring over forensic data. Slowly but surely, pieces began to fall into place. A security camera caught a glimpse of someone lurking around the victim's building on the night of the murder, while a suspicious transaction in an online marketplace hinted at a possible connection to the killer.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the city, Finn Straume finally felt like he was closing in on the truth. The game was far from over, but he knew he had taken the first step towards justice for the young victim and her family.

With renewed energy, Finn Straume stood up, straightened his tie, and walked out of the precinct, ready to take on the night ahead, as the intrepid detective Finn Johannsen (now Straume) was determined to bring the perpetrator to justice.
