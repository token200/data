Finn Roberts stepped off the bus and onto the dusty main street of Red Rock, Arizona. He had been driving for hours, and the endless desert landscape was starting to take its toll on his weary eyes. As he stretched his arms and arched his back, a sense of unease crept over him. This wasn't the trip he had planned.

It had started with a cryptic message from an old friend, begging Finn to meet him in Red Rock. The note had been brief, but it was enough to make Finn's curiosity piqued. He had agreed to come, hoping that his friend would have some answers for the questions swirling in his mind.

As he made his way into town, Finn noticed a sense of unease hanging over Red Rock like a cloud. People avoided eye contact, and whispers seemed to follow him as he passed by. He spotted a diner on the corner and decided to grab a cup of coffee, hoping that it might be the spark needed to shake off the feeling of foreboding.

The diner's neon sign read "Mae's Place" and the inside was dimly lit, with only a handful of patrons scattered around the tables. Finn took a seat at the counter and ordered a black coffee. As he sipped his drink, he noticed a figure sitting in the corner, eyeing him with a piercing gaze.

Finn's instincts told him that this was no ordinary stranger. He scanned the diner once more, taking in the rough-around-the-edges patrons and worn-out decor. It was clear that Mae's Place was a place where secrets were kept, and Finn was starting to wonder if he had stumbled into something bigger than himself.

Suddenly, his friend from the message appeared at his side, smiling weakly as he slid onto the stool beside him. "Finn," he said softly, his voice barely audible over the hum of the diner's jukebox. "I'm so glad you made it."

"What is this place?" Finn asked, gesturing to the stranger in the corner.

His friend leaned in close, a whisper escaping his lips as he replied, "This is where the past and present collide, Finn. And I think we're about to find out why."
