Finn Sienkiewicz was a force to be reckoned with in the art world. As a renowned comic book artist and illustrator, he had built a reputation for his unique style and attention to detail. His work on titles such as "Hellblazer" and "Preacher" had garnered widespread critical acclaim, and fans of the genre couldn't get enough of his twisted, surreal creations.

Despite his success, Finn remained humble and dedicated to his craft. He spent countless hours honing his skills, experimenting with new techniques and mediums, and pushing himself to new creative heights. His passion for art was evident in every stroke of his brush or line of his pen, and it showed in the richly detailed, atmospheric worlds he brought to life.

One day, Finn received an offer from a major publishing house to create a graphic novel adaptation of a classic novel.
