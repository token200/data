Oleg López wiped the sweat from his forehead as he surveyed the chaotic scene before him. The small, family-owned restaurant where he worked was in disarray. Orders were being shouted out, pots clanged against the stovetop, and the kitchen staff moved at a frantic pace to keep up.

It had been Oleg's dream to work in this very restaurant since he was a teenager. He spent hours watching the chefs, learning their techniques, and practicing his own recipes. Now, as the sous chef, he felt like he was finally living his dream – but also, incredibly stressed.

The reason for the chaos was the lunch rush. The restaurant was popular with locals and tourists alike, and Oleg knew that if they couldn't deliver on time, they would lose customers. He had been tasked with ensuring that every dish left the kitchen within a 30-minute window, which was easier said than done.

Just then, their head chef, Maria, stormed out of her office. "Oleg, we're running behind! The pastry team is struggling to get the croissants out on time." Oleg's heart sank – he knew exactly how it felt to be under pressure when the pastry team was having a rough day.

He quickly surveyed the kitchen, making adjustments and re-prioritizing tasks. "Alright, let me help!" he shouted to Maria. Together, they set up a new assembly line for the croissants, delegating tasks among the staff and ensuring that each dish left the kitchen on time.

As the lunch rush passed, the restaurant started to breathe a sigh of relief. Orders were completed with minimal delay, and the kitchen was finally quiet once again. Maria patted Oleg on the back as she made her way through the kitchen. "Well done, Oleg! You really saved the day."

For a moment, he smiled – it had been a long and stressful shift, but they had pulled it off together. But then his mind began to wander – what would happen if Maria left the restaurant? He had heard rumors that she was considering retirement after her daughter got married.

As Oleg continued with his tasks, his thoughts turned to the future of the restaurant and the people who worked there. Would he be next in line for head chef, or would someone else take over? For now, though, he just took a deep breath, surveyed the tidy kitchen, and smiled – it was going to be an okay night after all.

Oleg continued working his shift, but his mind kept drifting back to Maria and her retirement plans. It made him realize that change wasn't always something to fear - sometimes it could bring new opportunities for growth.
