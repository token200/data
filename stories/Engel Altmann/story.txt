Engel Altmann trudged through the snow-covered streets, his boots crunching on the frozen crystals. As a renowned detective in Vienna, he had seen it all - the darkest corners of human nature, the most intricate webs of deceit, and the most heart-wrenching tragedies.

But nothing could have prepared him for the phone call that came in on this particular winter's night. A wealthy merchant, Herr Müller, was frantic with worry. His daughter, Sophia, had gone missing, and he suspected foul play.

Engel arrived at the Müller estate, a grandiose mansion perched atop a hill overlooking the city. He was greeted by the distraught merchant, who handed him a photograph of his daughter. Engel studied it intently - Sophia was a beautiful young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair.

As he began questioning Herr Müller's staff, Engel noticed a peculiar lack of enthusiasm from one of the maids. He struck up a conversation with her, learning that she had been working for the Müllers for several years. Her name was Anna, and she seemed genuinely shaken by Sophia's disappearance.

Engel's instincts told him to dig deeper into Anna's alibi. She claimed to have been in her quarters all evening, but when he asked to speak with her directly, she became evasive. He sensed that she was hiding something.

Determined to uncover the truth, Engel paid a visit to Sophia's favorite café on the other side of town. The owner, a friendly woman named Frau Weber, remembered the young woman who had sipped coffee there every day for months. She mentioned that Sophia had been acting strangely in the days leading up to her disappearance, as if she was hiding something.

Engel returned to the Müller estate, where he confronted Anna with his findings. To his surprise, she broke down and confessed - she had seen Sophia arguing with a mysterious stranger at the café earlier that night. The stranger had vanished into the night, leaving behind only a whisper of a word: "Echo".

With this new lead, Engel set out to track down the enigmatic Echo. Hours later, he found himself standing in front of an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. The building loomed over him like a ghostly sentinel.

As he pushed open the creaking door, a chill ran down his spine. Inside, he discovered Sophia's lifeless body, suspended from the rafters by a rusty chain. Engel knew that Echo was more than just a name - it was a person, and she had been playing a twisted game of cat-and-mouse with him.

Engel vowed to bring Echo to justice, but as he gazed upon Sophia's pale face, he couldn't shake off the feeling that this case was far from over. The shadows seemed to be closing in around him, and Engel knew that he would have to dig deeper than ever before to unravel the tangled threads of truth.
