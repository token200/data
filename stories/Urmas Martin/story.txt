Urmas Martin, a man of unassuming appearance, stood at the edge of the frozen lake, gazing out into the void. His weathered boots crunched against the ice as he surveyed the winter landscape. The Estonian wind whipped through his thinning hair, leaving him looking even more rugged.

At 55, Urmas had lived a life marked by hardship and quiet dedication. He worked as an engineer at a local hydroelectric plant, where his hands moved with precision to keep the turbines running smoothly. Few knew that beneath his gruff exterior lay a man who dreamed of exploring the world beyond Estonia's borders.

One evening, while sipping tea in his small cabin on the lake shore, Urmas pulled out a tattered map of the Baltic region. His eyes wandered over the contours of the terrain as he recalled stories of adventure and bravery shared by friends and family members from the past. Among these tales was that of Erich von Stroheim, an Estonian explorer who had mapped much of the region during World War I.

Inspired by his research, Urmas began secretly building a sturdy wooden canoe in his workshop. Winter turned to spring as he worked tirelessly on his project, spending long hours away from work and social duties to see it come together. Finally, after months of effort, the canoe was ready. Its sturdy frame gleamed in the pale sunlight.

The day arrived when Urmas took his new craft onto Lake Peipus, paddling out into the icy waters with a sense of both fear and excitement. The air was crisp as he glided across the lake, feeling alive for the first time in years. With each stroke, he felt himself becoming one with nature – wind whipping through his hair, waves lapping against the shore.

Hours turned into days as Urmas navigated the treacherous currents of the Baltic Sea. The canoe rode the waves like a tiny boat, Urmas gripping its wooden sides tightly. As the sun set on another day, he settled down to sleep, lulled by the sound of the water lapping against his hull.

Urmas Martin was no longer just a quiet engineer or an outsider living at the edge of society – he had discovered himself. He would return home with tales of the vast expanse beyond Estonia's borders and share them with anyone willing to listen.
