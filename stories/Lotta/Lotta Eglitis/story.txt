Lotta Eglitis adjusted her glasses and cleared her throat, surveying the room as she began to speak in a low, husky tone.

With the evidence in hand, Lotta Eglitis knew that she would continue to fight against this evil organization, no matter the cost. For she was Lotta Eglitis, the hacker who refused to be silenced, and she would not rest until justice was served.
