She was captivated by the way the colors blended together, creating a world of its own. By the time she was 10, Lotta had taken up painting herself, teaching herself the basics from her grandmother's lessons.

Her full name, Lotta Isabella Arias, became synonymous with bold, colorful art that captured the essence of Brazil's rich cultural heritage.
