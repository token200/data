His employees admired him for his unwavering commitment to excellence and his willingness to listen to their ideas.

At 10 PM, Rachel gently nudged him awake. "You've been working for hours, Mr. Kalnina," she said with a chuckle. Arthur smiled, still lost in his thoughts. He knew he had earned every moment of it. With a final glance at the proposals, he nodded to himself and headed home, ready to face another day as Arthur Kalnina, CEO and driving force behind one of the world's most innovative companies.
