Arthur Lemoine was a man with a passion for the unconventional. He spent most of his days tinkering in his workshop, surrounded by gears, wires, and scraps of metal. His friends often joked that he was a mad scientist, but Arthur took pride in calling himself an inventor.

As a child, Arthur had always been fascinated by how things worked. He would take apart and reassemble clocks, watches, and even old appliances to understand their inner mechanics. As he grew older, his curiosity only deepened, leading him to pursue a degree in engineering.

After graduating, Arthur landed a job at a prestigious research facility, where he worked on top-secret projects for the government. However, it wasn't long before he felt stifled by the constraints of his job. He yearned for creative freedom and the chance to pursue his own ideas.

One day, Arthur decided to leave the security of his corporate job behind and strike out on his own.
