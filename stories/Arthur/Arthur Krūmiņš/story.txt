I couldn't find any information on the character Arthur Krūmiņš. It's possible that this is a fictional or obscure character, or it may be a mistake.

However, I can suggest some alternatives. If you could provide more context or details about who Arthur Krūmiņš is and what kind of story you would like to hear, I would be happy to try and assist you.

Alternatively, if you would like me to create a completely original story featuring a character named Arthur Krūmiņš, I can do that as well. Please let me know which option you prefer.
