Arthur Errani stepped into the dimly lit bar, his eyes scanning the room with an air of quiet confidence. The bartender, a gruff but kind-hearted man named Max, looked up from polishing a glass and raised an eyebrow.

"What can I get you, Arthur?" he asked, knowing full well that it wouldn't be a simple order.

Arthur smiled wryly and slid onto a stool, his eyes locking onto the whiskey decanter. "The usual," he replied, his voice low and smooth.

Max nodded and poured him a generous shot. As he handed it over, Arthur tossed a few coins into the tip jar and settled in for the evening. It wasn't often that people came to visit him at the bar, but when they did, it was always an event.

Arthur's past was shrouded in mystery, even to those who claimed to know him best. Few people knew that he had once been a member of an elite special forces unit, or that he had spent years working undercover to bring down corrupt governments and organizations.

But one thing was certain: Arthur Errani was a man with a reputation for getting things done. And tonight was no exception.

As the night wore on, a hooded figure slid onto the stool beside him, their eyes fixed intently on Arthur's face. The air grew thick with tension as the two men sized each other up, neither one willing to back down.

"What do you want?" Arthur asked finally, his voice dripping with sarcasm.

The hooded figure pushed back its cloak, revealing a woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. "I have information," she said, her voice husky and confident. "Information that could change everything."

Arthur's expression remained neutral, but his mind was racing. What kind of information could this woman possibly possess? And what did it have to do with him?

The woman leaned in closer, her breath whispering against Arthur's ear. "Meet me outside," she whispered. "We need to talk."

With that, she slid off the stool and vanished into the night, leaving Arthur Errani to ponder the mystery of the whiskey-smelling stranger.
