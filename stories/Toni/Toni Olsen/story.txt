Toni Olsen stepped into the dimly lit alleyway, her eyes scanning the rooftops for any sign of movement. As a former hitwoman, she had seen it all - the thrill of the job, the rush of adrenaline, and the devastating consequences that came with it. But after one too many near-misses, Toni had decided to hang up her guns and start anew.

Or so she thought.

Now, as she stood in this deserted alleyway, Toni couldn't shake off the feeling that someone was watching her. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she pulled out her phone and dialed a familiar number - that of her old boss, Victor.

"Toni, what do you want?" Victor's voice crackled over the line, his tone as cold as the winter night outside.

"I need your help, Vic," Toni said, her voice low and steady. "I've been getting some... unwanted attention. I think someone knows my true identity."

Victor snorted. "You mean the whole 'you're a hitwoman' thing? Relax, Toni. You thought that was just a fantasy. It's not like you can just walk away from it."

Toni sighed, feeling a familiar sense of frustration. "I did walk away, Vic. But now I'm back. And I need your help to stay alive."

There was a pause on the other end of the line before Victor spoke up. "Alright, fine. I'll send someone over. But you have to promise me one thing: you have to keep your mouth shut."

Toni hesitated for a moment before nodding in agreement. She knew that with Victor, you had to be careful what you said - and when.

Twenty minutes later, the sound of footsteps echoed through the alleyway as Victor's enforcer, Viktor, emerged from the shadows. He was a hulking mass of muscle and menace, his eyes fixed intently on Toni.

"Time for a little lesson, kid," Viktor growled, his voice low and menacing.

Toni swallowed hard, feeling her heart rate spike with fear. She knew that she was in over her head now - but she also knew that she couldn't back down. Not yet, at least.

As Viktor began to circle around her, Toni steeled herself for what was to come. She had thought she left this life behind, but it seemed that some wounds ran too deep.
