Toni Li was a woman of mystery and intrigue. With piercing green eyes and raven-black hair, she seemed to embody the very essence of Shanghai's underbelly. A street-smart thief with a quick wit and quicker fingers, Toni had made a name for herself on the city's most exclusive nights.

By day, Toni posed as a timid shopgirl at her family's small bakery in the French Concession. But by night, she donned a black leather jacket and set out to relieve the wealthy of their most prized possessions. With an uncanny ability to blend into the shadows, Toni would swoop in like a thief, leaving behind only whispers of her exploits.

One fateful evening, Toni received an offer from a mysterious client that could change everything. He proposed a heist of the century: stealing the priceless Jade Dragon pendant from the collector's mansion on the banks of the Huangpu River. The catch? The necklace was said to be cursed, and anyone who dared to touch it would be forever changed.

Undaunted by the risks, Toni accepted the challenge. She spent weeks casing the mansion, studying the security systems and waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Finally, on a moonless night in late spring, she put her plan into action.

With the help of an old acquaintance – a skilled hacker known only as "Zero Cool" – Toni infiltrated the mansion's defenses and made her way to the display case where the Jade Dragon pendant lay waiting. As she reached out to claim it, a sudden chill ran down her spine, and for an instant, she felt an inexplicable connection to the ancient relic.

Toni snatched the pendant from its velvet bed, feeling an electric thrill run through her veins. But as she turned to leave, she caught a glimpse of herself in a nearby mirror – and was shocked by the eyes that stared back. They were no longer green, but a deep, shimmering gold – the color of the Jade Dragon itself.

For a moment, Toni felt like she had been transformed. She knew then that the curse was real, and that her life would never be the same again. As she slipped out into the night, the pendant clutched tightly in her hand, Toni Li vanished into the shadows, leaving behind only whispers of a legend – one that would haunt her forevermore.
