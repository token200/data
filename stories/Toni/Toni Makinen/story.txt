With his team of experts in tow, including linguist Dr. Maria Rodriguez and photographer Jari Väisänen, Toni set off into the unforgiving landscape. As they trekked through the snow-covered terrain, Toni marveled at the sheer scale of the glacier, its icy peaks stretching as far as the eye could see.
