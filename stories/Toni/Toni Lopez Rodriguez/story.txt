She had worked multiple part-time jobs while pursuing her degree in journalism, determined to make a name for herself.

As she began her new role at the newspaper, Toni was eager to prove herself. She spent long hours researching stories and interviewing sources, pouring over notes and ideas until they were ready to be written. Her dedication paid off when she landed an exclusive interview with a prominent local politician, who agreed to speak candidly about his plans for the community.
