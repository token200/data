Her exploits were whispered about in hushed tones by fellow thieves and law enforcement alike, with some regarding her as a legend.

Born into a family of modest means, Toni's love for thievery was ignited at a young age. She began small, stealing from local markets to support her struggling family. However, as she grew older, her ambitions shifted toward the more lucrative and complex heists.
