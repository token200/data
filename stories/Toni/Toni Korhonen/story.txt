Toni Korhonen sat alone in his small Helsinki apartment, staring at the worn-out map of Finland on the wall. He rubbed his tired eyes, trying to shake off the feeling of restlessness that had been building up for months. As a freelance journalist, he had been chasing stories all over the country, but nothing seemed to capture his attention like this latest lead.

Toni's phone buzzed, snapping him out of his reverie. He picked it up, and his colleague, Emma, was on the other end, her voice laced with excitement. "Toni, I've got some news that might interest you! The old sawmill in Kaipionniemi is rumored to be haunted."

Toni's ears perked up at the mention of a mystery. He had always been fascinated by tales of the supernatural and the unexplained. As he listened to Emma's description of the sawmill, his mind began racing with possibilities.

He packed his bag, grabbed his camera, and set off towards Kaipionniemi, determined to uncover the truth behind the haunting. The drive was scenic, winding through rolling hills and dense forests, but Toni's focus remained fixed on his destination.

As he arrived at the sawmill, a chill ran down his spine. The building loomed before him, its wooden beams weathered to a soft gray that seemed almost otherworldly in the fading light. Toni hesitated for a moment, then stepped inside.

The air was thick with the scent of wood and decay, but it was alive with an eerie energy. He wandered through the empty rooms, his footsteps echoing off the walls as he searched for any sign of paranormal activity. It wasn't long before he felt a presence watching him â€“ a low hum in the back of his mind that seemed to grow louder by the minute.

Suddenly, a faint whisper seemed to caress his ear: "Leave now." Toni spun around, but there was no one there. He turned back to face the door, but as he did, it swung shut, trapping him inside.

For what felt like an eternity, Toni waited, frozen with anticipation. And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, everything stopped. The whisper ceased, the air stillness returned, and the wooden beams seemed once again to be ordinary. As he stumbled out into the night, blinking in the bright moonlight, Toni knew that this was only the beginning of a story worth telling.
