Orsolya Fontaine stood at the edge of the bustling market, her eyes scanning the vibrant stalls with a mixture of curiosity and disdain. As a member of the wealthy and influential Fontaine family, she was accustomed to luxury and refinement, but there was something about this particular gathering that felt...tacky.

A flutter in her corseted waist caught her attention as she spotted a young man, his dark hair messy and his eyes shining with a hint of desperation. He seemed out of place among the high-society crowd, and Orsolya found herself drawn to him despite herself.

As she watched, he haggled with a vendor over the price of a small, intricately carved wooden box. The vendor eventually relented, handing the young man a few coins in exchange for the prized item. Orsolya felt a pang of admiration for his tenacity.

"Excuse me," she said, her voice dripping with haughtiness as she descended from the stairs. "I couldn't help but notice...that remarkable wooden box you just acquired."

The young man turned, his eyes locking onto hers with an unnerving intensity. "Ah, yes! I'm a collector, you see," he replied, his voice low and smooth. "And that particular piece is one of my finds – worth a small fortune."

Orsolya raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite herself. "I would very much like to know more about it," she said, her interest piqued.

The young man hesitated for a moment before producing the box from his pocket and opening it, revealing the intricate carvings that had caught Orsolya's eye earlier. As she reached out a gloved hand to touch the delicate workmanship, he smiled – a flash of genuine warmth in an otherwise chilly demeanor.

"Tell me," Orsolya said, her voice softer now, "how did you come by this piece?"

The young man's eyes seemed to cloud over for an instant before clearing. "Let's just say it came with its...price," he replied. "But I assure you, the craftsmanship is worth far more than any amount of coin."

Orsolya studied him, sensing a depth to his words that belied his rough exterior. There was something about this young man – perhaps even someone like him? – that spoke directly to her own restless sense of discontent with her privileged existence.

"I see," she said finally, tucking the box away in her reticule. "Well, I suppose we'll have to keep an eye out for each other, collector and collector alike."

The young man smiled once more before turning to rejoin the crowd, leaving Orsolya with a sense of restlessness that would stay with her long after she left the market behind.
