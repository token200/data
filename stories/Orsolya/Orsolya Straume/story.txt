Orsolya Straume stepped into the grand hall, her long, dark hair cascading down her back like a waterfall of night. As the eldest daughter of the noble Straume family, she was accustomed to being the center of attention. Her piercing green eyes scanned the room, locking onto the familiar faces of her family and friends.

Orsolya Straume's reputation as a skilled healer and apothecary preceded her, and many had come to seek her counsel on matters of health and wellness. She smiled graciously as she made her way through the crowd, shaking hands and exchanging warm words with those who sought her assistance.

As she reached the front of the hall, Orsolya Straume's gaze fell upon a young woman, huddled in the corner with a look of desperation etched on her face. The girl was pale and clammy, clutching a small, intricately carved wooden box to her chest. Orsolya Straume's curiosity was piqued, and she made her way over to the girl.

"Please, milady," the girl begged, "you have to help me. I've tried everything – potions, salves, even prayer – but nothing seems to work. My sister passed away just a fortnight ago, and I'm consumed by grief."

Orsolya Straume's expression softened as she took in the girl's distress. She gently prised open the wooden box, revealing a small, glowing crystal nestled within. The air around them seemed to vibrate with an otherworldly energy.

"I think I can help you," Orsolya Straume said, her voice low and soothing. "This crystal is one of my most powerful remedies. It will absorb your sorrow and transform it into something nourishing."

With gentle hands, Orsolya Straume took the crystal from the girl and placed it on a nearby altar. As she did so, a warm light began to emanate from the stone, filling the room with an aura of hope and renewal. The young woman's eyes widened in amazement as she felt her grief begin to lift, replaced by a sense of peace and calm.

Orsolya Straume watched over her, a small smile playing on her lips. She knew that her work was far from over – there would be many more souls to guide and comfort – but for now, she was content to bask in the knowledge that she had made a difference in someone's life.
