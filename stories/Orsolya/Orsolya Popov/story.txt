Determined to get to the bottom of these stories, Orsolya started to investigate the connections between them.

Her research led her to a surprising discovery: a web of deceit that went all the way to the top of Hungarian politics. The implications were explosive, and Orsolya knew she had to act fast to get her story out to the public before it was too late.
