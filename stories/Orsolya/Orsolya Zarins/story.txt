Orsolya Zarins stood alone on the windswept cliffside, her long dark hair whipping around her face like a wild tangle of vines. She closed her eyes and breathed in deeply, feeling the salty air fill her lungs as she gazed out at the vast expanse of ocean stretching before her.

As the daughter of a wealthy merchant, Orsolya had always been expected to conform to societal norms – to marry well, raise children, and manage the family business with an iron fist. But Orsolya's restless spirit yearned for more. She was drawn to the sea, to the freedom and adventure that lay beyond the confines of her privileged life.

As she stood there, lost in thought, a faint cry echoed across the water – a sound that sent shivers down Orsolya's spine. She opened her eyes, scanning the horizon until she spotted a small boat making its way towards the shore. A young woman, dressed in tattered sailcloth and clinging to a tattered rope, was being pulled towards the waves by the strong current.

Without hesitation, Orsolya sprinted down the cliffside and plunged into the icy water, wading out to meet the struggling swimmer. Together, they fought against the undertow, finally pulling the young woman to safety just as the waves crashed over their heads.

The woman's eyes, sunken and desperate, locked onto Orsolya's face, and for a moment, Orsolya saw her own reflection staring back – a glimmer of recognition that spoke volumes. In that instant, Orsolya knew she had to take a stand against the expectations placed upon her.

"Come with me," she said, offering the woman her hand. "We'll find you shelter and safety. You're not alone anymore."

The young woman's gaze faltered, but as Orsolya pulled her towards the shore, something sparked within her – a spark that would ignite the flame of rebellion within Orsolya Zarins' own heart.
