Orsolya White stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. She had been traveling for hours, escaping the confines of her family's estate in the north. The memories that lingered in every corner of those halls still haunted her.

As a child, Orsolya had been treated like a fragile doll by her parents, forced to conform to their expectations of a proper lady. But she had grown restless, yearning for adventure and freedom. Her escape was a whispered secret among the servants, who had helped her gather what little money she could and slip away unnoticed.

Now, Orsolya stood at the edge of a new world, one that seemed both vast and intimidating. The stationmaster eyed her with curiosity as she gathered her small suitcase and began to make her way through the crowd.

She took in the sights and sounds of the bustling market square, her senses overwhelmed by the cacophony of vendors and hawkers. Orsolya wandered aimlessly, lost in thought as she navigated the narrow alleys and courtyards.

Eventually, she found herself standing before a small, unassuming building with a sign creaking in the gentle breeze: 'The Red Griffin Inn'. A warm smile spread across her face as she pushed open the door, ushered by the sound of laughter and clinking glasses.

 Inside, Orsolya was greeted by a jovial barkeep who introduced himself as Jack. He offered her a seat at the fire-lit counter, where she listened with rapt attention as he spun tales of adventure and bravery on the roads beyond. Her own stories remained locked away, hidden behind a mask of propriety.

For the first time in years, Orsolya felt like herself – untethered, unscripted. She laughed alongside the other patrons, sharing a drink or two as Jack regaled her with tales of bandits and brave heroes. For one fleeting moment, she forgot about the expectations that had once bound her.

Orsolya finished her drink, her gaze drifting out into the night, where stars twinkled like diamonds scattered across the sky. A small, daring heart beat within her chest, whispering secrets only she could hear. The Red Griffin Inn had become a refuge – not just for a weary traveler, but for a restless spirit seeking her place in this vast, untamed world.
