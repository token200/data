Orsolya Jian stood at the edge of the bustling market, her eyes scanning the vibrant stalls with a mix of curiosity and disdain. As a member of the esteemed Jian family, she was accustomed to luxury and refinement, but there was something about this particular gathering that drew her in.

A young boy, no more than ten years old, caught her attention as he expertly juggled a trio of brightly colored balls while executing an intricate dance routine. Orsolya Jian watched, transfixed, as the child's feet moved with a fluidity she had never seen before. The crowd around him cheered and clapped, but she remained still, mesmerized.

As the performance concluded, the boy approached her, beaming with pride. "Thank you, miss! I'm Kaito, by the way." Orsolya Jian smiled, intrigued by his confidence. She reached into her pocket and pulled out a small note, scribbled with a few hastily drawn strokes. "For your next performance," she said, handing it to him.

Kaito's eyes widened as he took in the intricate designs, recognizing some of the patterns from the stories her grandmother used to tell her. "This is beautiful!" he exclaimed. Orsolya Jian chuckled, pleased that she had caught his attention. "Tell me, Kaito, what inspired you to become a performer?"

Kaito's face lit up as he began to speak about his love of storytelling and movement. As they talked, Orsolya Jian found herself drawn into the world he was creating – one of imagination and possibility. She realized that this young boy, with all his energy and enthusiasm, reminded her of a younger version of herself.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm glow over the market, Orsolya Jian knew it was time to leave. But as she turned to walk away, Kaito called out after her, "Thank you again, Miss Jian! I'll make sure to practice even harder!" The note he had taken from her remained clutched in his hand, a symbol of the connection they shared – one that transcended social status and family legacy.
