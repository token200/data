Orsolya Hansen stood at the edge of the old dock, her eyes fixed on the worn wooden pilings that jutted out into the harbor. She had always felt a sense of peace here, as if the sea breeze and the rhythmic lapping of the waves against the shore could calm even the most turbulent of minds.

As she gazed out at the water, Orsolya's thoughts wandered back to her childhood. Growing up on this very dock, watching the fishermen bring in their catch and listening to the salty tales they told around the fire, had sparked a love of adventure within her. She spent hours as a young girl listening to the stories of the sailors who came ashore, and she dreamed of one day setting sail herself.

Years went by, and Orsolya grew into a skilled sailor, working on merchant ships and exploring the world's oceans. But as the years took their toll, she found herself drawn back to this small dock, where the memories of her childhood swirled like the seaweed in the tide pools below.

Now, at the age of sixty-five, Orsolya had retired from sailing, but her love for the sea remained strong. She spent her days tending to the old wooden pilings, making sure they didn't rot or shift with the tides. It was a quiet life, but one that brought her a sense of contentment.

As she worked, Orsolya noticed an unfamiliar face approaching her along the dock. A young girl, no more than ten years old, with a wild mane of curly brown hair and eyes that sparkled like the sea itself.

"Hi," the girl said, looking up at Orsolya with wonder. "I'm Sophie. I've been watching you from across the water."

Orsolya smiled, feeling a sense of nostalgia wash over her. "And I've been watching you," she replied. "You have the look of a sailor in you. Would you like to hear some stories about the sea?"

Sophie's eyes widened with excitement as Orsolya settled into the chair beside the pilings, the old wooden creaking beneath her weight. And so, the two sat down together, surrounded by the whispers of the past and the endless expanse of the ocean before them.
