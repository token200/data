Orsolya Hébert was known for her fiery personality and sharp wit in the small town of Ravenswood, where everyone seemed to know each other's business. As a journalist, she had built a reputation for herself as a fiercely independent and fearless investigator, always on the lookout for the next big story.

One stormy evening, Orsolya Hébert walked into the local pub, shaking off the rain that clung to her long, dark coat. The patrons turned their heads in recognition as she made her way to the bar, where the bartender greeted her with a nod.

"What can I get you, Orsolya?" he asked, his voice gruff from years of smoking and listening to tales of the town's history.

"Just a whiskey, neat," she replied, sliding a few coins across the counter. As she waited for her drink, she noticed a peculiar-looking individual sitting in the corner, eyeing her with an unnerving intensity.

The man, dressed in worn leather and sporting a scruffy beard, seemed out of place among the rowdy patrons of the pub. Orsolya Hébert couldn't help but feel a sense of unease as their eyes met across the room.

Just then, the storm outside intensified, causing the lights to flicker ominously. The stranger stood up, his movements fluid and deliberate, as if he was waiting for something to happen. Orsolya Hébert felt a shiver run down her spine, but she refused to back down.

As the night wore on, she found herself drawn into a conversation with the enigmatic stranger, who introduced himself only as "Jack." Over whiskey and cigarettes, they discussed everything from Ravenswood's dark history to their shared passion for true crime stories.

For Orsolya Hébert, it was like stumbling upon an old friend – someone who understood her fascination with the darker side of life. As she left the pub that night, Jack's parting words still echoed in her mind: "Meet me at the old windmill on the outskirts of town at midnight. Come alone."

Orsolya Hébert smiled to herself as she disappeared into the stormy darkness, her curiosity piqued and her journalistic instincts on high alert. She couldn't wait to see what other secrets Ravenswood held, and who might be willing to share them with her.
