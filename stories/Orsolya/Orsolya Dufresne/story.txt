Orsolya Dufresne strolled through the misty streets of Versailles, her silk gown rustling against the wet stones. As the mistress of the grand estate, she had grown accustomed to the whispers and glances that followed her everywhere. But on this particular morning, she felt a sense of restlessness, a feeling that she was trapped in a world not of her own making.

As she approached the Hall of Mirrors, the soft glow of candelabras illuminated her face, casting an otherworldly light upon it. Orsolya's eyes seemed to hold a thousand secrets, and those who gazed upon them couldn't help but feel drawn in by their depths. She paused before the mirror, running a gloved hand over the delicate porcelain frame that held her reflection.

"Good morning, Madame Dufresne," said the voice behind her.

Orsolya turned to face her loyal lady-in-waiting, Camille. The young woman's eyes sparkled with curiosity as she watched Orsolya's gaze linger on her own image.

"What do you seek, Camille?" Orsolya asked, a hint of wistfulness in her voice.

"I sought your counsel, Madame," Camille replied, bowing low. "There is one who wishes to speak with you – the Duc de Bourbon."

Orsolya's face paled slightly at the mention of his name. The Duc was notorious for his cunning and ambition, and Orsolya had long been wary of his intentions towards her.

"I will receive him," she said finally, her voice steady once more.

As Camille departed to escort the Duc to the receiving room, Orsolya couldn't help but feel a sense of foreboding. She knew that this meeting would be no ordinary one – for it held within it the promise of power, and perhaps even the key to her freedom.

With each step, she felt herself drawn into a labyrinth of intrigue, where allegiances were forged and broken with equal ease. Orsolya's eyes sparkled with a fierce inner light as she approached the door, ready to face whatever lay ahead – for in this treacherous world of Versailles, she was determined to emerge unscathed.

The door creaked open beneath her hand, revealing the Duc de Bourbon himself, his eyes glinting like polished onyx. Orsolya's heart quickened as she extended a gloved hand, sealing their fate and setting in motion a dance of power that would change the course of her life forever.
