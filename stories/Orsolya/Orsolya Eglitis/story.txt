Orsolya Eglitis stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. She had been traveling for days, and finally, she was here – in the small town of Riga, Latvia, where her great-aunts had lived during the war.

As a historian specializing in Eastern European conflicts, Orsolya had spent years researching the experiences of Latvian Jews during World War II. Her great-aunts, Rachel and Helena Eglitis, had survived the ghetto, the concentration camps, and even the partisans' network that helped smuggle Jews to safety.

Orsolya had always been fascinated by their stories, but it wasn't until she stumbled upon an old diary hidden away in her grandmother's attic that she felt a deep connection to her ancestors. The diary belonged to Rachel Eglitis, one of Orsolya's great-aunts, and it told the tale of a young girl who had lost everything – her family, her home, and her innocence.

As Orsolya made her way through the narrow streets of Riga, she couldn't help but feel a sense of sadness. The city was beautiful, with its Baroque architecture and picturesque canals, but it held memories of pain and loss. She visited the sites where her great-aunts had lived, the ghetto where they were imprisoned, and even the concentration camp where they had been separated from their families.

At night, Orsolya would sit in cafes, surrounded by locals who spoke little English, yet seemed willing to share their stories with a curious stranger. They told her about the war's impact on Latvian society – how it had brought people together, and torn them apart.

One evening, as she sipped coffee at a quaint corner cafe, Orsolya spotted an elderly woman who looked uncannily like her great-aunt Rachel. The woman smiled when their eyes met, and in that moment, Orsolya felt a connection to this stranger – a sense of shared history, of understanding.

"Hello," the old woman said, with a warm voice. "I'm Sofia."

Orsolya smiled back, feeling a spark of recognition. "I'm Orsolya Eglitis."
