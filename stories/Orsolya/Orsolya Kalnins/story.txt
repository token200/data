Orsolya Kalnins stepped into the crowded café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him across the table, sipping on a cup of coffee and staring out the window. It had been months since they last saw each other, but Orsolya's mind still lingered on his warm smile and piercing blue eyes.

She slid into the seat beside him, exchanging a gentle touch on his arm before taking her own seat. "Long time no see," she said softly, trying to gauge his mood.

Kalnins turned to her, his expression guarded but not unfriendly. "Orsolya. It's good to see you too." He paused, collecting his thoughts before continuing. "I've been thinking about you a lot lately."

Orsolya's heart skipped a beat at the admission. She had hoped he would feel the same way. They had shared so many memories together – laughter and tears, late-night conversations and wild adventures. But life had taken them in different directions, leaving them apart for far too long.

As they chatted, Orsolya couldn't help but notice the way Kalnins seemed to be holding himself back. The same easy charm that drew her to him was now tempered with a hint of reserve. She wondered what had changed him – had he found someone new? Was it something deeper?

Their conversation meandered through topics they used to discuss, but now felt like old habits. Orsolya tried to push past her own feelings, focusing on catching up and reconnecting with this piece of her past. Still, as the hours slipped by, she couldn't shake off the sensation that a part of him was still missing – that he was still holding onto something just out of reach.

As they prepared to leave, Orsolya reached across the table once more, this time grasping his hand in hers. It felt like an eternity since their hands had last touched. "I'm glad we met up," she said softly. Kalnins smiled back at her, but Orsolya could see a flicker of something deeper – a longing for connection that seemed to still linger between them.
