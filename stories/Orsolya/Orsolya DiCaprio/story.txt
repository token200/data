I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Orsolya DiCaprio. The name appears to be a combination of two famous individuals, Orsola Cole-Brennan (an Irish fashion designer) and Leonardo DiCaprio (an American actor).

However, I can create a new story based on the names. Here's a 400-word short story about Orsolya DiCaprio:

Orsolya DiCaprio was a free-spirited artist with a passion for sustainability and social justice. Born in Dublin, Ireland, she grew up surrounded by the city's vibrant music scene and eclectic art crowd. Her mother, an activist, had instilled in her a sense of compassion and activism from a young age.

After studying fine art at Trinity College, Orsolya moved to Los Angeles to pursue her dreams as an artist. She quickly became known for her unique blend of folk art and eco-friendly designs, which often incorporated recycled materials and sustainable practices.

Orsolya's big break came when she collaborated with Leonardo DiCaprio on a charity project to raise awareness about ocean conservation. The two had met at a high-profile gala, and Orsolya was thrilled to have the chance to work with one of her heroes.

As they worked together, Orsolya shared her knowledge of sustainable practices and creative solutions for reducing waste in the fashion industry. Leonardo DiCaprio was impressed by her expertise and enthusiasm, and soon, their collaboration led to the creation of a new clothing line using environmentally-friendly materials.

The collection, dubbed "EcoVibes," quickly gained popularity among eco-conscious consumers. Orsolya's designs were not only stylish but also told an important story about reducing our impact on the planet.

As the brand grew, so did Orsolya's influence in the art world and beyond. She became a vocal advocate for social justice and environmental causes, using her platform to raise awareness and drive change.

Years later, when asked about her journey, Orsolya smiled and said, "My mother always told me that art has the power to create positive change. I'm just trying to live up to that legacy."
