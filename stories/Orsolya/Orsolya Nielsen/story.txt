Orsolya Nielsen stood alone on the windswept beach, her long dark hair whipping wildly in the gale force wind. As the last rays of sunlight faded over the horizon, she felt a sense of melancholy wash over her. It had been ten years since her parents' passing, and yet the pain still lingered.

Orsolya's eyes scanned the horizon, her gaze lost in thought as she wondered what her life would have been like if they were still with her. Her mother, Sofia, had been a kind soul, always putting others before herself, while her father, Mikael, had been a free spirit, always chasing his dreams.

As the stars began to twinkle in the night sky, Orsolya felt a sense of peace settle over her. She took a deep breath, letting the salty air fill her lungs, and closed her eyes. The sound of the waves crashing against the shore was like music to her ears, soothing her soul.

She thought back to her childhood, growing up in this small coastal town, where everyone knew each other's stories. Orsolya had always felt like an outsider, a stranger in her own home. But her parents had loved her with all their hearts, and she knew they were still with her, watching over her from wherever they were.

As the night wore on, Orsolya decided to take a walk along the beach, feeling the sand beneath her feet and the wind in her hair. She felt free, unencumbered by the burdens of the world. The stars above seemed to be singing a lullaby just for her, and she let their melody wash over her like a balm.

Orsolya Nielsen knew that life would always be hard, but in this moment, she felt at peace. She was exactly where she was meant to be, standing on the edge of the world, with nothing but the sea stretching out before her. And as she walked into the darkness, she knew that her parents would be right behind her, guiding her through the shadows, their love shining like a beacon in the night.
