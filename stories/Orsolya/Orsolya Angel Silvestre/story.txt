Orsolya Angel Silvestre stepped out onto the sun-drenched streets of Rio de Janeiro, her long black hair fluttering in the gentle breeze.

The man smiled, revealing a hint of menace beneath his polished facade. "I represent...a mutual acquaintance," he said, his eyes glinting with warning. Orsolya Angel Silvestre's instincts prickled, but she kept her expression neutral, waiting to see where this new development would lead.
