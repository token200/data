Orsolya Zariņa stepped out of her small apartment and onto the bustling streets of Riga, Latvia's capital city. As a historian and researcher, she had spent years studying the country's complex past, but it was the stories of everyday people like herself that truly fascinated her.

With her curly brown hair tied back in a ponytail and a pair of wire-rimmed glasses perched on the end of her nose, Orsolya made her way to the local market. She had an appointment with a elderly woman who claimed to have known her great-grandmother, and Orsolya was determined to learn more about her family's history.

As she walked through the stalls, Orsolya sampled local delicacies like cepelinai (zeppelins) and svėnčias sūris (sour milk soup), chatting with the vendors in broken Latvian. She had always been proud of her heritage, but there was still so much she didn't know.

Finally, Orsolya arrived at the agreed meeting point - a small park on the outskirts of town. A frail woman with silver hair and a kind smile greeted her warmly, introducing herself as Elza. As they sat down on a bench, Elza began to tell Orsolya stories about her great-grandmother, who had lived through two world wars and witnessed some of Latvia's most tumultuous periods.

Orsolya listened intently, taking notes and asking questions. She was determined to capture every detail of these stories, knowing that they would help to flesh out the history she was writing about. As the sun began to set, casting a warm glow over the park, Orsolya thanked Elza for her time and promised to return soon.

Over the next few weeks, Orsolya returned to visit Elza several times, learning more about her family's experiences during World War II and the Soviet occupation. With each conversation, she felt like she was unraveling a thread that would eventually weave together into a rich tapestry of Latvian history. And it was all thanks to the stories of people like Elza, who had lived through some of the most turbulent times in their country's history.
