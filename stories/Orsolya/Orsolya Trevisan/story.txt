Orsolya Trevisan stood at the edge of the bustling market square, her eyes scanning the vibrant stalls and shoppers with an air of quiet confidence. As a master artisan and daughter of the esteemed Trevisan family, she had grown accustomed to the weight of expectation that came with being a member of one of Florence's most respected families.

Orsolya's fingers danced across the delicate pattern on her cloak, a subtle reminder of the intricate embroidery that would soon adorn the robes of the Medicis. Her mother, Lucrezia Trevisan, had taught her the art of needlework when she was just a child, and now Orsolya was renowned for her exquisite creations.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the market square, Orsolya made her way through the crowds, her long strides eating up the distance. She had promised her brother, Alessandro Trevisan, that she would meet him at the Oltrarno canal by sundown. He had been working tirelessly in his family's leather workshop all day, and Orsolya knew he needed a break.

As she approached the water's edge, she spotted Alessandro leaning against the stone wall, his eyes fixed on the rippling surface of the canal. "Orsolya!" he exclaimed, pushing off from the wall to join her. Together they strolled along the canal's edge, watching as the stars began to twinkle in the evening sky.

They talked little, but Orsolya sensed a tension beneath Alessandro's relaxed demeanor. Her brother had always been driven by a desire to prove himself, to live up to their family's legacy. She knew that his latest commission – a set of elaborate gloves for the Medicis' youngest son – was testing him at every turn.

As they reached the end of the canal, Orsolya placed a gentle hand on Alessandro's arm. "You will do beautifully, fratello," she said softly. "Just remember to enjoy the process." And with that, she turned and disappeared into the night, leaving her brother to ponder her words as he continued his work.
