Weronika Fernández González sat at her desk, staring blankly at the computer screen in front of her. She was a freelance writer, and had been working on her latest article for what felt like hours. But every time she tried to focus, her mind wandered back to the argument she had with her sister earlier that day.

Weronika's sister, María, was always getting under her skin. Their parents had passed away when they were young, and María had become the caregiver for their ailing mother. Weronika felt like she was shouldering all of the responsibility, while María got to enjoy the fruits of their labor.

As she sat at her desk, trying to come up with ideas for her article, Weronika's mind began to wander back to their childhood. She and María had always been close, but as they grew older, they started to drift apart. Their parents' death had brought them closer together again, but the tension between them was still palpable.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was her best friend, Sofía. "Hey, girl, what's going on?" Sofía asked, flopping down into the chair across from Weronika's desk.

Weronika sighed and rubbed her temples. "I don't know, I just can't seem to focus on anything right now. María is driving me crazy."

Sofía nodded sympathetically. "I know how you feel. But sometimes, taking a break from the situation can help clear your head. Why don't we take a walk outside?"

Weronika hesitated for a moment before standing up and following Sofía out of the house. As they walked through the quiet streets, Weronika felt her tension start to dissipate. They talked about everything except their argument with María, and Weronika found herself laughing and forgetting all about it.

When they returned to the house, Weronika sat back down at her desk with a renewed sense of purpose. She started typing away, the words flowing easily onto the page. As she wrote, she realized that maybe her sister wasn't so bad after all. Maybe their differences were what made them strong.

The article was finally finished, and Weronika felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. She sent it off to the editor, feeling hopeful that it would be accepted. And as she sat back in her chair, she knew that no matter what happened with María, she had found a way to move forward and make peace with their complicated past.

With a contented sigh, Weronika leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes, letting the calm wash over her. She knew that life was full of ups and downs, but for now, everything felt right.
