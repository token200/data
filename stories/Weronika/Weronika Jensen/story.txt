Weronika Jensen sat alone in her small, cluttered apartment, staring blankly at the wall as tears streamed down her face. She had just received news that her mother, who she had been living with for the past year after a painful divorce, had passed away suddenly.

As she gazed out the window, memories of happier times flooded her mind. Weronika's mother had always been there for her, offering words of encouragement and support when she needed it most. She remembered how her mother would take her to the beach on weekends, teaching her how to build sandcastles and collect seashells.

Weronika's thoughts drifted back to the difficult times as well. Her parents' divorce had left a deep scar, causing tension in their household. Weronika often felt like she was caught in the middle, struggling to balance her loyalty to each parent while trying to navigate the complexities of their relationship.

Despite the challenges, Weronika's mother had always been there for her, offering a listening ear and a comforting hug when needed most. She remembered how her mother would cook her favorite meals, like chicken parmesan and homemade pasta sauce, which seemed to bring her endless joy.

As she sat in silence, trying to come to terms with the loss of her mother, Weronika's thoughts turned to the future. She knew that this was a difficult time for her family, but she also knew that they would get through it together. Her father, who had been struggling to cope with his own grief, looked like he could use some support.

Weronika got up from her chair and began to tidy up the apartment, trying to distract herself from the overwhelming sadness that seemed to be suffocating her. She made a cup of tea, adding a pinch of salt to soothe her parched throat, and then took out her phone to send a text to her father.

"Hey Dad, I'm here for you," she typed, her thumbs hovering over the screen before hitting send. "I know this is hard, but we'll get through it together."

As she sat down at the kitchen table, cradling her cup of tea in her hands, Weronika felt a small sense of comfort wash over her. She knew that she wasn't alone in her grief, and that with time, support from loved ones, and memories of happier times, she would find a way to heal and move forward.

For now, though, all she could do was sit quietly, surrounded by the familiar comforts of home, and let the tears fall.
