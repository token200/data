Weronika Alsbach stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It had been years since she'd set foot in this forgotten town, but the memories still lingered. The smell of damp earth and decay filled her nostrils as she made her way to the old inn where she used to stay.

As a child, Weronika Alsbach would spend hours exploring these woods with her grandfather, listening to tales of the ancient forest's secrets and magic. Her grandfather had been a respected healer, known for his deep understanding of the natural world. After his passing, Weronika had returned to this place to settle his estate and lay him to rest.

The innkeeper, an elderly woman named Agnes, greeted her with a warm smile and a bowl of steaming soup. Weronika sat down at a table by the fire, feeling a sense of nostalgia wash over her as she took her first bite. It was just like she remembered â€“ rich and flavorful, filling her belly after a long journey.

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the forest floor, Weronika Alsbach rose from her seat and stepped outside into the cool evening air. The trees seemed to loom over her, their branches creaking softly in the breeze. She walked deeper into the woods, following a narrow path she had once known by heart.

Suddenly, the rustling of leaves beneath her feet caught her attention. Weronika froze, her eyes scanning the underbrush for any sign of movement. A small rabbit darted across her path, its large brown eyes watching her with curiosity before it vanished into the trees. She smiled, feeling a sense of peace settle over her as she continued on her way, deeper into the heart of the forest where memories and magic awaited.
