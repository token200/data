Weronika Järvinen's eyes fluttered open to an unfamiliar ceiling. She was lying on a hospital bed, surrounded by sterile white walls and beeping machines. The last thing she remembered was walking home from work, laughing with her coworkers about the latest Finnish pop music hits.

As she struggled to sit up, a wave of dizziness washed over her, forcing her back onto the pillow. A nurse rushed in to check on her, explaining that Weronika had been brought into the ER after being found unconscious outside her apartment building. She didn't remember anything about it – just a blur of darkness and pain.

The doctor's words were hazy: something about a head injury and potential concussion...Weronika's mind reeled as she tried to piece together the events leading up to this moment. Had she been mugged? In a fight? Something more sinister?

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts, and Weronika's best friend, Aki, slipped into the room with a bouquet of fresh flowers and a concerned expression.

"Weronika, you're finally awake!" Aki exclaimed, beaming. "I've been worried sick about you."

Weronika forced a weak smile, trying to sit up again as Aki handed her a glass of water. She took a sip, wincing at the taste – too bitter for her parched throat.

Aki filled in the gaps between Weronika's memories, telling her that she had been found curled up on the sidewalk outside her building, shivering and disoriented. The police were stumped; they didn't know who had attacked her or why.

Weronika's thoughts swirled with theories: a revenge attack? A mugging gone wrong? Something more personal?

Aki leaned in, lowering her voice. "There is something, Weronika. Something I think you should know."

Weronika's grip on the glass tightened as she listened to Aki's hushed words. It seemed that Weronika's attacker had left a small note next to her body – a single sentence scrawled in red ink: "You're not safe anymore, Järvinen."

A chill ran down Weronika's spine as the truth began to sink in. This wasn't just a random attack; it was personal. And she knew exactly why.
