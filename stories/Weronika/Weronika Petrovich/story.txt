Weronika Petrovich stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station with a mix of curiosity and trepidation. She had never been to this part of Russia before, and the locals seemed as tight-lipped as the icy grip of winter that clung to the landscape.

As she made her way through the deserted streets, Weronika Petrovich couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. The buildings seemed to loom over her, their peeling facades like skeletal fingers reaching out to snatch at her clothes. She quickened her pace, her boots crunching on the frozen gravel.

Eventually, she found herself standing in front of a small, unassuming cottage with a garden full of snow-covered vegetables and a few hardy flowers that seemed to defy the cold. A faded wooden sign creaked in the wind, bearing the name "Doma" in letters that looked like they'd been carved from stone.

Weronika Petrovich knocked on the door, her heart pounding slightly as she waited for an answer. The door opened a crack, revealing a pair of piercing green eyes and a face that seemed to be carved from the same granite as the sign.

"Who are you?" the woman asked gruffly, her voice like the rustling of snowflakes in a breeze.

Weronika Petrovich hesitated for a moment before answering. "I'm Weronika Petrovich," she said finally, her voice barely above a whisper. "I'm looking for... work."

The woman's eyes narrowed slightly as she stepped aside to let Weronika Petrovich in. As they walked through the cozy cottage, Weronika Petrovich couldn't help but feel that this chance encounter was more than just a coincidence.

Over steaming cups of black tea and plates of homemade pelmeni, the woman – whose name was Sofia – revealed that she had been expecting Weronika Petrovich. "You have skills I need," she said, her eyes glinting in the firelight. "I'll teach you what I can."

As the snow fell outside like a veil of secrecy, Weronika Petrovich felt a spark of hope ignite within her. Maybe this chance encounter was exactly what she needed – a fresh start, and a chance to forge a new path in this strange and unforgiving land.
