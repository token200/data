Weronika Popov stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. The misty morning air clung to her like a damp shroud, weighing down her long black hair. She had been walking for hours, but the rhythmic cadence of her footsteps felt more comforting than the hum of the city.

As she walked through the streets, Weronika Popov's thoughts turned to the letter in her pocket. It was addressed to her, but the words were not those of a lover or friend – they belonged to someone else entirely. The ink had been applied with a precision that bordered on cruelty, and the message itself was a cold, calculated reminder of a debt Weronika Popov had yet to repay.

She turned down alleys and side streets, her senses heightened as she navigated the unfamiliar terrain. Her eyes darted between storefronts and billboards, searching for any sign of recognition or refuge. But everywhere she looked, there was nothing but the echoes of her own footsteps.

Eventually, Weronika Popov found herself at a small, cramped café on the outskirts of town. The proprietor, an elderly woman with a face as worn as the station's platform, looked up from behind the counter and nodded in recognition.

"Comrade," she said, using the title that Weronika Popov had grown accustomed to since her return to this country. "I see you're still troubled."

Weronika Popov slid onto a stool and began to order, her voice steady despite the turmoil brewing inside. The old woman listened attentively as Weronika Popov recounted the events of the past few days – the mysterious letter, the unsettling encounters with strangers.

As she spoke, the café's proprietor nodded sympathetically, her expression softening into one of gentle concern. For a moment, Weronika Popov felt like she might finally be able to lay down her burden and find solace in this strange, crumbling world.

But as the old woman reached for a cup of steaming tea, Weronika Popov's thoughts returned to the letter once more – and the weight of that debt still lingered, unresolved.
