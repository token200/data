Weronika Bonnet was known for her striking appearance, with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair that cascaded down her back like a waterfall. Her sharp jawline and petite nose added to her allure, making her a magnet for attention wherever she went.

As the daughter of a wealthy merchant family, Weronika had grown up with every privilege at her fingertips. She had spent years honing her skills as an alchemist, mastering the art of transforming base metals into gold and brewing potions that could grant strength and agility to those who drank them.

But beneath her poised exterior, Weronika harbored a dark secret: she was cursed by a rival alchemist's spell. Every full moon, she would experience intense visions of the future, foretelling events both grand and tragic. The weight of these prophecies hung over her like a specter, making it difficult for her to sleep at night.

One fateful evening, as Weronika sat huddled in her laboratory, pouring over an ancient tome bound in black leather, she felt the familiar stirrings of the curse. She closed her eyes and let herself be swept away by the visions that came with each lunar cycle: battles won and lost, love affairs that would end in heartbreak, and cities reduced to ashes.

As the night wore on, Weronika became increasingly agitated, knowing that one misstep could unravel the very fabric of time itself. She hastily mixed a potion that she hoped would quench her visions, but as it touched her lips, a sudden jolt sent her stumbling backward.

The next morning, Weronika arrived at her family's estate to find that a mysterious guest had been waiting in the wings, bearing an invitation from a rival alchemist with ties to the Bonnet family. The letter proposed a collaboration, hinting that together, they could unlock secrets hidden for centuries.

Despite her initial reluctance, something about the proposal resonated with Weronika. She couldn't shake off the feeling that this chance encounter might be the key to breaking the curse and shattering the prophecies that had haunted her since birth.
