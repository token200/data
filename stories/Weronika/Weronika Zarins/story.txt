One afternoon, while exploring the Riga Market Hall, Weronika Zarins stumbled upon a small wooden workshop tucked away in a corner. The sign above the door read "Traditional Woodcarvings." Intrigued, she pushed open the door and stepped inside.

The workshop was dimly lit, but as her eyes adjusted to the light, she saw rows of beautifully crafted wooden figurines and intricate designs. Weronika Zarins approached the workshop's owner, a kind-eyed old man named Jānis, who offered to show her his craft.

Over the next few hours, Weronika Zarins learned about Jānis' technique and the stories behind each piece. She was captivated by the way he coaxed beauty out of raw wood, creating masterpieces that told tales of Latvian folklore and mythology.
