Weronika Carlburg was a name that whispered secrets in the dimly lit corners of Berlin's art scene. A recluse with an unyielding passion for photography, she had spent years honing her craft, capturing the city's hidden gems through the lens of her camera.

The space was dimly lit, with flickering fluorescent lights casting eerie shadows on the walls. It was there that she discovered an exhibition of her own work – carefully curated by an enigmatic curator who introduced himself only as "K."
