One day, Weronika Lewandowska received an invitation from a wealthy collector to join him on an expedition to the Amazon rainforest. The collector had heard of a rare and beautiful flower that bloomed only once a decade in the depths of the jungle, and he was willing to pay top dollar for anyone who could find it.
