Her research had led her to a small, quirky park on the outskirts of town, where she hoped to find some leads. As she walked through the gates, Weronika Zieliński spotted a familiar face - her old friend and colleague, Jakub.

"Weronika! Over here!" Jakub called out, beckoning her over. "I've got something big."

Weronika Zieliński rushed over to join him, curiosity getting the better of her. Jakub was hunched over a small notebook, scribbling furiously.

"What is it?" Weronika asked, peering over his shoulder.
