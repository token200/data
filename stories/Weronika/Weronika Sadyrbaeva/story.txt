Weronika Sadyrbaeva was a nomad who had lived on the vast steppes of Kazakhstan for as long as anyone could remember. Her people, the Kazakhs, were known for their resilience and adaptability in the face of harsh weather conditions and limited resources. Weronika's own story was one of struggle and survival.

Born into a family of nomadic herders, Weronika had grown up learning the traditional ways of life: how to ride a horse, herd animals, and navigate the unforgiving terrain. She had always felt a deep connection to the land and its rhythms, which seemed to dictate her every move.
