She continued to draw inspiration from the land that had nurtured her creative spirit from a young age. Her passion for painting only grew stronger as she traveled through Italy, taking in the breathtaking landscapes and rich cultural heritage of each region.

One day, while exploring the charming streets of Florence, Giorgia Mastroianni stumbled upon an old master painter who took her under his wing.
