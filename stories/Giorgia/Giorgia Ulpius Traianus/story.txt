Years passed, and Giorgia Ulpius Traianus became one of Rome's most respected authorities on mathematics and astronomy. She continued to push the boundaries of human knowledge, collaborating with scholars from across the empire. Her work was not limited to theoretical calculations; she also applied her skills to real-world problems, helping to improve navigation and timekeeping.

Despite the many accolades she received, Giorgia remained humble, crediting her success to her dedication to learning and exploration. As she looked up at the stars, now an old man, Giorgia knew that she had left a lasting mark on the world of science. Her name would be remembered for generations to come as one of Rome's greatest minds.

The Roman Senate honored Giorgia Ulpius Traianus with a statue in the heart of the city, inscribed with her full title: "Giorgia Ulpius Traianus, Mathematica et Astronomica."
