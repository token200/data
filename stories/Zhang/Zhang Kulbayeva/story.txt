I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Zhang Kulbayeva. It's possible that she is not a well-known or established character in literature or popular culture.

However, I can create a new story based on your request. Here's a 400-word short story about a fictional character named Zhang Kulbayeva:

In the scorching deserts of Central Asia, a legendary warrior named Zhang Kulbayeva rode her horse with precision and grace. Her long, dark hair was tied back in a ponytail, revealing piercing green eyes that seemed to see right through her enemies. She wore a traditional Kazakh outfit, adorned with intricate patterns and symbols that told stories of her ancestors.

Zhang's reputation as a fierce fighter spread far and wide, earning her the respect and admiration of many tribespeople. Her greatest strength lay not in her physical prowess, but in her wisdom and strategic mind. She was a skilled diplomat who could negotiate peace treaties between warring factions with ease.

One day, a group of bandits attacked a small village, seeking to plunder its riches. The villagers were no match for the marauders, and they fled in terror. Zhang Kulbayeva received a message from the village elder, begging her to intervene on their behalf.

With a fierce determination burning within her, Zhang gathered her cavalry and rode towards the bandits' camp. Her horse was swift and powerful, allowing her to catch up with the marauders before they could escape. With a few swift strikes of her sword, she cut down the bandits one by one, leaving them no choice but to surrender.

The villagers were overjoyed when Zhang appeared on the scene, having saved their homes from destruction. They thanked her profusely and begged her to stay with them for a while. Zhang, however, knew that her duty lay elsewhere, protecting the people of the region from those who would seek to harm them.

As she rode away from the village, Zhang felt a sense of pride and purpose wash over her. She knew that there were still many dangers lurking in the shadows, but she was ready to face them head-on. With her sword at her side and her horse beneath her, Zhang Kulbayeva disappeared into the vast expanse of the desert, ever vigilant and always prepared for battle.

From that day on, the legend of Zhang Kulbayeva spread far and wide, striking fear into the hearts of those who dared to threaten the innocent. And though she rode alone, her spirit was not isolated; it was a beacon of hope for all those who sought justice in a world filled with darkness.
