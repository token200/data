Zhang Sandström was a name whispered among those who knew him as a master of the ancient art of qigong. A Swedish-Chinese fusion of cultures and disciplines, Sandström's unique approach to balance and harmony had earned him a reputation as one of the most sought-after qigong instructors in Beijing.

Born Zhang Xiao'er in the bustling streets of Shanghai, Sandström grew up surrounded by the rich traditions of Chinese medicine and philosophy.
