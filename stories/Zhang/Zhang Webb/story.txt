I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Zhang Webb. Could you provide more context or details about this character?

If you'd like, I can create a new story about a character with this name. Here's a brief outline:

Title: The Art of Stealth

Zhang Webb was a master thief and assassin who had been in the shadows for years, taking on high-stakes missions for top-secret clients. With his razor-sharp mind and agile physique, he could slip into any situation unnoticed.

One day, Zhang received an offer from a wealthy collector to steal a priceless artifact from a heavily guarded museum. The prize was a rare Chinese vase worth millions. Intrigued by the challenge, Zhang accepted the job.

He spent weeks planning his approach, studying the museum's security protocols and observing the guards' patterns. He assembled a team of trusted allies, including an expert hacker and a safe-cracker. Together, they devised a complex plan to infiltrate the museum under the cover of darkness.

The night of the heist arrived, and Zhang led his team into position. With calculated precision, they bypassed security cameras and alarms, making their way to the display case where the vase was kept. As they worked, Zhang's mind raced with possibilities – what would happen if they got caught? What if something went wrong?

Just as they were about to extract the vase, a noise alerted them to an approaching guard. Panic set in, but Zhang remained calm, quickly dispatching his team to create a diversion while he made a final grab for the vase.

In a flash of adrenaline-fueled movement, Zhang snatched the vase and escaped into the night, leaving behind only whispers of his presence. The collector would be overjoyed with the prize – and so would Zhang Webb, now one step closer to achieving the ultimate thrill.

How's that? Would you like me to continue or start a new story?
