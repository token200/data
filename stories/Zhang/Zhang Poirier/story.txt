In the bustling streets of modern-day Vancouver, a peculiar individual was making waves in the local art scene. Zhang Poirier, a talented mixed-media artist, had recently gained recognition for her innovative works that blurred the lines between traditional Chinese calligraphy and abstract expressionism.
