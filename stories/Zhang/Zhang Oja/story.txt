In the bustling streets of ancient Chang'an, a young woman named Zhang Oja stood out from the crowd. Her fiery spirit and quick wit made her a favorite among the locals, who would often gather to hear tales of her adventures.

Zhang Oja, whose full name was Liang Xianyu, was a member of a noble family in the imperial court. However, she had always felt stifled by the expectations placed upon her. As a child, she would sneak out of the palace to explore the city, much to the dismay of her parents.

One day, while wandering through the market, Zhang Oja stumbled upon a small tea shop tucked away in a quiet alley. The proprietor, an old man named Master Lin, took notice of her keen interest in his wares and offered her a cup of steaming hot tea. As they sipped their drinks together, Master Lin shared tales of his own adventures as a young man.

Entranced by the stories, Zhang Oja found herself drawn to the world beyond the palace walls. She began visiting Master Lin regularly, learning about the art of tea-making and the history of the city. Her parents, however, remained unaware of her newfound passion.

As the days turned into weeks, Zhang Oja's love for adventure grew stronger. One evening, as she was leaving Master Lin's shop, a group of bandits attacked the street vendors nearby. Without hesitation, Zhang Oja drew her sword and charged into battle, fighting off the attackers with bravery and cunning.

When the dust settled, the crowd cheered for the young woman who had saved their evening. Word of her heroics spread quickly, and soon Zhang Oja's full name, Liang Xianyu, was on everyone's lips. Though still technically a member of the imperial court, she knew that her true calling lay elsewhere â€“ as a warrior, adventurer, and protector of the people.

From that day forward, Master Lin proudly referred to Zhang Oja as "the dragon girl," and the nickname stuck. As she traveled the land, using her skills to defend those in need, Zhang Oja knew that she had found her true purpose, one that would bring her honor and fulfillment beyond anything the palace could offer.
