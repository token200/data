In the quaint town of Taiyuan, nestled in the heart of ancient China, there lived a young and ambitious scholar named Zhang Tzu-chi. Born into a family of modest means, Zhang Tzu-chi's natural aptitude for learning and his insatiable curiosity drove him to pursue knowledge with unwavering dedication.

His friends and family marveled at his remarkable understanding of the complexities of human nature, and soon, word of his intellectual prowess spread throughout the town.

One day, a renowned patron of the arts, Mr. Wei, arrived in Taiyuan seeking a worthy student to tutor him in the ways of literature and poetry. Zhang Tzu-chi's exceptional abilities caught Mr. Wei's attention, and he offered the young scholar an opportunity to become his apprentice. Overjoyed at this new chapter in his life, Zhang Tzu-chi accepted the offer with humility and enthusiasm.
