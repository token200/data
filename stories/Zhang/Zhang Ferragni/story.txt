I think there may be a small mistake. There is no notable figure by the name of Zhang Ferragni. However, I believe you might be thinking of Chiara Ferragni, an Italian fashion blogger and entrepreneur.

If that's correct, here's a story about her:

Chiara Ferragni was born in 1987 in Sarteano, Italy. As a child, she grew up with a passion for fashion, inspired by her mother's love for shoes. After completing her studies, Chiara began to build her brand as a fashion blogger on Instagram.

Her early days were marked by struggles, but Chiara persevered, sharing her style and fashion tips with thousands of followers. Her blog quickly gained popularity, and she started collaborating with brands and designers.

One day, in 2011, Chiara received an email from her favorite Italian shoe brand, Gianvito Rossi, inviting her to attend their photoshoot in Milan. This marked the beginning of a fruitful partnership that would change her life forever. The brand became one of her biggest sponsors, and soon after, Chiara was approached by other major brands like Dolce & Gabbana.

In 2012, Chiara founded her own shoe line, Ferragamo for You, which quickly gained international attention. She also launched a mobile app that allowed users to purchase shoes directly from the brand's website. The success of this venture catapulted Chiara to the top of Italy's fashion scene.

Today, Chiara is one of the most influential fashion bloggers in the world. With over 25 million followers on Instagram, she shares her love for fashion, beauty, and lifestyle with millions of people worldwide. Her brand has expanded to include clothing lines, accessories, and even a publishing house.

Chiara's journey from a small-town Italian girl to a global fashion icon is truly inspiring. She embodies the spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation, always looking for new ways to connect with her audience and push the boundaries of fashion. Despite her immense success, Chiara remains humble and committed to giving back to her community.

In 2018, Chiara married Italian TV presenter Tommaso Ciura in a beautiful ceremony surrounded by friends and family. The couple's relationship is said to be filled with love, laughter, and mutual support.

Chiara Ferragni's story serves as a testament to the power of hard work, determination, and creativity. She has proven that with passion and dedication, anyone can achieve their dreams and leave a lasting impact on the world of fashion.
