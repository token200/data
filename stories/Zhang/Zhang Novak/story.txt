I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Zhang Novak. It's possible that you may have misspelled the name or that Zhang Novak is not a well-known character.

However, I can suggest some alternative fictional characters that might fit the bill. For example, Zhang Ziyi is a Chinese actress and martial artist, while Zhang Zhongying is a Chinese writer and novelist. If you'd like, I could write a story about one of these characters instead.

Alternatively, if you have any additional information or context about Zhang Novak, such as their background, personality, or the world they inhabit, I may be able to create a more personalized story for you.

If none of the above options appeal to you, please let me know and I can try to suggest some other fictional characters that might fit the bill.
