Born into a family of modest means, Stéphane's early life was marked by hardship and determination.

As he grew in stature and intellect, Stéphane caught the eye of Emperor Aurelius Verus, who saw potential in the young man.

His wisdom and compassion earned him the respect of the people, and he became known throughout the empire as a champion of justice.

Stéphane's name eventually came to be synonymous with virtue, and it was not uncommon for historians to refer to him simply as "Diocletianus," the epitome of a just ruler.
