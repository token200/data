In those fleeting moments between shows, when the spotlight dimmed and the crowd dispersed, Stéphane Zhunussova was a woman lost in thought, struggling to reconcile the person she was meant to be with the one she had become. It was a fragile balance, one that required constant attention and effort – but it was also what made her music so powerful, so achingly human.
