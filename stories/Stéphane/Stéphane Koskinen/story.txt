Stéphane Koskinen stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the crowded station. He was a man out of time, a relic from a bygone era who had stumbled into this strange new world by accident. Or so he thought.

As he made his way through the throngs of people, Stéphane couldn't help but feel like an outsider. Everyone seemed to be in such a hurry, their faces buried in small, glowing rectangles or speaking on their wrists. They were all connected, yet completely alone.

He hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of his boarding house. The cabbie eyed him warily as he took in Stéphane's vintage attire – a three-piece suit, complete with a fedora and cane.

"Where you from?" the cabbie asked, his tone laced with skepticism.

Stéphane hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. "Paris," he said finally, trying out the word on his tongue.

The cabbie raised an eyebrow. "Never been to Paris," he replied. "You're a little old-fashioned for this city, aren't you?"

Stéphane chuckled, feeling a twinge of self-consciousness. "Perhaps," he admitted.

As they drove through the city streets, Stéphane marveled at the towering skyscrapers and neon lights that seemed to dance across the sky. It was all so... bright. So loud.

The boarding house was a modest affair, tucked away in a quiet corner of the city. Stéphane was greeted by a friendly landlady who showed him to his room and handed him a key.

"Room 214," she said, smiling. "You're welcome here."

Stéphane thanked her, feeling a sense of gratitude wash over him. This strange new world might be overwhelming, but it wasn't unforgiving. And for that, he was grateful.

Over the next few days, Stéphane struggled to adjust to his new surroundings. The technology was baffling, and he found himself constantly getting lost in the maze of streets and alleys. But as he explored the city, he began to notice small details – a street performer juggling clubs on the corner of 5th and Main, the smell of freshly baked bread wafting from a nearby café.

It was these tiny moments that reminded Stéphane of home – the Parisian cafes where he would sip coffee and watch the world go by, the sound of laughter and music filling the air. It was a connection to his past that he couldn't shake, even as he navigated this strange new future.

As he sat on his bed, surrounded by the unfamiliar trappings of modern life, Stéphane smiled to himself. Maybe being out of time wasn't so bad after all.
