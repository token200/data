Stéphane Ángel Silvestre was a man with a passion for photography. Growing up in the French Riviera, he spent most of his childhood exploring the rugged coastline and capturing its beauty through his lens. As Stéphane Ángel Silvestre, he had always been drawn to the art of photography, and after completing his studies, he decided to turn it into a career.
