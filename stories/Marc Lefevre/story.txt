Marc Lefevre stood at the edge of the rooftop, the wind whipping his dark hair into a frenzy as he gazed out over the city. A former detective, now working for a private agency, he had spent years tracking down leads, piecing together fragments of evidence to uncover the truth.

But it was the case that had brought him here tonight, a case that still lingered in the back of his mind like an open wound. The murder of a young woman, found dead in her apartment with no signs of forced entry or struggle. The only clue was a small note left on the kitchen counter: "Look again".

Marc's eyes narrowed as he thought about the note. Look again at what? He had investigated the scene extensively, questioned witnesses, but nothing seemed to point to a motive. No enemies, no grudges, just a senseless killing.

As he stood there, lost in thought, his phone buzzed in his pocket. He pulled it out and saw a text from an unknown number: "Check the victim's past".

Something about the message sent a shiver down Marc's spine. He had been so focused on finding a physical lead that he hadn't considered looking deeper into the victim's personal life.

He took out his phone and pulled up the victim's file, scrolling through her social media profiles and online activity. That was when he saw it: a post from several years ago, announcing her engagement to be married. But what caught his eye was the photo accompanying the post - a picture of the woman standing in front of an old apartment building.

Marc felt a spark of excitement as he remembered the address on the victim's ID. He had passed by that building when coming to interview witnesses, but hadn't thought much of it at the time.

Without hesitation, Marc made his way back down from the rooftop and headed out into the night, destination set for the old apartment building. This was going to be a long shot, but he knew one thing - sometimes it's the smallest details that make all the difference in solving a case like this.

As he walked through the dimly lit streets, Marc couldn't shake off the feeling that he was on the cusp of something big. Something that could change everything.
