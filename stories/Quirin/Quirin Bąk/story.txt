Quirin Bąk stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. The small town of Krakow was quiet tonight, the only sound the distant hum of a night watchman patrolling the streets.

As a detective, Quirin had seen it all – from murders in the Old Town to smuggling rings operating out of the port. But this case... this one felt different. A local businessman had gone missing, leaving behind only a cryptic message that read: "The Shadow comes for you."

Quirin's partner, a young and ambitious detective named Kasia, met him at the station with a look of concern etched on her face.

"Quirin, we've got nothing," she said, as they walked through the deserted streets. "No signs of foul play, no witnesses. It's like he vanished into thin air."

Quirin nodded thoughtfully, his mind already racing with theories and possibilities. He had a reputation for being one of the best in the business, but this case... it seemed to defy all logic.

As they arrived at the businessman's office, Quirin couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He glanced around the empty room, taking in every detail – the shattered desk lamp, the scattered papers, and the eerie silence.

It was then that he noticed a small piece of paper on the floor, partially hidden under the desk. Quirin picked it up, smoothing out the creases as he read the words scrawled on it: "Look for the eyes in the dark."

A shiver ran down his spine as he realized the message was more than just a riddle – it was a warning. The Shadow had come for him.

Without hesitation, Quirin and Kasia set out to follow the trail of clues, tracing the businessman's final steps back to an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. As they approached the building, Quirin could feel the air grow thick with tension – he knew that whatever lay inside was waiting for them.

With a deep breath, he pushed open the creaky door and stepped into the darkness, his eyes straining to see beyond the shadows. The silence was oppressive, but Quirin's trained instincts told him that they were not alone.
