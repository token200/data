Quirin Mäkinen stood alone in the dimly lit room, surrounded by the eerie silence of the abandoned asylum. As a renowned urban explorer and thrill-seeker, she had spent countless nights crawling through ventilation shafts and climbing crumbling walls in search of the next big adrenaline rush.

But tonight was different. Tonight, Quirin Mäkinen had set her sights on the infamous Ward 13, a section of the asylum rumored to be home to some of its most violent and disturbed patients from decades past.

As she made her way deeper into the decaying building, the air grew thick with the scent of rot and decay. Quirin Mäkinen's heart pounded in her chest, but she pressed on, her eyes fixed on the rusted door at the end of the hall.

She pushed it open, revealing a room that seemed frozen in time. Patient records lay scattered across the floor, old medical equipment sat silent and still against the walls, and in the center of the room, a single, flickering light bulb cast an otherworldly glow.

Quirin Mäkinen felt a shiver run down her spine as she approached the source of the light. There, sitting in a rusty wheelchair, was a man named Thomas Blackwood – or so the records indicated. Quirin Mäkinen had spent years searching for this moment, and now that it finally arrived, she couldn't help but wonder if it would be worth the risk.

As she stood there, transfixed by the dim light, Quirin Mäkinen felt a presence behind her. She spun around, but saw nothing. The air seemed to vibrate with tension, as if Thomas Blackwood was watching her from just out of sight.

Suddenly, the light bulb above flickered and died, plunging the room into darkness. Quirin Mäkinen's heart skipped a beat as she realized that she might not be alone after all.
