As a free-spirited artist, Quirin Hideki found inspiration in the most unlikely places. Her studio was a reflection of her eclectic personality, filled with colorful textiles, peculiar trinkets, and half-finished projects that seemed to be waiting for their turn in the spotlight.

Together, Quirin Hideki and Luna spent hours brainstorming ideas and sketching out rough designs for the mural. Quirin Hideki's imagination ran wild as she envisioned vibrant colors and intricate patterns that would bring the community center to life.
