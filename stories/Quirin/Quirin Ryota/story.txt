One night, Quirin Ryota received a message from an anonymous source, claiming to have information about one of his past marks. The target was a priceless artifact hidden in a high-security museum, and only someone with Ryota's exceptional skills could hope to get their hands on it.

Without hesitation, Ryota set out to assemble his team, carefully selecting individuals who shared his passion for the art of thievery. Together, they hatched a plan to infiltrate the museum during its annual gala, when the security would be at its weakest.

The artifact was safely in hand when they made their escape, leaving behind a trail of cleverly hidden clues that would challenge even the most skilled detectives for months to come. The Fox had struck again, and his legend grew as a result.

But for Quirin Ryota, there was no rest. He already had his sights set on the next mark, and his mind was racing with new ideas and strategies. As he disappeared into the night, his mask casting shadows on the walls, it seemed that The Fox would forever be one step ahead of his pursuers.

And so, the enigmatic Quirin Ryota continued to pull off daring heists, always staying one step ahead of his enemies. His reputation as a master thief was cemented, and his name became synonymous with cunning and sophistication.
