Quirin Dubois stepped into the dimly lit caf√©, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of the mysterious figure she had been searching for. The air was thick with the smell of coffee and worn leather, a haven for those who preferred to keep a low profile.

As she waited, sipping on a cup of black coffee, her thoughts turned to Quirin Dubois's own past - the life she had left behind in Paris, the connections she had made there. She thought about the art dealer, Marcel, who had once been her closest confidant, and how their friendship had ended abruptly.

The door swung open, and a figure emerged from the shadows. It was him - Quentin Dumont, a notorious collector of rare artifacts. Quirin Dubois's eyes narrowed as she watched him scan the room, his gaze lingering on each patron before moving on.

"Quirin Dubois," he said, his voice low and smooth. "I've been expecting you."

She nodded, her movements economical. "Dumont. I see you're still collecting... treasures."

"I have a feeling that one of them might be what you're looking for," Dumont replied, a hint of amusement dancing in his eyes.

Quirin Dubois snorted. "You think you can fool me? After all these years?"

The game was on, and Quirin Dubois was more than happy to play along. She had been searching for a specific artifact - a rare gemstone known as the Starlight Serenade - and Dumont seemed to be the only one who knew where it might be.

As they danced around each other, their conversation laced with innuendo, Quirin Dubois couldn't help but think of her own past. She had once been an expert in art history, and her knowledge of rare gems was unparalleled. But that life was behind her now - or at least, it seemed that way.

Dumont leaned forward, his eyes locked on hers. "Tell me, Quirin Dubois... are you still a woman driven by obsession?"

Quirin Dubois smiled, a glint of steel in her voice. "I've never lost my passion for the chase."

With that, the game was far from over.
