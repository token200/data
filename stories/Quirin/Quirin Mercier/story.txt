Quirin Mercier stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar creaking of the wooden planks beneath his feet a comforting sound. It had been years since he'd returned to Ravenshire, but the small town still held a piece of him. As a former detective, Quirin had spent most of his life chasing down leads and solving mysteries, but after a traumatic event left him with PTSD, he'd retreated back to his hometown to regroup.

The air was heavy with the scent of damp earth and decay as Quirin made his way through the deserted station. He hailed a taxi, giving the driver the address of the old Mercier family home. The once-grand Victorian stood now in disrepair, its paint chipped and faded, but Quirin didn't care – it was still his.

He spent the afternoon sorting through boxes and trunks, uncovering memories he'd long suppressed. There were old photographs, yellowed newspaper clippings, and a small, leather-bound book belonging to his grandfather. As he flipped through its pages, Quirin felt a sense of calm wash over him – this was where it began.

As night fell, Quirin took a walk down the crumbling streets, passing by buildings that once held laughter and life now stood as empty shells. He knew many had moved away in search of better lives, but for him, Ravenshire would always be home.

Quirin's thoughts turned to his colleagues at the station – they'd all thought he was crazy, leaving it all behind. But now, with each passing day, he realized that maybe running from his past hadn't been an option after all. Maybe facing it head-on was the best way to heal.

Just as Quirin was about to turn back towards home, a faint light flickered in the distance. He squinted, trying to discern what it was, but the darkness seemed to swallow everything whole. Suddenly, he spotted her – an old friend from his days on the force, Lucy, standing at the edge of town.

Quirin's heart skipped a beat as they locked eyes, and for a moment, they just stood there, frozen in time. The weight of years fell away, replaced by an unspoken understanding. "Hey," Quirin said finally, breaking the silence.

Lucy smiled softly and began walking towards him, hand extended. "Welcome back, Q."

In that instant, something shifted inside Quirin Mercier – a door creaked open, revealing new possibilities and untold stories waiting to be unraveled. He took Lucy's hand, feeling an electric sense of possibility wash over him.

For the first time in years, Quirin felt like he was finally coming home.
