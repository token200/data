Leah Kalēja stepped into the quiet café, her eyes scanning the space as she waited for Jack to arrive. She took a seat at the small table by the window and sipped on her coffee, lost in thought.

The sudden tap on the shoulder broke her concentration. It was Jack, his hair mussed from a long day of work. "Hey, sorry I'm late," he said with a sheepish grin.

Leah smiled and leaned over to kiss him on the cheek. They had been friends since college, but over the years, their friendship had blossomed into something more. It was a love that had grown quietly, without fanfare or drama.

As they sat down together, Leah pulled out her sketchbook from her bag. "I've been working on this piece," she said, flipping through the pages to reveal her latest masterpiece – a beautiful portrait of Jack's eyes. His piercing blue gaze seemed to hold a depth that no other picture could capture.

Jack laughed and took the book from her, running his fingers over the pencil lines. "You're an amazing artist, Kalēja."

Leah blushed and handed him back the sketchbook. "Thanks. You're pretty good at giving me inspiration," she said with a wink.

Their conversation flowed easily as they discussed everything from art to music to their shared love of old movies. It was moments like these that Leah cherished – just being in Jack's presence, without distractions or expectations.

As the sun began to set outside, casting a golden glow over the café, Leah turned to Jack with a serious look on her face. "I need to tell you something," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

"What is it?" Jack asked immediately, his brow furrowed in concern.

"I've been offered an art residency in Paris next year," Leah announced, excitement and nerves warring within her.

Jack's face lit up with a wide smile. "That sounds incredible! You'll have to show me all the works when you get back."

Leah smiled too, feeling a sense of accomplishment wash over her. It was a chance to pursue her passion, to push herself creatively – and spend even more time in Jack's company.

As they sat there, watching the world outside slowly change colors, Leah knew that this moment with Jack was what truly made life worth living.
