Leah Patel walked into the bustling café, scanning the room for a familiar face. She had been searching for her missing sister, Rohini, for weeks, and any lead was worth exploring. As she waited in line to order, her eyes landed on a young woman with striking green eyes and jet-black hair – it was Rukmini, a friend from college who had known Rohini.

"Rukmini! Is that you?" Leah asked, approaching the table with a mix of excitement and caution.

Rukmini looked up, startled, before nodding in recognition. "Leah! I hadn't seen you in ages."

As they exchanged warm hugs, Leah asked Rukmini about her whereabouts. She had been hanging out with Rohini's friends from their old college days, and word had it that she was part of a tight-knit group of travelers. But Leah knew that Rukmini wouldn't share any information without a good reason.

"Look, I need to know if you've seen my sister," Leah said, her voice firm but gentle. "I'm getting worried sick."

Rukmini hesitated for a moment before nodding discreetly towards the corner of the café. Leah followed her gaze and spotted Rohini sitting alone, nursing a cup of coffee.

Without hesitation, Leah rushed over to her sister's table. Rohini looked up, startled, as Leah dropped into the chair across from her. "Leah! I thought you were never going to show up."

The sisters spent the next hour catching up, filling each other in on their lives since college. As they talked, Rohini revealed that she had been on a journey of self-discovery, traveling with like-minded individuals who shared her passion for art and music.

Leah listened intently, feeling a mix of relief and worry. She knew that her sister was strong-willed and independent, but also that she needed her support. As they parted ways, Leah knew that this was just the beginning – she would be by Rohini's side every step of the way, guiding her through life's twists and turns.

As she watched Rukmini walk out of the café, Leah couldn't help but feel grateful for their chance encounter. It had led her to her sister, and brought them closer together once again.
