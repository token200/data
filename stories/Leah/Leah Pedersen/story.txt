Leah Pedersen walked into the small café, scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Emma, sitting by the window, sipping on a latte. As she approached, Emma looked up and smiled.

"Hey, Leah Pedersen! Long time no see!" Emma exclaimed, using her full name to emphasize their reunion.

Leah chuckled and took a seat beside her friend. "Hey, Em! It's been too long. How've you been?"

The two friends chatted for a bit, catching up on each other's lives. Leah had just finished a long project at work, while Emma was preparing for a big presentation at her job. As they talked, Leah noticed the café's owner, Mr. Jenkins, watching them from across the room.

Mr. Jenkins was an elderly man with a kind face and a warm smile. He had owned the café for years, and Leah had always felt at home there. She remembered spending countless hours studying for exams in the quiet corner by the window.

As they finished their drinks, Emma turned to Leah and said, "Hey, have you heard about the charity event happening next month?"

Leah shook her head, intrigued. "No, I haven't. What's it all about?"

"It's a fundraiser for a local children's hospital," Emma explained. "We're going to organize a bake sale and auction off some of our artwork."

Leah's eyes lit up. "That sounds amazing! Can I help?"

Emma nodded enthusiastically. "Definitely, Leah Pedersen! We could use your creativity and energy."

As they made plans for the event, Mr. Jenkins approached their table. "Ladies, I couldn't help but overhear your conversation," he said with a smile. "I think I might have something that can help make your event even more special."

Leah and Emma exchanged excited glances as Mr. Jenkins revealed his plan to donate a portion of the café's profits from the day of the event to the charity.

As they left the café, Leah turned to Emma and said, "Thanks for inviting me to this event, Em. I'm really looking forward to it."

Emma smiled back at her friend. "No problem, Leah Pedersen. We're glad to have you on board."
