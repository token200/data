As a child, she would spend hours drawing and painting, losing herself in the vibrant colors and textures that brought her imagination to life.

As she grew older, Leah Zarina's passion for art only intensified. She began to explore different mediums, from sculpture to photography, but it was music that truly spoke to her soul. She spent countless hours practicing piano, teaching herself to play complex pieces with ease and emotion.
