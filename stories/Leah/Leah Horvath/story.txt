Leah Horvath sat alone in her small apartment, staring blankly at the wall as tears streamed down her face. It had been months since she'd last spoken to her estranged mother, and the pain still lingered.

As a child, Leah had always felt like an outsider in her own family. Her parents had divorced when she was young, and her father had moved away to start a new life elsewhere. Her mother, however, had stayed behind, struggling to cope with the loss of their marriage.

Despite the distance between them, Leah's mother had always been the one person who truly understood her. She knew about Leah's struggles in school, her love of art, and her quiet determination to succeed. But as she grew older, Leah began to push her away, feeling like she was a burden on her mother's fragile life.

Now, as she sat in her apartment, Leah couldn't help but wonder what could have been if they had remained closer. Would she be happier? More confident? More at peace?

Leah's phone buzzed, breaking the spell. It was a text from an old friend, inviting her to meet up for coffee that afternoon. Leah hesitated for a moment before typing out a response, accepting the invitation.

As she waited for her friend to arrive, Leah couldn't help but think about her mother again. She wished she could talk to her, apologize for the hurt and pain she'd caused, and ask for forgiveness. But it was too late now. Her mother had long since given up hope of reconciliation.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was her friend, Rachel, arriving with a warm smile and a cup of coffee in hand. Leah smiled back, feeling a sense of gratitude wash over her. Maybe, just maybe, this meeting would be the start of something new â€“ something that didn't involve her mother, but did involve friendship, love, and a chance to rebuild.

As they sipped their coffee together, Leah felt a weight lift off her shoulders. She knew she still had a long way to go, but for now, at least, she was okay. And that was all that mattered.
