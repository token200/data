Leah Yang stepped into the crowded coffee shop, scanning the room for her friend Emily. They had plans to meet here an hour ago, and she was starting to get worried that Emily might have stood us up.

As she waited in line, Leah checked her phone for what felt like the hundredth time, her eyes scrolling over the screen in a futile attempt to will Emily's name into appearing as a text from her. But there was nothing. Just a stream of spam messages and social media notifications.

When it was finally her turn to order, Leah ordered a large coffee and took a seat at the small table by the window. She pulled out her phone and began typing out a hasty message to Emily, hoping that she would see it and respond with an apology or explanation for her tardiness.

Just as Leah was about to give up and leave, Emily walked in, looking frazzled and apologetic. "Hey, I'm so sorry I'm late," Emily said, dropping into the chair across from Leah. "Traffic on the way here was a nightmare."

Leah smiled sympathetically and handed over her phone, which had been silently buzzing with messages as she waited. "I got worried when you didn't show up an hour ago," she said, shaking her head in amusement.

Emily laughed and took a sip of her own coffee, her eyes brightening with gratitude. "Sorry again for that. I feel awful."

As they sipped their drinks and caught up on each other's lives, Leah couldn't help but think that sometimes life just got in the way. But it was moments like these, spent with a good friend and a warm cup of coffee, that made all the hassle worth it.

Leah Yang smiled to herself as she watched Emily laugh at something on her phone. It was moments like these that reminded her why she loved spending time with her friend so much - for the laughter, the adventure, and the unwavering support that only true friendship could provide.
