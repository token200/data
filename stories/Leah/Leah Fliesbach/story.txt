Leah Fliesbach stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of her contact. She had been waiting for what felt like an eternity, and her patience was starting to wear thin. As a freelance journalist, Leah had learned to be resourceful, but this assignment in rural France was proving to be more challenging than she anticipated.

Just as she was about to give up hope, a figure emerged from the crowd, sporting a worn leather jacket and a weathered backpack. "Leah Fliesbach?" he asked, eyeing her with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion.

"Oui," Leah replied, extending a hand in greeting. The man shook it firmly, his handshake warm and genuine.

"I'm Marc," he said, "and I've been sent to pick you up. My employer has information about the recent disappearances in the village."

Leah's journalist instincts kicked into high gear as she followed Marc out of the station and onto the cobblestone streets of the quaint village. They walked in silence, the only sound being the clinking of Marc's keys against his bag.

As they turned a corner, Leah caught sight of a small, rustic cottage nestled among the surrounding trees. "This is where I'll be staying?" she asked, raising an eyebrow.

Marc nodded. "For the duration of your stay, yes. You'll need to be careful, though. The villagers are... tight-lipped about certain things."

Leah's journalist mind was already racing with possibilities. She had a feeling that this assignment would prove to be the most intriguing one she'd taken on yet.

As they entered the cottage, Leah was struck by its cozy simplicity. A fire crackled in the hearth, casting a warm glow over the cluttered room. Marc handed her a cup of steaming coffee, and Leah took a sip, feeling the warmth spread through her veins.

"Tell me," she said, setting the cup down on the table, "what do I need to know?"

Marc leaned back in his chair, eyes narrowing slightly as he began to speak. Leah listened intently, her pencil poised over her notebook, ready to capture every detail. She knew that this assignment was going to be a wild ride, but she was ready for whatever came next.

And with Marc by her side, Leah Fliesbach felt confident that she could uncover the truth behind the disappearances in this small, seemingly idyllic village.
