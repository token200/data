Leah Hassan stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of her friend, Emily. She had been waiting for what felt like hours, and she was starting to get worried.

As she made her way through the crowd, Leah's mind wandered back to their plans for the weekend. They were going to spend a day hiking in the nearby mountains, just the two of them, and enjoying each other's company. Leah had been looking forward to it all week.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, she spotted Emily's familiar figure waiting by the exit. "Hey, girl!" Emily exclaimed, as Leah approached her. "Sorry I'm late, traffic was a nightmare."

Leah smiled and gave her friend a hug. "No worries, I just got here myself," she replied. "But it's good to see you! How was your ride?"

Emily filled her in on the details of her journey, and they chatted for a bit before setting off towards the mountains. As they walked, Leah couldn't help but feel grateful for their friendship. She had met Emily in college, and they had instantly clicked.

Over the years, they had been through thick and thin together, supporting each other through every up and down. And now, as adults, they were enjoying each other's company even more.

As they hiked higher into the mountains, the scenery grew more breathtaking. Leah felt a sense of peace wash over her, and she knew that this was exactly where she needed to be right now. She took a deep breath, feeling the cool mountain air fill her lungs, and gazed out at the stunning view before them.

"Wow," Emily breathed, as they stopped to take in the sight. "This is amazing."

Leah nodded, smiling. "I know, right? I'm so glad we decided to come here today."

As they sat down on a nearby rock, Leah couldn't help but think about how much her life had changed since graduating from college. She had landed her dream job, made some new friends, and even started dating someone special. But no matter where life took her, Emily would always be there for her.

"Thanks for being such an amazing friend, Em," Leah said, turning to Emily with a smile. "I don't know what I'd do without you."

Emily's face softened, and she reached out to put a hand on Leah's arm. "You'll never have to find out, girl," she replied.
