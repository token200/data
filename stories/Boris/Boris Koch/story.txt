Boris Ivanovich Koch was a man of few words, but when he spoke, people listened. A retired engineer from Moscow, he had spent most of his life working on the city's infrastructure projects, earning him the nickname "The Man Who Built Moscow."

After retiring, Boris returned to his small village in rural Russia, where he lived a simple life surrounded by nature and the sounds of the forest. He spent his days tending to his garden, reading books, and taking long walks along the nearby river.

Despite his quiet demeanor, Boris had a deep passion for innovation and technology. In his younger years, he had worked on some of Moscow's most ambitious projects, including the construction of the city's iconic metro system. His expertise in engineering and problem-solving had earned him numerous awards and recognition within the industry.

One day, a group of young engineers from Moscow arrived in the village, looking for inspiration and guidance from Boris himself. They were fascinated by his experience and knowledge, and they spent hours listening to his stories and seeking advice on their own projects.

As they sat around his living room, sipping tea and smoking cigarettes, Boris regaled them with tales of his adventures in Moscow's construction industry. He spoke of the challenges he had faced, the obstacles he had overcome, and the triumphs he had achieved. His words were laced with humor and wisdom, and the young engineers hung on his every word.

As the sun began to set, Boris stood up, his joints creaking with age, and led the group outside into the garden. He pointed to a small pond in the center of the yard, where a family of ducks swam peacefully.

"This is my design," he said, a hint of pride in his voice. "A simple system for harnessing the energy of the river. I built it myself, many years ago."

The young engineers listened intently as Boris explained the principles behind the pond's design, and they were amazed by his ingenuity and creativity.

As they left the village the next day, one of the engineers turned back to Boris and said, "We'll never forget your stories, Mr. Koch. You're an inspiration."

Boris smiled, feeling a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment. He knew that he had made a difference in the lives of others, and that was all the reward he needed. As he watched the young engineers disappear into the distance, he returned to his garden, feeling grateful for the chance to share his wisdom with others.
