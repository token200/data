Boris Hill, a man with a wild shock of white hair and a bushy white beard to match, stood tall as he surveyed the bustling streets of London. A renowned historian and collector of rare artifacts, Boris had spent his life uncovering the secrets of the past.

As he walked through the crowded market stalls, Boris's eyes scanned the vendors' wares with a practiced air of discernment. He was on the hunt for something new to add to his collection - a relic from ancient Egypt, perhaps, or a rare manuscript from medieval Europe.

Just then, a commotion broke out at the nearby stall of an elderly antiquarian named Jenkins. A small, intricately carved stone statue had been discovered among the vendor's wares, and whispers were circulating about its possible provenance.

Boris's ears perked up as he strode over to examine the statue for himself. The vendor, a thin-lipped old man with a knowing glint in his eye, smiled wryly as Boris approached.

"Ah, you're the collector I've been hearing so much about," Jenkins said, his voice dripping with malice. "I reckon I can trust you to handle this little gem properly."

Boris's eyes narrowed as he took in the statue - a delicate, high-relief carving of Anubis, god of the dead. He could hardly believe his luck.

"Tell me, Mr. Jenkins," Boris said, his voice low and measured, "where did you acquire this...remarkable piece?"

Jenkins hesitated for a moment before responding, "Oh, I found it in an old warehouse down by the docks. Just lying about like it was waiting to be picked up."

Boris's eyes sparkled with excitement as he carefully took the statue from Jenkins's grasp. He tucked it into his leather satchel with care, already envisioning its place among his vast collection.

As he walked away, the vendor called out after him, "You'll find that statue comes at a price, Mr. Hill! It's said to be cursed!"

Boris just chuckled and continued on his way, whistling a jaunty tune as he disappeared into the crowded streets of London.
