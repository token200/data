Boris Wiśniewska, or "Bory" as he was known to his friends, sat alone at the small café on the corner of ulica Nowogrodzka. He nursed a cup of cold coffee, staring blankly out the window at the grey, rainy streets of Warsaw.

It had been two years since the accident. Two years since Bory's life had changed forever. The memories still lingered, like an open wound that refused to heal. His eyes drifted back to the photograph on the table in front of him – a faded Polaroid of himself and his best friend, Jakub, taken during their last summer together before Jakub left for university.

Bory sighed and set the cup down, running a hand through his unruly hair. He was still trying to come to terms with what had happened that night. The car crash, the screams, the faces of the paramedics rushing towards him like zombies... it all seemed like a blur now. But the pain still lingered.

As he sat there, lost in thought, a young woman walked into the café, shaking her hair free from its ponytail. Her bright blue eyes scanned the room, locking onto Bory with a curious intensity. For a moment, they just stared at each other, two strangers bound by some invisible thread.

"Sorry," she said finally, breaking the spell. "I know it's weird, but I couldn't help noticing you were staring out of nowhere."

Bory chuckled, feeling a spark of amusement ignite within him. "Just lost in thought," he replied. "Long story."

The woman nodded sympathetically and took a seat across from him. "Mind if I join you?" she asked, her voice soft and melodious.

"Not at all," Bory said, smiling wryly. "Please, sit down."

As they sipped their coffee together, Bory found himself opening up to the stranger in ways he never thought possible. Her name was Anna, a graphic designer with a quick wit and infectious laugh. For the first time since the accident, Bory felt like he could breathe again.

Perhaps it was fate that had brought them together on this drizzly evening. Perhaps it was the rain-soaked streets of Warsaw that had washed away his grief, allowing him to see the world – and people – in a new light. Whatever it was, Bory knew one thing for certain: he wasn't alone anymore.
