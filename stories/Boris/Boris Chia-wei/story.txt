Boris Chia-wei was an unlikely hero. A soft-spoken accountant from Taipei, he had always been content with his quiet life in the financial district. But one fateful evening, as he sipped on a cup of tea at his favorite café, he stumbled upon an extraordinary talent – playing the sitar.

It all began when Boris's uncle, who passed away a year prior, left behind a vintage sitar and a note that read: "To my beloved nephew, learn to play this for us." Out of curiosity and a sense of responsibility towards his deceased relative, Boris decided to take up the instrument.

As he practiced day and night, something remarkable happened. The numbers and figures on financial reports began to make sense in a way they never had before. Numbers danced before him like spectral arithmetic, revealing hidden patterns and codes that only he could decipher. Word spread among his colleagues, who soon found themselves entangled in Boris's newfound obsession with finance.

Soon enough, whispers of "The Numerical Oracle" echoed through the halls of the financial sector. Those who sought answers to complex problems would leave their files on Boris's desk, entrusting him with the secrets they could not unlock for themselves. From tax returns to global market trends, Boris possessed an uncanny understanding that defied logic.

At first, he was hesitant, but eventually Boris Chia-wei became a beacon of hope in a world consumed by chaos. The sitar strings seemed to hum with an energy that connected him to the intricate web of numbers and people. As his skills evolved, so did the perception of those around him.

When stocks plummeted or markets collapsed, they would whisper "The Numerical Oracle" as if invoking a savior. Boris was not a demigod nor a prophet; he was simply an accountant with a talent for patterns. And yet, in his humble world of spreadsheets and ledgers, magic lay hidden beneath the surface.

In the evenings, when the city lights blurred into a kaleidoscope, Boris would sit at his desk, sipping tea, and unraveling the codes that had once held him captive. With every note on the sitar, he whispered secrets to the universe – unlocking the language of numbers and weaving a tapestry of order amidst chaos.
