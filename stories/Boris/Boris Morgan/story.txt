Boris Morgan stepped into the dimly lit jazz club, his eyes scanning the crowded room for familiar faces. As he made his way through the sea of patrons, he spotted his friend, Emma, sitting at the bar, sipping on a whiskey sour.

"Hey, Boris," she called out as he approached. "I didn't know you were coming tonight."

Boris Morgan flashed her a disarming smile and slid onto the stool beside her. "I wouldn't have missed it for the world, Em," he said, his deep voice rumbling across the room.

The club was playing one of Boris's favorite tunes – a sultry saxophone solo that always got him in the mood. He closed his eyes, letting the music wash over him, and turned back to Emma when the band switched to a more upbeat track.

"So, how's life been treating you?" he asked, leaning in closer. "I feel like I haven't seen you in ages."

Emma sighed and shook her head. "It's been busy, that's all. Work's been keeping me on my toes, and then there's...other stuff," she trailed off, leaving the rest unsaid.

Boris Morgan nodded sympathetically, his expression understanding. He knew Emma was hiding something from him – had been for months now – but he wasn't about to pry. Not yet, at least.

The music reached a crescendo as Boris Morgan caught sight of Alex, his old friend and bandmate, striding onto the stage with a guitar slung low over his shoulder. The crowd erupted into cheers, and Boris couldn't help but feel a rush of pride – he had always loved watching Alex perform live.

As the night wore on and the music grew more intense, Boris Morgan found himself lost in the rhythm and the moment, his worries about Emma's secrets forgotten for now. He was just there to enjoy the music with his friends, to let go and lose himself in the sweet, sweet sound of jazz.

And when the last notes faded away and the crowd began to disperse, Boris Morgan turned to Emma once more, a warm smile spreading across his face. "Thanks for tonight, Em," he said, his voice low and genuine. "You needed this."

Emma smiled back at him, her eyes shining with unshed tears. "Yeah, I guess you're right."
