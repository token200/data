Boris Palmas was known for his unorthodox approach to detective work. The renowned private investigator had built a reputation for solving cases that left even the most seasoned detectives stumped. His latest challenge came in the form of the mysterious disappearance of wealthy businessman, Henry Richmond.

As Boris sat in his office, sipping on a cup of black coffee, he stared at the file in front of him. The only clue was a cryptic message left behind by Richmond: "Look to the shadows." Boris's mind began to wander as he thought about his past cases and how they might be connected.

Just then, his secretary, Jane, walked into the room. "Boris, I have some news," she said, her voice filled with excitement. "I've received a call from an anonymous source claiming to have information about Richmond's disappearance."

Boris's ears perked up. "Put them through," he said, already knowing that this could be his break in the case.

The caller identified himself as Alex, a former employee of Richmond's. Boris listened intently as Alex revealed that Richmond had been involved in some shady dealings before his disappearance. The more Boris listened, the more he became convinced that this was indeed the lead he had been searching for.

As the conversation came to a close, Boris thanked Alex and made a mental note to track down the mysterious informant. He then turned his attention back to the file in front of him, his eyes scanning the pages with renewed purpose.

Just as he was about to leave for the day, Boris's phone rang again. This time, it was Alex calling back. "Boris, I think I've found something," the voice on the other end said. "A hidden safe in Richmond's office. I didn't dare touch anything, but I could swear there's a piece of paper inside with a cryptic message."

Boris's heart began to pound as he rushed back to his office. He quickly made his way to Richmond's office and found the safe, which was cleverly concealed behind a bookshelf. After some fiddling, Boris managed to open it, revealing a note that read: "Meet me at the old warehouse at midnight. - J."

Boris's mind was racing as he pieced together the clues. He knew that he had to act fast if he was going to solve this case before it was too late. With renewed determination, Boris Palmas set out to unravel the mystery of Henry Richmond's disappearance and bring the perpetrator to justice.
