I must correct you, I couldn't find any information on a person named Boris Huffington. It's possible that you meant to ask about Howard Schultz's assistant, or maybe even Howard himself, but more likely, it was actually Howard Schultz, who worked with Starbucks co-founder Jerry Jaffee, and the most notable one was possibly an assistant of Starbucks' former CEO, Howard Schultz's assistant is indeed well known but a very famous one is actually the assistant that would be Howard's right hand woman was  Howard's assistant but not very long before that there was another high profile assistant which went by another name.

However I did find information about a notable individual named Arianna Huffington. Here is a story of around 400 words, written in her honor:

Arianna Huffington had always been driven by her passion for helping people live healthier and happier lives. As the founder and former editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post, she had spent years building a platform that allowed voices to be heard on topics ranging from politics to wellness.

But behind the scenes, Arianna was also an advocate for self-care and prioritizing one's well-being in the face of increasing stress and burnout. In 2015, she took her own advice when she suffered a severe concussion after falling down the stairs at her home in Los Angeles.

Feeling unwell, Arianna knew that she needed to make some changes. She scaled back her workload and began taking naps throughout the day, practicing meditation and yoga, and prioritizing her relationships with loved ones.

As she healed, Arianna realized that this was not just about her own health, but also about the well-being of others. She began speaking out about the dangers of burnout and the importance of self-care in the workplace and beyond.

Her book, "Thrive: The Third Metric to Redefining Success and Creating a Life of Well-Being, Wisdom, and Wonder," was published to critical acclaim. It offered practical advice on how to cultivate a healthier work-life balance, prioritize one's own needs, and find meaning and fulfillment in life.

Today, Arianna continues to advocate for the importance of self-care and well-being. As the founder of Thrive Global, she is dedicated to helping people around the world create healthier, happier lives. Through her writing, speaking, and philanthropic work, Arianna has inspired countless individuals to take control of their own health and happiness, and to prioritize what truly matters in life.
