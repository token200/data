Sami Petersen sat alone at her small caf√©, nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee. The rain pattered against the windowpane, casting a melancholy mood over the entire establishment. She stared blankly into space, her mind consumed by the same thoughts that had been plaguing her for weeks.

As an accomplished detective with a keen eye for detail and a sharp mind, Sami should be thrilled to have cracked one of the city's most notorious cold cases. But instead, she felt empty and hollow, like she'd just won a trophy that meant nothing to her.

Sami's eyes drifted out the window, focusing on the small inscription etched into the rain-slickened glass: "Lost in the City." The words had been scrawled by an anonymous tipster who claimed it was their own parting gift for Sami. The phrase echoed in her mind like a refrain from a distant melody.

As she pondered, her phone buzzed on the counter, shrill and insistent. With a sigh, she picked up to reveal a text from an unknown number: "Look again at the victim's journal. You're missing something."

Sami's heart skipped a beat as she slid open the folder containing the case files. She began flipping through the pages, her eyes scanning the handwritten entries of the young woman who'd been brutally murdered just three years ago.

Suddenly, a small phrase jumped out at her: "The city eats its own." It was one of the victim's final entries, and it now seemed like more than just a cryptic message. Sami recalled how the victim had spent countless hours wandering the streets, trying to escape the suffocating darkness that plagued her.

An idea began to take shape in her mind as she continued reading through the journal. She spotted something she'd missed before - a single sentence highlighted in red ink: "The eyes that saw me are not the ones who did."

A chill ran down Sami's spine. Who was watching her, waiting for their chance to strike? The phone buzzed again, this time with an address. A small, quaint house on the outskirts of town. With shaking hands, she typed out a reply: "I'm there."
