The voice on the other end claimed to have seen something incriminating at the crime scene – a suspicious figure lurking around Sophie's body before the murder. Sami's ears perked up with excitement as she scribbled down notes and made plans for a follow-up investigation.

With her mind racing and adrenaline pumping, Sami Charron knew that this was going to be one tough case to crack.
