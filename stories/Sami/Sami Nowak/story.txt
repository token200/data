Sami Nowak walked into the small café on the corner, scanning the room for a familiar face. As she waited in line to order, her eyes landed on a figure sitting by the window – an old friend from college, Alex.

Sami's best friend from childhood, Emily, had introduced her to Alex during their senior year. They quickly became close friends, bonding over late-night pizza parties and impromptu road trips. As Sami approached the counter, Alex caught her eye and gave a warm smile.

"Hey, Nowak!" Alex called out, waving her over. "Come join me!"

Sami laughed as she took a seat next to Alex. They chatted for a bit about their latest projects – Sami was working on a new graphic design portfolio, while Alex had just started writing a novel.

As they sipped their coffee, Emily walked into the café and made her way over to their table. "Hey guys! What's going on?" she asked, plopping down in the empty chair.

The three friends spent the next hour catching up on each other's lives. Sami filled them in on her latest design accomplishments, while Alex shared stories about her writing struggles. Emily talked about her new job and her plans to travel abroad.

As they chatted, Sami couldn't help but feel grateful for their friendship. She had always cherished the bond she shared with Emily and Alex – they had been there for each other through thick and thin. From late-night study sessions in college to spontaneous adventures as adults, their friendship had endured.

As the afternoon wore on, the café started to fill with more people. The noise level increased, making it harder for Sami to focus on her conversation. She excused herself to grab another coffee from the counter.

As she waited in line, she couldn't help but think about how much her life had changed since college. She had landed a stable job and started building a reputation as a graphic designer. But no matter where life took her, Sami knew that Emily and Alex would always be there to support her.

When Sami returned to the table, Alex reached out and squeezed her hand. "We're so proud of you, Sami Nowak," she said with a smile. "You've come a long way since college."

Sami smiled back, feeling a sense of contentment wash over her. She knew that no matter what the future held, she would always have her friends by her side – Emily, Alex, and the rest of their tight-knit group.
