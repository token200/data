Sami Kortajarena was no stranger to the world of dance. As a principal dancer with the renowned Ballet de l'Opéra National de Paris, she had spent years perfecting her craft and honing her technique. Born Sami Kortajarena in Madrid, Spain, Sami's passion for dance began at a young age, when she would spend hours watching videos of Misty Copeland and other iconic ballerinas.

As she grew older, Sami's dedication to the art form only intensified. She trained tirelessly, often for 12 hours a day, pushing herself to new heights with each passing year. Her hard work paid off when, at just 25 years old, she was offered the role of Odile in Swan Lake – one of the most iconic and challenging roles in all of ballet.

Sami's performance as Odile was nothing short of breathtaking. Her technical precision and emotional depth brought a level of nuance to the character that had been lacking in many previous interpretations. Critics raved about her performance, with one reviewer describing her as "a force of nature on stage."

Despite her success, Sami remained humble and grounded. She credited her upbringing in Madrid – where dance was an integral part of her daily life – for instilling in her a deep love and respect for the art form. Her parents, who had encouraged her passion from a young age, were overjoyed by her success.

As Sami took her final bow after each performance, she felt a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over her. She knew that she had given it her all, leaving everything on stage. It was a feeling that never got old, one that Sami cherished deeply.
