Sami Novák walked into the small café, scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Léa, sitting by the window, sipping on a cup of coffee. Sami made her way over, exchanging warm smiles with Léa.

"Hey, how's it going?" Léa asked, not looking up from her phone.

Sami slid into the seat across from Léa and signaled the barista for a coffee. "I'm good, just trying to get some work done before the weekend."

Léa put down her phone and turned to face Sami. "So, how's life as a freelance writer treating you? I feel like I haven't seen you in ages."

Sami chuckled and leaned back in her chair. "It's been keeping me busy, that's for sure. But it's not all bad. I've been working on some great projects lately. My latest article just got picked up by a major publication, so I'm really excited about that."

Léa's eyes lit up with enthusiasm. "That's amazing, Sami Novák! Congratulations!"

Sami blushed and shook her head. "Thanks, Léa. It's still surreal to think about my work being read by so many people."

As they chatted, the café began to fill with more customers, and the noise level increased. Sami and Léa laughed and joked together, enjoying each other's company.

After a while, Léa stood up to leave. "I should probably get going," she said. "But we should catch up again soon."

Sami nodded in agreement. "Definitely. Maybe we can grab brunch next weekend?"

Léa smiled and hugged Sami. "Sounds like a plan to me."

As Léa walked out of the café, Sami watched her go with a sense of contentment. It was moments like these that reminded her why she loved being a writer – for the chance to connect with others through her words.

Sami took a sip of her coffee and sat back in her chair, feeling grateful for friends like Léa who supported her every step of the way.
