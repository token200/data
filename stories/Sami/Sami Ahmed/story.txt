Sami Ahmed sat alone in her small apartment, staring blankly at the wall as she tried to process the events of the past few weeks. As a successful event planner, she had always been the epitome of poise and control, but lately, everything seemed to be spiraling out of control.

Her business partner, Rachel, had suddenly quit without warning, leaving Sami to pick up the pieces and try to salvage what was left of their company. The stress was taking a toll on her mental health, and she couldn't shake the feeling that she was losing herself in the process.

Just as she was starting to feel like she was at her breaking point, there was a knock at the door. It was her best friend, Leila, who had come to check in and offer some much-needed support. Sami welcomed Leila with open arms, feeling a sense of gratitude wash over her.

Over coffee and cookies, Leila listened intently as Sami poured out her frustrations and worries. She offered words of encouragement and advice, reminding Sami that she was strong and capable, and that she would get through this difficult time.

As they chatted, Sami's mind began to wander back to her childhood, when her parents had first immigrated to the United States from Somalia. Her father, a hardworking man with a kind heart, had always been her rock, supporting her through thick and thin. And her mother, a talented cook with a warm smile, had taught her the value of community and connection.

Sami felt a sense of peace wash over her as she thought about her parents, and the sacrifices they had made for her. She realized that she didn't have to go through this alone, and that she had people like Leila who cared about her deeply.

With renewed determination, Sami stood up and hugged Leila tightly. "Thank you for being here for me," she said, her voice filled with emotion. "I don't know what I'd do without you."
