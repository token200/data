"Good morning, Miss Girace," Mr. Jenkins said, his voice dripping with condescension. "I see you've brought your notebook and pen. I hope you're ready for a challenge."

Sami Aisha smiled sweetly, trying to hide the fire that burned within her. "I'm always ready, Mr. Jenkins. I have a story that I think will blow the lid off this town's corruption scandal."
