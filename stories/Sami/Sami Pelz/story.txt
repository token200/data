Sami Pelz stepped out onto the rooftop, her eyes scanning the cityscape below. As a member of the X-Men, she was used to being on high alert, always ready for battle. But tonight, she just wanted to clear her head.

The team had saved the world from yet another diabolical plan, and Sami felt like she needed some time to herself. She took a deep breath, feeling the cool night air fill her lungs, and closed her eyes.

As she stood there, she heard the sound of footsteps behind her. Opening her eyes, she saw X-Men teammate Wolverine sitting beside her, his piercing yellow eyes fixed on hers.

"What's on your mind, Sami?" he asked, his deep voice low and soothing.

Sami shrugged, feeling a little self-conscious. "Just needing some space, I guess," she said. "We've been fighting for so long, I feel like I'm losing myself in all of it."

Wolverine nodded sympathetically. "I know how you feel," he said. "Sometimes I feel like I'm just going through the motions too. But the truth is, we're not alone. We've got each other's backs, and together, we can face anything that comes our way."

Sami looked at him, feeling a surge of gratitude towards her teammate. She knew she could always count on Wolverine to be there for her.

Just then, Cyclops appeared beside them, his eyes scanning the horizon. "Everything okay?" he asked.

Wolverine shook his head. "Just Sami needed some time out," he said. "I was filling her in."

Cyclops nodded and walked away, leaving just Wolverine and Sami alone on the rooftop.

"Thanks for understanding, Logan," Sami said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Wolverine smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "That's what friends are for, Sami," he said.

Sami smiled back, feeling a sense of peace wash over her. Maybe she wasn't losing herself in all of it after all. She had people like Wolverine and Cyclops who cared about her, and together, they could face whatever challenges lay ahead.

As the night wore on, Sami found herself lost in conversation with Wolverine, discussing everything from their favorite battles to their personal struggles. For the first time in a long while, she felt like she was truly being herself, without the weight of her X-Men responsibilities.

It was a small moment, but it was one that would stay with Sami forever - a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there was always someone who cared.
