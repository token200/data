One fateful evening, as Sami sat sipping tea in his office, a knock at the door broke the silence. It was a young woman, her eyes red-rimmed from crying, who introduced herself as Maria. She had been the last person seen with a missing businessman, and her frantic demeanor hinted at a desperate need for help.

Sami Nurlanov listened intently as Maria recounted the events leading up to the man's disappearance. His trained ears picked up on subtle inconsistencies in her story, and his mind began to weave a complex web of theories and hypotheses.
