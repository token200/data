Sami Gauthier stepped out of the misty Quebec morning, her bright pink scarf wrapped tightly around her neck. As a detective with the Sûreté du Québec, she was no stranger to the rugged beauty of rural Quebec. But on this particular day, the tranquility of the forest was disrupted by the sound of shattering glass.

As Sami made her way through the underbrush, her eyes scanned the clearing before her. A small, antique shop stood amidst the trees, its windows shattered and its wooden sign creaking in the gentle breeze. The owner, Madame LaFleur, was nowhere to be seen, but a faint scent of lavender wafted from within.

Sami's instincts told her that something was off. She carefully made her way inside, taking note of the intricate carvings on the walls and the vintage trinkets that lined the shelves. As she moved further into the shop, a small, leather-bound book lay open on a nearby table. The pages were yellowed with age, but one entry caught Sami's eye: "Beware the stranger in black."

Suddenly, the door creaked open and Madame LaFleur emerged from the shadows, her eyes wild with fear. "You've found it," she whispered, handing Sami a small, ornate box. "This has been hidden for decades. It belongs to my great-grandmother, who was accused of witchcraft in these very woods."

Sami's mind racing, she carefully opened the box, revealing a collection of family heirlooms and ancient artifacts. But it was what lay at its center that sent shivers down her spine: a small, antique locket with a note etched onto its surface.

"For my daughter, if you ever find your way back," the note read.

Sami's eyes met Madame LaFleur's, and for an instant, they shared a look of understanding. This was no ordinary case of theft or vandalism – it was something far more sinister. The stranger in black had left behind more than just broken glass; he had left behind a trail of secrets and lies that threatened to upend the entire community.

With a newfound sense of determination, Sami Gauthier vowed to unravel the mysteries hidden within those ancient woods. She knew that this was just the beginning of a long and perilous journey, one that would take her deep into the heart of Quebec's dark history. But she was ready, her pink scarf fluttering behind her like a banner of defiance.
