Sami King sat at her desk, staring blankly at the stack of files in front of her. As a private investigator, she had seen it all - the cheating spouses, the missing persons cases, the corporate espionage schemes. But nothing could have prepared her for the latest case that landed on her doorstep.

The young woman, Sarah, walked into Sami's office with tears streaming down her face. Her sister, Emily, was missing and the police were stumped. The only clue was a cryptic text message that read "I'm sorry". Sami listened intently as Sarah recounted the events leading up to Emily's disappearance.

As Sami began to dig deeper, she discovered that Emily had been involved in some shady dealings - working as a freelance journalist and taking on cases that were too hot for her corporate sponsors. It seemed like she was getting close to uncovering a major scandal when she vanished.

Sami knew she had to tread carefully. She began by interviewing Sarah's friends and acquaintances, searching for any leads that might point her in the direction of Emily's whereabouts. But every door she knocked on led to a dead end.

It wasn't until Sami received an anonymous tip that the case started to heat up. The message read "Look into Emily's past" and was followed by a single phone number. Sami hesitated for a moment before dialing in, her heart racing with anticipation.

The voice on the other end was gravelly and menacing, but it sent shivers down Sami's spine. "You're getting close," the voice growled. "But you'll never find her."

Sami didn't flinch. She had dealt with enough crooks to know that threats were just a way to keep people off their trail. "I'll do whatever it takes to find Emily," she said firmly.

The line went dead and Sami was left staring at the phone, her mind racing with possibilities. Who was this person? And what did they want from her?

As she sat there, trying to gather her thoughts, a piece of paper slipped out of her pocket and landed on the floor. She picked it up, smoothing out the wrinkles, and read the words scrawled across it: "Trust no one".

Sami's eyes narrowed as she looked around the room. Who was playing this game with her? And what did they have planned for Emily?
