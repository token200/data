"We need you to investigate and get to the bottom of this story."

Without hesitation, Sami accepted the assignment. She knew that it would be a tough road ahead, but she was ready for the challenge. With her father's words echoing in her mind, "The truth is always worth fighting for," she set out to uncover the truth, no matter what dangers lay ahead.
