Sami's love affair with art began at a young age, watching her abuela (grandmother) tend to her garden filled with tropical flowers and vibrant greenery. It was during these late-night strolls through the garden that Sami Ángel Silvestre would often sketch the intricate details of nature, mesmerized by the way light danced across each petal.
