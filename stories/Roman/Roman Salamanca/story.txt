Roman Alejandro Salamanca, known to many as simply "Salamanca," sat in his dimly lit office, sipping on a glass of fine scotch. As one of the most feared and respected cartel leaders in Mexico, he exuded an aura of calmness and confidence that unnerved even his enemies.

With a flick of his wrist, Salamanca summoned his loyal lieutenant, Hector Salinas, into his presence. "Hector, I have a new plan," Salamanca said, his voice low and gravelly. "We're going to expand our operations into the north, take advantage of the chaos in the United States."

Hector nodded eagerly, knowing that this was Salamanca's idea and not to be questioned. The two men had worked together for years, building a vast empire of cocaine trafficking and money laundering.

As they discussed their strategy, the door burst open and in walked Gustavo "Gus" Fring, one of the most cunning and ruthless cartel leaders in Mexico. Salamanca's eyes narrowed as he assessed Gus's intentions.

"What brings you here, Gus?" Salamanca asked, his tone dripping with skepticism.

"I have a proposal for you, Roman," Gus replied, his voice smooth as silk. "We can form an alliance, share our resources and take down our common enemies together."

Salamanca snorted, his expression dismissive. "I don't need your help, Gus. I'm doing just fine on my own."

Gus's smile faltered for a moment before he regained his composure. "As you wish, Roman. But know this: if you refuse to work with me, I will make sure that you regret it."

The air was thick with tension as the two men locked eyes, each waiting for the other to blink first. Finally, Salamanca spoke up, his voice dripping with menace.

"I'm not afraid of you, Gus. And I certainly don't need your help. You can leave now and try somewhere else."

Gus nodded curtly before turning on his heel and exiting the room. Salamanca watched him go, a cold glint in his eye. He knew that this was far from over.

As he turned back to Hector, Salamanca smiled grimly. "It seems, Hector, that Gus Fring is not going away anytime soon."
