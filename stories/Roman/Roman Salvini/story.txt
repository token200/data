Roman Salvini stepped out of his small, cluttered apartment and onto the bustling streets of Little Italy. The aroma of freshly baked bread wafted from the nearby bakery, mingling with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves that seemed to seep from every crack in the sidewalk.

As a retired librarian, Roman had grown accustomed to the quiet rhythms of his neighborhood. But on days like these, when the sun beat down relentlessly and the air felt heavy with anticipation, he couldn't help but feel restless.

Roman's eyes scanned the crowds as he made his way to the corner deli. He ordered a cup of black coffee and a slice of his favorite Italian bread, which he devoured in three swift bites while watching the world go by through the steamy windowpane.

People passed him on their way to or from work – harried office workers, bright-eyed students, and elderly couples holding hands. Some nodded in greeting, while others barely acknowledged his presence. Roman wasn't bothered; he was used to being overlooked.

As he finished his coffee and began to make his way home, a gust of wind carried a crumpled piece of paper down the street. Roman picked it up, smoothing out the wrinkles with his thumb. It appeared to be a receipt from a local antique shop – or rather, what remained of one.

The shop had been in the Salvini family for generations, its intricate wooden door adorned with carved cherubs and grapevines that seemed to dance in the sunlight. But it was gone now, sold off at an auction after years of struggling to stay afloat.

Roman tucked the receipt into his pocket, feeling the familiar ache in his chest. He turned the corner onto 14th Street, where the shop had stood for so many years. A vacant lot sprawled before him, its grass overgrown with weeds that seemed to be winning the battle.

As he walked home, Roman couldn't shake the sense of loss that clung to him like a shroud. The memories came flooding back – afternoons spent helping his father sort through dusty tomes, evenings listening to tales of the Old Country from his nonna.

Roman took a deep breath, letting the scent of Italy fill his lungs once more. He smiled wistfully, knowing that though the shop was gone, its stories and secrets would live on in him – and maybe even, one day, in someone else's hands.
