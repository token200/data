Roman Krūmiņš stepped out of his worn, red car and onto the cracked sidewalk of Riga's Old Town. The Latvian winter had finally set in, casting a chill over the city that seemed to seep into every pore. As he lit a cigarette, the smoke wafted up towards the sky, mingling with the fog.

Roman was a man of few words, but his eyes told stories of their own. A retired detective from Riga, he had spent years solving cases, unraveling mysteries that seemed to defy all logic. His reputation preceded him – the ' Krūmiņš Method' was whispered about in hushed tones among the police forces.

As he walked through the narrow streets, Roman's mind wandered back to his last case: the disappearance of a young girl named Anna. The family had been frantic with worry, and Roman had promised them justice. He had followed every lead, every tip, but the trail had gone cold. Still, he couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off.

Roman stopped in front of a small café, where an old friend, Jānis, waited for him. Over steaming cups of coffee, they reminisced about past cases and shared stories of their respective lives since retiring from the force. Roman spoke little, but his eyes betrayed a deep sadness – he missed the rush of adrenaline that came with solving a case.

As they parted ways, Roman couldn't help but feel a pang of restlessness. He needed to get back to work, to dig through old files and revisit Anna's disappearance. The case still lingered in his mind like an open wound.

Back at his small apartment, Roman spent hours poring over documents, searching for any shred of evidence that might have been missed. The fire crackled in the background as he sat, surrounded by stacks of dusty files, his eyes scanning each line until exhaustion took its toll.

And then, just as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting Riga's streets in a warm orange glow, Roman stumbled upon something – an old receipt from a local pawnshop. The scribbled name on the back caught his eye: Vasilīns.
