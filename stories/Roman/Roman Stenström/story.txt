Roman Stenström stood atop the hill, his eyes scanning the misty dawn landscape. As a former mercenary and member of the infamous Viking clan, Raven's Wings, he had seen his fair share of battles. But nothing could have prepared him for the sense of unease that settled in the pit of his stomach as he gazed out at the ruins of his home village.

The once-thriving settlement was now a smoldering ruin, its wooden houses reduced to ash and smoke. The screams of the survivors still echoed in Roman's mind, and he couldn't shake the feeling of guilt that weighed upon him like an anchor.

As he descended into the ravaged streets, Roman noticed a figure standing amidst the rubble. It was Eira, his childhood friend and former comrade-in-arms. Her piercing green eyes locked onto his, and she beckoned him closer with a gesture.

Roman approached her cautiously, unsure of what to expect. Eira's face was streaked with soot, but her spirit remained unbroken. She grasped Roman's arm, her grip firm as she pulled him toward the center of the village.

"What happened?" Roman asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

Eira's eyes clouded over, and for a moment, Roman thought he saw the faintest glimmer of sorrow. "The raiders," she spat, her voice venomous. "They came under cover of night, their armor black as the night itself. We fought them off, but...but too many fell."

Roman's face twisted in anguish. He had been separated from Eira during the battle and had spent hours searching for her, only to find her now, among the wreckage.

As they surveyed the damage, Roman spotted a group of survivors huddled together near the outskirts of the village. Among them was Elric, his fellow mercenary and close friend. The two men locked eyes, and without a word, Roman knew that Elric had come for him – and Eira.

Roman turned back to Eira, his expression grim. "We have to leave," he said, his voice firm. "This village is no more. We must find new lives, somewhere the world can't reach us."

Eira nodded, a small smile playing on her lips. Together, they gathered their meager belongings and vanished into the rising mist, leaving behind the ruin of Roman Stenström's once-thriving home.

As they disappeared into the unknown, the wind whispered a haunting phrase through the ruins: "Raven's Wings will rise again." But Roman knew that some wounds would never heal, and some scars would remain forever etched upon his soul.
