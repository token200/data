Roman Altmann stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the city. His eyes scanned the towering skyscrapers and neon-lit streets, a stark contrast to his own quiet existence. He was a man out of place in this world of perpetual noise and chaos.

A mathematician by trade, Roman had always been drawn to the beauty of patterns and logic. But after a freak accident involving a faulty electrical wire and a lightning storm, he found himself afflicted with an unusual condition – the ability to see the underlying code that governed the universe.

It started with small things: noticing the intricate patterns on a leaf or the symmetry of a building's design. But soon, Roman's sight expanded to encompass the entire world. He could see the hidden structures that underlay every phenomenon, from the orbits of planets to the branching networks of neurons in his own brain.

At first, this new perspective had been overwhelming. The constant barrage of information had left Roman reeling, struggling to filter out the extraneous and grasp the essential. But with time, he learned to navigate this vast mental landscape, developing a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of all things.

Now, as he stood on the rooftop, Roman felt like a part of the city itself. He saw the threads that bound people together, the invisible networks of relationships and dependencies that made life tick. It was a disorienting feeling, but also strangely exhilarating.

Despite his newfound abilities, Roman's social interactions remained limited. His condition made it difficult to connect with others on an intimate level – they couldn't understand the vast, complex tapestry that he saw. So he kept to himself, observing from the periphery of society while secretly exploring its hidden patterns.

The city was a never-ending puzzle for Roman, and he reveled in the challenge. In his own quiet way, he felt like a detective, searching for clues to unlock the secrets of existence. And as he gazed out into the night, lost in thought, Roman knew that this was where he belonged – on the cusp of understanding, with the universe laid bare before him.
