The once-abandoned mansion was now a hub of activity, with people gathering to share stories about its past and marvel at its beauty.

Roman's hard work paid off as Willowdale was finally completed. The historical society held an official reopening ceremony, where guests marveled at the restored mansion. Roman stood proudly beside his creation, beaming with pride. His years of dedication had brought a piece of history back to life, and he knew that Roman Alexander Tamm had played a vital role in it.
