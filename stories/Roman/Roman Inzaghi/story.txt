Roman Inzaghi trudged through the pouring rain, his eyes fixed on the pavement beneath his feet. He had just left a meeting with a potential investor for his new business venture, and the news was not what he had hoped for.

As he walked, Roman's mind replayed the conversation he had just had. The man had expressed interest in funding his idea, but only if he could take a significant stake in the company. Roman knew that would compromise his vision, and he couldn't bring himself to do it.

He finally arrived at the small café where he had agreed to meet with the investor. He took a seat at the bar and ordered a coffee, his eyes scanning the room for any signs of life. The café was quiet, the only sound the steady drip of water from the faucet above.

As he sipped his coffee, Roman couldn't help but think about his family. His parents had always been supportive of his dreams, even when they seemed impossible. And now, as he stood at a crossroads, he wondered if he was making a mistake by not taking the investor's offer.

Just then, the door swung open and a woman walked in, shaking the rain from her coat. Roman looked up to see a familiar face - his sister, Alessia. She spotted him and smiled, making her way over to the bar.

"Hey, Roman," she said, sliding onto the stool beside him. "How did it go?"

Roman sighed and rubbed his temples. "It didn't go well."

Alessia nodded sympathetically. "What happened?"

Roman filled her in on the details, from the investor's offer to his own decision not to take it. Alessia listened intently, her expression growing more serious by the minute.

When Roman finished speaking, Alessia reached out and put a hand on his arm. "You're making the right choice, Roman," she said firmly. "Your vision is worth fighting for."

Roman smiled, feeling a surge of gratitude towards his sister. He knew he could always count on her to be there for him, no matter what. And with that thought, he felt a sense of determination wash over him, propelling him forward into the unknown.
