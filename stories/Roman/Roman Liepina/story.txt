One fateful night, Roman Liepina walked into the local jazz club, his presence announcing itself to all within earshot. The air inside was thick with smoke and music, and Roman Liepina moved through it like a ghost. He made his way to the bar, ordering a whiskey on the rocks without breaking stride.

As he sipped his drink, Roman Liepina watched the crowd with an intensity that bordered on obsession. His eyes locked onto a young woman sitting alone at a table, her face lost in thought. There was something about her that drew him in, something that made him want to know more.

Roman Liepina took a seat beside her, his movements economical and controlled. The woman looked up, startled, as he introduced himself with a low bow.
