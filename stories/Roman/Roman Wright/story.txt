Roman Wright stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the familiar streets of Ashwood. It had been ten years since he'd last set foot in this small town, and yet it felt like no time had passed at all. The same quaint shops and cafes lined the high street, the same faces nodded in greeting from the pavement.

As a child, Roman had spent summers in Ashwood with his family. His parents had been folk musicians, and they'd often perform at local festivals and gatherings. But when Roman was twelve, tragedy struck: his father died in a car accident, leaving Roman's mother to raise him alone.

Despite the challenges of growing up without a father figure, Roman found solace in the music that had always been such an important part of his life. He spent hours playing his guitar and writing songs, pouring out his emotions onto the page. As he grew older, Roman began to perform at local open mic nights and small gigs around town, eventually working up the courage to start a band of his own.

Now, at twenty-two, Roman was back in Ashwood, seeking inspiration for his next album. His parents' death had left him feeling lost and uncertain about his future, but he knew that music had always been there to guide him. He'd spent the past few months touring and writing, trying to shake off the sadness and find a new voice.

As Roman walked through the streets of Ashwood, he felt a sense of peace settle over him. The air was alive with the scent of blooming flowers, and the sound of birdsong filled his ears. He stopped outside the old bookshop on High Street, where he used to spend hours as a child browsing through shelves stacked high with dusty tomes.

Roman pushed open the door and stepped inside, his eyes adjusting to the dim light. The shop was just as he remembered it: rows of books that seemed to stretch up to the ceiling, and a warm, welcoming atmosphere that made you feel like you were stepping into another world.

He spent the next few hours browsing through the shelves, running his fingers over the spines of the books. It was music to his eyes, stumbling upon an old issue of The Poetry Review that featured some of his favorite poets from childhood. He pulled out a worn copy of Dylan Thomas's "Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night" and read it again for the hundredth time, feeling the emotions wash over him like waves.

For Roman, music had always been about capturing moments â€“ fleeting feelings and observations that might never come again. And yet, as he stood in the quiet of the bookshop, surrounded by the words and wisdom of those who came before him, he felt a sense of clarity wash over him. It was time to find his voice again, to write songs that would speak directly to his heart.

Roman pulled out a notebook and began scribbling down lyrics, letting the words flow onto the page like water. The world outside seemed to fade away as he wrote, leaving only the music and the emotion in his soul.
