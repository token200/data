Roman Jansone, a former Special Forces operative, sat alone in his dimly lit apartment, nursing a whiskey on the rocks. The fire crackled in the fireplace as he stared out the window, lost in thought. It had been years since he last took on a mission, and yet the memories of his past still lingered.

As he gazed into the flames, Roman's mind wandered back to his days as a soldier. He remembered the camaraderie of his fellow operatives, the trust they had built together, and the countless battles they had fought side by side. It was during one such mission that Roman earned his nickname: "The Ghost." A ghostly figure, seemingly invisible, who could strike without warning and disappear just as quickly.

Roman's thoughts turned to his wife, Sophia. They had met while he was still serving, and she had been the one person who could bring him back down to earth. She had a way of making him laugh, even on the darkest of days. Roman smiled wistfully, remembering the countless late-night conversations they had shared about their hopes and dreams.

As the night wore on, Roman's thoughts turned to his current life. He had retired from active duty and was now living off his pension. It wasn't a bad life, but it lacked the excitement and purpose that came with being a soldier. He felt like he was just going through the motions, waiting for something - anything - to shake him out of his rut.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. Roman's heart skipped a beat as he wondered who could be visiting at such an hour. He made his way to the entrance, whiskey still in hand, and opened the door to reveal a familiar face: Maria, his old handler from the Special Forces.

"Roman Jansone," she said with a hint of a smile. "I heard you were looking for work."

Roman raised an eyebrow, intrigued by her sudden interest. What could this mean? Was it time to dust off his old gear and take on one final mission? Or was something more at play?

As Maria stepped inside, Roman couldn't help but feel that his life was about to change in ways he hadn't anticipated.
