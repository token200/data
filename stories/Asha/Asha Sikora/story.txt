Asha Sikora stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. It had been years since she'd set foot in Ravenswood, the small town where she grew up. Her mother, Maria, had passed away just a week ago, leaving Asha to return home for the funeral.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Asha felt a mix of emotions: sadness, nostalgia, and a hint of determination. She'd always been drawn to the ocean that rimmed Ravenswood's edge, its vastness a reminder of the world beyond this small town.

Asha walked along the beach, feeling the wind whip her hair into a frenzy as she breathed in the salty air. The sound of seagulls filled the silence, and for a moment, she felt like a child again, carefree and untethered. As she rounded a bend in the shore, Asha spotted a figure standing at the water's edge.

It was Jax, her childhood friend and confidant, now grown into a ruggedly handsome young man with a strong jawline and piercing blue eyes. They'd lost touch after high school, but the memories of their late-night conversations on these very shores had stayed with Asha all these years.

"Hey," Jax said, breaking the silence as Asha approached him. "I wasn't expecting you."

Asha smiled wryly. "Figured I wouldn't be the only one returning to this place." The two of them stood there for a moment, watching as the sun began its slow descent into the ocean.

As they parted ways later that day, Jax offered Asha a spot on his porch, and together they sat in comfortable silence, listening to the waves. It was like no time had passed at all, yet everything had changed â€“ or so it seemed.
