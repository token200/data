Asha Lefevre stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. It had been months since she'd left Paris behind, seeking a fresh start in this rural town in the south of France. The village was quiet, with only a handful of residents to keep her company.

As she made her way through the deserted streets, Asha Lefevre couldn't help but feel a sense of longing for the city she had once called home. She missed the bustling cafes and markets, the sound of the Seine River flowing gently through the heart of Paris.

Despite the distance, Asha Lefevre felt a sense of peace settle over her as she walked. The air was filled with the scent of lavender and rosemary, and the sun shone down upon her face, warming her skin. She had always been drawn to the simple, rustic life, and this village seemed to be the perfect fit.

As she approached her small cottage on the outskirts of town, Asha Lefevre noticed a figure watching her from across the road. It was an old man, his face creased with age and experience. He smiled at her, and Asha felt a sense of warmth spread through her chest.

"Bonjour," he said, as she approached him. "I've been expecting you."

Asha Lefevre's eyes narrowed slightly, unsure of what to make of the old man's words. But there was something kind in his eyes that put her at ease, and she smiled back at him.

"I'm Asha Lefevre," she said, extending a hand. "And you are...?"

The old man took her hand, his grip firm but gentle. "I am Marcel," he said. "Welcome to our village, Asha Lefevre. I think you'll find it's home."
