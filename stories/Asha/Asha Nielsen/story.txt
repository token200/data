Asha Nielsen stepped into the dimly lit jazz club, her eyes scanning the crowded room for a familiar face. As she navigated through the sea of patrons, her gaze landed on a figure sitting alone at the bar - a woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair.

It was Lily, Asha's best friend since childhood, who had moved to the city a year ago. The two had promised to stay in touch, but life had gotten busy, and their last communication was over six months ago. Asha felt a pang of guilt for not reaching out more often.

As she made her way to Lily's table, Asha noticed a group of rowdy patrons eyeing them with disdain. She shook off the feeling and sat down beside Lily, who flashed her a warm smile as soon as she saw her.

"Asha! It's been ages!" Lily exclaimed, wrapping her in a tight hug.

Asha hugged her back, feeling a wave of emotions wash over her. "Long time coming," she replied with a chuckle. "I've missed you so much."

The two spent the next hour catching up on each other's lives, from Asha's struggles as a freelance writer to Lily's newfound success as a painter. As they sipped their drinks and laughed together, Asha felt a sense of peace wash over her.

Just then, the band began playing, and Asha's eyes sparkled with excitement. She grabbed Lily's hand, pulling her onto the dance floor. Together, they swayed to the beat, lost in the music and each other's company.

As the night wore on, Asha realized that sometimes life gets busy, but true friendships can transcend distance and time. She was grateful for Lily, who had remained a constant source of support and love in her life.

As they left the club, Asha leaned over to whisper something in Lily's ear. "I promise I'll reach out more often from now on," she said with a grin.

Lily smiled back, her eyes shining with understanding. "I'd like that."
