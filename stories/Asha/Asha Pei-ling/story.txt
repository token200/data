One sunny afternoon, Asha Pei-ling stepped into her small studio, eager to begin working on a new piece. She had been inspired by a recent trip to China, where she had immersed herself in the vibrant colors and patterns of traditional silk fabrics.

The hours flew by as Asha lost herself in the world of color and texture. Her strokes danced across the canvas, imbuing it with life and energy. She was completely absorbed in the creative process, her mind quiet and focused.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow through the studio windows, Asha stepped back to admire her work.
