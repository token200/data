Agnieszka Abdi had always felt like an outsider in her small town. As a Somali refugee who had fled war and persecution in her homeland, she struggled to find her place among the predominantly white population. Her parents, refugees themselves, had settled in the United States seeking safety and a better life for their daughter.

Growing up, Agnieszka was always drawn to the arts. She spent hours sketching and painting, lost in the vibrant colors and textures of her Somali heritage. Her art was a way for her to express herself and connect with the culture she had left behind.

As she entered high school, Agnieszka began to feel more like an outsider than ever. The other students seemed to know nothing about Somalia or its rich history and customs. They would often ask her awkward questions, trying to understand her accent or where she was from. It made her feel like a relic from another time, like a stranger in her own skin.

Despite the challenges, Agnieszka persevered. She joined a local art club, where she met other creatives who shared her passion for self-expression. Together, they formed a support system, encouraging each other to push past their fears and doubts.

One day, Agnieszka's art teacher assigned a project that would change everything. She was asked to create a mural depicting the history of Somali migration to the United States. With trembling hands, she set to work, pouring her heart and soul into every brushstroke.

As the mural took shape, Agnieszka felt a sense of pride and purpose that she had never felt before. Her art was no longer just a way for her to express herself but also a way to share her story with others. For the first time in years, she felt like she belonged, like she had found her place in the world.

When the mural was finished, Agnieszka's classmates gathered around to admire it. They asked her questions and listened intently as she shared stories about her parents and their experiences. For a moment, Agnieszka felt like she had finally found her voice, like she could speak without being misunderstood or judged. And in that moment, she knew that she would always be proud to call herself Agnieszka Abdi.
