Agnieszka Andersen stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the cool breeze carrying the faint scent of salt and sea. She had been away for what felt like an eternity, escaping the suffocating grip of her past in Warsaw.

As she made her way through the deserted station, memories flooded her mind – the sounds of shattering glass, the screams, the endless rain that seemed to wash away all sense of hope. Agnieszka's eyes landed on a small café across the street, its neon lights casting a warm glow over the darkening sky.

She pushed open the door and slid onto a stool at the counter, ordering a cup of black coffee as she watched the waitress expertly juggle orders with an efficiency that belied her tired eyes. Agnieszka closed her gaze, allowing herself to let go of the weight that had been pressing down on her for so long.

A few minutes later, the door swung open and a figure slid onto the stool beside her. It was Jacek, a childhood friend who had remained one of the few people she could trust in this new life.

"Agnieszka?" he asked softly, peering at her through tired eyes that betrayed their own share of scars. "I wasn't sure if I'd find you here."

"I got a message from Zofia," Agnieszka replied, nodding towards the waitress, who had discreetly handed over a small note with Jacek's name on it.

As they ordered food and sat in silence for a while, memories began to unravel before her – happy moments, arguments with her brother Janek that would still leave her heart racing long after their fights were resolved. The words spilled from Agnieszka like confetti as she let go of the carefully constructed walls that had shielded her world.

Jacek listened attentively, offering a reassuring touch on her arm when she seemed to lose herself in the echoes of old pain. In those fleeting moments, Agnieszka realized she wasn't alone anymore – Zofia and Jacek had become her anchor in this new life, grounding her back onto solid ground.

With every passing day, Agnieszka's resolve strengthened; with each new encounter, a tiny piece of the past was extinguished by the growing light of hope. The wind outside died down as she opened her eyes, locking gazes with Jacek – who smiled softly at her.

"Welcome home," he whispered.

As they stepped out into the cool evening air, their arms wrapped tightly around each other, Agnieszka knew that this time, there would be no rain to wash away.
