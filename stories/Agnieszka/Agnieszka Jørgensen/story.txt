As she walked through the streets, Agnieszka Jørgensen noticed the quaint shops and cafes that lined the high street. The smell of freshly baked bread wafted from one of the bakeries, enticing her to stop and sample some pastries. She purchased a warm baguette and began to make her way to her small studio apartment, located above a vintage clothing store.
