One day, a local antique dealer approached Joshua with a special request. She had acquired an old, intricately carved music box that needed restoration, and she knew just the man for the job. The box was in pieces, its delicate mechanisms exposed and worn from years of disuse. But Joshua saw potential in its broken state, envisioning it as a beautiful piece to showcase his skills.

As he worked on the music box, Joshua Mägi poured all his love into its revival.

The day it was finished, Joshua presented the restored music box to its grateful owner, who gasped in amazement at its transformation. The old woman thanked Joshua for his incredible work and promised to display the music box proudly in her home. Word of Joshua's talents spread quickly through the community, and soon he had a steady stream of clients clamoring for his services.
