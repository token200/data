Joshua Pedersen sat at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of files in front of him. As a private investigator, he had seen it all - from missing persons to corporate espionage. But this case was different. This one was personal.

Ava Morales, a young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair, had gone missing five years ago. Her family had given up hope, but Joshua had never lost faith that she was still out there. He had been searching for her ever since, following every lead, no matter how small.

As he sifted through the files, a name caught his eye - Marcus Thompson, a former associate of Ava's who had been involved in some shady dealings. Joshua had always suspected that Marcus might know something about Ava's disappearance, but he needed proof.

He picked up the phone and dialed a number, waiting for what felt like an eternity before someone answered. "Detective James," a gruff voice said on the other end of the line.

"Marcus Thompson," Joshua replied. "I need to speak with him."

There was a pause, and then Detective James relented. "He's at the city jail, but he's not cooperating with us. He claims he doesn't know anything about Ava's disappearance."

Joshua scribbled down the number of Marcus's cell. He had an idea. Using his connections, he managed to get himself a visitation pass and headed to the jail.

When he arrived, Joshua spotted Marcus sitting on a bench in the common area. The man looked like he hadn't changed much since their last meeting - the same scruffy beard, the same scrappy demeanor.

Joshua took a seat next to him and began to chat. "Hey, Marcus. Long time no see."

Marcus raised an eyebrow. "What do you want?"

"I'm here about Ava," Joshua said, his voice steady. "I know you two were friends, and I think you might be the only one who can help me find her."

Marcus snorted. "You really think I'd betray my sister like that? You're barking up the wrong tree, Pedersen."

Joshua leaned forward, his eyes locked on Marcus's. "Tell me what happened to Ava," he said, his voice low and urgent.

For a moment, Marcus seemed taken aback. Then, something flickered in his eyes - a glimmer of guilt, maybe. "I'll tell you everything I know," Marcus said finally. "But it won't be pretty."

Joshua nodded, his heart racing with anticipation. He was one step closer to finding Ava Morales, and he wouldn't rest until she was safe again.
