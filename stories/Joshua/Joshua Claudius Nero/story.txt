Joshua Claudius Nero was an enigmatic figure in the small town of Ashwood. He lived in a crumbling mansion on the outskirts of town, surrounded by overgrown gardens and whispering trees.

Joshua Claudius Nero beckoned her closer, inviting her to join him on his journey through sound.

Together, they wandered into the gardens, where the night air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the distant hum of crickets. The stars twinkled above, casting an ethereal glow over the scene.
