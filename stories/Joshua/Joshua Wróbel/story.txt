One drizzly evening, Joshua Wróbel received a visit from a distraught woman named Anna, who claimed that her sister's prized diamond necklace was missing. The family had been preparing for a grand celebration the next day, and without the necklace, the festivities would be ruined.

Joshua Wróbel listened attentively as Anna recounted the events leading up to the disappearance of the necklace. He took meticulous notes, his brow furrowed in concentration. "Tell me more about your sister," he said, his voice calm and soothing. "And when did you last see her?"
