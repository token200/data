Joshua Jain walked into the small café, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. He spotted her sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee, and made his way towards her. As he approached, she looked up and smiled.

"Hey, Josh," she said, using the nickname only a few people had ever called him.

Joshua Jain chuckled and sat down across from her. "Just Joshua, please," he replied with a grin.

They chatted for a while, catching up on each other's lives. She told him about her new job, and he shared stories of his latest photography project. As they talked, the café began to fill with more people, but they remained engrossed in their conversation.
