Joshua Miguel Lopez was a man with a passion for photography and a heart of gold. Growing up in a low-income neighborhood, he had always been drawn to the beauty in the world around him. Despite the hardships he faced, Joshua's love for art only grew stronger.

After high school, Joshua decided to pursue his dream of becoming a photographer. He enrolled in a local college program and spent countless hours honing his craft. His talent and dedication quickly paid off, and he began landing freelance gigs for local clients.
