His parents, both talented artists themselves, encouraged his creativity from a young age.

As Joshua grew older, his love for art only intensified. He spent hours sketching and painting, experimenting with different techniques and mediums. His room was filled with canvases, paints, and brushes, each one telling a story of its own. After completing high school, Joshua decided to pursue a degree in fine arts from a prestigious college in Delhi.

Word of his work spread quickly, and soon he was being commissioned by galleries and individuals from all over the country to create custom pieces for their homes and offices.

Despite his growing success, Joshua remained humble and grounded. He continued to paint in his small studio apartment, lost in the world of color and light. His music also played an important role in his life â€“ Joshua was a skilled sitar player who would often accompany himself on guitar during long painting sessions.

As his career took off, Joshua began to receive invitations to show his work at prominent galleries and museums around the world. He accepted each opportunity with gratitude and enthusiasm, eager to share his art with audiences everywhere. Joshua Ramesh Patel was living his dream, and he knew that this was just the beginning of an incredible journey.
