His success on the ice was matched only by his charisma and showmanship off it. He was a natural entertainer, with a quick wit and charming smile that won over fans around the world.

But Popov's greatest thrill came when he turned to big-air skiing, a sport that combined elements of skiing, snowboarding, and ice climbing. He became one of the first athletes to compete in this extreme sport, performing death-defying jumps and flips with ease.

Throughout his career, Popov remained true to his roots, never forgetting his East German upbringing.
