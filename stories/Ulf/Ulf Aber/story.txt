Ulf Aber trudged through the snowy streets, his parka hood pulled up to shield him from the biting wind. As a detective in the sleepy town of Ravenswood, he had seen it all - from the bizarre to the mundane. But nothing could have prepared him for the strange phone call that morning.

"Detective Aber, we've got another one," the dispatcher's voice crackled over the radio. "Somebody just broke into the local antique shop and stolen a priceless diamond necklace."

Ulf arrived at the scene to find Mrs. Jenkins, the owner of the shop, frantically waving her hands in distress. The usually calm woman was visibly shaken, and Ulf knew he had to act fast.

As he began questioning witnesses, Ulf noticed something peculiar - everyone seemed to have an alibi for the time of the break-in. It was as if someone had managed to coordinate with multiple people at once, making it impossible to track down the thief.

Undeterred, Ulf took on the case with his characteristic tenacity. He spent hours poring over security footage and interviewing suspects. But no matter how hard he looked, he couldn't seem to find any leads.

As night fell, Ulf found himself back at his desk, sipping a lukewarm cup of coffee and staring blankly at the stack of files in front of him. That's when his phone rang again - this time with a cryptic message: "Look closer at the owner."

Ulf's eyes widened as he read the words on the note. Mrs. Jenkins? But she was clearly distraught about the break-in, not behind it. Yet...a nagging feeling told him that there was more to her story than met the eye.

With newfound determination, Ulf decided to pay another visit to the antique shop. This time, he noticed a small inscription on the display case - "Property of Mrs. Jenkins, courtesy of our esteemed benefactor." A name etched beneath it made Ulf's heart skip a beat: Ulf Aber himself.

Suddenly, the pieces clicked into place. The coordinated alibis, the suspiciously cooperative witnesses...it all pointed to one person: Ulf Aber. But why? Had someone set him up as a pawn in their own game?

Ulf's eyes scanned the room, and this time he saw something he hadn't noticed before - a tiny smudge of lipstick on his jacket cuff. A message was clear: "Meet me at the old warehouse at midnight."
