Ulf Kask sat in his worn armchair, staring out the window at the snow-covered forest beyond. The flickering flames of the fireplace danced and cast eerie shadows on the walls as he nursed his cup of tea.

It had been ten years since the infamous Heist of Stockholm. Ten years since Ulf's skills as a safecracker and thief were unmatched, earning him a reputation as one of Europe's most notorious con artists. But after that fateful night, everything changed.

Ulf's trusted partner, Axel, had betrayed him, stealing millions in loot and leaving Ulf for dead on the streets. The scars on his body would never fully heal, but it was the blow to his ego that still stung the most.

As he sat there, lost in thought, a knock at the door broke the silence. It was Maria, his former lover and closest friend. She slipped inside, her eyes scanning the room as if searching for something - or someone.

"Ulf, it's been too long," she said softly, sitting beside him on the couch. "I heard you'd retired from the game."

He grunted, not looking at her. Maria knew better than to push him now. Ten years of silence and secrets had left their mark.

Maria poured herself a cup of tea, her movements economical and precise. She sat back, letting out a sigh. "I've come with information, Ulf. News that might be relevant to you."

Ulf raised an eyebrow, his curiosity piqued despite himself. Maria handed him a small folder filled with documents and photographs.

He scanned the contents, his eyes widening as he realized the scope of Axel's betrayal went far beyond their little heist. It was bigger than Ulf had ever imagined, reaching all the way to the highest echelons of Swedish society.

For the first time in years, a spark of anger ignited within him. Maybe, just maybe, it was time to take back what was owed to him.

Maria watched him with an air of quiet understanding, knowing that once Ulf's fire was lit, there would be no stopping him. And for a moment, she felt a pang of trepidation, wondering if she had just set off a chain reaction that would change her life forever.

As the snowflakes continued to fall outside, Ulf Kask smiled, his eyes gleaming with a new determination.
