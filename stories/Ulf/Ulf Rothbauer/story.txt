Ulf Rothbauer walked into the dimly lit room, his eyes scanning the crowd for any sign of life. He had been searching for months, following every lead, every hint that might bring him closer to solving the mystery of his sister's disappearance. As he moved through the sea of faces, one person stood out - a woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair.

"Ulf Rothbauer," she said, her voice low and husky. "I've been expecting you."

He approached her cautiously, his hand on the knife at his belt. "Who are you?" he asked gruffly.

"My name is Ariana Blackwood," she replied, a small smile playing on her lips. "And I have information about your sister's disappearance."

Ulf's grip on the knife tightened. He had heard rumors of a mysterious figure who knew something about his sister's vanishing act. Could this be the person he had been searching for?

Ariana led him to a small table in the corner of the room, where a single chair sat. "Sit down," she said, her eyes never leaving his face.

Ulf hesitated for a moment before taking a seat. Ariana began to speak, her words spilling out like a river. "I saw your sister on the night she disappeared," she said. "She was with a group of people, all dressed in black. They were arguing, and then they left quickly."

Ulf's mind raced as he processed the information. This could be it - the break he had been waiting for. He leaned forward, his eyes locked on Ariana's.

"What do you want in return?" he asked gruffly.

Ariana smiled again, her eyes glinting with mischief. "I have something that belongs to your sister," she said. "Something that will bring you closure."

Ulf's grip on the knife tightened further. He was willing to do whatever it took to find out what had happened to his sister. But at what cost?
