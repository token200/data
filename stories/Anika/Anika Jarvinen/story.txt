"How did it go?" one of them asked, eyes shining with excitement. Anika grinned, feeling elated. "It was amazing," she said, sipping her own cup of coffee as the adrenaline began to wear off. "I think we might be onto something special." The others nodded in agreement, already discussing plans for their next show and how they could take it to the next level.
