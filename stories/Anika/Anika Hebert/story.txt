As she grew older, Anika's love of art only deepened, and she began to study painting at a local college. Her instructors were impressed by her unique style, which blended elements of impressionism with a touch of abstract expressionism.

After graduating from college, Anika set out on her own, traveling to various parts of the country in search of inspiration for her art.
