Anika Askarova stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. It had been years since she'd set foot in Moscow, and yet the familiar sights and sounds brought back memories like no other.

As a former KGB agent turned freelance journalist, Anika had made a name for herself sniffing out corruption and deception in the highest echelons of power. Her skills were renowned, but her personal life was shrouded in mystery.

Anika hailed a taxi and gave the driver an address on the outskirts of the city. The fare would be paid in cash, of course. She checked her watch – 10:47 PM. That's when the package was usually delivered.

The driver dropped Anika off at a nondescript warehouse, where she was greeted by a figure shrouded in shadows. A package was handed over, wrapped in brown paper and twine. No label, no identification. Just a small note attached to the string: "For Anika's eyes only."

Anika examined the package carefully before untying it and unwrapping the contents. Inside, she found a stack of documents detailing a massive money laundering operation involving some of Russia's most influential oligarchs.

Her phone buzzed with an encrypted message from her contact within the KGB. "The package is genuine," it read. "Meet me at the Café Luna tomorrow night to discuss further."

Anika tucked the documents into her bag and lit a cigarette, feeling the familiar rush of adrenaline coursing through her veins. This was what she'd been working towards – uncovering the truth behind Russia's most entrenched corruption.

The driver watched Anika with an air of curiosity as she paid him in cash and disappeared into the night. What did this KGB contact have to say? And how far would they go to keep the operation under wraps?

Anika knew that in Moscow, information was currency, and those who controlled it held the power. As a journalist, she'd made her share of enemies. But tonight, she had a lead that could change everything.

She took one last drag on her cigarette before disappearing into the shadows, ready to unravel the tangled threads of corruption and uncover the truth – no matter where it led.
