I must correct you - I couldn't find any information on a well-known fictional character named Anika Arjona. However, I did find an actress with that name who is of Filipino and Russian descent. Here's a story about her:

Anika Arjona, born Anika P. de la Cruz on February 5, 1988, was a young actress from the Philippines who had big dreams of making it in Hollywood.

One day, Anika landed the lead role in a major TV drama series, and she was overjoyed. She threw herself into the project, pouring all of her energy into bringing the character to life. The show became a huge hit, and Anika's performance earned her critical acclaim and a new wave of fans.
