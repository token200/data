One day, Anika received an assignment to write about a small town in rural Hungary, nestled in the rolling hills of the countryside.

For in its quiet streets and historic buildings, Anika Molnár found a sense of home and belonging – a place where she could be herself, without apology or pretension. And it was here that she would always remain, a free spirit bound to the earth by threads of love and loyalty.
