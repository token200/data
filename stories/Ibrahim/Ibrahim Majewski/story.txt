Ibrahim Majewski stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the crowded station for any sign of his contact. As a freelance journalist, he had been investigating a string of mysterious disappearances in the small town of Ravenswood, and he was determined to get to the bottom of it.

As he made his way through the throngs of people, Ibrahim's mind wandered back to the cryptic message he had received earlier that day. It read simply: "Meet me at the old windmill on the outskirts of town. Come alone." Ibrahim had a feeling that this was going to be more than just a simple interview.

He hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of the windmill, which was rumored to have been abandoned for decades. As they drove through the darkening streets, Ibrahim couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He glanced in the rearview mirror, but the taxi's interior was empty except for the faint outline of the driver's profile.

When they arrived at the windmill, Ibrahim paid the driver and stepped out onto the crumbling stone floor. The windmill loomed above him, its sails creaking ominously in the breeze. He took a deep breath and pushed open the door, calling out into the darkness.

"Ibrahim Majewski? Is anyone here?"

A figure emerged from the shadows, its features illuminated by the faint moonlight filtering through the windmill's windows. Ibrahim's eyes adjusted slowly, and he made out the face of a woman - perhaps in her mid-30s, with piercing green eyes and long, curly brown hair.

"Welcome, Ibrahim Majewski," she said, her voice low and husky. "I've been expecting you."

Ibrahim felt a shiver run down his spine as the woman approached him, her movements fluid and confident. He had a feeling that he was about to uncover a truth that would change everything he thought he knew about Ravenswood.

"Who are you?" Ibrahim asked, trying to keep his voice steady.

The woman smiled, a small, enigmatic smile. "My name is Sarah," she said. "And I'm here to tell you the story of what really happened in Ravenswood."
