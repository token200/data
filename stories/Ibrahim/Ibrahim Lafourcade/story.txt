Ibrahim Lafourcade stepped into the dimly lit caf√©, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. He spotted her sitting alone by the window, sipping on a cup of coffee, and made his way towards her.

It had been months since Ibrahim Lafourcade last saw his childhood friend, Sophia. They had grown apart after high school, each chasing their own dreams in different parts of the world. But despite the distance, their bond remained strong, and they often found themselves thinking of each other.

As he approached Sophia's table, she looked up, a hint of surprise on her face. "Ibrahim Lafourcade! I didn't expect to see you here," she said, setting her cup down.

Ibrahim Lafourcade smiled, feeling a sense of comfort in Sophia's presence. "I could say the same about you," he replied, taking a seat across from her.

The two friends chatted for hours, catching up on each other's lives and sharing stories about their adventures. Ibrahim Lafourcade listened intently as Sophia talked about her travels, her voice filled with excitement and wonder. He couldn't help but feel a pang of envy, wishing he could be out exploring the world like she was.

As the night wore on, they decided to take a walk along the river that ran through the heart of the city. The stars twinkled above them, casting a magical glow over the water. Ibrahim Lafourcade felt at peace, surrounded by the sounds and smells of nature.

Sophia turned to him as they strolled, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. "Ibrahim Lafourcade, what's really going on? You've been quiet lately," she said, her tone gentle but probing.

Ibrahim Lafourcade hesitated for a moment before answering. He had been struggling to find his place in the world, feeling lost and uncertain about his future. But with Sophia by his side, he felt like he could be honest about his doubts and fears.

"I'm just trying to figure things out," he said finally, looking at her with gratitude. "Thanks for listening, Sophia."

Sophia smiled and took his hand, her touch sending a wave of comfort through him. "Anytime, Ibrahim Lafourcade," she said, her voice filled with warmth. "That's what friends are for."
