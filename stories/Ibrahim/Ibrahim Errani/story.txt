Ibrahim Errani stepped out of his small apartment and into the vibrant streets of Marrakech, Morocco. As a renowned artisan and master craftsman, he was known for his exquisite intricate tile work that adorned the walls of palaces and homes throughout the city.

Born Ibrahim Errani in a humble family in Fez, Morocco, he had always been fascinated by the art of tile-making. From a young age, he would spend hours watching the elderly artisans at work, learning the intricacies of their craft. With dedication and hard work, Ibrahim Errani honed his skills, eventually becoming one of the most sought-after tile-makers in the city.
