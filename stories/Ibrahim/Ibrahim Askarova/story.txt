Ibrahim's story, which she wrote with meticulous research and careful attention to detail, exposed the full extent of the corruption and its devastating impact on ordinary people. It was widely shared online and in print, and it quickly became one of the most talked-about stories of the year.

As a result of her investigative reporting, Ibrahim Askarova found herself at the center of a maelstrom of attention and controversy.
