María Kovács sat alone at her small café table, sipping a cup of bitter coffee as she stared out the rain-soaked window. Her dark hair was tied back in a messy bun, and her bright green eyes seemed to hold a thousand secrets.

As a journalist, María had made a name for herself by exposing corruption and deceit in the highest echelons of power. But it came at a cost – she had few friends, and even fewer allies. The last person who had gotten close to her had been her mentor, a gruff but kind-hearted editor who had taught her the art of storytelling.

But he was gone now, silenced by a rival journalist who had accused him of embezzlement. María's eyes narrowed as she thought back on that day – she had known it was too good to be true. She had been working late, pouring over documents and records, when she realized her editor's death was no accident.

The rain drummed against the pavement outside, a relentless beat that matched the rhythm of María's thoughts. Who could have done this? And why?

Suddenly, her phone buzzed on the table. It was an unknown number – not a number she recognized. But she hesitated for only a moment before answering.

"María," a low voice said on the other end. "I know who killed your editor."

María's heart skipped a beat. She had been expecting someone to come forward, but no one had dared to speak out against the rival journalist.

"What do you want?" María asked, her voice firm.

"I have information," the voice replied. "About the Kovács family. They're not who they seem."

María's eyes snapped towards the window. What did this stranger know? Was it connected to the murder?

The line went dead, leaving María staring at her phone in stunned silence. She knew she had to get to the bottom of this – for her editor's sake, and for the truth.

With a newfound sense of purpose, María pushed back from the table and stood up. The rain might be relentless outside, but she was ready to take on whatever came next. She would follow every lead, no matter how small or suspicious. She owed it to herself, and to her editor's memory.
