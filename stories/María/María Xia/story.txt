María Xia had always been drawn to the unknown, and as a renowned archaeologist, she had spent her fair share of time uncovering the secrets of long-lost civilizations. Born in Mexico City, María Xia's love for history and exploration was ignited at a young age by her abuela, who regaled her with stories of Aztec gods and ancient myths.

As María Xia delved deeper into her research, she became increasingly fascinated with the mysteries of the Mayan jungle. Her latest expedition had brought her to the heart of the dense rainforest, where local guides claimed to have spotted a hidden temple deep within the foliage. María Xia was determined to find it, and after weeks of trekking through the unforgiving terrain, finally stumbled upon the entrance.
