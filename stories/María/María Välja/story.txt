María Välja was a force to be reckoned with in the world of Estonian folklore. As a young girl, she lived in the rural countryside with her family, where the whispers of old myths and legends still lingered in the air.

María's life took an unexpected turn when her father, a skilled woodcarver, passed away suddenly. The family was left to pick up the pieces, but María, feeling restless and unfulfilled, felt an inexplicable pull towards the nearby forest.

It was there that she met Käbi, a mysterious figure with eyes like two shimmering pools of moonlight. He spoke in riddles and whispered ancient secrets in her ear, drawing María deeper into the world of the wild.

As the years went by, María's connection to nature grew stronger. She began to sense the pulse of the land, feeling the rhythms of the forest and its creatures. Her skin took on a warm, golden hue, as if kissed by the sun itself.

The villagers began to notice the change in María. Her eyes sparkled like gemstones, and her hair seemed to grow longer, more wild, as if infused with the magic of the woods. They whispered among themselves about the "wood-sister," how she could communicate with animals and coax life from the very earth itself.

One fateful night, a great storm swept through the village, threatening to destroy the homes and livelihoods of those who lived there. María stepped forward, her eyes blazing like lanterns in the dark. With Käbi by her side, she summoned the ancient powers of the forest, calling upon the spirits of the land to calm the tempest.

As the winds howled and the rain pounded against the earth, María's voice rose above the din. Her words wove a spell of peace and tranquility, drawing in the creatures of the wild and conjuring the primal forces that had once shaped the world itself.

Slowly but surely, the storm began to subside. The winds died down, the rain slowed to a gentle patter, and an eerie silence fell over the land. When the villagers emerged from their homes to survey the damage, they saw María standing tall, her hands still outstretched as if embracing the very heart of nature.

And so, María Välja became a legend in her own time – a guardian of the wild, a weaver of ancient magic, and a testament to the enduring power of the natural world.
