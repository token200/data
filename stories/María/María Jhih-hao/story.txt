Growing up in the small town of Santurce, Puerto Rico, she witnessed firsthand the struggles faced by her community, particularly the immigrant population. Her parents, though hardworking, struggled to make ends meet, and María's desire to create change only intensified as she grew older.

After completing her studies at the University of Puerto Rico, María dedicated herself to the cause, earning a degree in law with honors.

One fateful day, María received a call from an elderly man who had been detained at the local immigration facility for weeks without any clear reason for his continued stay. The man, whose name was Juan, claimed to have been wrongly identified as an undocumented immigrant despite having a valid work visa. Intrigued by his story, María Jhih-hao decided to take on the case.

Through relentless research and networking, María discovered that Juan's situation was not isolated. Many like him had fallen through the cracks of the immigration system, subjected to inhumane conditions and denied their basic rights.
