María Liebad was a name whispered in hushed tones among the locals of Ravenswood, a quaint town nestled deep within the heart of the Carpathian Mountains. It was said that she had once lived there, but some claimed she'd never actually existed at all.

According to legend, María had been a mysterious and beautiful woman with skin as pale as moonlight and hair as black as the night sky. She possessed an otherworldly allure that drew men to her like moths to flame. But it was not just her physical beauty that captivated – María's presence seemed to carry an aura of darkness, a subtle hint of malevolence that both fascinated and repelled.

As a child, Anna would sit by the fireplace, listening to tales spun by the elderly women who had grown up with stories of María Liebad. They'd speak in hushed tones of the woman's supposed powers – her ability to heal the sick with just a touch, or curse those who crossed her path. Some claimed she was a witch, born of dark magic and cursed to roam the earth for eternity.

Anna never believed any of it, but as she grew older, she began to sense that there was something peculiar about María's story. She felt an inexplicable connection to the woman, as if their paths had crossed in another life. The further she dug into María's history, the more convinced Anna became that the truth lay hidden beneath the surface.

One stormy night, as the wind howled through Ravenswood, Anna decided to follow her curiosity down a rabbit hole of sorts. She set out on foot, driving towards the remote location where some said María Liebad had lived and died. With every step, the air grew thick with an unsettling energy that left Anna's skin prickling.

It was then she stumbled upon a crumbling cabin, half-hidden in the darkness. The door creaked as Anna pushed it open, revealing a space that seemed frozen in time. In the center of the room, on a dusty wooden chest, lay a locket bearing Maria's name – engraved with an unsettling smile etched into her face.

Anna didn't dare touch it, but instead simply turned to leave. As she did, a gust swept through the cabin, extinguishing the flickering candles and plunging everything into darkness. And in that silence, Anna felt María Liebad's presence – cold, dark, yet strangely alluring.
