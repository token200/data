Mathieu Taro stepped out of the rain and into the cozy bookstore, shaking off the droplets from his umbrella. He had always been drawn to this place, where the scent of old books and fresh paper filled the air. As he browsed through the shelves, his eyes landed on a tattered copy of Baudelaire's "Les Fleurs du Mal". Mathieu Taro, a poet himself, couldn't resist the allure of the French master's words.

As he delved deeper into the store, Mathieu Taro struck up a conversation with the owner, an elderly woman named Madame Dupont. She was known for her vast knowledge of literature and poetry, and Mathieu Taro was eager to learn more. They talked about everything from Rimbaud to Lorca, their discussions meandering through the world of art and literature.

Madame Dupont smiled as she handed Mathieu Taro a worn leather-bound volume. "I think you'll find this one interesting," she said, her eyes twinkling. The book was an old edition of Mallarmé's poetry, filled with intricate symbols and hidden meanings. Mathieu Taro felt a shiver run down his spine as he opened the cover, the yellowed pages revealing the poet's masterful language.

As the hours passed, Mathieu Taro found himself lost in the world of words and ideas. He was no longer just a reader, but a participant, his thoughts intertwining with those of the poets they discussed. Madame Dupont watched him with a knowing smile, her eyes seeing beyond the surface level to the depths of Mathieu Taro's soul.

Eventually, the store closed, and Mathieu Taro bid Madame Dupont goodnight, promising to return soon. As he walked out into the rain once more, he felt invigorated, his mind buzzing with new ideas and inspirations. He knew that he would carry the words of Mallarmé and Baudelaire with him always, their poetry seeping into his very being like a slow-moving river.

Mathieu Taro smiled to himself as he disappeared into the night, the raindrops falling around him like diamonds on black velvet.
