Mathieu Gauthier stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the cold mist of the French Riviera hanging heavy in the air. He had been away for months, traveling through Europe and Asia, trying to escape the memories that haunted him. The weight of his past lingered, refusing to be shaken.

As he made his way through the crowded station, Mathieu's eyes scanned the sea of faces, searching for a familiar one. It was a habit he'd developed after losing his sister in a tragic accident five years ago. He had always felt more at ease when surrounded by people, even if it meant pretending to be someone I wasn't.

Mathieu hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of his family's old villa on the outskirts of town. The winding road led him through olive groves and vineyards, the scent of lemons and lavender filling the air. He hadn't set foot in this place since childhood, yet it felt like coming home.

As he stepped onto the veranda, Mathieu was greeted by his mother's warm smile and the sound of the Mediterranean lapping against the shore. She invited him to join her for lunch on the patio, surrounded by old photographs and family heirlooms. The familiar sights and sounds brought a fleeting sense of peace, but it wasn't enough to shake off the darkness that had followed him for so long.

That evening, Mathieu strolled through the village, taking in the vibrant colors and lively chatter of the townspeople. He stopped at a small café, ordering a coffee and listening to the news on his phone. A new murder investigation was underway, the latest victim a young woman who had been found dead on the beach just a few hours earlier.

As he sipped his coffee, Mathieu couldn't help but wonder if there was a connection between this latest tragedy and his own sister's death all those years ago. The questions swirled in his mind like a tempest, refusing to be silenced.

The night air grew thick with humidity as the stars began to twinkle overhead. Mathieu stepped out of the café and onto the beach, feeling the cool sand beneath his feet. The waves crashed against the shore, a soothing melody that seemed to lull him into a state of suspended animation.

For a moment, the memories receded, and he was just a young man standing on the edge of the sea, lost in thought. But as he gazed out at the vast expanse of water, Mathieu knew it was only a temporary reprieve. The darkness would eventually find him again, no matter where he went.
