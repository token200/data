Mathieu Wright sat at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of bills in front of him. He was a talented artist, but it seemed like no one took him seriously. His latest exhibition had been met with lukewarm reception, and he was struggling to make ends meet.

As he sighed, his mind wandered back to his childhood dreams. Growing up, Mathieu had spent hours sketching and painting, lost in his own little world. But as he got older, the harsh realities of the art world began to sink in. He had studied fine art, moved to a big city, and even landed a few small commissions – but it wasn't enough.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was his best friend and confidant, Luna. She was an interior designer with a keen eye for style, and she often offered Mathieu advice on how to present himself to the world.

"What's wrong?" Luna asked, as she took in the sight of the bills piled high.

"I don't know," Mathieu replied, shaking his head. "I just feel like I'm never going to make it as an artist."

Luna smiled and sat down beside him. "You are making it, Matt. You're doing what you love, even if it's not paying the bills right now."

She pulled out her phone and started scrolling through art websites and social media. Suddenly, she stopped on a post from one of Mathieu's favorite artists.

"Look at this!" Luna exclaimed. "This artist is struggling too – just like us. And yet, he still manages to sell his work for thousands of dollars."

Mathieu's eyes widened as he read the article. This was what he needed to hear. He wasn't alone, and he didn't have to give up on his dreams.

With renewed determination, Mathieu picked up a pen and started scribbling notes on his whiteboard. Luna sat beside him, offering words of encouragement as he brainstormed ideas for a new exhibition.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm glow over the room, Mathieu felt a spark of excitement ignite within him. He was going to make it happen – not just for himself, but for all those struggling artists out there who needed to see that their dreams could come true too.

"I'm doing this," he said to Luna, his voice filled with conviction.

"And I'll be right here beside you," she replied, smiling. "Let's do this."
