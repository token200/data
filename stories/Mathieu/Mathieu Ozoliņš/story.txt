Mathieu Ozoliņš stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the sleepy station. As he made his way through the crowd, a sense of unease settled in the pit of his stomach. He had been running from his past for months, but he knew it was only a matter of time before he couldn't escape anymore.

Mathieu Ozoliņš had grown up with a penchant for trouble, and his latest escapade had landed him in hot water. He had stolen from the wealthy elite, using his quick wit and charming smile to swindle them out of their hard-earned cash. But this time, he had gone too far.

As he walked through the streets, Mathieu Ozoliņš couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He quickened his pace, his heart racing with every step. He ducked into a small café, hoping to lose himself in the crowd.

The barista, a kind-eyed woman with a warm smile, took one look at him and knew exactly who he was. "Mathieu Ozoliņš," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I've been expecting you."

Mathieu's eyes narrowed, his hand instinctively reaching for the wallet in his pocket. But the barista just chuckled and handed him a cup of steaming coffee. "You're not here to cause any trouble today," she said. "At least, not yet."

As he sipped his coffee, Mathieu Ozoliņš felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe this was an opportunity to turn his life around, to leave his past behind and start anew. But as he looked into the barista's eyes, he saw a flicker of something more - a hint that she knew him far better than he thought possible.

With a sense of trepidation, Mathieu Ozoliņš took another sip of his coffee, wondering what lay ahead and whether he was ready to face it head-on.
