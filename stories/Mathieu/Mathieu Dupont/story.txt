Mathieu Dupont stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station. He had been traveling for hours, and the familiar sight of the old town was a welcome relief. As he made his way through the crowds, Mathieu's mind began to wander back to the letter he had received that morning.

It was from an old friend, one who had always been close to him but had drifted apart over the years. The letter was brief, but it spoke of a proposal: meet at the old café on the outskirts of town and discuss a chance to reconnect.

Mathieu's heart quickened as he made his way through the winding streets, the familiar buildings passing by in a blur. He arrived at the café just as the sun was setting, casting a warm orange glow over the deserted tables.

The door swung open, and Mathieu's friend, Jacques, stood up from his seat, a smile spreading across his face. "Mathieu! It's been far too long," he said, extending a hand for a hearty handshake.

As they sat down and ordered a round of wine, Mathieu couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. He had always looked up to Jacques as a mentor, someone who had encouraged his love of literature and supported him through thick and thin.

"So, what's this proposal you wanted to discuss?" Mathieu asked, curiosity getting the better of him.

Jacques leaned in, his eyes sparkling with mischief. "I've been working on a project, something that could use your unique perspective. I think it has the potential to be groundbreaking."

Mathieu's ears perked up as Jacques outlined his idea: a collection of short stories, each one exploring the complexities of small-town life in France. As he listened, Mathieu felt a surge of excitement and pride.

This was exactly what he had been searching for – a chance to prove himself, to showcase his writing skills to the world. And with Jacques' support, he knew that this project could be a reality.

As the night wore on, the two friends laughed and talked, the hours slipping away unnoticed. It was clear that their friendship was far from over, and Mathieu left the café feeling invigorated, ready to take on whatever lay ahead.
