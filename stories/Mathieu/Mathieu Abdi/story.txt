Mathieu Abdi was a man of few words, but his piercing green eyes told stories of a life lived with purpose. Born to Somali refugees in a small town in France, Mathieu's early years were marked by hardship and struggle. His parents, who had fled their war-torn homeland in search of safety, worked tirelessly to provide for their family.

As Mathieu's photography skills improved, he started to take notice of the lives of those around him – the struggles, the triumphs, and the quiet moments in between.
