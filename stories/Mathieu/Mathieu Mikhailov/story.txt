Mathieu Mikhailov stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the unfamiliar streets of Prague. As an art historian, he had spent years studying the works of Czech Expressionists, but nothing could have prepared him for the thrill of finally setting foot in the city where they thrived.

A graduate student at a prestigious university in Paris, Mathieu had always been drawn to the bold colors and distorted forms that characterized the style. He spent countless hours pouring over books on the subject, analyzing the techniques used by artists like Egon Schiele and Franz Kafka's contemporaries.

As he made his way through the winding streets of Prague's Old Town, Mathieu felt a sense of wonder wash over him. Every building seemed to tell a story, its worn stone facades bearing witness to centuries of history. He stopped in front of a small church, admiring the intricate carvings that adorned its exterior.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows - an elderly woman with a kind smile and eyes that twinkled like stars. "Ah, you must be Mathieu Mikhailov," she said, her voice low and soothing. "I've been expecting you."

As it turned out, this was Frantiska, the sister of Franz Kafka himself. She had invited Mathieu to visit her in Prague, where he could delve deeper into the city's artistic heritage.

Over the next few weeks, Mathieu found himself immersed in a world of art and literature. He spent hours discussing the works of Czech Expressionists with Frantiska, who shared her own insights on the style. Together, they explored galleries and museums, uncovering hidden gems that few tourists ever got to see.

As Mathieu prepared to leave Prague, he felt grateful for the experience. His study of Czech Expressionism had been transformed by his time in the city, and he knew that he would carry the memories of this place with him forever. Frantiska smiled as she walked him to the train station, her eyes shining with a knowing light. "You will return," she said. Mathieu Mikhailov nodded, already planning his next visit to Prague - the city where art and history came alive in ways he never could have imagined.
