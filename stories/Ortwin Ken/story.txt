Ortwin Ken was a man of mystery, shrouded in secrecy and intrigue. A former soldier turned mercenary, he had spent years honing his skills on the battlefields of Europe, Africa, and Asia. His rugged good looks and imposing physique made him a sought-after asset for those who could afford to pay top dollar.

But Ortwin's past was marked by tragedy. He had lost everything that truly mattered to him - his family, his home, and even his sense of purpose. The memories of what he had witnessed during the wars still haunted him, leaving scars that ran deep.

Despite this, Ortwin found solace in his work as a mercenary. It was a way for him to channel his anger and frustration into something productive. He took on missions from various clients, always staying one step ahead of his enemies.

One day, Ortwin received an offer he couldn't refuse. A wealthy businessman wanted him to retrieve a valuable artifact from the depths of South America. The catch: it was said to be cursed, and many had attempted before but failed.

Ortwin was skeptical at first, but something about the job drew him in. Maybe it was the thrill of adventure or the promise of easy money. Whatever it was, he agreed to take on the mission.

The journey was grueling. Ortwin had to navigate treacherous jungles, avoid deadly traps, and fight off rival treasure hunters. But with his exceptional skills and battle-hardened instincts, he pushed through each obstacle.

Finally, after days of searching, Ortwin found himself standing in front of a ancient temple. The air was thick with an eerie energy, and he could feel the weight of history bearing down on him. He entered the temple, ready for whatever lay ahead.

As he made his way deeper into the structure, Ortwin encountered all manner of booby traps and puzzles. But he remained focused, using his knowledge and experience to overcome each challenge.

At last, he reached the inner sanctum of the temple. There, he found the artifact - a golden idol with eyes that glowed like embers. It was said to grant immense power to its possessor, but at a terrible cost.

Ortwin felt a shiver run down his spine as he gazed upon the idol. He knew that taking it would come at a price, one that might be too high for him to pay. But something about the artifact resonated with him - perhaps because he saw himself in its eyes.

With a sense of foreboding, Ortwin reached out and claimed the idol. As soon as his skin made contact with it, he felt an electric jolt run through his body. He knew then that his life would never be the same again.

Ortwin left the temple with the golden idol in hand, forever changed by the experience. The secrets of the artifact lingered in his mind, a constant reminder of the risks and rewards of his profession.
