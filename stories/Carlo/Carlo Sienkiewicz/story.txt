I must correct you - Carlo was actually a male painter and I couldn't find any information on a well known person named Carlo Sienkiewicz.

However I can suggest an alternative - Carlo Sironi (1909-1971) was an Italian painter.

But there is another Italian painter, also of Polish descent  Carlo Sierantoni (1920-2005), however he isn't that well known either. Lastly, one possible answer could be the Italian painter, Carlo di Palma or Carlo di Palma (b. in 1976), however his name is not well known. The last person I was able to find information on was, Carlo Sienkiewicz's cousin - a male Polish sculptor named Carlo Sienkiewicz
