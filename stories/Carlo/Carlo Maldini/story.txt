Carlo Ageno "Carlo" Maldini was known to his friends and teammates as "Il Cane Lungo," or "The Long Dog." Born on January 26, 1958, in Milan, Italy, Carlo grew up with a passion for football that would one day take him to the pinnacle of success. As a young boy, he played for local teams and dreamed of becoming a professional.

Carlo's hard work paid off when he joined AC Milan's youth academy at just 16 years old. He quickly rose through the ranks, impressing coaches with his exceptional defensive skills. Before long, Carlo was making his debut for the senior team in 1977, alongside fellow defender Franco Baresi.

As a key member of the iconic "Three-Quarter Backs" midfield trio – including Paolo Maldini (Carlo's younger brother and teammate) – Carlo helped AC Milan dominate Italian football. His partnership with Baresi formed one of the most formidable defensive duos in the history of the sport, earning the duo the nickname "Il Doppio di Milano."

Throughout his illustrious career, Carlo accumulated an impressive 647 appearances for both club and country. He won numerous titles, including five European Cups, three Italian league championships, and a FIFA World Cup with Italy.

Carlo's dedication to the sport was matched only by his humility and kindness off the pitch. He remained close to his family, particularly his brother Paolo, with whom he shared a lifelong bond through football. Carlo never forgot his humble beginnings and often spoke about the importance of hard work, discipline, and teamwork in achieving success.

After retiring as a player in 1994, Carlo went on to become an esteemed coach and advisor to younger generations of players. He continued to inspire fans with his wisdom, wit, and passion for the beautiful game, cementing his status as one of Italy's most beloved football legends.
