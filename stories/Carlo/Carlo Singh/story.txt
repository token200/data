Carlo Singh was known for his fiery temper, which often got him into trouble. He had been the president of the local cricket club in Delhi since he was 25 years old, but it seemed like every year he found himself in a heated argument with one of his teammates or opponents.

One day, as Carlo was walking out of the club's office after a particularly fiery meeting with his vice-president, he noticed a young boy watching him from across the street. The boy couldn't have been more than 12 years old, but there was something about Carlo that seemed to command attention.

As Carlo approached the boy, he was surprised to see that it was Rohan, the son of one of the club's biggest sponsors. "Rohan, what brings you here?" Carlo asked gruffly.

"I came to watch you argue with my dad," Rohan replied with a mischievous grin. "I've never seen anyone get so worked up over something as simple as cricket."

Carlo felt his face redden with embarrassment, but he tried to maintain his tough exterior. "What do you think I should do?" he asked Rohan.

"I think you should calm down and let people have their opinions," Rohan replied simply.

Carlo was taken aback by the boy's words. No one had ever told him that he needed to calm down before. In fact, Carlo had always prided himself on being able to get his way through sheer force of personality.

Over the next few weeks, Carlo found himself thinking more about Rohan's advice than he would have liked. He began to realize that maybe, just maybe, he had been going about things all wrong.

One evening, as he was walking into the club's office, Carlo spotted Rohan sitting at his desk, watching him with an expectant expression. "You know, I've been thinking," Carlo said, dropping into the chair across from the boy.

"I think you're right, Carlo," Rohan replied with a smile. "I think we should try to be more team players."

And so, Carlo made a conscious effort to change his ways. He started listening more and arguing less, and it was surprising how well it worked out. The cricket club began to flourish under his leadership, and he found that people were actually starting to respect him for the first time.

As Carlo looked over at Rohan, who was now grinning at him like an old friend, he realized that maybe it was time to trade in his tough exterior for a softer, more compassionate one.
