Carlo Lefevre stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the glittering lights of Paris. The city he had grown to love as a child was now his home, and yet he couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing.

As a detective with the French police, Carlo had seen it all - from the seedy underbelly of Montmartre to the opulent ballrooms of the Champs-Elys√©es. But despite his years of experience, he still hadn't found what he was looking for: justice.

Carlo's mind wandered back to the case that had brought him to Paris in the first place - a high-society murder that had shaken the city to its core. He had been tasked with solving it, and though he had uncovered some dark secrets along the way, he still couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to the story.

As he stood on the rooftop, the wind whipping his hair into a frenzy, Carlo felt a presence behind him. He turned to see his partner, Sophie, approaching him with a concerned look on her face.

"Carlo, what's wrong?" she asked, falling into step beside him.

Carlo shook his head. "I don't know, Sophie. I just feel like there's something missing. A piece of the puzzle that I've yet to find."

Sophie nodded sympathetically. "We'll get it, Carlo. We always do."

But Carlo knew better. This case was different - he could feel it in his bones. And as they made their way back down into the city, he couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched.

The streets of Paris seemed to close in around them, casting long shadows in the fading light. Carlo's eyes scanned the crowds, searching for any sign of trouble.

And then, just as they turned a corner onto Rue de Rivoli, he saw her - a woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She was standing on the sidewalk, watching them with an intensity that made Carlo's skin crawl.

For a moment, their gazes locked, and Carlo felt a jolt of recognition. He knew that look, that sense of purpose.

"Who is she?" Sophie asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Carlo didn't answer. He just took off running, following the woman into the heart of the city.

And as they disappeared into the shadows, Sophie fell in behind them, her eyes fixed on Carlo's retreating back. She knew that look, and she knew that she had to follow him.

For Carlo Lefevre was on a mission - one that would take him to the very edges of Paris, and beyond.
