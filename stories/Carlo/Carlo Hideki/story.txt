He spent weeks casing the joint, studying security cameras and guards' routines, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

Finally, with the stars aligned in his favor, Carlo Hideki put his plan into action. Donning a sleek black jumpsuit and mask, he slipped past the sleepy sentry and made his way to the vault.
