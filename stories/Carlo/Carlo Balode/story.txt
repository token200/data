Carlo Antonio Balode was known for his extraordinary abilities as a street artist. Born and raised in the vibrant city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Carlo had always been fascinated by the intersection of art and culture. As a child, he would spend hours watching the skilled vendors who sold colorful trinkets on the famous Copacabana Beach.
