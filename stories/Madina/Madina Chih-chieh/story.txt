Growing up, Madina spent hours sketching and painting, inspired by the works of Taiwanese masters like Wu Guanzhong and Chu Teh-Chun.

After completing her studies in fine arts, Madina Chih-chieh set out to make a name for herself in the Taipei art scene. She spent years honing her craft, experimenting with different mediums and techniques. Her unique blend of traditional Taiwanese motifs and modern abstract expressionism quickly gained attention from collectors and critics alike.

One day, Madina received an invitation to participate in a prestigious group exhibition at the National Palace Museum. Excited by the opportunity, she poured her heart and soul into creating a piece that would showcase her vision for "qi" as a living, breathing force. The result was a stunning installation featuring intricately carved wooden screens adorned with glowing LED lights.

As attendees wandered through the museum's galleries, they were drawn to Madina Chih-chieh's work like moths to a flame. Her piece seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy, as if the very essence of "qi" was emanating from it.
