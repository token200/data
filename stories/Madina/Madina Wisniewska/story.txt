Madina Wisniewska was a woman with a passion for art and music that knew no bounds. Born in Poland, she grew up surrounded by vibrant colors and melodies, which would later become the foundation of her unique style.

As a child, Madina spent hours watching old films at her father's film club, mesmerized by the performances of legendary singers like Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday.

Growing up, Madina's love for art only intensified as she discovered the works of Polish Expressionist painter, Stanislaw Przybyszewski. The bold colors and distorted forms in his paintings resonated deeply with her own creative energy, and she knew from a young age that she wanted to become an artist.

After completing art school, Madina went on to study music at the Warsaw Academy of Music, where she honed her skills as both a singer and pianist. She began performing in local jazz clubs and bars, quickly building a following among the city's music enthusiasts.
