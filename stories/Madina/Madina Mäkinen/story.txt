Her music was a testament to the power of cross-cultural exchange, with Madina Mäkinen herself becoming an ambassador for Finnish jazz around the world.

Throughout her career, Madina had received numerous awards and accolades, including several Finlandia Prizes for Music. But she remained humble and dedicated, always pushing herself to new creative heights. As she took the stage at each performance, Madina Mäkinen was in her element, lost in the music that flowed through her like a river.
