Her eyes scanned every inch of the room, taking in every detail – the faint scent of cigar smoke, the dust motes dancing in the faint moonlight filtering through the blinds, and the rustling of papers on his desk.

The next morning, Victoria Pawlak burst onto the front page of The Oakdale Observer with a bombshell exposé that left Mayor Jenkins' supporters reeling. Her fearless reporting had once again proven that she was the best journalist in town, and her name became synonymous with integrity and tenacity.
