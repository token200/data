Victoria Meier was a woman with a mind like a steel trap and a wit sharper than any razor. She had spent years honing her skills as a private investigator, earning a reputation as one of the best in the business.

Her latest case was personal - her sister, Emma, had gone missing three days ago. Victoria's phone had been ringing nonstop with friends and family members asking when she'd heard from Emma, but Victoria knew that Emma wasn't the type to leave without warning.

Victoria set out into the rain-soaked streets of Los Angeles, determined to find her sister. She pulled up to the last known location where Emma was seen - a small coffee shop on Sunset Boulevard. As she stepped inside, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee enveloped her and Victoria's eyes scanned the room for any sign of her sister.

Behind the counter stood Rachel, Emma's best friend from college. "Victoria! Thank God you're here," Rachel exclaimed, rushing to hug her tightly. "I've been trying to reach Emma all day, but she never answers my calls."

"I know," Victoria replied, taking a deep breath. "Emma always leaves a message or sends me an update on her whereabouts. She would have contacted you if something was wrong."

The two women spent the next hour sipping coffee and discussing their shared memories of Emma's adventurous spirit. As they talked, Rachel revealed that Emma had received a mysterious text message just before she disappeared - a single line reading "They're watching you".

Victoria's instincts told her that this was no ordinary case of a missing person. She made a mental note to investigate further.

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the city, Victoria decided it was time to pay a visit to the mysterious sender of the text message. A string of leads had taken her from dingy bars to upscale nightclubs, but she finally found herself standing outside a seedy office building in the wrong side of town.

With her hand resting on the grip of her gun, Victoria pushed open the creaking door and stepped inside. The fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over the drab office furniture. "Who are you?" she demanded, her voice firm but controlled.

A hunched figure emerged from the shadows - a man with sunken eyes and a scowl that seemed to be etched into his very being. "I'm someone who knows about your sister's involvement," he spat.

Victoria's grip on her gun tightened. She had suspected as much, but she was ready for whatever came next.
