Victoria Durand stepped out of the misty London morning, her eyes scanning the fog-shrouded streets. A detective with a sharp mind and quick wit, she had spent years honing her skills on the meanest of streets in England's capital. Her latest case had been a gruesome one - a string of brutal murders with no apparent connection to each other.

As she walked into the precinct, the familiar hum of activity enveloped her like a warm blanket. Victoria knew every face and every name, every trick and every trap that lay hidden beneath the surface of this city. Her partner, Jack Harris, looked up from his coffee, a hint of curiosity in his eyes.

"Find anything new?" he asked, as she dropped into her chair.

"Not yet," Victoria replied, running a hand through her short, dark hair. "But I have a feeling about this one."

Jack raised an eyebrow. He knew better than to let Victoria's instincts slide. She had a sixth sense that often led her down the most unlikely of paths.

The rest of the morning was spent pouring over evidence and interviewing witnesses. But it wasn't until she spoke with Sarah Jenkins, the victim's sister, that the pieces began to fall into place. Sarah's quiet determination sparked something within Victoria - a spark that told her this case was far more complex than initially thought.

Victoria's mind racing, she returned to the precinct and sat down at her desk. With a few swift keystrokes, she accessed an old database of cold cases and began searching for any similarities with Sarah's brother's murder. Hours passed as she delved deeper into the world of unsolved crimes.

And then it hit her - a single phrase etched in Victoria's memory since the case went cold years ago: "The Devil's in the details." Suddenly, everything clicked into place. She had her killer.
