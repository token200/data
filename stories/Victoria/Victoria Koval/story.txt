Victoria Koval stepped out of her small apartment, gazing up at the grey London sky. She had always loved this city, with its dark alleys and quaint pubs, but lately, it felt like she was drowning in its sea of faces.

As a detective specializing in cold cases, Victoria's work took her back to places where time stood still. She spent most of her days pouring over old files and interviewing witnesses who refused to speak. The latest case she was working on was that of 17-year-old Emily Wilson, who had gone missing five years ago.

Victoria's eyes scanned the small park across from her apartment, remembering the day Emily's parents had left a bouquet of flowers and a note asking for help finding their daughter. It had been a lead, a whisper in the wind, but it was all she had to hold onto.

With a deep breath, Victoria tucked her hair under her hat and walked into the station. Her colleagues knew better than to ask her about Emily; they knew the weight that kept her up at night. The only one who seemed to understand was her partner, Tom. He'd been working alongside her for years, but even he didn't fully grasp the depth of Victoria's obsession.

"Morning," Tom said as she walked into the briefing room. "Still on Emily?"

Victoria shook her head, taking a seat beside him. "Nothing new."

The day passed in a blur of interviews and paperwork, the same tired questions asked over and over again. As the sun began to set, Victoria pulled out her phone and dialed an old number.

It rang until finally, a familiar voice answered on the other end. "Victoria?"

"I think I found something," she said, trying to keep her excitement in check.

A pause, then Rachel's voice came back online. "What is it? You're not getting cold feet now, are you?"

"Emily's school records. She had a teacher who spoke out about the night she went missing."

Rachel's line went silent for a moment before she whispered, "Who was it?"

Victoria smiled, her heart racing with possibility. "Mrs. Jenkins. I need to talk to her again."

As Victoria hung up and walked back into the station, she felt a glimmer of hope that had been missing for years. Maybe this time, something would change. Maybe Emily's story wasn't just another case file in a city full of them.

Victoria took a seat at her desk, her eyes scanning the files on Emily's computer, searching for a new thread to tug on. The investigation was far from over, but Victoria knew she was one step closer to uncovering the truth â€“ and finally laying Emily to rest.
