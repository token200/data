One day, while exhibiting her art in a small gallery, Victoria met someone who truly understood her. His name was Alex, a fellow artist with a passion for social justice. Together, they hatched a plan to use their art to bring about positive change in their community. And so, Victoria Jain's journey as an artist and activist began.
