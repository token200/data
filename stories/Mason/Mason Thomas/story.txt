Mason Thomas had always been fascinated by the old antique shop on Main Street. As a child, he would often sneak in through the back door to explore the dusty shelves and peculiar trinkets on display. Now, as an adult, Mason returned to the shop frequently, searching for unique items to add to his own collection.

One day, while browsing the shop's latest shipment of vintage items, Mason stumbled upon a beautifully crafted wooden clock with intricate carvings of leaves and vines. As he reached out to touch it, the shop owner, an elderly man named Mr. Jenkins, appeared from behind the counter.

"Ah, you've found the star of our collection," Mr. Jenkins said with a smile. "That's a rare piece, Mason Thomas. It was made by a skilled craftsman in the late 1800s."

Mason's eyes widened as he examined the clock more closely. He could see the subtle wear on the wooden surface and the way the carvings seemed to dance across the face.

"How much are you looking for?" Mr. Jenkins asked, noticing Mason's interest.

"I'll give you $500," Mason replied confidently, knowing it was a fair price for such an antique piece.

Mr. Jenkins nodded thoughtfully before responding with a name that would send chills down Mason's spine: Henry Lee.

Henry Lee had been a notorious thief in the late 1800s, known for stealing priceless items from wealthy collectors and selling them on the black market. The legend of his exploits had become so infamous that some believed he was cursed, never truly able to escape his own notoriety.

Mr. Jenkins seemed to sense Mason's unease and leaned in closer. "But, Mason Thomas, I'll tell you this: if you're willing to take on the risk, I'm willing to let it go for $400. The clock comes with a warning â€“ some say it was cursed by Henry Lee himself."

Mason hesitated before making his decision. Would he risk it all for a piece of history? Or would he leave it in the shop where Mr. Jenkins could keep its dark past at bay?

As Mason walked out of the shop, the wooden clock safely in hand, he couldn't shake off the feeling that Henry Lee's spirit was watching him from the shadows, waiting for his next move.
