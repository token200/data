Mason Bak sat alone on the beach, his feet dangling in the cool ocean water as he stared out at the horizon. It had been three years since his return from war, and he was still struggling to adjust to civilian life. His parents had always been supportive, but even they couldn't fully understand what Mason had experienced during his time overseas.

As a soldier, Mason Bak had seen things that no one should ever have to see. The memories of the friends he had lost, the atrocities he had witnessed, and the traumas he had endured still lingered in his mind like an open wound. Despite his efforts to move on, Mason couldn't shake the feeling that a part of him was still stuck in the past.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the waves, Mason felt a sense of peace wash over him. He closed his eyes and let the sound of the ocean wash away some of his doubts. For a moment, he forgot about the stress of everyday life and allowed himself to simply be present in the moment.

Just then, a seagull swooped down from the sky, circling around Mason's head before landing on the sand beside him. The bird cocked its head to one side, regarding Mason with an unblinking gaze. For a moment, they just sat there together, enjoying the silence.

Mason Bak opened his eyes and smiled wryly at the seagull. "You're the only one who seems to understand me," he said, scratching behind the bird's ears. The seagull let out a soft squawk of agreement before settling in to take a nap beside him.

As the stars began to twinkle overhead, Mason Bak knew that he still had a long way to go. But with the help of his trusty sidekick – or rather, his feathered friend – he felt like he was taking one step at a time towards healing and recovery. With a deep breath, Mason stood up and walked away from the beach, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.
