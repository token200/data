Mason Bach stepped out of his small cabin, breathing in the crisp mountain air. The sun was setting over the forest, casting a warm orange glow over the treetops. He took a deep breath, feeling the stress of the past few weeks melt away.

As a park ranger, Mason had seen his fair share of wilderness adventures. From rescuing lost hikers to dealing with rogue wildlife, he'd been through it all. But this season was different. The forest seemed quieter than usual, as if the animals were waiting for something – or someone.

Mason's thoughts turned to his best friend, Emma. She'd gone missing two weeks ago, and despite Mason's search party and calls to the authorities, there was no sign of her. The investigation had yielded nothing, leaving Mason with more questions than answers.

He walked back into the cabin, pouring himself a cup of coffee from the thermos on the stovetop. As he sipped the bitter liquid, his eyes landed on a photo on the mantle – Emma smiling brightly in front of the Grand Canyon. She'd always loved nature, just like Mason.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. Mason's heart skipped a beat as he wondered if it could be someone from the investigation team with new information. He opened the door to find a young woman standing on the porch, her backpack slung over one shoulder.

"Can I help you?" Mason asked warily.

"I'm Sarah," she said, holding out a piece of paper. "I've been tracking Emma's movements before she disappeared. This was on her phone the night she vanished."

Mason took the paper and scanned it quickly. It showed a route from her cabin to a nearby trailhead – a trail Mason knew all too well. He felt a shiver run down his spine as he realized where this could lead.

Without another word, Mason grabbed his backpack and gestured for Sarah to follow him. Together, they set off into the forest, the darkness closing in behind them like a question waiting to be answered.
