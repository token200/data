Mason Sten was a man with a troubled past, one that he had carefully kept hidden from the world. A former soldier, he had seen his fair share of battles and had come out on top, but not without scars - both physical and emotional. He had tried to leave it all behind, to start anew in the small town of Willow Creek, where he worked as a mechanic at the local garage.

But the past had a way of catching up with you, and Mason's peaceful life was soon disrupted by a mysterious package delivered to his doorstep one day. Inside, he found a photograph of himself from his time in the military, accompanied by a cryptic message that read: "They're looking for you, Mason Sten".

At first, Mason tried to brush it off as a prank, but the feeling of unease lingered. He began to wonder if someone had discovered his true identity, and what they wanted from him now. As he worked on cars all day, his mind wandered back to the days of combat, and the friends he had lost along the way.

That evening, Mason decided to do some digging into his past. He scoured the internet for any information on himself, but found nothing out of the ordinary. It was as if he had never existed before Willow Creek. But then, just as he was about to give up, a strange phone call came through. A low, gravelly voice spoke only two words: "Mason Sten". The line went dead, and Mason's heart skipped a beat.

He knew then that his past was not going to stay buried for long. Mason Sten had to decide whether to face whatever was coming his way, or to try and keep running. But as he stood there in the darkness of his garage, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched, and that his life was about to change forever.
