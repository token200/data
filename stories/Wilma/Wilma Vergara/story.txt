Wilma Vergara was a brilliant and feisty engineer who had always been fascinated by the way things worked. Growing up in a family of modest means, she learned to rely on her wit and resourcefulness to overcome obstacles.

As Wilma grew older, her passion for engineering only intensified. She pursued a degree in mechanical engineering and quickly became known for her innovative solutions to complex problems. Her colleagues admired her tenacity and creativity, and her professors praised her exceptional talent.

Despite her many accomplishments, Wilma remained humble and grounded. She was fiercely loyal to her family and friends, and she always put their needs before her own. Her parents, who had immigrated to the United States from Colombia, were particularly proud of her achievements.

She was thrilled at the opportunity and threw herself into the work with characteristic enthusiasm.
