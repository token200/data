Wilma Moreno Martínez stepped off the crowded street and into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She had heard whispers of a new expat community in the city, and was determined to find out if it lived up to the hype.

As she waited in line, Wilma's mind wandered back to her childhood in rural Mexico. Her abuela used to tell stories of the strong women who worked tirelessly behind the scenes, often without recognition. Wilma had grown up with a desire to make a difference, but after years of working as an accountant in Guadalajara, she felt unfulfilled.

The barista called out her name and Wilma ordered a café con leche. As she waited for her drink, she noticed a group of women gathered at the corner table, laughing and chatting amongst themselves. Their conversation turned to the upcoming Women's March, and Wilma felt an inexplicable sense of belonging.

One of the women, a tall blonde with piercing green eyes, caught Wilma's gaze and smiled. "Mind if I join you?" she asked, nodding towards the empty chair across from her.

Wilma shook her head, feeling a spark of electricity run through her veins. The woman introduced herself as Sarah, an American expat who had recently relocated to the city. As they sipped their coffee, Wilma learned that Sarah was organizing the Women's March, and was in need of volunteers to help with logistics.

Wilma's heart skipped a beat as she agreed to lend a hand. For the first time in years, she felt like she was part of something bigger than herself. Over the next few weeks, Wilma found herself becoming more involved in the march's planning, connecting with other women who shared her passion for social justice.

As the day of the march approached, Wilma couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and purpose. She had traded her suit-and-tie job for a life of activism, and it felt like she was finally coming into her own. As she took to the streets alongside thousands of other women, Wilma knew that this was just the beginning of an incredible journey.

Sarah clapped her on the back, grinning from ear to ear. "You're one of us now, Wilma," she said, and in that moment, Wilma knew that she had found her true calling.
