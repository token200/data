Wilma Sundlof stepped into the small café on the corner of Main and Elm streets, her bright blue eyes scanning the cozy space for an empty table. As she waited, her dark hair pulled back into a ponytail, she couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her. This was where she had spent countless hours as a child, sipping hot chocolate with her grandmother and listening to tales of adventure.

The bell above the door jingled, signaling Wilma's arrival, and the barista greeted her with a warm smile. "Hey there, Wilma! The usual?" she asked, already knowing the answer. As she took her seat by the window, Wilma couldn't help but think about how much had changed since that childhood spent in this very café.

Over steaming cups of coffee and platefuls of freshly baked pastries, Wilma reflected on her life's journey so far. From small-town beginnings to city streets, she had made a name for herself as a talented writer, chronicling the stories of those around her with wit and empathy. People often asked how someone from such a quiet background had developed such a voice, but Wilma knew that it was her grandmother who had instilled in her a love of words and a sense of wonder.

As she finished her coffee and prepared to leave, Wilma noticed a young girl sitting across the room, scribbling away in a notebook. There was something about the way she hunched over, her brow furrowed in concentration, that brought back memories of Wilma's own writing days. Without hesitation, Wilma got up and walked over to the table, introducing herself with a warm smile.

"You're going to write stories that change the world," she told the young girl, before taking her advice: sitting down at an empty table by the window, and letting the words flow.
