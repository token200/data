I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Wilma Luis Borges. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created recently. If you'd like, I can create a short story featuring a character with this name.

Here is a 400-word short story:

Wilma Luis Borges stared out at the crowded market square, her eyes scanning the vibrant stalls and colorful vendors. As a skilled cartographer, she had spent years mapping the intricate networks of streets and alleys in this ancient city. But today, Wilma's focus was not on documenting the urban landscape, but on uncovering a secret.

Legend had it that a hidden map, known only as "El Mappante de la Luna" (The Map of the Moon), held the key to unlocking a powerful and mysterious treasure. Many had attempted to find the map before, but none had succeeded.

Determined to be the first, Wilma began her search by questioning the locals. She spoke with an old wise woman who claimed to have seen the map etched onto a stone tablet in the heart of the nearby forest. A young apprentice baker mentioned that his master had received a cryptic message from a mysterious stranger, leading him on a wild goose chase through the city.

Undeterred by these leads, Wilma continued her investigation, using her knowledge of cartography to decipher hidden patterns and codes. As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the square, she spotted a small inscription etched into the base of a nearby fountain.

"The map lies where shadows dance," it read.

Wilma's eyes narrowed as she pondered the meaning behind these words. Suddenly, a gust of wind swept through the square, causing the sunlight to create intricate patterns on the ground. As the shadows danced and twisted, Wilma recognized the design â€“ it was an ancient symbol, known only to a select few.

With a thrill of excitement, she reached into her bag and pulled out her trusty mapbook. With precision strokes, she began to sketch the pattern onto the page, using her knowledge of cartography to translate the symbolic language.

As the final stroke of her pen touched the paper, Wilma felt a shiver run down her spine. She knew that she had unlocked the secret of "El Mappante de la Luna." And with it, she would claim the treasure and become the greatest cartographer in all the land.
