Wilma Põld was known for her sharp wit and quick tongue in the small Estonian village of Paide. She was a woman who didn't suffer fools gladly, and those who crossed her soon learned to watch their step.

As the owner of the local bakery, Wilma's pastries were renowned throughout the region for their flakiness and flavor. However, it was her sharp tongue that truly made her a force to be reckoned with. Whether she was trading barbs with the village elder or offering advice to the young couples who came to Paide seeking love, Wilma Põld was never afraid to speak her mind.

One sunny afternoon, a group of tourists stumbled into Wilma's bakery, seeking directions to the nearby town of Tartu. As they perused the menu, Wilma eyed them warily, sizing them up before offering a curt reply: "You're looking for Tartu? It's about 20 kilometers down the road. But if you want my opinion, the real charm is in Paide – and that's where I'm from."

The tourists were taken aback by Wilma's forthright demeanor, but they soon found themselves won over by her warm smile and generous attitude. As they left the bakery with their purchases, one of them turned back to Wilma and asked, "Excuse me, miss... what's your name?"

Wilma Põld chuckled and replied, "I'm Wilma Põld, of course – though you can call me Wilma if you prefer. Now, don't be late paying for those pastries! I have better things to do than sit around all day waiting for customers."

The tourists left with full bellies and big smiles on their faces, eager to share their encounter with Wilma Põld back in the village. Word of her kindness and sharp wit spread quickly, and soon people from all over were flocking to Paide just to meet the legendary baker.

As the sun began to set, Wilma Põld sat behind her counter, a satisfied smile on her face as she watched the villagers gather outside for their evening bread. She knew that her reputation had preceded her, but she also knew that at the end of the day, it was all about providing a good product and good service – and Wilma Põld was always up to the task.
