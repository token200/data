Wilma Pētersone was a Latvian folk singer known for her captivating performances and rich, soulful voice. Growing up in rural Latvia, Wilma learned traditional folk songs from her grandmother, who had learned them from her mother before her. These songs, passed down through generations of women in Wilma's family, were woven into the fabric of Latvian culture and tradition.

As a young girl, Wilma would often accompany her friends to the countryside festivals and celebrations, where she'd watch mesmerized as older women sang with voice after voice, each one telling its own story. Inspired by these gatherings, Wilma began practicing singing at home, honing her craft under the guidance of local folk music masters.

Years went by, and Wilma's talent and dedication earned her recognition in Latvia's folk music scene. She released several critically acclaimed albums that showcased traditional songs as well as innovative compositions inspired by Latvian folklore.

Despite her success, Wilma remained committed to preserving the cultural heritage she loved. In 1992, she founded an all-women's folk ensemble called Māra Muiza – 'Sister Song.' The group brought together talented singers from across Latvia who shared Wilma's passion for traditional songs and storytelling through music.

Together, they toured extensively throughout Eastern Europe and beyond, performing to sold-out audiences. Their performances never failed to evoke strong emotions in those present, as each song told a tale of love, loss, struggle, or triumph – woven into the rich tapestry of Latvian folklore.

Through her music and work with Māra Muiza, Wilma played an important role in promoting cultural exchange between Latvia and other nations. The group's performances were always filled with warmth and authenticity, reflecting the strong bonds of sisterhood that bound them together.

Today, at 75 years old, Wilma remains active as a performer and mentor to emerging artists. Her legacy extends beyond her own work – she has inspired generations of Latvian folk musicians, encouraging them to preserve their heritage while innovating with it.

As Wilma sings in one of her most popular songs, 'Aizgādējos' ('We'll Depart'), "It's a call from the past, an invitation to remember / The songs our mothers sang – a tradition we hold dear." For Wilma Pētersone and Māra Muiza, this heritage is not just about preserving music but also a testament to the power of women in keeping it alive through generations.
