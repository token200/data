One day, Ben received a call from a wealthy collector who wanted him to restore a rare 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air. The challenge was on, and Ben was determined to rise to it. With his usual precision and care, he set to work, meticulously sanding down the paint, replacing worn-out parts, and bringing the car back to its former glory.
