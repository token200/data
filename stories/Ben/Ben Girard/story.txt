Benjamin James Girard was no stranger to the streets of New Orleans. As a child, he would often explore the French Quarter with his grandmother, who would regale him with tales of the city's rich history and vibrant culture.

Growing up in the 1970s, Ben was exposed to the harsh realities of poverty and racism that many people in the community faced every day. Despite these challenges, his family remained strong, and Ben learned valuable lessons about resilience and determination from his parents.

As he grew older, Ben became fascinated with music, particularly jazz and blues. He spent countless hours listening to legendary artists like Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith, trying to learn as much as he could about their craft.

After high school, Ben decided to pursue a degree in music education, which led him to the prestigious New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. It was there that he met his mentor, the renowned saxophonist, Sidney Bechet's protégé, Edmond "Mumbles" Jenkins.

Under Mumbles' guidance, Ben honed his skills as a musician and began performing with various jazz bands throughout the city. His talent didn't go unnoticed for long, and soon he was invited to play at some of New Orleans' most esteemed venues, including Preservation Hall.

As his career took off, Ben never forgot where he came from. He continued to perform in the French Quarter, paying tribute to the community that had raised him. He also began teaching music classes to underprivileged children, sharing the lessons he learned from his grandmother and Mumbles with a new generation.

Years later, as Benjamin James Girard stood on stage at Preservation Hall, surrounded by some of the city's most talented musicians, he couldn't help but think back to those early days exploring the streets with his grandmother. The connection between past and present was palpable, and for Ben, there was no greater joy than sharing that connection with others through the power of music.

As the night wore on and the crowd sang along to the familiar tunes, Ben's eyes scanned the room, searching for a glimpse of his grandmother, who had sadly passed away many years ago. He smiled, knowing she was watching over him from wherever she was, proud of the man he'd become and the music that continued to flow through his veins like the mighty Mississippi River itself.
