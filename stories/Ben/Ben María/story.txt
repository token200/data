Ben María had always been a free spirit, never one to be bound by conventional norms or expectations. As a child, he would spend hours exploring the woods behind his family's small farmhouse, collecting leaves and pinecones, and dreaming of far-off adventures.

As he grew older, Ben María's love of exploration only deepened. He began to venture further afield, traveling to distant lands and immersing himself in the cultures and traditions of the people who lived there. Wherever he went, he carried his camera with him, capturing the beauty and wonder of the world around him.

Despite his many adventures, Ben María never lost sight of his roots. He remained fiercely loyal to his family and community, always willing to lend a helping hand or offer a listening ear. His friends and acquaintances would often remark on his kindness and generosity, qualities that seemed almost instinctual to Ben María.

One day, while traveling through the Mediterranean, Ben María stumbled upon a small village nestled in the hills of rural Spain. The villagers welcomed him with open arms, inviting him to join in their celebrations and share in their stories. For several weeks, Ben María lived among them, learning about their customs and traditions, and teaching them about his own love of photography.

As he prepared to leave, the villagers presented Ben María with a gift: a beautifully crafted wooden box adorned with intricate carvings. "For your camera," they said, smiling. Ben María was touched by the gesture, and vowed to always cherish the memory of his time in that magical village.

From that day forward, Ben María continued to travel the world, capturing its beauty and wonder on film. But he never forgot the lessons he learned in that small Spanish village, or the kindness and generosity of the people who had welcomed him into their lives. And whenever he looked at his camera, he remembered the words of his new friends: "El mundo es un cuadro" - The world is a painting.
