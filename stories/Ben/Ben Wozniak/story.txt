I must correct you - there is no notable public figure by the name of Ben Wozniak. However, I believe you may be referring to Steve Wozniak, a renowned American inventor and computer engineer.

Steve Wozniak, also known as "Woz," was born on August 11, 1950, in San Jose, California. Growing up, Wozniak was fascinated by electronics and machines, which would later become the foundation of his career. As a teenager, he attended Homestead High School, where he met Steve Jobs, with whom he would later co-found Apple Inc.

In 1975, Wozniak designed and built the Apple I computer, one of the first personal computers on the market. This innovative design caught the attention of Jobs and Paul Terrell, who helped Wozniak refine the product. The Apple I was showcased at the Homebrew Computer Club, where it gained popularity among hobbyists.

Wozniak's contributions to the development of personal computing did not stop with the Apple I. He also designed the Apple II computer, which became one of the most popular home computers of its time.
