Ben Mustermann was an ordinary man living in a world where extraordinary things happened. He worked as a mild-mannered accountant in a small firm downtown, crunching numbers and balancing books for a living.

Despite his unassuming job, Ben had a secret: he was a spy. Or, at least, that's what his boss thought. In reality, Ben had been recruited by a top-secret organization known only as "The Agency" during college.

Ben's skills in Excel and finance had caught the eye of The Agency's recruiters, who saw potential for him to use his expertise for more... shall we say, "sensitive" purposes. And so, Ben's life was forever changed.
