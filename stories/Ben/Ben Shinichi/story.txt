Ben Shinichi was known for his mysterious past and his unyielding determination to uncover the truth behind it all. As a detective in the city of New Tokyo, he had seen his fair share of crimes and conspiracies, but none had ever captured his attention like the case that would change his life forever.

It started with a series of seemingly unrelated murders, each victim bearing an eerie resemblance to Ben himself. The killer was leaving behind a small, intricately carved stone at the scene, engraved with the phrase "I'm always one step ahead." The police were stumped, and it seemed like the case was going cold.

Ben Shinichi knew he had to take matters into his own hands. He spent countless hours poring over evidence and interviewing witnesses, but every lead seemed to end in a dead-end. Just when he thought he was getting nowhere, a cryptic message arrived at his doorstep - "Look again at your past."

Ben's eyes narrowed as he realized the message was more than just a red herring. He began to dig deep into his own history, and what he found shocked him to his core. As Ben Shinichi, he had grown up on the streets of New Tokyo, surviving by any means necessary. But there was one aspect of his past that he had never shared with anyone - his twin brother, Makoto.

Makoto's death had been ruled a tragic accident when Ben was just a child, but now Ben suspected otherwise. The resemblance between the victims and himself wasn't a coincidence; it was proof that someone was trying to send him a message.

With newfound determination, Ben Shinichi set out to uncover the truth behind his brother's demise. He followed a trail of clues that took him from the darkest alleys of New Tokyo to the highest echelons of power. And finally, after months of tireless work, he uncovered the shocking truth - Makoto had not died in an accident; he was still alive.

The killer, Ben realized, was not just anyone but a former ally turned enemy, driven by a twisted obsession with Ben Shinichi. The game was far from over, and Ben knew he would have to face his nemesis once again. But this time, he was ready. As Ben Shinichi stood tall, ready to take on the darkness that had haunted him for so long, he whispered a single phrase - "It's time for justice."
