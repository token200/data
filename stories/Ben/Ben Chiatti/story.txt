Born Benjamin Andrew Chiatti, Ben's passion for art began at a young age. Growing up in Brooklyn, he spent countless hours sketching the cityscapes that inspired him to pursue a career as an artist. After studying fine arts in college, Ben moved to Manhattan, determined to make a name for himself in the competitive world of contemporary art.

Ben's studio was a reflection of his eclectic personality – a mishmash of vintage furniture, paint-splattered canvases, and eclectic knick-knacks collected from thrift stores around the city. It was here that he spent most of his days, lost in thought as he mixed colors on his palette or applied bold brushstrokes to his latest piece.

One day, a prominent art critic stumbled upon Ben's work at a local gallery opening. Impressed by the raw emotion and energy emanating from his paintings, she wrote a glowing review that catapulted Ben Chiatti – aka Benjamin Andrew Chiatti – into the spotlight.
