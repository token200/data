Ben Tamm sat alone at the worn wooden table, nursing a cup of cold coffee. It had been weeks since he'd last seen his friends or family, and the isolation was starting to get to him. As a skilled hacker and former member of an elite cyber warfare unit, Ben had always been comfortable with solitude.

But this time felt different. The events that had led him to this small café on the outskirts of town still lingered in his mind like an open wound. The loss of his sister, who had been killed in a tragic accident involving corporate espionage, had left a gaping hole in his life.

Ben's fingers drummed against the tabletop as he stared out the rain-soaked window. His eyes wandered to a small notebook on the edge of the table, filled with scribbles and fragmented thoughts about his sister's death.

He sighed and pushed the notebook away, not ready to confront those memories yet. Instead, he focused on the phone in front of him. A message from an unknown number had been flashing on the screen for hours, taunting him with a single phrase: "Your sister wasn't what you thought she was."

Ben's heart quickened at the words, which had sent his mind spiraling into all sorts of paranoid scenarios. What if his sister had been involved in something illicit? What if her death was no accident?

As he pondered these questions, the door to the café swung open and a young woman walked in. She was dressed in a plain white t-shirt and jeans, with a backpack slung over one shoulder.

Ben's instincts told him she was trouble, but there was something about her that drew him in. Maybe it was the way her eyes sparkled with mischief or the air of quiet confidence that surrounded her like an aura.

"Can I help you?" Ben asked gruffly, trying to sound nonchalant despite his growing interest.

The woman smiled and slid into a seat across from him. "I'm looking for someone," she said, her voice low and smooth. "Someone with certain... skills."

Ben raised an eyebrow. "What makes you think I have those skills?"

The woman's smile grew wider. "Let's just say I've heard rumors about your past. About the things you're capable of."

Ben's gut told him to be wary, but there was something in her words that resonated with him. Maybe it was the sense of possibility, or maybe it was the feeling that this woman might finally be someone who could help him uncover the truth about his sister's death.

Whatever the reason, Ben found himself leaning forward, intrigued by the stranger across from him. "What do you want?" he asked gruffly, but the words felt hollow even to his own ears.

The woman just smiled and pulled out a business card from her backpack. "Let's discuss," she said, before turning on her heel and walking out of the café into the rain-soaked night.
