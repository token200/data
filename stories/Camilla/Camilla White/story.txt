Camilla White was a brilliant and feisty forensic anthropologist with a passion for solving cold cases. She had spent years studying the art of human identification, and her expertise had earned her a reputation as one of the leading experts in her field.

Camilla's latest case was particularly personal - a 20-year-old woman named Sarah who had gone missing in 2002 while walking home from work in a small town. The police had been unable to find any leads or suspects, and the case had remained unsolved for over two decades.

Determined to crack the case, Camilla spent countless hours poring over old evidence and interviewing witnesses. She was particularly fascinated by Sarah's last known photographs, which showed her wearing a distinctive silver necklace with a small pendant in the shape of a bird.

One evening, as Camilla was reviewing the case files, she noticed something peculiar - a tiny scratch on one of the photographs that looked almost like a crescent moon symbol. It was a pattern she had seen before, but couldn't quite place it.

Undeterred, Camilla decided to follow up on her hunch. She spent hours researching symbols and markings associated with various cults and organizations, searching for any possible connections to Sarah's case. And then, just as the sun was setting, she stumbled upon a reference to an obscure group known as "The Red Wing" that used the crescent moon symbol as their calling card.

Camilla knew she had to act fast - she immediately contacted her contacts in the local law enforcement agency and arranged for a meeting with the lead detective on the original case. As they pored over the evidence, Camilla began to piece together a timeline of events that seemed to point to The Red Wing as the prime suspects.

It was a breakthrough moment for Camilla - she had finally found her first real lead in what seemed like an impossible puzzle. And with her relentless determination and razor-sharp mind, she knew that she was close to solving Sarah's case once and for all.
