Camilla Yang stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the crowded station for any sign of her missing sister, Emily. It had been weeks since they'd last spoken, and Camilla's anxiety was starting to get the better of her.

As she made her way through the throngs of people, Camilla's mind wandered back to their childhood, growing up in the small town of Willow Creek with their parents. Her parents had always been supportive, but as she got older, Emily had become increasingly withdrawn, spending more and more time locked away in her room.

Camilla had tried to be patient, to give her sister space, but as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, she'd begun to worry. Where was Emily going? What was she doing?

The stationmaster called out, interrupting Camilla's reverie, and she turned to see a tall, imposing figure standing before her. "You must be Camilla Yang," he said, his voice deep and gravelly.

Camilla nodded warily, unsure what to make of the stranger. But as he handed her a small piece of paper, with a note scrawled on it in Emily's familiar handwriting, she felt a surge of hope. The note was brief, but it told her that Emily was safe, and that she would be arriving at Willow Creek within the hour.

Camilla rushed out of the station, her heart pounding with excitement and relief. As she walked through the quiet streets, she could feel Emily's presence growing stronger, until finally, she saw her sister standing on the sidewalk before her, a look of sheepish apology on her face.

"Sorry I didn't write," Emily said, as Camilla flung herself into her arms. "I just needed some time to figure things out."

Camilla held her close, tears of joy streaming down her face. She was home, and she had her sister back.
