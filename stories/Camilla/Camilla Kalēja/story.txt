Camilla Kalēja stood at the edge of the cliff, the wind whipping her dark hair into a frenzy as she gazed out at the endless expanse of turquoise water. It was her favorite place to clear her mind and find solace in the world.

As a child, Camilla had spent countless hours playing on this very beach with her grandmother, who taught her the ancient stories of their people. She had always felt a deep connection to the land and the sea, and now as an adult, she found herself drawn back to this special place whenever she needed to recharge.

Camilla's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps behind her. She turned to see her best friend, Elena, approaching with a wide smile on her face.

"Hey, Cal! I knew you'd be here," Elena said, using the nickname only she used. "I brought some breakfast."

Camilla raised an eyebrow as Elena handed her a plate piled high with pastries and fresh fruit. They sat down together, munching in silence for a moment before Elena spoke up.

"So, what's on your mind? You've been distant lately," she said gently.

Camilla sighed, feeling a weight settle onto her shoulders. "I don't know, El. I just feel like I'm stuck. My art is stagnant, and my relationships are... messy. I feel like I'm losing myself in all of it."

Elena nodded thoughtfully, taking a bite of her own pastry. "Maybe you're just trying too hard to fit into someone else's expectations," she suggested.

Camilla looked at her friend skeptically. "You think so?"

"Well, when was the last time you did something just for yourself?" Elena asked, her eyes sparkling with mischief.

Camilla thought back over the past few months – the late nights spent working on a commissioned piece, the endless emails from galleries and collectors... She realized that she had been so focused on pleasing others that she had forgotten to prioritize her own needs.

As they finished their breakfast and prepared to leave, Camilla felt a sense of determination wash over her. She knew what she needed to do – take some time for herself, focus on her art, and rediscover the things that brought her joy. With Elena's words echoing in her mind, she smiled, feeling a weight lift off her shoulders.

"Thanks, El," Camilla said, as they walked hand in hand towards the horizon. "You always know just what to say."
