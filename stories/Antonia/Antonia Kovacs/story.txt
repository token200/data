Antonia Kovacs stepped off the train and onto the platform, her worn leather boots scuffling against the metal grating. She had been on the move for weeks, ever since she'd left behind the only life she knew. As a former member of an elite special forces unit, Antonia had grown tired of the constant danger and politics that came with it. Now, she was determined to leave her past behind and start anew.

With a small backpack slung over her shoulder, Antonia made her way through the bustling streets of Budapest. She'd heard whispers of a mysterious organization that operated in the city's underbelly, one that might be able to help her find redemption. As she walked, the sounds of the city - car horns, chatter, and wailing sirens - blended together into a cacophony that was both overwhelming and familiar.

Antonia had always been drawn to the shadows, where the light of day couldn't penetrate. It was there that she'd made her name as a skilled operative, taking on missions that few others dared to attempt. But after years of living in the darkness, she'd begun to feel empty, hollow even. She knew she needed to find a new purpose, one that didn't involve constantly putting herself in harm's way.

As she turned a corner, Antonia spotted a small caf√© tucked away on a quiet side street. The sign above the door read "Vanda's" - a name she'd heard whispered in hushed tones among those who knew her. Without hesitation, she pushed open the door and stepped inside. The air was thick with smoke and the smell of freshly brewed coffee.

Antonia spotted Vanda herself, an imposing figure with piercing green eyes and a shaved head that seemed to gleam with a life of its own. "Welcome back, Antonia Kovacs," the woman said, her voice dripping with familiarity. For a moment, they just stared at each other, the weight of their shared history hanging in the air like a challenge. Then, Vanda nodded and motioned for Antonia to take a seat. "We've been expecting you."
