Antonia Garcia stared out at the worn, wooden dock, her eyes tracing the gentle lapping of the waves against its weathered planks. It was a spot she'd known since childhood, where her abuela used to take her fishing trips on lazy summer mornings. The salty scent of the ocean filled the air as she breathed in deeply, trying to hold onto those memories.

As she stood there, lost in thought, the sound of laughter echoed from behind her. Antonia turned to see her younger brother, Juan, bounding up the dock with a mischievous grin plastered on his face. He was always getting into trouble, that one – first, it was pulling pranks on their father, then sneaking out at night to explore the abandoned lot on the outskirts of town.

"Hey, cuz!" Juan called out, plopping down beside her on the creaky dock. "Mind if I join you?"

Antonia raised an eyebrow but couldn't help a smile as she glanced over at her brother's messy brown hair and bright blue eyes. They'd always been close, despite their age difference – he was only three years younger than her.

Just then, their father emerged from the small house they shared with his wife and siblings, a battered old suitcase slung over his shoulder. "Hey, kids! I've got some news to share."

Antonia's curiosity piqued, she turned back to face him, her eyes wide with excitement. Their father cleared his throat before speaking, "You both are invited to visit your abuela in Mexico City for the holidays!"

Juan let out a whoop of excitement, bouncing up and down beside Antonia as if he'd just caught the biggest fish in the sea. The thought of spending Christmas with their extended family was practically too much to handle – it had been years since they'd all been together.

The following weeks flew by in a whirlwind of preparations and packing. Antonia helped her mother bake tamales and tortillas, while Juan insisted on practicing his salsa dancing skills for the festivities. As the night before their departure approached, the house grew thick with excitement and anticipation.

Finally, the morning arrived – the day they'd set off for Mexico City, to reconnect with the people and place that had shaped so much of Antonia's life. As they boarded the bus, she felt a sense of belonging wash over her – home wasn't just where you were born, it was where your heart belonged.

Antonia gazed out at the sprawling cityscape unfolding before them, a wave of nostalgia washing over her like the ocean breeze on that dock so many years ago. It seemed as though time had paused in this moment – and all she knew was that this Christmas with their abuela would be one to cherish forever.
