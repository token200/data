One evening, after a sold-out show at the iconic Berghain nightclub in Berlin, Antonia met a fellow musician who shared her passion for experimental soundscapes. The two musicians spent hours discussing everything from noise rock to avant-garde poetry, bonding over their mutual love of sonic experimentation.

The encounter would prove pivotal for Antonia's creative direction as Echo Fade's lead vocalist. With newfound inspiration, she began incorporating electronic elements and ambient textures into the band's music, yielding some of their most critically acclaimed work to date.
