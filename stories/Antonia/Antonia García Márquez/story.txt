Antonia García Márquez sat alone at the small café on Avenida Las Américas, sipping a cup of strong Cuban coffee. She had just received news from her cousin in Bogotá that her grandmother, Abuela Mía, was passing away.

As she waited for more information, Antonia's mind wandered back to her childhood in Medellín. Growing up, Abuela Mía would regale the family with tales of her own childhood in Cartagena and the stories of their ancestors' struggles and triumphs. She had always been a source of comfort and strength, teaching Antonia how to cook, weave, and tend to the land.

Antonia's thoughts were interrupted by a soft voice behind her. "¿Qué pasa?" (What's wrong?) A familiar face turned towards her - it was Mateo, her childhood friend and next-door neighbor. They had grown up together, exploring the city streets and playing in the park. Mateo now worked as a journalist, covering local politics.

"I just heard about Abuela Mía's passing," Antonia explained, her eyes welling up with tears.

Mateo put down his cup of coffee and took a seat next to her. "I'm so sorry, Antonia. She was an incredible woman."

The two reminisced about their favorite memories of Abuela Mía - the time she taught them how to dance salsa at her birthday party, or when she took them on long walks through the historic district of El Centro.

As they chatted, a young waitress arrived with a tray of freshly baked empanadas. "¿Señorita García?" she asked politely, holding out a plate with Antonia's name on it.

Antonia smiled weakly and took an empanada from the plate. It was her favorite - filled with shredded chicken and spices. She bit into it, savoring the flavors that reminded her of Abuela Mía's love and care.

Mateo looked at her with concern, but Antonia waved him off. "I'm okay," she said. "Just need some time to process."

As they sat there, watching people walk by outside, Antonia realized that Abuela Mía had left behind a legacy not just of memories, but also of lessons and values passed down through generations.

"I'll come to the funeral with you," Mateo offered, his hand on her shoulder.

Antonia smiled, feeling a sense of gratitude towards her friend. "I'd like that."

Together, they would face this difficult time side by side, honoring Abuela Mía's memory and carrying on her legacy in their own way.
