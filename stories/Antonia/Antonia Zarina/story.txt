Born in the rolling hills of Tuscany, Italy, she spent most of her childhood surrounded by the vibrant colors and textures of the Italian Renaissance. As a child, Antonia would spend hours watching her mother paint masterpieces in their family's studio, mesmerized by the way light danced across her father's canvas.

Years went by, and Antonia's fascination with art only grew stronger. She began studying fine arts at the University of Florence, where she honed her skills under the guidance of some of the most renowned artists of her time.
