Antonia Schulz stepped out of her small apartment, taking a deep breath of the crisp morning air. As she walked to the local café, she couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. It had been three months since the sudden departure of her best friend, Sophia, and Antonia was still trying to come to terms with it.

Sophia and Antonia had grown up together, exploring the streets of their small town and sharing every secret and dream they had. After high school, Sophia moved away to pursue a career in photography, but she never forgot about Antonia. The two remained close, meeting up whenever Sophia returned home.

But that all changed when Sophia didn't show up for their scheduled monthly meetups. At first, Antonia thought it was just a busy schedule or maybe even a bad case of wanderlust, but as the weeks went by and there was no word from her friend, Antonia began to worry.

She tried calling Sophia's phone, but it went straight to voicemail. She sent messages on social media, but received no response. It was as if Sophia had vanished into thin air.

Antonia felt lost without her friend by her side. The two had always been inseparable, and now she found herself wandering the empty streets of their hometown, searching for a glimpse of the person who used to be there in every corner.

As she entered the café, Antonia spotted a familiar face behind the counter – Sophia's old photography equipment, partially set up on a small table. A sense of hope sparked within her. Was it possible that Sophia had come back?

Antonia approached the table cautiously, wondering if this was indeed Sophia who sat across from her, sipping a steaming cup of coffee and watching her with an unreadable expression.

"Hey," Antonia said softly, trying to contain her excitement. "It's really you."

Sophia looked up, her eyes locking onto hers for what felt like the first time in months.

"I'm so sorry I didn't reach out sooner," Sophia said, a hint of apology on her lips.
