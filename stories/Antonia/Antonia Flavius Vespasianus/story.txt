As she walked, the sounds of merchants hawking their wares and the clanging of hammer on anvil from the nearby blacksmiths filled the air. Antonia's eyes scanned the crowds, searching for someone – anyone – who could offer her guidance in her pursuit of knowledge.

A chance encounter with a wise old philosopher, Marcus Tullius, led to a series of conversations that would shape the course of Antonia Flavius Vespasianus' life.
