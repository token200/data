Antonia Ozolins stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted him sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee and staring out the window. It had been months since they'd last spoken, but Antonia couldn't shake off the feeling that there was still something between them.

As she approached the table, he looked up and their eyes met. For a moment, time stood still. Antonia felt a flutter in her chest as he smiled faintly and nodded at her. She took a seat across from him, trying to composed herself.

"So, Antonia Ozolins," he said, his voice low and smooth. "It's been a while."

Antonia shrugged, feeling a sense of unease wash over her. "Yeah, it has."

They chatted for a while, catching up on each other's lives. Antonia learned that he had taken up a new hobby – painting – and was actually quite talented. He, in turn, asked about her job as a journalist and listened intently as she talked about her latest investigations.

As the conversation flowed, Antonia found herself relaxing in his presence. She couldn't help but notice the way his eyes crinkled at the corners when he smiled or the way his hair curled slightly at the nape of his neck. It was like no time had passed at all.

But as the night wore on, Antonia began to feel a pang of uncertainty. She wasn't sure if she was ready to revisit the past, or if she was just getting caught up in the present moment. She excused herself to go to the bathroom and took a few deep breaths.

When she returned, he was still sitting there, his eyes locked onto hers. "Antonia Ozolins," he said softly, "I have something I want to ask you."

Her heart skipped a beat as she leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. "What is it?"

He hesitated for a moment before speaking the words that had been on her mind since their last encounter: "Will you meet me again? Maybe outside of this café?"

Antonia's pulse quickened as she nodded, a smile spreading across her face. She knew that she was taking a risk, but she couldn't deny the spark that still lingered between them.
