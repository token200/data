Mikolaj Gagnon stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar smell of damp earth and decay wafting up to greet him. He had been away for years, and the small town of Sainte-Catherine seemed even more rustic than he remembered.

As he made his way through the crowded station, Mikolaj's eyes scanned the faces of the passengers, searching for a glimpse of familiarity. It was a habit he'd developed after so many years away, and one that often left him feeling like an outsider.

He spotted a figure waiting for him by the doors - an old friend from school, Jean-Luc. The two had lost touch over the years, but Mikolaj's mind had always lingered on the memories of their time together.

"Mikolaj!" Jean-Luc exclaimed, his face breaking into a wide smile as he opened his arms for a bear hug. "It's been ages!"

Mikolaj chuckled and patted him on the back, feeling a sense of warmth wash over him. It was good to be home, if only for a little while.

As they walked through the town, Mikolaj couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia. This was where he'd grown up, where his parents still lived in the small house at the end of the street. He wondered what had become of them since he'd left - whether they were still talking about him as much as they used to.

Eventually, Jean-Luc led Mikolaj back to their old haunts, the places they'd explored and laughed together over a decade ago. They sat on the same bench, watching the sun set over the hills beyond town, and talked long into the night, catching up on lost years.

For the first time in ages, Mikolaj felt like he was home, like the pieces of his life were falling back into place. And as he leaned back against Jean-Luc's shoulder, feeling the familiar contours of his friend's body beside him, he knew that no matter where life took him next, a part of him would always be here, in this small town, with its people and its memories.
