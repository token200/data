Mikolaj Majewski stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. He had been searching for weeks, following every lead, every hint that might bring him closer to finding his sister's killer. The memory of that fateful night still haunted him – the sound of shattering glass, the scream that had frozen his blood.

As he took a seat at the bar, the bartender nodded in recognition. "Mikolaj Majewski," she said softly, her eyes filled with compassion. "I've been expecting you."

He ordered a whiskey, his mind racing with thoughts of the case. His sister, Katarzyna, had been a journalist, investigating corruption and greed in the small town where they lived. Her last article had been about a local businessman, Janek Ziobro, who had connections to some shady characters.

Mikolaj's eyes locked onto a figure across the room – a man with a scar above his left eyebrow, matching the one Katarzyna had described in her final email. He felt a surge of adrenaline as he watched the man laugh with a group of associates, sipping champagne like it was nothing.

As he approached Ziobro's table, Mikolaj noticed the man's eyes flicker towards him, a hint of unease creeping onto his face. "Can I help you?" Ziobro sneered, but Mikolaj could sense the fear beneath his words.

"I'm looking for someone," Mikolaj replied calmly, pulling out a photograph of Katarzyna from his pocket. "A woman named Janina Kowalska. Do you know her?"

Ziobro's smile faltered, and he glanced nervously at his associates. Mikolaj's gut told him that Ziobro was hiding something – but what? He leaned in closer, his voice taking on a menacing tone. "I think we need to have a little chat, Ziobro. About your sister's murder."

The air seemed to thicken as the men exchanged uneasy glances. Mikolaj Majewski had finally found a lead, and he was determined to follow it wherever it led. Tonight, justice would be served – or so he hoped.
