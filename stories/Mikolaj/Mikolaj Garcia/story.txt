Sofia took a tentative bite, and her expression transformed from skepticism to surprise. The combination of flavors was unlike anything she had ever tasted before – earthy matcha, zesty lemon, and sweet meringue all working together in perfect harmony.

"Mikolaj Garcia, you're a genius," Sofia declared, as they sat down to enjoy the tart together. "I have no idea how you do it, but I'm hooked."

As they devoured the tart, Mikolaj Garcia smiled to himself, knowing that his unique approach to baking had paid off once again. He was on a roll, and he couldn't wait to see what other culinary masterpieces he would create.
