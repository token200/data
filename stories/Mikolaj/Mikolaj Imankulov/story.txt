In the heart of Tbilisi, Georgia, a young and ambitious journalist named Mikolaj Imankulov was making a name for himself in the city's vibrant media scene.

One day, while researching a story on the exploitation of migrant workers in Tbilisi's textile industry, Mikolaj stumbled upon a shocking revelation that would change the course of his career forever.
