One fateful evening, Mikolaj Hideki stumbled upon an old antique shop tucked away in a forgotten alley. The store's proprietor, an elderly woman named Sophia, took a liking to the young artist and offered him her collection of rare artifacts. Among them was an ancient tome adorned with cryptic symbols, which sparked Mikolaj Hideki's fascination.

As he delved deeper into the book's mysteries, Mikolaj Hideki discovered that his connection to the occult ran far beyond mere curiosity.
