In the quaint town of Krakow, Poland, there lived a young and ambitious scholar named Mikolaj Faust, known to his peers as Miko for short. Miko's insatiable thirst for knowledge and understanding drove him to delve into the world of alchemy and mysticism. He spent countless hours poring over ancient texts and experimenting with various potions in an attempt to unlock the secrets of life and death.

One fateful evening, while walking through the town's market square, Miko stumbled upon a mysterious old man selling rare artifacts and curiosities. The old man, sensing Miko's curiosity, revealed himself as Krzysztof WÄ…trzynski - a wise and experienced sage who had spent his life studying the dark arts.

Krzysztof took notice of Miko's potential and proposed an offer: in exchange for a significant portion of his most prized possessions and research notes, he would teach Mikolaj Faust the forbidden knowledge of necromancy. Miko, blinded by ambition and driven by an insatiable hunger for power, agreed to Krzysztof's proposal.

Under Krzysztof's guidance, Miko mastered the dark arts and soon found himself entwined in a web of magic and deceit. His name became synonymous with terror and despair as people whispered about Mikolaj Faust, the cursed alchemist who had made a pact with the devil itself. As his power grew, so did his ego, and he began to lose sight of what was truly important.

Years went by, and Miko's obsession consumed him. He lost everything that mattered: his friends, his family, and even his own sense of self. In the end, it was not Krzysztof who had destroyed Mikolaj Faust, but rather his own hubris and ambition. Now, as he wandered the earth alone, Miko realized too late that some secrets were better left unspoken.
