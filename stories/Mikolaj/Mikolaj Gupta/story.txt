One day, while working in his bustling restaurant in New York City, Mikolaj Gupta received an unexpected visit from a young food blogger, eager to learn about the secrets behind his signature dishes. Intrigued by the young woman's passion for food, Mikolaj Gupta agreed to share his knowledge and stories with her.

As they sat down to talk, Mikolaj Gupta began to reminisce about his childhood in Warsaw, where he first discovered his love for cooking.
