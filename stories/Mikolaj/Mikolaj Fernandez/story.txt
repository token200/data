One evening, while strolling through an exhibition hall, Mikolaj Fernandez came across a young girl standing transfixed before one of his pieces. The painting depicted a dreamlike forest, teeming with life and magic. The girl's eyes were aglow as she absorbed the colors and textures of the artwork.
