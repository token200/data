Rumors swirled around the small town of Ravenswood about Andreas Ławniczak's connection to the local art scene. Some said he was a talented painter, while others claimed he was a skilled forger. One thing was certain: his artwork commanded high prices at local auctions.

One evening, as Andreas Ławniczak strolled through the town square, the flickering streetlights seemed to dance in sync with his movements.
