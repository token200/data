With each passing note, Andreas Gonzalez's connection to the music seemed to deepen, as if the notes themselves were channeling the emotions and experiences that had inspired him to create in the first place. As Echo Fade finished their set and began to disband for the night, Andreas knew that he was exactly where he was meant to be â€“ on stage, creating something new and beautiful with the people who shared his passion for music.
