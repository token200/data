Andreas Angert stood at the edge of the frozen lake, his breath misting in the crisp air. He had always been drawn to this place, where the water seemed to stretch out before him like an endless expanse of silver. As a child, he would spend hours skating on its surface, feeling the rush of wind and snow as he glided effortlessly across.

But Andreas's love for the lake went beyond mere recreation. He had grown up in a small village at its foot, where his family had lived for generations. His ancestors had been fishermen, brave men who braved the harshest of seas to bring home the catch. And Andreas, too, was born with a sense of adventure and a need to explore.

As he looked out across the lake, Andreas felt a pang in his chest. He knew that this place held many secrets, hidden beneath its tranquil surface. His grandfather had always told him stories of strange occurrences – of people who had gone skating on the ice and never returned, only to be found frozen solid in the depths below.

Andreas shivered at the thought, but he couldn't shake off the feeling that something was calling to him. He took a deep breath, and began to make his way onto the ice. The cold seeped into his bones, but he barely noticed as he started to skate.

The snow crunched beneath his feet, a familiar sound that brought back memories of his childhood. Andreas felt alive, free from the worries and troubles that weighed him down in everyday life. He glided across the ice, feeling the wind rushing past him like a whisper.

As he reached the middle of the lake, Andreas noticed something strange. The ice seemed to be shimmering, as if there was light coming from beneath its surface. Without hesitation, he skated closer, his heart pounding in his chest.

Suddenly, the ice gave way beneath him and he felt himself tumbling through a void. Andreas's world went dark, but even as he lost consciousness, he knew that this was just the beginning of an adventure – one that would take him to the very limits of his courage and wits.
