Andreas Weissner stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the familiar surroundings of the small town he had called home for years. As the owner of the local bakery, Andreas was no stranger to the routine of everyday life in the quaint town square. But today, he felt a sense of unease that he couldn't quite explain.

As he made his way through the quiet streets, Andreas couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. He had received a mysterious letter earlier that morning, addressed to him personally, with no indication of who might have sent it or what it was about. The words "The past is not forgotten" were scrawled in hasty handwriting on the page.

Andreas Weissner pushed open the door to his bakery and slipped inside, closing the shutters behind him as he began to prepare for the day's customers. But his mind was elsewhere, replaying the events of the letter in his head. He had lived in this town all his life, and yet there were still secrets that lingered in the shadows.

As the morning wore on, Andreas found himself lost in thought, his hands moving automatically as he mixed and kneaded dough for the day's bread. Customers trickled in, exchanging pleasantries with him as they ordered their usual fare, but Andreas was distant, distracted by the nagging feeling that something was about to disrupt the tranquility of his life.

Just as he was starting to think that maybe the letter had been a mistake, a figure appeared in the doorway. It was an old acquaintance from his childhood, someone Andreas hadn't seen in years. The man's eyes were piercing, and Andreas felt a shiver run down his spine as he approached him.

"What brings you back?" Andreas asked, trying to keep his tone neutral.

The old man smiled, his eyes glinting with a knowing light. "I'm here about the letter," he said, his voice low and measured. "You might want to take another look."

Andreas Weissner's heart was racing now, as he unfolded the paper from his pocket and read the words once more: "The past is not forgotten". This time, however, they seemed more than just a vague warning â€“ they seemed like a message, delivered on purpose.
