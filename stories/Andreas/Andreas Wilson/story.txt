Andreas Wilson stepped into the small café on the corner, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. He spotted Emma, an old friend from college, sitting alone at a table by the window. She looked up and smiled as he approached.

"Hey, Andreas," she said, using his full name like only a few people did. "It's been ages."

Andreas sat down across from her, ordering a cup of coffee as they caught up on each other's lives. Emma had moved back to the city after traveling abroad for a year, and Andreas was thrilled to see her.

As they chatted, Andreas couldn't help but notice how much Emma's life had changed since their college days. She spoke with a newfound confidence and authority, having pursued a career in journalism. He felt a twinge of envy, remembering his own struggles to find direction after graduation.

Emma seemed to sense his unease and reached out, placing a reassuring hand on his arm. "Andreas, you're doing great," she said softly. "You've always had a way with people. You just need to believe in yourself more."

Andreas smiled, feeling a surge of gratitude towards his friend. Emma had always been someone who could see beyond the surface level, and her words meant a lot coming from her.

As they sipped their coffee, Andreas found himself opening up to Emma about his own struggles. He confided in her about his feelings of restlessness and uncertainty, feeling like he was stuck between different paths. Emma listened attentively, offering words of encouragement and support.

It was moments like these that reminded Andreas why he valued his friendship with Emma so much. She saw him as a person, not just a friend or acquaintance – she saw the fullness of his being, including all its complexities and quirks. And in return, Andreas felt seen and understood by her, a sense of connection that transcended words.

As they finished their coffee and parted ways, Andreas smiled at Emma, feeling grateful for her presence in his life. "Thanks for listening," he said, using her full name once more to express his appreciation.

Emma smiled back, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "Anytime, Andreas Wilson."
