Andreas Szabó stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of familiarity. As he made his way through the crowds, a familiar face caught his attention - it was his old friend, László.

László, now in his mid-twenties, looked just as ruggedly handsome as Andreas remembered him from their university days. "Andreas! It's been ages!" he exclaimed, embracing his friend warmly.

The two men had grown up together in the small town of Szeged, Hungary, where they had shared countless nights spent exploring the local bars and cafes, dreaming of adventure beyond their tiny corner of Europe. After completing their degrees in engineering, Andreas had set out to make a name for himself in Budapest, while László had opted for a more nomadic lifestyle, traveling the world and working odd jobs to support himself.

As they caught up on old times, László filled Andreas in on his latest exploits - from hiking through the Himalayas to volunteering at refugee camps in Africa. Andreas listened intently, feeling a pang of jealousy that he had never been able to pursue such adventures himself. He had stuck with what was familiar and safe, working as an accountant in a small firm.

But despite their differing paths, the two friends still shared a deep bond. They spent the next few days exploring Budapest together, visiting museums and galleries, and reminiscing about old times. Andreas couldn't help but feel grateful for László's presence in his life - he had always been the wild card, the one who pushed him to take risks and try new things.

As they sat on a hill overlooking the Danube River, watching the sunset paint the sky with hues of pink and gold, Andreas turned to László and said, "You know, I've been thinking - maybe it's time for me to make some changes." László grinned mischievously. "I knew you had it in you, my friend!"
