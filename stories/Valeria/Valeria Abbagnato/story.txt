Valeria Abbagnato was known for her razor-sharp wit and icy demeanor, but behind closed doors, she was a vulnerable soul. A renowned art critic and curator, she had spent years honing her craft in the cutthroat world of modern art.

Her latest exhibition at the prestigious Bellavista Gallery was set to be her magnum opus – a collection of works by the enigmatic Italian artist, Alessandro Bianchi. Rumors swirled that Bianchi's art was cursed, bringing misfortune to those who dared to exhibit it. But Valeria saw only potential.

As she carefully selected each piece for the exhibition, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The paintings seemed...almost alive. She brushed off her doubts, attributing them to her own exhaustion. After all, this was the culmination of years of tireless work.

The night of the opening, the gallery buzzed with the city's elite. Valeria mingled, shaking hands and exchanging small talk as she waited for the first pieces to be unveiled. When Bianchi himself arrived, a lanky figure in a worn leather jacket, she felt an electric jolt run through her body.

"Ah, grazie mille, Signorina Abbagnato," he said with a faint smile, his eyes locking onto hers like cold steel. "I see you have taken care to create...an atmosphere."

As the evening wore on and the crowd dispersed, Valeria began to notice strange occurrences. A single flower would appear in an empty corner of the room; a whispered phrase would echo through the gallery. She dismissed it as her imagination, but deep down, she felt like something was watching her.

One piece, however – Bianchi's hauntingly beautiful "La Notte" – seemed particularly out of place. Its somber colors and pulsing energy made her skin prickle with unease. That night, as she stood alone before the painting, she swore she saw a figure in the shadows – Alessandro himself.

She spun around, searching for an exit, but the room had transformed into an endless expanse of darkness. The air was heavy with secrets and whispers that seemed to emanate from "La Notte" itself. Valeria knew then that some mysteries were better left unsolved. She carefully closed the gallery, locking Bianchi's work away like a prison.

The world would never understand her choices – but Valeria Abbagnato understood herself well enough.
