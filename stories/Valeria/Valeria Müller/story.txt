Valeria Müller was a 25-year-old artist with a passion for painting and a knack for storytelling through her art. She had grown up in a small town surrounded by rolling hills and vast open spaces, which had inspired her to explore the world beyond her horizons.

After completing her degree in fine arts, Valeria had moved to the city to pursue her dreams of becoming a successful artist. She spent countless hours honing her skills, experimenting with different techniques, and learning from her mistakes.
