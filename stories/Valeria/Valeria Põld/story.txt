Valeria Põld was a Estonian artist known for her striking and thought-provoking installations that often explored themes of nature, identity, and the human condition. Born in the remote village of Alatskivi, where she spent much of her childhood surrounded by rolling hills and forests, Valeria's work seemed to be deeply rooted in the natural world.

Her most famous piece, "Tahju", or "Knowledge", was a stunning installation made from hundreds of handmade wooden boxes. Each box was adorned with intricate patterns and symbols that told the stories of the old country: myths, legends, and historical events. The boxes were then arranged in a seemingly haphazard pattern on a large wooden platform, creating an immersive environment that invited viewers to explore and uncover its secrets.

Valeria's work was not without controversy, however. Some critics accused her of romanticizing Estonian folklore and ignoring the country's complex history. Others saw her installations as shallow attempts to celebrate nostalgia for a bygone era. But Valeria remained steadfast in her vision, believing that art should be a reflection of life itself, with all its complexities and contradictions.

Despite these criticisms, Valeria's work continued to gain international recognition. Her exhibitions were met with critical acclaim and drew crowds from around the world. She became an icon for Estonian contemporary art, and her name was on everyone's lips: artists, curators, collectors, and enthusiasts alike.

One of her most recent pieces, "Nadala", or "Nature's Voice", took viewers on a journey through the soundscape of the forest. Using a combination of field recordings, soundscapes, and carefully crafted wooden instruments, Valeria created an immersive experience that transported listeners to the heart of the woods. The installation was met with standing ovations at its debut in Tallinn, and solidified Valeria's reputation as one of the most innovative and visionary artists working today.

Valeria Põld continued to create installations that challenged and inspired her audiences, drawing them into a world of discovery and exploration. Her work remained deeply rooted in Estonian culture, but also spoke to universal themes of identity, community, and our place within the natural world.
