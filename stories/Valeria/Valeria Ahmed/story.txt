Valeria Ahmed sat at her desk, staring blankly at the stack of files in front of her. As the lead investigator on the department's cold case team, she had seen her fair share of unsolved murders and disappearances. But none of them had ever left a mark on her like the Smith case.

It was five years ago when 25-year-old Sarah Smith vanished after leaving work one evening. Her parents had reported her missing, and Valeria had been assigned to the case. Despite their best efforts, no one had ever seen or heard from Sarah again.

As she sifted through the files, a particular document caught her eye. A security camera had caught a glimpse of Sarah's car parked outside a seedy bar on the outskirts of town that night. The image was grainy, but Valeria recognized the car as belonging to a known associate of a notorious local gangster.

She couldn't shake off the feeling that she was missing something. She decided to pay a visit to the bar and see if anyone remembered Sarah or the night she disappeared. As she walked in, the dim lighting and musty smell hit her like a punch to the gut.

The bartender looked up as Valeria approached. "Can I help you?" he asked gruffly. Valeria flashed her badge. "I'm investigating a cold case from five years ago," she said gently. "A woman named Sarah Smith disappeared after leaving work that evening."

The bartender shifted uncomfortably in his seat. "I don't know anything about it," he lied.

Valeria's eyes narrowed. She wasn't buying it. After a few minutes of quiet questioning, the bartender finally cracked. He told her that Sarah had come to the bar on the night she disappeared, looking nervous and scared. "She was asking questions," he said. "About something."

Something clicked into place in Valeria's mind. She asked him who Sarah had been asking about, and the bartender hesitated before telling her.

"She was looking for someone named 'V'," he said quietly.
