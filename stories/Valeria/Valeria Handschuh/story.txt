Despite her success, Valeria remained humble and grounded. She continued to paint from the heart, pouring her emotions onto canvas in bold, expressive strokes. Her work was a reflection of her own experiences as a woman in a male-dominated field – she had faced many challenges along the way, but she never let them hold her back.

Valeria's art studio became a hub for like-minded artists and creatives. She hosted workshops and exhibitions, sharing her knowledge and passion with others. Her enthusiasm was infectious, inspiring a new generation of women to pursue careers in the arts.
