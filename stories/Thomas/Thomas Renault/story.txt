Thomas Renault stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the glittering cityscape. He lit a cigarette, feeling the familiar rush of nicotine coursing through his veins. It was moments like these that he felt most alive.

As a high-stakes art dealer, Thomas had made a name for himself in the underworld of New York's art scene. His keen eye and ruthless business tactics had earned him the respect of collectors and artists alike. But it came at a cost - Thomas knew the darker corners of his own soul, and he wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty.

The phone on his hip buzzed, breaking the silence. "Thomas?" A low, husky voice spoke, sending a shiver down his spine. It was Sophia, his longtime associate and partner in crime.

"Sophia, what have you got for me?" Thomas's eyes scanned the rooftops below, searching for any signs of danger.

"I've got news about the Picasso," she whispered, her words dripping with excitement. "It's going to sell at the auction house tonight, but I think we can get a better price than anyone else."

Thomas's mind was already racing with possibilities. He could feel the thrill of the hunt coursing through his veins - this was what he lived for.

He flicked the cigarette butt over the edge, watching as it fell to the pavement far below. The city lights twinkled like diamonds, and Thomas felt a sense of excitement wash over him.

"Alright, Sophia," he said, already moving towards the stairs that led down to the streets below. "Let's go get this art."

As they descended into the night air, Thomas couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. He glanced at his watch - it was going to be a long night.

They arrived at the auction house, Thomas and Sophia posing as anonymous bidders. The room was thick with tension as the lots were opened one by one, each sale sparking a chorus of "ohs" and "ahs".

Thomas's eyes locked onto the painting he wanted - "Les Femmes d'Alger", a rare Picasso that would set him up for life.

He raised his paddle, his voice barely above a whisper. "I'll give you three million dollars."

The room held its collective breath as the auctioneer counted down from ten. When Thomas's bid was announced, he felt a rush of triumph - they had it in the bag.

As they left the auction house with their prize, Thomas couldn't help but feel that tonight was going to be one for the books.
