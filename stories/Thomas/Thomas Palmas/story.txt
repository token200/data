One day, Thomas Palmas received a visit from the wealthy socialite, Sophia Grant, who had been targeted by a series of eerie occurrences at her estate. Doors would slam shut on their own, and strange noises echoed through the halls at night. Desperate for answers, Sophia implored Thomas Palmas to investigate.

With his trusty magnifying glass in hand, Thomas Palmas set out to unravel the mystery. He began by questioning the staff, searching for any inconsistencies in their alibis or motives.

Thomas Palmas's instincts told him that Maria was hiding something. He decided to pay her another visit, this time with a more deliberate tone. "Maria," he began, his voice low and even, "I've been watching you closely. I think it's time we had a little chat."
