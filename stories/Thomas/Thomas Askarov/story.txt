Thomas Askarov was a man with a mysterious past, shrouded in secrecy and intrigue. Few knew much about him beyond his imposing physique and piercing green eyes. He worked as a private investigator, taking on cases that the local police department deemed too difficult or too peculiar.

One day, Thomas Askarov received a call from a wealthy businessman named Marcus, who was desperate to find a stolen artifact. The item, a priceless gemstone necklace, had been pilfered from his mansion the previous night. Desperate for its return, Marcus offered Thomas Askarov a handsome sum of money to retrieve the necklace.

Thomas Askarov accepted the case and began to investigate. He spoke with the staff at Marcus's mansion, asking questions about any suspicious activity on the night of the theft. The maids seemed nervous, but Thomas Askarov couldn't quite put his finger on why. He decided to follow up with further questioning another day.

The next morning, Thomas Askarov received a cryptic message from an anonymous source claiming to have information about the stolen necklace. The note read: "Look to the staff, not the guests." Intrigued, Thomas Askarov paid a visit to Marcus's mansion once again. This time, he decided to snoop around the staff quarters.

As he rummaged through cupboards and drawers, Thomas Askarov stumbled upon a hidden safe. Inside, he found a small note addressed to him. The message read: "You'll find what you're looking for in the garden." Puzzled, Thomas Askarov ventured into the garden, searching for any clues that might lead him to the stolen necklace.

In a hidden corner of the garden, Thomas Askarov discovered a set of footprints leading to a nearby shed. He cautiously approached the shed and found the stolen necklace, nestled among some old gardening tools. As he held the gemstone in his hand, Thomas Askarov couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction at having solved the case.

Thomas Askarov returned the necklace to Marcus, who was overjoyed to have it back. The businessman thanked him profusely and offered to increase Thomas Askarov's fee. Thomas Askarov smiled quietly to himself, knowing that his work as a private investigator had once again paid off.
