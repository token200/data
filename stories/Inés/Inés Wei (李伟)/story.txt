Inés Wei, or Lee Wei as she was known in her native Taiwan, had always felt like an outsider in her own family. Growing up, she was the product of a cultural divide between her Taiwanese heritage and her American upbringing. Her mother, a Taiwanese immigrant, had married a successful businessman who had raised Inés and her siblings as Americans.

Inés struggled to reconcile her dual identities, often feeling lost between two worlds. She had always been drawn to art, but her parents encouraged her to pursue a more practical career in business like the rest of her family. Feeling stifled, she turned to photography instead, using it as an outlet for her emotions and experiences.

After high school, Inés traveled to Asia and Europe, capturing the vibrant colors and textures of unfamiliar cities through her lens. She began to see herself as a photographer, not just a businesswoman or daughter. Her work was met with critical acclaim, but she couldn't shake off the feeling that something was missing.

One day, while on assignment in Taiwan, Inés received an invitation from her estranged grandfather, who had passed away years ago. He wanted to meet her, finally, after all these years. Inés hadn't seen him since childhood, and the thought of meeting her absent father figure was both thrilling and terrifying.

She accepted the invitation and returned to Taiwan, where she was greeted with open arms by a group of relatives who had always supported her artistic pursuits. Her grandfather listened intently as she showed him her photographs, his eyes lighting up with pride and nostalgia.

Inés realized that she didn't have to choose between two worlds; she could bridge the gap between them, using her art to tell the stories of her heritage and culture. With renewed passion and purpose, she continued to capture the beauty and diversity of Asia through her lens, no longer feeling like an outsider in her own family.

As she looked through her grandfather's eyes at her photographs, Inés knew that she had found a sense of belonging – not as a Taiwanese or American, but as a photographer, and as herself.
