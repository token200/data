Inés Bauer stood at the edge of the lake, her eyes fixed on the reflection of the moonlit sky. She had always felt a connection to this place, where the water lapped gently against the shore and the trees towered above like sentinels.

As a child, Inés would spend hours playing by the lake, chasing after fish and watching the stars twinkle to life in the evening sky. Her family had owned the small cabin on the lake's edge for generations, and it was here that she felt most at home.

But Inés wasn't like other people. She had a secret: she could hear the whispers of the past. It started when she was a teenager, after her grandmother's passing. At first, it was just a faint humming in her ear, but as time went on, she began to make out words and phrases carried on the wind.

As she grew older, Inés learned to tune in to these whispers, to listen for the stories of those who had lived before her. She heard tales of love and loss, of triumph and tragedy. And with each passing year, the whispers grew louder, more insistent.

Tonight was one such night. The wind carried the soft murmur of a woman's voice, reciting an old poem in a language Inés couldn't understand. But as she listened, the words began to shift and change, taking on a new meaning. It was a love song, sung by a young couple who had strolled along this very shore.

Inés felt a shiver run down her spine as she turned to face the water. The moon cast eerie shadows on the lake's surface, but she saw no reflections of the woman in white silk and blue ribbons, singing to the one who waited for her on the shore.

She closed her eyes, feeling the whispers grow louder, more urgent. And when she opened them again, the words were clear: "Wait for me," they whispered. "Forever and always."

Inés smiled, a small smile that barely showed on her face. She knew what it was like to wait for someone, to be patient in love's slow dance. But as the whispers faded into the night air, she felt something else, too – a sense of longing that went beyond words.

For tonight, at least, Inés was alone by the lake.
