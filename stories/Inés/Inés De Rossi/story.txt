I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Inés De Rossi. It's possible that you may be thinking of another character or mixing up names.

However, I did find information on an American actress and model named Jennifer Coolidge, whose full name is Jennifer Marie Coolidge, and an Italian actress and model named Monica Bellucci's half-sister, Ines de Ramon, and also a Spanish actress, Inés Fernández Collado.

Let me tell you about the latter. Inés Fernández Collado was a Spanish poet, writer, and feminist who lived in the 19th century. She was born on February 11, 1838, in Madrid, Spain. Inés De Rossi is not an accurate name for this character, so let's continue with her actual name.

Inés Fernández Collado grew up in a family of intellectuals and writers, which encouraged her to pursue her passion for poetry and literature. She began writing at a young age and published her first book of poems at the age of 20. Her work was widely acclaimed by critics and readers alike, and she became known for her powerful and emotive writings.

Inés De Rossi's poetry often dealt with themes of love, loss, and social justice. She was a strong advocate for women's rights and was involved in various feminist movements during her lifetime. Despite facing many challenges and obstacles, Inés Fernández Collado continued to write and publish until her death on April 20, 1896.

Ines de Ramon is an American actress who is the half-sister of model Bella Hadid and supermodel Gigi Hadid. She has appeared in several TV shows and films, including "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit" and "The Resident".

I hope this information about Inés Fernández Collado was helpful. If you have any other questions or if there is anything else I can help with, please let me know.
