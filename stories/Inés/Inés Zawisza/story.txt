Inés Zawisza stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the crowded station. She had been on the move for days, always looking over her shoulder, never staying in one place for too long. Her past was a complicated web of secrets and lies, and she wasn't about to let anyone get close enough to unravel it.

As she made her way through the throngs of people, Inés Zawisza's gaze landed on a small café tucked away in a corner of the station. She had been drawn to the warm glow of the lanterns and the enticing aroma of freshly brewed coffee. It was the perfect place to blend in and gather her thoughts.

She pushed open the door and slipped inside, taking a seat at a small table by the window. The barista, a friendly young woman with bright pink hair, greeted her warmly and asked what she wanted to drink. Inés Zawisza smiled and ordered a black coffee, savoring the rich flavors as she gazed out into the station.

As she sat there, lost in thought, a figure caught her eye across the room. A man with piercing blue eyes and jet-black hair was sitting at a table by the window, his face bathed in the soft light of the lanterns. Inés Zawisza felt a shiver run down her spine as their eyes met, but she quickly looked away, unsure what to make of this unexpected encounter.

The man stood up and approached her table, his movements fluid and confident. "Mind if I join you?" he asked, his voice low and smooth. Inés Zawisza hesitated for a moment before nodding, intrigued despite herself. As they introduced themselves – his name was Lucas, by the way – she couldn't help but wonder how he knew her.

But for now, she decided to play it cool, ordering another coffee as Lucas sat down beside her. They chatted easily about everything and nothing, their conversation flowing like a gentle stream. Inés Zawisza found herself relaxing in his presence, feeling an unusual sense of calm wash over her.

As the minutes ticked by, she began to wonder if perhaps this chance encounter might be exactly what she needed – a respite from her constant running and hiding. Maybe, just maybe, Lucas was someone who could help her unravel the tangled threads of her past, someone who could see beyond the façade and help her find a new sense of purpose.

Only time would tell, but for now, Inés Zawisza was willing to take a chance on this stranger, and see where their unlikely friendship might lead.
