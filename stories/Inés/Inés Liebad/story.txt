Inés Liebad stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of familiarity. It had been months since she'd last set foot in this city, and yet the memories still lingered. She spotted a figure huddled in the corner, their back to her.

As Inés approached, the stranger slowly turned, revealing a young man with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. His gaze locked onto hers, and for an instant, time stood still.

"Alex?" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the hum of conversation.

The man nodded, his expression unreadable. "Inés."

They exchanged awkward smiles, the tension between them palpable. Inés had thought she'd left this part of her life behind, but Alex's presence brought it all flooding back.

It was 2015 when they'd met at an art gallery in Berlin. Both struggling artists, they'd bonded over their shared passion for the unconventional and the avant-garde. Their relationship had been intense, if short-lived – lasting a mere six months before Alex vanished without warning.

Inés had spent years trying to piece together what had driven him away. Some said he was haunted by demons from his past; others claimed he'd simply lost interest in their creative pursuits. The truth remained elusive, leaving Inés with more questions than answers.

As they sipped their coffee, the silence between them grew heavier. Alex broke it first, asking about her current work as a painter. Inés spoke of her struggles to find inspiration in a world that seemed increasingly commercialized and superficial. Alex listened intently, his eyes lighting up with understanding.

Their conversation flowed effortlessly, as if no time had passed at all. It was as if they'd never been apart. Yet, beneath the surface, Inés sensed a tension building – a reminder that life had taken them down different paths.

As their meeting drew to a close, Alex handed her a small package wrapped in brown paper. "I found this on my doorstep last week," he said, his voice tinged with uncertainty. "I thought of you."

Inside the package lay a sketchbook, its cover adorned with Inés's signature style – bold lines and vibrant colors. A note from Alex accompanied it: "To spark your creativity when inspiration dwindles. I still believe in us, even if we've lost our way."

Inés smiled, feeling a glimmer of hope she hadn't felt in years. Perhaps, just perhaps, their connection was more resilient than she thought. As they parted ways, Inés knew that this chance encounter would be the start of something new – an exploration of what could have been, and maybe, just maybe, what was yet to come.
