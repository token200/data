Inés Jankowska stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Léa, sipping on a cup of coffee in the corner, and made her way over.

"Hey, Inés! Long time no see," Léa said with a smile as Inés sat down across from her.

Inés Jankowska laughed, "I know, I've been MIA for ages. Work has been crazy lately."

Léa raised an eyebrow, "Crazy? That's one way to put it. I've seen you run marathons at this rate."

Inés chuckled and shook her head, "Okay, maybe not that fast. But seriously, how have you been?"

The two friends chatted for hours, catching up on each other's lives. Inés Jankowska talked about her latest art project, a series of paintings inspired by the Polish folk culture she grew up with.

Léa listened intently, her eyes lighting up as Inés described her creative process. "I love it," Léa said, "you're so talented."

Inés blushed, feeling a little self-conscious about her artistic endeavors. But Léa's praise made her feel more confident. Maybe she was onto something with this new series.

As the night wore on, the café began to close, and Inés Jankowska realized she had to get going soon. She reluctantly said goodbye to Léa and stepped out into the cool night air.

As she walked home, Inés thought about her life and all its complexities. Her parents had immigrated to France when she was a child, leaving behind their Polish heritage. But as an artist, Inés Jankowska felt a deep connection to that culture, one that she sought to express through her art.

She smiled to herself, feeling grateful for Léa's friendship and support. With renewed energy and inspiration, Inés Jankowska looked forward to the next chapter in her artistic journey.

As she drifted off to sleep that night, Inés Jankowska knew that no matter what lay ahead, she would always carry a piece of Poland with her.
