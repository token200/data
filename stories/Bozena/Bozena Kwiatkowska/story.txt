Bozena Kwiatkowska was known for her unique blend of artistic expression and scientific curiosity. A renowned botanist by day, she spent her evenings lost in the world of abstract art. Her paintings were not just vibrant representations of flowers, but also held deep symbolism and meaning.

One fateful evening, while pouring over her notes on rare plant species, Bozena received an unexpected visit from a young girl named Sophia.
