Her full name, Bozena Yusuf, reflected her rich cultural background, with "Bozena" being a Czech name passed down from her mother's side and "Yusuf" a common Egyptian surname shared by many in her community.

Growing up in Cairo, Egypt, Bozena was surrounded by the colors and patterns of African textiles, which later influenced her artwork.
