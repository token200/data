Felix Lehtonen stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the small station in the Finnish countryside. He had been away for months, but it felt like just yesterday he was leaving this place behind. As a young boy, he had spent countless summers here with his grandmother, listening to her stories of the land and its people.

Now, Felix was back for another reason: to find solace. The city had become too much for him, the noise and chaos suffocating. He needed the quiet, the peace that only this place could provide.

Felix made his way through the station, nodding hello to the familiar faces of the locals. They knew him, the stranger who came back every year, always with a story or two to share. Some wondered if he was running from something, others thought he was running towards something. Felix didn't care what they thought; all that mattered was that he had come home.

He walked up the path to his grandmother's cottage, the one place where he felt truly at ease. She opened the door with a smile and invited him in for coffee and a warm welcome.

As they sat by the window, watching the sun set over the forest, Felix told her about his adventures. About the friends he had made in the city, the jobs he had taken on, the things he had seen. His grandmother listened intently, her eyes sparkling with interest.

But as the night wore on, Felix began to open up about why he was really here. About how he felt lost and alone, like a leaf torn from its branch without knowing where it belonged. His grandmother listened attentively, her expression softening into understanding.

When Felix finished speaking, she took his hand in hers and looked him straight in the eye. "You're not just running from something, Felix," she said softly. "You're running towards home."

Felix felt a weight lift off his shoulders as he gazed at his grandmother's wise face. For the first time in months, he felt like he was exactly where he needed to be. And as they sat together by the fire, watching the stars twinkle to life above, Felix knew that this summer would be one of healing and growth, not running from his past, but towards a brighter future.
