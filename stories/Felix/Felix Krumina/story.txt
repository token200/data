Felix Krumina stepped out of the misty rain and onto the damp pavement, his eyes scanning the deserted streets of the city. A former member of an elite organization known as "The Umbra Collective," Felix had thought he'd left that life behind for good. But the memories of his past continued to haunt him.

As a young adult, Felix Krumina had been recruited by The Umbra Collective, a group of highly skilled operatives trained in espionage, sabotage, and infiltration.
