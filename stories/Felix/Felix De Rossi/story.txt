Felix De Rossi was known for his unparalleled skills as a getaway driver, but few people knew that behind the wheel, he was also a recluse with a soft spot for stray cats.

After a string of high-profile jobs in New York City's underworld, Felix had decided to leave it all behind and start fresh. He sold his prized 1969 Mustang, the one that had been his trusty sidekick on countless adventures, and bought a small beachside bungalow in Miami.

The only thing Felix kept from his old life was his extensive collection of stray cat figurines. They adorned every shelf and mantle of his new home, a constant reminder of the connections he'd made along the way. Stray cats had been his confidants, his partners-in-crime, and even his surrogate family.

One stormy night, Felix received an unusual request from an old acquaintance: a famous socialite was in town for a high-profile charity gala, but she'd gone missing, and her entourage couldn't find her anywhere. She had a pet cat with her, but the cat was now alone on her empty yacht, bobbing aimlessly off the coast.

Felix hesitated for a moment before accepting the job. He agreed to meet the socialite's team at dawn and help find her, just as soon as he'd finished his morning coffee and checked on his feline friends.

As Felix sped through Miami streets in his sleek, black sedan, he spotted something odd – a tiny ball of fluff clinging to the backseat window. He pulled over and coaxed it inside with a can of tuna.

Once Felix reached the yacht, he found the socialite's cat, Luna, meowing pitifully on the deck. Felix carefully lifted her into his arms, feeling an unexpected pang of responsibility. When he finally located the missing socialite – hiding in a storage room to avoid her husband's demands – Felix gently handed over Luna.

The grateful socialite asked him what had driven him to help her cat find its owner. Felix shrugged, smiling wistfully as he watched Luna curl up on his shoulder. "Somebody's got to do it," he said with a wink, and slipped away into the night, leaving behind another trail of his own unassuming legend.

That evening, when Felix settled down in his bungalow, he gazed at his row of stray cat figurines, feeling a sense of belonging for the first time since leaving New York. He scratched Luna's ears, now safely back with her owner, and whispered to himself, "You're never really gone."
