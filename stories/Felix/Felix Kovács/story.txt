Felix Kovács stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit café, shaking the water from his umbrella. He was a man who had seen it all, or at least that's what he liked to think. As a private investigator, Felix had spent years navigating the seedy underbelly of Prague's streets.

He took a seat at the bar and ordered a whiskey, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. The café was a favorite haunt of his, a place where the city's elite came to play, or so it seemed.

Just then, a woman caught his eye. She was sitting alone in the corner, nursing a cup of coffee and staring at a small photograph in her hand. Felix's curiosity got the better of him, and he made his way over to her table.

"Mind if I join you?" he asked, his voice low and smooth.

The woman looked up, startled, but then nodded almost imperceptibly. "I suppose not," she said, tucking the photograph into her purse.

Felix sat down across from her, taking in her features. She was beautiful, with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair, but there was something about her that didn't add up.

"What's your name?" Felix asked, his pen poised over his notebook.

"Lena," she replied, her voice husky.

Felix's eyes narrowed. "And what brings you to this fine establishment?"

Lena smiled, a small, sad smile. "I'm looking for someone," she said. "A man named Viktor."

Felix's ears pricked up at the name. He had heard rumors about Viktor, whispers of a man with connections to some very unsavory characters.

"I might know something about him," Felix said, leaning in closer.

Lena's eyes locked onto his, and for a moment, Felix saw a glimmer of fear there.

"Don't say anything until I'm sure you're willing to take the risk," he warned her, his voice barely above a whisper.

Lena nodded, her jaw set. "I'll do whatever it takes," she said.

Felix knew then that he was in this up to his neck. And he wasn't sure if he wanted out of it anymore.
