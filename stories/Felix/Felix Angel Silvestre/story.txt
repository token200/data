One drizzly evening, Felix received a visit from a distraught socialite named Sophia. She was frantic about her missing sister, Emma, who had been last seen leaving the family's estate in search of adventure. Convinced that foul play was involved, Sophia begged Felix to find her sister before it was too late.

As Felix listened attentively, his piercing blue eyes narrowed in thought. He promised Sophia he would do everything in his power to locate Emma and bring her home safely. With a nod, Felix accepted the case, and Sophia departed, leaving him to begin his investigation.
