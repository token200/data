The sweet aroma of freshly baked bread wafted up through the vents and mingled with the sound of Felix's melodies, creating an intoxicating combination that drew in passersby from all over town.

As he strummed a final chord on his latest composition, Felix smiled to himself. He was working on a new album, one that he hoped would finally launch him into stardom. With a flourish, he tucked the guitar under his arm and descended back down to the bakery floor, where his mother waited with a warm smile.

"Hey, kiddo! How's it going?" she asked, eyeing the scribbled lyrics on Felix's notebook.

"It's good," he replied, handing her the manuscript. "I think I've got something special this time."

"You know, Felix," his mother said, as he finished up, "you'd be proud of yourself. You're almost ready for that audition."

Felix's eyes lit up at the mention of the coveted spot opening in the regional music festival. He had been working towards this moment for years, and he was determined to make it happen.
