Overjoyed, Felix accepted the offer and began working tirelessly to produce his debut album.

As Felix's album, "Echoes," dropped, critics praised his raw emotion and catchy melodies. Fans connected with his music, and soon he was playing sold-out shows across the country. With his newfound success, Felix's name became synonymous with indie rock, and he was hailed as one of the most exciting new voices in the industry.
