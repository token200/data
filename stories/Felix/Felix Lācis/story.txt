Felix Lācis stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the desolate landscape. He had been away for so long, and yet the memory of this place still lingered in his mind like a ghost. The small town of Riga, Latvia, where he grew up as a child, was now a mere whisper of its former self.

Felix's thoughts turned to his family, who had long since moved on with their lives. His mother, his father, his younger sister – all gone, leaving him behind like a cast-off glove. He thought back to the days when Riga was a thriving city, full of life and laughter, but now it seemed to be dying.

As he walked through the streets, Felix couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. He passed by the old family home, its windows boarded up and its door hanging crookedly on its hinges. He remembered the countless nights he spent playing hide-and-seek with his sister in those very same rooms.

But as much as he longed to turn back time, Felix knew that couldn't be done. Instead, he steeled himself for what lay ahead. His father had passed away just a few weeks ago, and Felix had received a letter from the executor of his estate – asking him to come home for the reading of the will.

Felix arrived at the old family home, his heart heavy with emotion. The door creaked as he pushed it open, and he stepped inside, his eyes adjusting to the dim light within. A small group of people sat in the living room, their faces somber and serious.

The executor cleared his throat, and began to speak. "Felix Lācis, you have been named as the beneficiary of your father's estate." Felix felt a lump form in his throat as he stood up, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of life.

As he listened to the reading of the will, Felix realized that his father had left him more than just money. He had left him a piece of himself – a small, intricately carved wooden box with a note inside that read: "For my son, in case I'm not here to give it to you."

Felix's eyes welled up as he held the box in his hands, feeling the weight of his father's legacy settle upon him. He knew that this was just the beginning of a new chapter in his life – one filled with loss and grief, but also hope and renewal.
