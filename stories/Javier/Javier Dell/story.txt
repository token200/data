His colleagues often found themselves scratching their heads as he pored over seemingly unrelated clues, searching for connections that others missed.

One particularly puzzling case had been weighing heavily on Javier Dell's mind for weeks. A string of high-end jewelry store robberies had left the police department stumped, with no leads or suspects in sight.
