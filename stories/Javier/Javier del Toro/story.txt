Javier Del Toro stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the cityscape below. The sun had just set, casting a warm orange glow over the towering skyscrapers and bustling streets. He lit a cigarette, taking a long drag as he let the smoke waft up into the air.

Javier was a man of mystery, with a past shrouded in secrecy. Some said he was a former spy, while others claimed he was a skilled thief or assassin. The truth, however, lay somewhere in between. Javier had been a soldier, fighting in various conflicts around the world before leaving the military and making his own way.

As he stood there, lost in thought, Javier's mind began to wander back to his past. He remembered the sounds of gunfire and screams, the smell of smoke and sweat. He remembered the faces of those he had fought alongside, and those he had lost. And he remembered the woman who had changed everything for him.

Her name was Maria, and she had been a fellow soldier during Javier's time in the military. They had met by chance, and had quickly formed a bond that went beyond mere friendship. When Javier had left the military, Maria had stayed behind, but they had continued to communicate through letters and occasional meetings.

Maria had been his muse, his confidante, and his heart. She was the one person who truly understood him, and he her. But fate had other plans, and Maria had been killed in a tragic accident just as Javier was leaving for the States.

Now, years later, Javier found himself back in the city where they had first met. He had received a letter from an old friend, informing him of Maria's passing and inviting him to come visit her grave. Javier had hesitated at first, but something about the invitation had resonated deep within him. He needed to see Maria's face one last time, to say goodbye and find closure.

As he walked through the cemetery, Javier felt a sense of peace wash over him. The sun was setting now, casting long shadows across the grass. He found Maria's grave, marked by a simple stone monument with her name and dates of birth and death.

Javier sat down beside the grave, running his fingers over the inscription. Tears pricked at the corners of his eyes as he gazed up at the sky, feeling the weight of his emotions finally lift off his shoulders. He knew that Maria was gone, but he also knew that she would always be with him, in spirit and in memory.

With a final nod, Javier stood up and began to walk away from the grave, leaving the past behind him. But as he disappeared into the crowd, it was clear that some wounds never fully healed, and that some scars would remain forever etched on his heart.
