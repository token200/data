One day, while wandering through the streets of El Poblado, Edgars Rodríguez García stumbled upon a small gallery showcasing the work of an up-and-coming artist named Carlos. The paintings were striking – vibrant colors, bold brushstrokes, and a raw emotion that spoke directly to Edgars Rodríguez García's own experiences growing up in a marginalized community.
