Edgars Malinowski stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of life. As he waited, a chill ran down his spine, a familiar feeling that had become all too common since his return to Riga.

It had been five years since Edgars Malinowski, then a young detective, left Latvia to pursue a career in England. He had hoped to leave the dark memories of his past behind, but it seemed that no matter where he went, they followed him.

As he made his way through the crowded station, Edgars's mind wandered back to the events that had led him here. His sister, Jāzepa, still lived in Riga, and a cryptic letter from her had prompted him to return to the country of his birth.

The letter spoke of an old case, one that Edgars Malinowski thought he had long closed. But something about it resonated with him now, a sense of unfinished business that he couldn't shake. He was determined to find out what Jāzepa knew and why she had reached out after all these years.

Edgars's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps behind him. Turning, he saw a woman standing in the doorway of a nearby café, her eyes locked on his with an unnerving intensity.

"You're Edgars Malinowski," she stated, her voice low and husky.

He nodded, his instincts on high alert.

"I've been looking for you," she said, her gaze seeming to bore into his very soul. "I have information about your sister's case."

Edgars's heart quickened as he followed the woman into the café. Who was this stranger, and what did she know about Jāzepa?

Over steaming cups of coffee, the woman revealed a shocking truth: Jāzepa had been in contact with an old adversary, one who had been thought long dead.

Edgars Malinowski's mind reeled as he pieced together the evidence. It was clear that his return to Riga was not a coincidence, but rather a carefully orchestrated event designed to draw him into the heart of the mystery once again.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Edgars set out on a journey to uncover the truth about Jāzepa's case and the secrets that had been hidden for so long. The road ahead would be treacherous, but one thing was certain: Edgars Malinowski was ready to face whatever lay in store for him.
