Growing up, Edgars had always been fascinated by the art of baking. He spent countless hours watching his father work, learning the intricacies of yeast fermentation, dough kneading, and the perfect balance of flavors. After his father's passing, Edgars took over the bakery with a mix of sadness and determination. He was determined to carry on his father's legacy while making it his own.
