Edgars Ming, or Zhang Ming as he was known in his hometown of Beijing, had always been fascinated by the supernatural. Growing up, he spent countless hours poring over dusty tomes in his family's antique shop, devouring tales of ghosts, demons, and otherworldly creatures.

As a young man, Edgars became increasingly obsessed with the concept of "qi," or life energy, which was said to flow through all living things. He spent years studying the ancient art of qigong, practicing intricate movements and breathing techniques in an effort to harness and balance his own qi.

But it wasn't until he stumbled upon a mysterious, ancient text hidden away in the depths of his family's shop that Edgars' life truly took a dramatic turn. The text, bound in worn leather and adorned with strange symbols, was said to hold the secrets of the "jiuxi," or immortal spirits who were believed to possess the power to manipulate qi.

Enthralled by the prospect of unlocking such immense power, Edgars devoted himself to deciphering the text's cryptic language. He spent countless hours studying, practicing, and experimenting, eventually becoming proficient in the art of qi manipulation.

As his skills improved, Edgars began to notice strange occurrences around him – objects would move on their own, and he could feel an otherworldly energy coursing through his veins. It was as if the jiuxi had awakened within him, granting him access to powers beyond his wildest dreams.
