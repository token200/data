One drizzly evening, Edgars Cara received a visit from a distraught socialite named Sophia Grant. She arrived at his office, her usually immaculate appearance ruffled and disheveled, with tears streaming down her cheeks. "Edgars, I've come to you because I have no one else," she exclaimed, throwing herself into the chair opposite his desk.

"What seems to be the matter, Miss Grant?" Edgars Cara asked softly, his eyes taking in every detail of Sophia's distraught expression.
