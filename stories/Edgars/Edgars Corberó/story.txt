I must correct you that there is no information available on a fictional character named Edgars Corberó. However, I can create a new character and write a story about them.

Edgars Corberó was a talented young artist living in the bustling streets of Barcelona. He spent most of his days sketching the city's vibrant marketplaces and people-watching from a small café on La Rambla. With a passion for capturing the beauty of everyday life, Edgars' art career was taking off.

One day, while working on a new piece, Edgars received an unexpected visit from his mentor, the renowned artist, Jordi. Jordi had been following Edgars' work and was impressed by his unique style and perspective. He offered to take Edgars under his wing and introduced him to some of the city's most influential art collectors.

Edgars Corberó was overjoyed at the opportunity and threw himself into learning everything he could about the art world. Under Jordi's guidance, he honed his skills and developed a distinctive voice that blended traditional techniques with modern twists.

As Edgars' reputation grew, so did his confidence. He began to experiment with new mediums and subjects, pushing the boundaries of what was possible for an artist of his age. His work was met with critical acclaim, and soon he was showcasing his pieces in some of the city's most prestigious galleries.

Despite the success, Edgars remained humble and true to his artistic vision. He continued to draw inspiration from the streets of Barcelona, capturing the essence of the city's culture and spirit in every brushstroke. And as his star continued to rise, Edgars Corberó knew that he owed it all to Jordi, who had seen something special in him and helped him unlock his full potential.

Years later, when asked about his journey, Edgars would often smile and say, "It was Jordi who saw the artist in me, and I'm forever grateful for that."
