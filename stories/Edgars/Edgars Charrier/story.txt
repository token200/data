One day, Edgars Charrier received a message from an old acquaintance, asking him to meet at a high-end jewelry store on the outskirts of town. The catch? The owner had recently acquired a rare and valuable diamond necklace that was said to be cursed.

Edgars Charrier knew better than to turn down a challenge like this. He arrived at the store, dressed in his finest attire, and introduced himself to the owner. With his quick wit and silver tongue, he convinced the owner that Edgars Charrier was there on a legitimate business proposal.
