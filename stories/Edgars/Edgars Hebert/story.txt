As a child, he spent countless hours exploring the rocky shores and tides of his native coastal town, collecting seashells and watching the gulls soar overhead. As he grew older, his love for the ocean only deepened, and he became determined to make a career out of it.

Edgars Hebert pursued a degree in marine biology, spending long hours studying the intricacies of ocean currents and marine life. After completing his studies, he landed a job as a research assistant on a vessel sailing the open waters of the Atlantic. It was there that he honed his skills as a sailor and scientist, collecting data on everything from coral reefs to whale migrations.

Years went by, and Edgars Hebert's expertise grew.
