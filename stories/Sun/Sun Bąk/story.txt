Despite her modest upbringing, she had big dreams and aspirations. She longed to explore the world beyond the confines of her village and make a name for herself in the process.

One day, while walking through the market square, Sun Bąk overheard whispers about a prestigious competition being held in the nearby city of Turkestan.
