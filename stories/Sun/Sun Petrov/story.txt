Sun Petrov stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the city as the sun dipped below the horizon. His eyes were squinting against the fading light, and his strong jawline was set in determination.

Petrov, a seasoned mercenary, had seen his fair share of battles. From the dusty deserts of Afghanistan to the war-torn streets of Syria, he had fought for whoever paid the most. But tonight was different. Tonight, he was here to collect a payment from a mysterious client.

As he waited, Petrov's mind wandered back to his troubled past. Born in Moscow, he had grown up on the streets, surviving by any means necessary. He had found work as a soldier in the Russian army, but after a brutal incident left him with a bullet wound in his leg, he was forced to leave.

Years of wandering and taking on odd jobs had honed his skills as a fighter, but also filled him with emptiness. Until, one day, he received a cryptic message from an unknown sender – offering him a chance to join a private security firm, with the promise of unlimited riches.

Petrov took it, and had since found himself in some of the most chaotic hotspots around the world. He was known for his tenacity and fearlessness, but also for his unwavering loyalty to those who paid him.

Tonight's job was no different. Petrov checked his watch – a battered old Omega, given to him by an old friend – before seeing a black SUV pull up at the corner of the building.

He sauntered over, eyes scanning the interior for any signs of danger. The door slid open, revealing a suited figure inside.

"Well, well, well," Petrov said with a smile, extending a hand. "Looks like my client has arrived."

The man shook it firmly. "Sun, we've been waiting for you. Your payment is waiting – inside."

With a nod, Petrov entered the SUV and made his way to the backseat. He waited until they reached the destination before opening the door, peering up at a sleek skyscraper towering above the city.

As he stepped out onto the rooftop, a single spotlight hit him like a punch to the chest. His eyes narrowed – this was no ordinary job. Suddenly, Petrov's instincts screamed that something was off.

"Hey," the man called from the SUV, his voice dripping with warning. "Be careful, Sun."

But it was too late. As he gazed up at the towering building, a gleam caught his eye - and everything went dark.

Petrov stumbled forward, confusion fogging his mind. When he came to, he found himself lying in an unfamiliar room – his memories hazy, his body throbbing with pain.

He struggled to sit up – only to realize that he was wearing a wristwatch bearing the logo of...a private security firm?
