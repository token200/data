Sun Hansen was known for her fiery personality and unparalleled dedication to social justice. A passionate environmental activist, she spent most of her days rallying against corporate pollution and advocating for sustainable practices.

Born as Astrid Maria Hansen, Sun had always been drawn to the power of human connection and collective action. Her childhood spent volunteering at local community gardens and participating in beach cleanups had instilled in her a deep love for the natural world and its ability to heal and uplift.

Her fearless approach earned her both admiration and ridicule, but Sun refused to back down.

But in this moment, surrounded by newfound allies and an unyielding sense of purpose, she felt invincible – ready to face whatever lay ahead with unwavering resolve. The name Astrid Maria Hansen had become synonymous with courage, conviction, and a relentless pursuit of justice for all living things.
