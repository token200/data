With a deep breath, she summoned the full force of her magic, calling upon the spirits of her ancestors to aid her in her quest for freedom. The air erupted in a blaze of light and sound as Sun Krumina broke the curse, shattering the chains that bound Zerzura to the entity's will.

With the darkness lifted, Sun Krumina stood victorious, her name etched into the annals of history as a champion of courage and wisdom.
