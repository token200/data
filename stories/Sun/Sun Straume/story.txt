The balance of nature was threatened by a dark sorcerer who sought to harness the sun's energy for his own malevolent purposes. The elders implored Sun Straume to join forces with them and put an end to this nefarious plan.

Without hesitation, Sun Straume accepted the challenge. With her solar magic at the ready, she set out on a perilous journey to confront the dark sorcerer.
