I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Qian Zawisza. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created recently. If you'd like, I can try to create a story about a character with this name.

Here is a 400-word story about Qian Zawisza:

In the bustling streets of modern-day Shanghai, few people knew the legend of Qian Zawisza, a brilliant and reclusive hacker who had made a name for herself in the shadows. Born Qingyu Zhang, Qian Zawisza was the alias she used to protect her online identity from prying eyes.

As a child prodigy, Qingyu had shown an uncanny talent for computers and coding, earning her a full scholarship to one of China's top engineering schools. However, it was during her time at university that she discovered her true calling – using her skills to expose corporate corruption and bring justice to those who needed it most.

Under the pseudonym Qian Zawisza, she had built a reputation as a ghost in the machine, able to infiltrate even the most secure systems with ease. Her methods were often unorthodox, but always effective, earning her both admiration and fear from her peers.

One fateful night, Qian Zawisza received a cryptic message from an anonymous source, warning of a massive data breach that would compromise sensitive information from some of China's most powerful government officials. Without hesitation, she sprang into action, using her vast network of contacts to gather intelligence and track down the source of the leak.

As she delved deeper into the mystery, Qian Zawisza found herself in a cat-and-mouse game with a ruthless cyber-vigilante who sought to claim the credit for himself. With her quick wit and razor-sharp instincts, she outmaneuvered him at every turn, ultimately exposing the truth and bringing the perpetrators to justice.

In the aftermath of the breach, Qian Zawisza's legend grew even larger, as whispers of her heroics spread through the darknet. Though she remained a recluse, few could deny the impact she had on the world – a true champion of cybersecurity and justice, fighting for a brighter future in the shadows.
