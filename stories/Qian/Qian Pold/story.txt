Qian Pold was an enigmatic figure known for his unparalleled skills in infiltration and espionage. A master of disguise and deception, he could blend into any environment, taking on various personas to suit his needs. His true identity remained a closely guarded secret, known only to a select few.

Born in the distant lands of Kaida, Qian Pold was raised by a family of nomadic tribespeople who honed his skills from a young age.
