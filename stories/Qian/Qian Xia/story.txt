In the bustling streets of ancient China, a young woman named Qian Xia walked with purpose, her long black hair flowing behind her like a river of night. She was on a mission to meet with the great poet, Ruan Ji, who was known for his wisdom and wit.

As she approached the poet's humble abode, Qian Xia felt a sense of trepidation wash over her. What would she say to him? Would he even listen to her words? She took a deep breath, steadying herself for what lay ahead.

Upon entering the small cottage, Qian Xia was greeted by Ruan Ji himself, who looked up from his writing desk with a warm smile. "Ah, young one," he said, beckoning her closer. "I have been expecting you."

Qian Xia approached him cautiously, her eyes scanning the room for any signs of distractions. But Ruan Ji's gaze was focused solely on hers, and she felt a sense of calm wash over her.

"I have come to seek your wisdom, Master Ruan," Qian Xia said, her voice steady despite her nerves.

Ruan Ji nodded thoughtfully, his eyes twinkling with interest. "Ah, yes. I am happy to share my insights with you, Qian Xia. What is it that weighs heavily on your mind?"

Qian Xia took a deep breath and began to speak, pouring out her heart to the poet before her. Ruan Ji listened attentively, his expression thoughtful as he nodded along with her words.

As they spoke, the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the room. Qian Xia felt a sense of peace settle over her, knowing that she had found not only guidance but also a kindred spirit in Ruan Ji.

And so, the two of them sat together in silence for a moment, lost in their own thoughts as the night deepened outside. It was clear to both that this was only the beginning of a beautiful and lifelong friendship between Qian Xia and the great poet, Ruan Ji.
