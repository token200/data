Qian Kovacs stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the cityscape below. The neon lights of the skyscrapers reflected off the wet pavement, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the dark waters of the harbor. It was a sight she knew all too well, having grown up in this very city.

As a former member of the elite Shadow Agency, Qian Kovacs had seen her fair share of high-stakes missions and covert operations. But after a falling out with her handlers, she had struck out on her own, determined to make a name for herself as a private investigator.

Tonight's case was no exception. A wealthy businessman had approached her with a mysterious threat: someone was blackmailing him over a dark secret from his past. Qian Kovacs' instincts told her that this was more than just a simple extortion scheme - there was something sinister at play.

She lit a cigarette and took a long drag, feeling the familiar burn in her lungs. This was what she loved about being on her own: the freedom to follow her nose, no matter where it led.

As she scanned the rooftops, Qian Kovacs' eyes landed on a figure watching from across the street. She recognized the tattooed sleeve and the scar above the left eyebrow - this was Viktor Kuznetsov, an old acquaintance with ties to the Russian underworld.

She snubbed out her cigarette and headed down into the night, following Viktor's trail as it led her through alleys and backstreets. The city streets were narrow and winding, but Qian Kovacs knew them like the back of her hand.

After a few minutes of chasing, she finally caught up with Viktor at an abandoned warehouse on the waterfront. He sneered at her, but Qian Kovacs could see the hint of fear lurking behind his eyes.

"You're a hard woman to find," he growled, reaching for a gun hidden in his jacket.

Qian Kovacs drew her own pistol, trained it on Viktor's chest. "Let's talk, shall we?" she said, a cold smile spreading across her face.
