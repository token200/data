I couldn't find any information on the character Qian Angert. If you'd like, I can create a story about this character.

Qian Angert stood at the edge of the forest, her eyes scanning the trees for any sign of movement. She was on a mission to gather rare herbs for her potions shop in the nearby village. As a skilled apothecary and member of the Lunar Clan, Qian Angert had spent years perfecting her craft under the guidance of her mentor.

Qian Angert's full name, Quan'aoang Ai (or "Moonlit Blossom" as it was also known), held great significance among her people. It signified not only her connection to the lunar cycle but also her dedication to the ancient art of healing. With a deep breath, she began to sniff the air, searching for the distinct aroma of Wolf's Bane. Legend had it that this herb could cure even the most stubborn of ailments.

As she walked deeper into the forest, Qian Angert encountered a figure cloaked in shadows. The air seemed to vibrate with an otherworldly energy emanating from the stranger. Despite her initial unease, Qian Angert's years of training and intuition allowed her to approach cautiously. "Who are you?" she asked firmly.

The figure stepped forward, revealing a lithe woman with skin as pale as moonlight and hair that flowed like silver. She introduced herself as Aria Moonwhisper, a wandering mystic seeking rare herbs for her own magical purposes. Qian Angert sensed an undercurrent of deceit beneath Aria's words but could not quite put her finger on it.

A silent understanding passed between the two women as they agreed to work together. Qian Angert knew that her reputation and the trust of her customers depended on this alliance. Together, they ventured into the heart of the forest, navigating treacherous paths and facing unknown dangers. As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the land, Qian Angert smiled wryly to herself, knowing that her skills as an apothecary and a member of the Lunar Clan would be put to the ultimate test.
