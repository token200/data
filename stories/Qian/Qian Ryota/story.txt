The city's neon lights cast an eerie glow over the crowded streets, a stark contrast to the tranquility that Qian Ryota had grown accustomed to. As a former assassin for hire, he had once revelled in the rush of adrenaline that came with his line of work. But after a near-fatal job went sour, Ryota found himself on the run, forced to abandon the life he knew and start anew.

Now, at 35, he worked as a freelance security consultant, using his unique set of skills to protect high-profile clients from the shadows. His latest assignment was a particularly high-stakes one: a wealthy businessman's daughter who had received death threats from an unknown assailant.

As Ryota arrived at the mansion where he would be meeting with the client, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The air seemed heavy with tension, and the usually composed businesswoman, Rachel, appeared on edge.

"What can I do to help?" Ryota asked, his eyes scanning the room for any signs of danger.

"We've had reports of strange occurrences at night," she replied, her voice barely above a whisper. "Doors opening by themselves, footsteps echoing down the halls... we're terrified that someone is watching us."

Ryota nodded, his mind already racing with scenarios and counter-scenarios. He began to survey the perimeter of the mansion, taking note of any potential entry points or weaknesses.

As he made his way to the library, where Rachel had requested a private meeting, Ryota's senses went on high alert. Something didn't feel right. The air seemed charged with anticipation, and for the first time since arriving, he felt like something was indeed watching him from the shadows.

Suddenly, a book fell off the shelf behind him, sending shards of glass scattering across the floor. Ryota spun around, his eyes locking onto a figure in the corner of the room – a figure that didn't seem to be there just moments before.

Without hesitation, Ryota drew his gun and moved towards the mysterious figure, ready for whatever lay ahead. As he got closer, however, something unexpected happened: the figure began to take shape, its features becoming clearer with each passing moment.

It was a woman, her face twisted in pain, her eyes locked onto Ryota's with an unnerving intensity. For a split second, their gazes held, and then she vanished into thin air.

Ryota stood there for what felt like hours, his heart pounding in his chest, trying to make sense of the bizarre encounter. But one thing was certain: he had stumbled into something much bigger than himself – and this case was about to get a whole lot more complicated.
