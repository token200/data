Talgat Roche was known for his unparalleled skills as a master thief and con artist in the city of Ashenhold. Few knew that beneath the fa√ßade of charm and wit lay a mind sharper than any blade. Born into a life of poverty, Talgat had honed his craft on the streets from a young age, perfecting the art of deception and manipulation.

As he navigated the shadows of Ashenhold, whispers of Talgat Roche's exploits echoed through the underworld. His latest target was the esteemed Golden Griffin tavern, rumored to be hosting a high-stakes poker game that only the most skilled players were invited to attend. With his eyes fixed on the prize, Talgat set out to infiltrate the establishment.

Dressed in fine attire, complete with a black domino mask and a charming smile, Talgat wove through the crowds of patrons, collecting information like a spider gathering threads. He discovered that the game was being hosted by the enigmatic lord, Marcellus Blackwood, who was known for his ruthless ambition.

With a calculated risk, Talgat made contact with one of the players, a young noblewoman named Lady Sophia, who was desperate to win the coveted Golden Griffin trophy. Using his silver tongue and an air of confidence, Talgat convinced Lady Sophia to join him at the table, where he proceeded to clean them both out.

Marcellus Blackwood watched the scene unfold with interest, sensing the potential in this new player. He extended Talgat Roche an offer: join forces and take down a rival guild, securing their place in Ashenhold's elite circle. Talgat, aware of the risks but also of the opportunity, agreed to Marcellus' proposal.

As he parted ways with Lady Sophia, now a temporary ally, Talgat Roche vanished into the night, his eyes fixed on the prize. With a whispered promise to deliver, Talgat disappeared into the shadows, ready to unleash his cunning and skill upon the world once more. The game had just begun, and Talgat Roche was about to prove himself as one of Ashenhold's most formidable players.
