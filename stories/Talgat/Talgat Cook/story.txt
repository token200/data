Talgat "Tal" Cook was a man with a passion for cooking and exploring the world's diverse cuisines.

One day, a friend suggested that Talgat Cook take his cooking skills on the road, and he eagerly accepted the challenge. With a backpack full of ingredients and a camera slung around his neck, Talgat set off on a culinary journey across Central Asia.
