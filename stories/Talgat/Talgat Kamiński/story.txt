I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named "Talgat Kami≈Ñski." However, I believe you may be referring to Targaryen character Rhaenyra's son Talys and her half brother/son Prince Daemon Targaryen's son  also known as (Targaryen prince named) "Talisk" however most popular in English speaking regions the last name of a child born between Aerys II and his wife Rhaella is not well documented.
