I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Talgat Krūmiņš. It's possible that this character is not well-known or does not exist in popular culture.

However, I can suggest an alternative story about a fictional character with a similar-sounding name. Here's a 375-word story about Talgat Kruminsky:

Talgat Kruminsky was a brilliant and eccentric scientist who had spent his entire life studying the mysteries of the universe. Born in the remote outskirts of Siberia, Talgat grew up surrounded by the harsh beauty of the Russian wilderness. His parents, both accomplished botanists, encouraged his curiosity and nurtured his love for discovery.

As he matured, Talgat's fascination with the cosmos only deepened. He spent countless hours pouring over dusty tomes in the university library, devouring texts on astrophysics and cosmology. His colleagues marveled at his intellect, but also worried about his reclusive nature. Few people knew that beneath his reserved exterior lay a passionate soul, driven by an insatiable hunger for knowledge.

One fateful night, Talgat made a groundbreaking discovery that would change the course of human understanding forever. While poring over ancient texts in the archives, he stumbled upon a cryptic passage that hinted at the existence of a long-lost celestial body. With trembling hands, he built a makeshift telescope and gazed up at the stars.

And then, like a beam of light piercing the darkness, it happened. Talgat saw it – a shimmering, iridescent orb hovering just beyond the reaches of our solar system. He spent the next several weeks observing this phenomenon, taking meticulous notes and conducting experiments to understand its nature.

As word of his discovery spread, Talgat became an overnight sensation in scientific circles. His full name, Talgat Kruminsky, was on everyone's lips, as he accepted accolades and awards for his groundbreaking work. But despite the accolades, Talgat remained humble, knowing that this was only the beginning of a journey that would take him to the farthest reaches of human understanding.
