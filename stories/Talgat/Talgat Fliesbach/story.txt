Talgat Fliesbach stepped into the dimly lit tavern, the smell of smoke and ale hitting him like a punch to the gut. He had been traveling for days, searching for any lead on his missing sister, Aida. The villagers spoke little of outsiders, but Talgat knew he had to keep trying.

As he made his way to the bar, a hooded figure caught his eye from across the room. The air seemed to thicken around them as Talgat approached, and for a moment, he thought it might be Aida, but the face was too worn, too weathered.

The bartender, a gruff old man with a thick beard, eyed him warily. "What can I get you?" he growled. Talgat ordered a whiskey, his mind racing as he scanned the room for any sign of clues.

A figure pushed back their hood, revealing piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. A young woman, no more than twenty years old, with a look of defiance etched on her face. She was the one, Talgat was certain of it.

"Mind if I join you?" he asked, nodding towards an empty stool beside her. The girl raised an eyebrow but didn't move, so Talgat slid onto the stool next to her. "I'm Talgat Fliesbach," he said, extending a hand. The girl shook it firmly.

"My name is Kassia," she replied, her voice husky and confident. As they sipped their drinks, Talgat told her about Aida's disappearance, leaving out nothing. Kassia listened intently, her eyes never leaving his face.

When he finished, she nodded thoughtfully. "I think I might know something," she said, her words sending a shiver down Talgat's spine. He leaned in closer as Kassia began to speak in hushed tones of dark rituals and hidden temples. The night seemed to darken around them, but for the first time since his sister vanished, Talgat felt hope. Maybe, just maybe, he had found someone who could help him find Aida.
