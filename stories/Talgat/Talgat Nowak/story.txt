I couldn't find any information on the person named Talgat Nowak. If you'd like, I can generate a short story with that name. 

Here is a short story:

Talgat Nowak stood tall, his piercing blue eyes scanning the crowded market in Almaty. His dark hair was neatly combed, and he wore a crisp white shirt under his tailored jacket. As a successful businessman, Talgat Nowak was accustomed to commanding attention.

As he navigated through the stalls, Talgat Nowak's thoughts turned to the upcoming meeting with potential investors for his new startup. He had spent years developing a revolutionary app that promised to change the way people communicated in Kazakhstan. But so far, securing funding had proven elusive.

Talgat Nowak's eyes landed on a small, family-owned stall selling traditional Kazakh clothing. He approached the vendor, a warm smile spreading across his face. "Ah, Salome, how are you doing today?" he asked, using the local name for the woman. Her eyes lit up as she handed him a beautifully embroidered scarf.

As Talgat Nowak browsed the stall, he noticed a young girl watching him from across the way. She couldn't have been more than ten years old, with a mop of curly brown hair and big green eyes that sparkled with curiosity. He felt a pang of nostalgia wash over him as he remembered his own childhood in this very market.

"Excuse me," Talgat Nowak said to the vendor, "what's her name?" The woman followed his gaze and smiled knowingly. "That's little Aida. She's a bright one, just like you when you were young."

Talgat Nowak chuckled, feeling a sense of connection to this small town that he had once called home. He made a mental note to look into partnering with local organizations to support education initiatives for young people.

As the day drew to a close, Talgat Nowak left the market with a renewed sense of purpose. He knew that securing funding wouldn't be easy, but with the help of people like Salome and Aida, he felt a sense of hope that his startup would succeed. And as he walked away from the market, he couldn't help but wonder what other challenges lay ahead for Talgat Nowak.
