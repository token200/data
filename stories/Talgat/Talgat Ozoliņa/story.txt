I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Talgat Ozoliņa. It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created recently.

However, I found some information on a Latvian footballer named Andris Ozoliņš and a Kyrgyzstani politician named Talgat Orazbayev, but no information on a character with the name Talgat Ozoliņa.

If you could provide more context or details about this character, I would be happy to try and assist you in writing a story about them.
