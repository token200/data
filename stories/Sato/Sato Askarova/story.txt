As she trekked through the rugged terrain, Sato Askarova's eyes scanned the landscape for any signs of the elusive ruins she had been searching for. She was accompanied by a local guide, who seemed to know every inch of the land like the back of his hand.

After hours of hiking, they finally stumbled upon the entrance to an ancient temple.
