Sato Krumina was known throughout the city for her striking features and razor-sharp wit. A skilled thief and con artist, she had built a reputation as one of the most elusive figures in the underworld.

One rainy night, Sato Krumina slipped into the high-end jewelry store, her eyes scanning the rows of gleaming jewels with practiced ease. She knew exactly what she was looking for – a rare diamond necklace that would make her fortune.

As she expertly disabled the security system, a voice echoed from the shadows, "You shouldn't be here, Sato Krumina." The thief spun around, hand instinctively reaching for the hidden blade in her sleeve. A figure emerged, tall and imposing, with piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into her very soul.

It was Ryker, an old acquaintance who had a talent for appearing at the most inconvenient moments. Sato Krumina sighed inwardly – she had hoped to avoid him tonight.

"Ryker," she drawled, "I see you're as predictable as ever." She held up the necklace, its gemstones glinting in the dim light. "What do you want?"

Ryker chuckled, a low rumble that sent shivers down her spine. "I just wanted to make sure you didn't steal anything I was after," he said, his eyes flicking towards the shelf behind Sato Krumina's back.

She snorted, rolling her eyes. It was an old trick – Ryker thought she would fall for it every time. But Sato Krumina had been around too long to be fooled so easily. She pocketed the necklace and turned to leave, but Ryker blocked her path, his massive frame pinning her against the counter.

"You know, Sato Krumina," he whispered, his breath cold against her ear, "I think it's time we talked about our past. You've been running from us for a long time – maybe it's time you faced the music."

Sato Krumina's eyes flashed with anger, but she knew better than to let Ryker get under her skin. She smiled sweetly, a cold calculation glinting in her eyes. "I think that can wait, don't you?"
