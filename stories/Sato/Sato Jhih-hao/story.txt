I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named "Sato Jhih-hao". Can you provide more context or details about this character? 

If you'd like, I can create a new story for a fictional character with that name. Please let me know what kind of story you're interested in (e.g. sci-fi, fantasy, mystery, etc.) and I'll do my best to craft an engaging tale.

Alternatively, if you have any additional information about Sato Jhih-hao (e.g. where he appears in a book or movie, his personality traits, abilities, etc.), I'd be happy to try and write a story based on that.
