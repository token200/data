Sato Straume stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit café, shaking the water from her long black coat. As a private investigator with a reputation for being one of the best in the city, she had seen it all – the gruesome murders, the desperate pleas for help, and the countless secrets hidden behind closed doors.

As she waited for her contact to arrive, Sato took a seat at the bar and ordered a whiskey on the rocks. She lit a cigarette, the smoke curling lazily into the air as she gazed out into the rain-soaked streets.

Her contact, a former cop named Marcus, arrived promptly at 9 PM, his eyes scanning the room before locking onto Sato's. He slid into the seat across from her, his expression serious.

"Sato Straume," he said, his voice low and gravelly. "I've got a case for you."

Sato raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "What kind of case?"

"It's a high-profile murder," Marcus replied, producing a small notebook from his pocket. "The victim was a wealthy businessman with connections to the city's elite. The police are stumped, and they think it's connected to a string of similar murders that went unsolved years ago."

Sato's eyes narrowed as she took the notebook from Marcus. She scanned the pages, her mind already racing with possibilities.

"I'll take it," she said finally, tucking the notebook into her bag.

Marcus nodded, his expression grim. "Be careful, Sato Straume. This one could get messy."

Sato smiled wryly, a hint of danger dancing in her eyes. She knew that when you were dealing with the kind of cases she handled, there was always going to be risk involved. But that was what made it so exhilarating.

As she left the café and disappeared into the night, Sato Straume was already mentally preparing herself for the long, dark road ahead.
