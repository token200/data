As the night wore on, visitors found themselves lost in Sato Oja's labyrinthine world, confronting their deepest fears and desires. And when they emerged into the bright lights of dawn, they were forever changed by the experience. For in the realm of Sato Oja, art was not just creation – it was transformation.
