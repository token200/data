Born Sato Katsuragi, she had always been drawn to the beauty of music. Growing up in a small town surrounded by lush forests and winding rivers, Sato spent most of her childhood lost in daydreams, her fingers instinctively moving over imaginary keys. Her parents, both music enthusiasts themselves, encouraged her passion, providing her with a vintage piano that had once belonged to their own mentor.
