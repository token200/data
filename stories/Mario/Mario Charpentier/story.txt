I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named "Mario Charpentier". It's possible that this character is not well-known or was created for a specific story or context.

However, I can suggest an alternative character: Mario Andretti is a real-life American racing driver and former IndyCar champion. But since you requested a fictional character, I'll create one for the sake of storytelling.

Word of Mario's exceptional cooking spread like wildfire, and soon foodies from all over Paris flocked to try his creations.
