Mario Novák was a man with a passion for music and a gift for storytelling. Born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, to a family of musicians, he had grown up surrounded by the sounds of classical guitars and folk songs.

His music attracted a diverse audience, from students at universities to workers in factories, all of whom were drawn to his authenticity and energy. As he toured the country, playing to packed houses and festival crowds, Mario remained true to his roots while embracing new sounds and styles.

Despite his success, Mario never forgot where he came from.
