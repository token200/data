I couldn't find any information on the fictional character "Mario Durchdenwald". It's possible that this character does not exist or is not well-known. If you'd like, I can create a short story based on a character with a similar name.

However, if you would like to provide more context or details about Mario Durchdenwald, I'd be happy to try and write a story based on what you have in mind.

If you're looking for a generic story about a character named Mario, here's a 400-word story:

Mario trudged through the dense forest, his worn-out boots scuffling against the damp earth. He had been searching for weeks, following every lead, every hint that might bring him closer to finding what he was looking for.

As a skilled archaeologist, Mario had spent years studying the ancient civilization that once thrived in these woods. He had always believed that there was more to their mythology than met the eye, and now he was determined to uncover the truth.

The trees seemed to close in around him as the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the forest floor. Mario quickened his pace, his heart racing with excitement. He knew that he was getting close.

Suddenly, a faint rustling caught his attention. Mario's eyes scanned the underbrush, and then he saw it: a small, intricately carved stone lying on the ground. It glinted in the fading light, and Mario's breath caught in his throat as he realized what he had found.

It was a fragment of an ancient artifact, one that would prove beyond a doubt that the myths were true. The forest around him seemed to come alive with magic as Mario carefully picked up the stone and tucked it into his pocket.

With the artifact secure, Mario knew that he could finally return home, armed with the knowledge that would change the course of history. He turned to leave, but not before catching a glimpse of something else - a small, shimmering light in the distance. It was hard to see, but Mario was certain that it was there.

He smiled to himself, knowing that this was just the beginning of his journey. The adventure had only just begun, and he couldn't wait to see what other secrets lay hidden in these enchanted woods.
