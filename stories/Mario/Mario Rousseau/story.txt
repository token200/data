Mario "The Maverick" Rousseau was known for his unorthodox approach to detective work. A former NYPD homicide detective, he had left the force to start his own private investigation agency in New York City. His latest case involved a high-profile businessman with ties to organized crime.

As Mario sat at his desk, sipping on a cup of black coffee, he stared at the file in front of him. The victim's name was Richard Langley, and according to the police report, he had been found dead in his office building late last night. The only clue was a small note left behind, reading "You'll never find it."

Mario rubbed his temples, trying to ward off the growing headache. This case seemed like a classic setup for one of his old colleagues to try and pin on him. He had always been at odds with Langley, who he believed had tried to sabotage his career.

Just then, his phone rang. It was an unknown number, but Mario answered anyway. "Rousseau Investigations," he said firmly.

"Hello, is this Mario Rousseau?" a woman's voice asked on the other end of the line.

"Yes, it is."

"I'm calling from the NYPD. We need to talk about Richard Langley's case."

Mario raised an eyebrow. What did the department want with him now?

The woman paused before speaking again. "We've found something, Mr. Rousseau. Something that suggests your theory about Langley's murder might be... inaccurate."

Mario's gut tightened. He had been expecting this.

"What have you got?" he asked gruffly.

"We'll send someone over to discuss the details," she replied before hanging up.

Back at his desk, Mario felt a familiar itch forming in the pit of his stomach. He was used to people trying to set him up or undermine his work. But he refused to back down.

With renewed determination, Mario began searching through Langley's office for any clues that might contradict his own theory. After all, as Mario "The Maverick" Rousseau always said, the truth was worth fighting for, no matter what it took.

As the sun dipped below the towering skyscrapers of Manhattan, casting long shadows across the city streets, Mario couldn't shake the feeling that he was onto something big. The game was on, and he was ready to play.
