Carla García Fernández sat at her desk, staring blankly at the stack of rejection letters in front of her. She had been applying to art schools for what felt like an eternity, but so far, none had accepted her.

As a child, Carla had always been fascinated by art. She spent hours sketching and painting, lost in her own little world. Her parents, both artists themselves, encouraged her passion and provided her with endless supplies of paper and paint.

But as she grew older, the pressure to make a living from her art mounted. Her parents' struggles to make ends meet made Carla feel like she had to "be practical" and pursue a more stable career. She reluctantly enrolled in a design program at university, thinking that it would be a stepping stone to furthering her artistic education.

However, as the years went by, Carla found herself growing increasingly unfulfilled. The creative spark that had driven her to pick up a pencil as a child seemed to have fizzled out under the pressure of textbooks and practicality. She struggled to balance her coursework with her own art, always feeling like she was compromising on something essential.

Despite this, Carla's passion for art never truly went away. In secret, she continued to paint and draw whenever she could find the time. It became a source of comfort and solace in a world that seemed determined to stifle her creativity.

As she gazed at the stack of rejection letters, Carla felt a familiar sense of frustration rising up inside her. Why couldn't anyone see her potential? Why did no one want to give her a chance?

Just then, her best friend, Sofia, burst into the room, holding a large portfolio case. "Hey, I heard you were having a meltdown," she said with a knowing smile.

Carla shook her head. "I just feel like I'm not good enough."

Sofia sat down beside her and began to flip through Carla's own sketchbook. Her eyes widened as she saw the raw talent and emotion in each drawing. "You are good enough, Carla," she said firmly. "Art is not just about making a living; it's about expressing yourself, taking risks, and pushing boundaries."

Carla looked up at Sofia, feeling a spark of determination ignite within her. Maybe it was time to take a leap of faith and follow her heart, no matter where it led.

With newfound resolve, Carla gathered her things and set out to reapply to art schools, this time with the courage to be true to herself. As she walked through the streets, portfolio case in hand, she felt a sense of excitement and possibility that she hadn't felt in years.

Perhaps, just perhaps, this was the start of something beautiful.
