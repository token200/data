Lucas Boulanger was a man with a passion for the unknown. As an amateur paranormal investigator, he spent most of his free time exploring abandoned asylums and haunted mansions in search of evidence to support his theories.

Born Lucas Anthony Boulanger on November 12th, 1987, he had always been fascinated by the supernatural and the unexplained. Growing up, he devoured books on ghost hunting and watched countless documentaries on the subject. It was only natural that he would one day become an investigator himself.

Lucas's latest investigation took him to a notorious asylum on the outskirts of town. The building had a reputation for being one of the most haunted places in the country, with reports of ghostly apparitions and disembodied voices. Lucas was determined to get to the bottom of it all.

As he made his way through the dusty corridors, Lucas couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He set up his equipment and began to scan the area for any signs of paranormal activity. The hours ticked by slowly, with only a few minor occurrences to report - a creaking floorboard here, a faint whisper there.

But then, something changed. Lucas felt a sudden chill run down his spine as he walked into a room that seemed to have been left untouched for decades. The air was thick with the scent of decay and rot, and he could swear he saw a shadowy figure lurking just out of sight.

Lucas's heart racing, he began to set up his cameras and audio recorders in preparation for what he knew would be a wild night. And then, it happened - a loud bang echoed through the room, followed by a faint whisper that seemed to come from all around him: "Get out while you still can."

Lucas Boulanger didn't need any further encouragement. He quickly packed up his equipment and made a hasty retreat from the asylum, determined to analyze the evidence he had collected once he was safe back in his own home. It was going to be a long night of reviewing footage and trying to make sense of what had happened.
