As the night drew to a close, Sophia thanked Lucas for an unforgettable dining experience and promised to feature Mancini's Pizzeria on her blog. Overjoyed by the prospect of sharing his story with an even wider audience, Lucas beamed with pride as he handed Sophia a warm bread roll to take home.

With a full belly and a newfound appreciation for the art of traditional Neapolitan pizza-making, Sophia left Mancini's Pizzeria knowing that she had discovered more than just a great meal â€“ she had found a piece of Little Italy's heart.
