Lucas Yu stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out at the glittering city below. The neon lights reflected off the wet pavement like a canvas of color and energy, drawing him in with its vibrant pulse.

As he breathed in the cool night air, his thoughts drifted back to the life he left behind. His family, his friends – everything was a distant memory now. He had abandoned it all for this city, for the anonymity and freedom that came with it.

But tonight felt different. Tonight, Lucas couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching him. He scanned the rooftops, half-expecting to see someone lurking in the shadows. The city seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.

Suddenly, a gust of wind swept across the rooftop, sending papers and trash swirling around Lucas' feet. He laughed, feeling a sense of unease dissipate as he watched the mess blow away. Maybe it was just his imagination playing tricks on him.

He turned back to the city, his eyes drawn to a specific building across the street. It was an old skyscraper, one that had been abandoned for years. Rumors swirled around its dark history – whispers of ghostly apparitions and unexplained occurrences.

Lucas felt an inexplicable pull towards the building. He took a step forward, his heart pounding in his chest. Suddenly, the lights on the rooftop seemed to flicker and dim, as if someone was trying to signal him something.

Without hesitation, Lucas leapt off the rooftop, landing softly on the pavement below. The city seemed to come alive around him – people rushing past, sirens blaring in the distance. But he stood frozen, his eyes fixed on the abandoned skyscraper across the street.

The building loomed above him, its windows like empty eyes staring back. Lucas felt a shiver run down his spine as he approached the entrance. He took a deep breath and stepped inside.

As he walked deeper into the building, Lucas realized that he wasn't alone. There were whispers around him – faint murmurs of footsteps echoing off the walls. It was then that he saw her – a ghostly figure standing in front of him, her eyes locked on his with an otherworldly intensity.

Lucas' heart skipped a beat as he froze, unsure what to do next. But something about this mysterious woman drew him in, like a moth to flame. He took another step forward, and that was when everything changed.
