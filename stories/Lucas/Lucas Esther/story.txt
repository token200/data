He was on the cusp of a major breakthrough, he could feel it in his bones. Suddenly, a loud clap of thunder shook the room, causing him to jump out of his seat.

As he regained his composure, Lucas noticed something peculiar - a small piece of parchment had been inserted into one of the contraptions, bearing an ancient symbol that sent shivers down his spine. This was it - this was the proof he had been searching for.

With shaking hands, Lucas Esther carefully transcribed the symbol onto a new parchment, feeling the weight of history on his shoulders. He knew that his discovery would shake the very foundations of science and challenge everything people thought they knew about the world.
