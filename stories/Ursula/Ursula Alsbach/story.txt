Ursula's exceptional abilities were not limited to her work; she was also an avid hiker and outdoor enthusiast. On weekends, you could find her trekking through the mountains or exploring the depths of the forest, searching for rare species of plants and animals.

One day, Ursula received a call from the local police department, asking for her expertise in analyzing evidence related to a particularly gruesome murder case. The victim was a young woman found brutally killed in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. As Ursula delved into the case, she discovered that the crime scene had been meticulously cleaned, leaving few clues behind.

Ursula's keen eye and extensive knowledge of forensic science allowed her to spot subtle details that others might have missed.

The owner of the shop was a quiet, unassuming man who kept to himself, but Ursula's instincts told her he might be hiding something.
