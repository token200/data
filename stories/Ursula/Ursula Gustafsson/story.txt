Despite the setback, Ursula Gustafsson refused to give up. She spent the day perfecting a new batch of her famous cinnamon rolls, and by evening, the aroma of freshly baked bread wafted through the streets, enticing customers to come and support her.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, a group of mischievous teenagers strolled by the bakery, laughing and teasing each other about the vandalism. But when they caught sight of Ursula Gustafsson's bright smile and twinkling eyes, they quickly turned around and fled.
