In the dimly lit cantina on the outskirts of town, a mysterious figure sat sipping a whiskey on the rocks. Ursula del Toro, a name whispered in awe by those who knew her, was the owner and operator of this humble watering hole. Her eyes gleamed with a knowing intensity as she surveyed the room, taking in the faces of the patrons.

As a child, Ursula had always been drawn to the shadows, feeling like an outsider among her own kind. She learned to rely on her wit and cunning to survive, earning her the nickname "La Llorona del Norte" - The Weeping Woman of the North. But it was only when she stumbled upon an ancient tome hidden deep within the city's labyrinthine library that Ursula truly found her calling.

The book revealed to her the secrets of the mysterious entity known as El Sombrero, a being rumored to grant wishes to those who could solve its riddles. Intrigued by the prospect of finally having a purpose in life, Ursula devoted herself to deciphering the cryptic clues within the tome's pages.

Years passed, and Ursula del Toro became a legend in her own right. Patrons would come from far and wide, hoping to catch a glimpse of the reclusive owner or perhaps, even earn her favor by solving one of her riddles. Few succeeded, but those who did found themselves granted not only their heart's desire but also a fleeting glimpse into the enigmatic mind of Ursula del Toro.

One night, as the moon hung low in the sky outside, a young man named Juan stumbled into the cantina, searching for solace from his own troubles. He approached Ursula with trepidation, eager to test his luck against hers. With a sly smile, she presented him with her final riddle: "What is it that lies at the heart of darkness, yet shines like the brightest star in the light?" The young man hesitated, then answered, "The truth." Ursula's eyes sparkled as she nodded in approval. For one fleeting moment, Juan del Toro felt a sense of belonging, but as he turned to leave, the shadows seemed to swallow him whole once more.
