Ursula Eriksson was a force to be reckoned with in the small town of Ravenswood. As the owner of the local bakery, "Sweet Delights," she was known for her delicious pastries and warm smile. But few people knew about Ursula's secret: she was also an avid reader of true crime novels.

One rainy evening, as the storm outside intensified, Ursula settled into her favorite armchair with a fresh cup of tea and a new book by Agatha Christie. She had always been fascinated by the darker side of human nature, and true crime stories were her guilty pleasure. As she turned the pages, Ursula's mind began to wander back to the past.

Years ago, when Ursula was just a teenager, a string of mysterious murders had shaken Ravenswood to its core. The killer had left behind no leads, and the case remained unsolved to this day. Some said it was the work of a serial killer, while others believed it was a disgruntled ex-lover seeking revenge.

Ursula's curiosity had always been piqued by the mystery, and she had spent countless hours poring over old newspapers and police reports. She had even created her own theory, which involved a unlikely suspect: a reclusive old man who lived on the outskirts of town.

As the night wore on, Ursula became more and more engrossed in her book, completely forgetting about the rain pounding against the windows. But when she finally emerged from her reverie, she was jolted back to reality by the sound of her phone ringing. It was her best friend, Emma, calling to ask if she wanted to meet up for a nightcap.

Ursula agreed, and soon found herself sipping cocktails with Emma at the local pub. As they chatted about everything from their jobs to their love lives, Ursula couldn't shake off the feeling that there was something more sinister lurking beneath the surface of Ravenswood's seemingly idyllic streets. Little did she know, her next big adventure was just around the corner.
