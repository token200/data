Ursula Esposito stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small town with a mix of curiosity and apprehension. She had never been to Ravenswood before, but a letter from an old friend had brought her back to the place where she grew up.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Ursula's mind wandered back to her childhood days spent exploring these very same streets with her best friend, Rachel. They had shared countless adventures, from sneaking into the abandoned mill on the outskirts of town to climbing trees in the nearby woods.

But life had taken them down different paths, and Ursula had often wondered what had become of Rachel after they parted ways. The letter, it turned out, was from Rachel herself, inviting Ursula back to Ravenswood for a visit.

Ursula's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her phone buzzing in her pocket. She pulled it out to find a text from an unknown number: "Be careful around here, Ursula Esposito." The message sent a shiver down her spine, but she pushed it aside, telling herself it was probably just a prank.

As she walked further into town, Ursula noticed that the streets were eerily quiet. The shops and restaurants that had once been bustling with activity now stood empty and still. She couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, and her instincts told her to be careful.

Eventually, she arrived at Rachel's house, a cozy little bungalow on Elm Street. The door opened, and Rachel welcomed Ursula with a warm smile. "I'm so glad you're here," she said, hugging her friend tightly. "We've got a lot of catching up to do."

Over the next few days, Ursula and Rachel spent their time reminiscing about old times and exploring the town together. But despite the warm welcome, Ursula couldn't shake the feeling that something was lurking just beneath the surface, waiting to pounce. And whenever she looked at her friend, she wondered: what secrets had Rachel been keeping all these years?
