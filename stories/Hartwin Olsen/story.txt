Hartwin Olsen sat at his desk, staring blankly at the stack of papers in front of him. As the lead detective on the cold case unit, he had seen it all - the gruesome murders, the heartbreaking families, and the countless dead ends. But nothing seemed to stick.

As a young man, Hartwin had always been drawn to the darker side of human nature. Growing up on the wrong side of the tracks, he knew what it was like to feel like you were staring into the abyss. And yet, despite all that, he had found solace in the one thing that made sense to him - solving mysteries.

His latest case was a particularly puzzling one. A woman named Sarah had been found dead in her apartment, with no signs of forced entry or struggle. The only clue was a small note on the kitchen counter, bearing the words "I'm not alone". Hartwin's gut told him that this was more than just another senseless murder.

As he pored over the evidence, his mind kept wandering back to Sarah's family. They were shaken, but otherwise cooperative with the police. He remembered one young daughter in particular, who had been holding onto a small stuffed rabbit tightly during the interview. It was then that Hartwin realized something - this case might be about more than just a killer; it might be about someone trying to leave a message.

Hartwin's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of his phone ringing. He picked up to hear a gruff voice on the other end. "Detective Olsen, I think I've found something." It was one of the officers who had responded to Sarah's apartment that night. "We got a surveillance camera footage from across the street. Someone was seen lurking around Sarah's building around 10 pm."

Hartwin's heart skipped a beat as he grabbed his notebook and pen. "Can we get a copy of that footage now?" The officer promised it would be on his way to Hartwin's desk within the hour.

As the hours ticked by, Hartwin couldn't shake off the feeling that something was missing. He felt like there was another piece of the puzzle out there, just waiting for him to find it. And then, suddenly, he saw it - a tiny inconsistency in the officer's description of the figure on the footage. It was small, but it was enough.

Hartwin's mind began racing as he pieced together the evidence. He knew that this case wasn't about a killer at all; it was about someone who wanted to be heard. And with that realization, everything fell into place.
