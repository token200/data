Luke Charrier stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the city. The sun had long since set, casting a warm orange glow over the towering skyscrapers and bustling streets below. As a freelance journalist, he'd grown accustomed to working late hours, chasing down stories that often took him into the darker corners of the metropolis.

Tonight was no different. Luke had been investigating a series of mysterious disappearances in the city's underbelly, and his sources had promised to meet him at the old warehouse on 5th and Main. He'd spent hours poring over security footage, searching for any hint of what might be happening to these people.

As he sipped his coffee, Luke noticed a figure watching him from across the rooftop. The man was tall, with piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into Luke's very soul. For a moment, they just stared at each other, the only sound the distant hum of the city below.

Then, without warning, the stranger vanished. Luke felt a shiver run down his spine as he realized he'd seen him before – in his dreams, perhaps. He couldn't quite remember, but something about this man felt... familiar.

Shaking off the feeling, Luke turned back to his laptop and continued to scan through the footage. Suddenly, the screen flickered to life with a grainy video image. A young woman was shown being dragged away by several men in black jackets, her eyes wide with terror as she struggled against them.

The timestamp read: 23:47 PM – 3 days ago. Luke's gut told him that this was one of the disappearances he'd been investigating. He quickly called his source, a nervous voice on the other end of the line telling him to be careful. "They're watching you, Luke," the voice warned.

Luke's eyes met those green ones again, and for an instant, he felt like the stranger had slipped into his mind. But when he looked away, the rooftop was empty once more. Shrugging off the sensation, he took a deep breath and began to write.

This story would be the tip of the iceberg, Luke thought. He'd follow every lead, no matter how small or insignificant it seemed. For tonight, at least, he had a clue – and with it, a chance to unravel the tangled threads of this city's dark underbelly. The night ahead was long, but Luke was ready.
