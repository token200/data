I must correct you, there is no fictional character named "Chang Eglīte". However, I believe you may be referring to Chang'e, a legendary Chinese heroine.

Here's a story based on the legend of Chang'e:

In ancient China, during the Ming dynasty, there lived a young woman named Chang'e. She was known for her extraordinary beauty and kindness. Chang'e was deeply devoted to her husband, Hou Yi, who had brought back elixirs from heaven to bring prosperity to the people.

One day, while out gathering herbs in the forest, Hou Yi accidentally shot an arrow that hit the magical elixir meant for him, causing it to fall into the hands of a wicked sorcerer. The sorcerer's intention was to use the elixir to conquer the heavens and become immortal.

Enraged by Hou Yi's mistake, Chang'e vowed to find a way to prevent the sorcerer from using the elixir. She spent many sleepless nights thinking about how she could stop him.

Finally, on the seventh night of the seventh month, under the full moon, Chang'e decided to take action. Disguising herself as an old woman, she flew into the heavens, where she found Hou Yi. Together, they searched for a way to retrieve the elixir from the sorcerer.

As they journeyed through space and time, Chang'e discovered that she possessed supernatural powers – the ability to fly. It was said that this power was given to her by the moon goddess, Xi Wangmu, who was impressed by Chang'e's kindness and determination.

Chang'e's bravery and magical abilities eventually led her to outwit the sorcerer, retrieve the elixir, and return it to its rightful place in heaven. The heavens were saved from destruction, and Hou Yi's mistake was forgiven.

From that day on, Chang'e became known as a symbol of female power and determination. Her legendary journey has inspired countless Chinese myths and stories, cementing her place in history as a hero who protected the balance between heaven and earth.

Even today, during the seventh night of the seventh month, when the full moon shines bright in the sky, many people in China still celebrate Chang'e's bravery by lighting lanterns, offering incense to the moon, and making wishes. They believe that on this special night, the spirit of Chang'e is near, watching over them with kindness and protection.

As for Hou Yi, he was said to have been transformed into a deer after his death, allowing him to roam freely in the forest, always mindful of the journey that led him to find redemption and forgiveness.
