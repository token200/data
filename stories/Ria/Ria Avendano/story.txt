Ria Avendano walked into the small caf√© on her way to meet her friends. She was running late, as usual, and was hoping that they would still have room for her. As she waited in line, she fidgeted with the hem of her jacket, a habit she had developed when she was stressed.

When it was finally her turn to order, Ria Avendano smiled brightly at the barista, who knew her by name and always saved her favorite coffee drink. "The usual, Ria," she said, and the barista nodded in response.

As she waited for her coffee, Ria Avendano took a seat at the small table by the window and pulled out her phone to check her schedule for the day. She had a big meeting at work later that afternoon with one of her clients, and was feeling a bit nervous about it.

Her friends, Maria and Alex, walked in just as she was checking her emails. They were laughing and chatting, and Ria Avendano couldn't help but smile as she saw them. The three of them had been friends since college, and despite their different careers and interests, they always made time for each other.

Over coffee and pastries, the conversation turned to work and school. Ria Avendano shared stories about her latest project, which was going surprisingly well. Maria and Alex offered words of encouragement and support, reminding her that she had done this before and could do it again.

As they finished their drinks and prepared to part ways, Maria reached out and put a hand on Ria Avendano's arm. "You're going to crush that meeting," she said, and Ria Avendano smiled, feeling a surge of confidence. She knew that with her friends by her side, she could face anything that came her way.

With a renewed sense of determination, Ria Avendano stood up and headed out the door, ready to take on whatever challenges lay ahead.
