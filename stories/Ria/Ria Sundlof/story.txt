Ria Astrid Sundlof stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station with a mix of curiosity and trepidation. She had never been to Ravenshire before, but her family's old farmhouse was in need of repair, and she had volunteered to take on the task. As she gathered her bags, Ria couldn't help but feel a sense of disconnection from the world around her. Her mother's passing had left a void that seemed impossible to fill.

As she made her way through the sleepy town, Ria was struck by its quaint charm and the familiar faces of the locals. She felt like an outsider, yet at the same time, there was something about Ravenshire that drew her in. The air was thick with history, and Ria could almost smell the stories etched into every stone and brick.

After checking into the local inn, Ria set to work on the farm, her hands moving wearily as she repaired broken fences and tended to the overgrown fields. Her thoughts drifted back to her childhood days spent exploring these very same lands with her mother. The memories were bittersweet, but they gave her a sense of purpose.

As the sun began to set, Ria took a break by the river, watching as the light danced across the water. She pulled out her sketchbook and began to draw, letting the strokes of her pencil flow freely onto the page. For a moment, she forgot about the weight of her responsibilities and simply let herself be present.

As the stars began to twinkle overhead, Ria closed her eyes and listened to the soft lapping of the river against the shore. She felt a sense of peace settle over her, as if Ravenshire was slowly wrapping its arms around her like an old cloak. It was as if her mother's spirit had finally found a way to whisper in her ear: "You're home now, Ria Astrid Sundlof."
