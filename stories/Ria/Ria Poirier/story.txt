Ria Poirier stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of her friend. She had been searching for weeks, trying to track down Lucien Dupont, who had promised to meet her here to discuss a business opportunity.

As she waited, Ria's mind wandered back to their last conversation. They had been working together on a project, and Ria Poirier was convinced that Lucien Dupont knew of something big - something that could make them both rich beyond their wildest dreams.

Just as Ria was starting to lose hope, a figure emerged from the crowd. It was Lucien Dupont, his dark hair mussed and his eyes tired. He smiled when he saw her, and Ria's heart skipped a beat.

"Sorry I'm late," Lucien Dupont said, falling into step beside her. "Traffic was a nightmare."

Ria Poirier shot him a look of mock annoyance. "You're always running late, Lucien Dupont. It's one of your most charming qualities."

Lucien Dupont chuckled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "Hey, someone has to keep you on your toes," he said.

As they made their way through the station, Ria Poirier couldn't help but notice the way Lucien Dupont moved with an air of confidence that she admired. He was a true entrepreneur, always chasing his next big opportunity and never backing down from a challenge.

They reached the agreed meeting point - a small café on the outskirts of town - and slipped inside to take a seat at a quiet table in the corner. Ria Poirier pulled out her notebook and pen, ready to take notes as Lucien Dupont began to explain his idea.

It was something big, Ria Poirier could feel it. Something that had the potential to change their lives forever. She listened intently as Lucien Dupont outlined his plan, her mind racing with possibilities.

As they finished up and prepared to part ways, Ria Poirier turned to Lucien Dupont with a smile. "I think we're onto something here," she said.

Lucien Dupont grinned back at her, his eyes sparkling with excitement. "I knew you'd see it my way, Ria Poirier."

Together, they left the café and stepped out into the bright sunlight, ready to take on whatever challenges lay ahead.
