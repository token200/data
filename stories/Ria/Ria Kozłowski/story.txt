Ria Kozłowski sat alone in her small apartment, staring blankly at the wall as she tried to shake off the lingering feeling of emptiness. It had been months since her best friend, Lena, left for a new job on the other side of the country, and Ria couldn't help but feel like a part of her had been torn away.

As she wandered aimlessly around her apartment, Ria's mind began to wander back to all the memories they had shared. The late-night conversations about life and love, the laughter-filled nights spent watching movies together, and the countless hours spent exploring new places – it was all etched in her memory like a map of the city she knew so well.

Ria Kozłowski sighed heavily as she flopped down onto her couch, the worn cushions comforting under her weary frame. She felt lost without Lena by her side, like a leaf blown away from its tree on a gusty wind. But as she sat there, something inside of her began to stir. It was a small spark, but it was enough to ignite the flame of determination that burned within her.

With newfound resolve, Ria Kozłowski leapt off the couch and began to tidy up her apartment with a sense of purpose. She put on some music and started to dance, twirling around the room like she used to do with Lena. The feeling was still there, but it was no longer tinged with sadness; it was now tinged with hope.

As the hours passed, Ria Kozłowski found herself lost in the rhythm of the music and the beat of her own heart. She started to see the world through new eyes, as if everything had changed since Lena left. And when she finally took a break to make herself a cup of tea, she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror and smiled – a smile that said, "I'm going to be okay."

Ria Kozłowski's eyes sparkled with a newfound sense of strength as she wrapped her arms around herself, holding onto the feeling like a lifeline. She knew that life would never be the same without Lena, but she also knew that she was ready to face whatever came next – alone and unafraid.
