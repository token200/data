Ria Larsson stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the cool mist of the Swedish lake air enveloping her like a damp hug. She had spent years away from this small town on the shores of Lake Vättern, but it was home, and she knew every curve and contour of its streets and houses.

As a journalist, Ria had covered some big stories in her time, but none as personal as this one. Her younger brother, Marcus, had gone missing three years ago, and the police had never found him. The family had searched far and wide, but there were leads to follow and secrets to uncover.

Ria's thoughts turned to her parents, who still lived in the old house on Elm Street. She had promised them she would be careful, that she wouldn't take any unnecessary risks. But the truth was, she couldn't sit idly by while someone else tried to uncover the truth about Marcus' disappearance.

As she made her way back through the town, Ria noticed the way people looked at her - with a mix of curiosity and suspicion. She knew it was because of the Larsson name. The local press had been tight-lipped about the investigation all these years, but whispers of a family scandal had spread like wildfire.

Ria ducked into the old café on Main Street, where she always met up with her source, Old Tom. He was an elderly fisherman who had spent his life on Lake Vättern, and Ria trusted him implicitly. She slid onto a stool beside him and took a sip of coffee.

"The wind's picking up," Old Tom said, nodding towards the lake. "It's like the water's trying to tell us something."

Ria leaned in close. "What do you know, Tom?"

Old Tom hesitated, glancing around the café before speaking in a hushed tone. "I've seen things on my boat at night," he said, his eyes darting towards Ria. "Strange lights on the water, people... or maybe I imagined it."

Ria's heart skipped a beat. This was exactly what she needed - a lead. She scribbled down notes in her pad as Old Tom continued to talk, sharing stories of the strange occurrences that had been happening around town for weeks.

As they talked, Ria felt the puzzle pieces falling into place. The mysterious lights on the water were no accident; someone was trying to send a message. And she was determined to be the one to uncover it.
