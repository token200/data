After completing law school, Ria joined a local non-profit organization that specialized in advocating for workers' rights and social justice. It was there that she met her closest friends and confidants, a group of like-minded individuals who shared her commitment to creating change.

One day, Ria received a call from a woman who had been forced into an abusive relationship by her own family. The woman was trapped and feared for her safety if she spoke out. Ria listened attentively, her eyes filling with tears as the woman poured out her heart. With calm determination, Ria reassured the woman that she would do everything in her power to help.

That moment marked a turning point in Ria Hassan's journey. It reminded her of why she had dedicated her life to fighting for justice and inspired her to continue pushing boundaries and breaking barriers. As she walked out of the office that day, Ria felt an unshakeable sense of purpose â€“ a sense that she was exactly where she was meant to be.
