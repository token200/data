Ria Straume stepped out of her small apartment and into the crisp morning air. As she walked to the local caf√©, she couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. It had been three days since the mysterious package arrived at her doorstep, containing only a cryptic note with her full name: Ria Straume.

The words sent shivers down her spine. Who could have sent it? And why? She tried to brush it off as mere paranoia, but the sense of unease lingered. Ria Straume had always been a private person, keeping her personal life and relationships close to her chest. The sudden invasion of her privacy was unsettling.

As she sipped her coffee, Ria Straume couldn't help but wonder if this was more than just a prank. She thought back to the events leading up to the package's arrival: the strange phone calls, the unexplained noises in the night. It all seemed too coincidental.

Determined to get to the bottom of things, Ria Straume decided to dig deeper. She spent the rest of the day researching online, scouring forums and social media for any mention of her name or similar cases. The more she learned, the more convinced she became that something sinister was at play.

As the sun began to set, Ria Straume received another message: this time, a text with a single sentence - "You're getting close." Her heart racing, she knew she had to be careful. She couldn't let her guard down, not even for a moment.

With a newfound sense of determination, Ria Straume vowed to uncover the truth behind the mysterious package and its sender. She was no longer just a victim; she was a detective on the case. And with each passing minute, she felt more empowered to face whatever lay ahead. The game had begun, and Ria Straume was ready to play.
