Ria Hansen stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any signs of life. As a freelance journalist, she was no stranger to traveling solo, but there was something about this particular assignment that didn't sit right with her. The village of Ravenswood, nestled in the heart of the Scottish Highlands, was rumored to be haunted by the ghost of a young woman named Ailsa.

Ria had always been skeptical of such tales, but as she made her way through the mist-shrouded streets, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. She stopped at the local pub, ordering a pint of ale and striking up a conversation with the bartender, an old man named Angus who seemed to know everything about Ravenswood's history.

"I'm Ria Hansen," she said, extending her hand. "I'm here to research the legend of Ailsa."

Angus eyed her warily, but nodded and began to spin a tale of love, loss, and tragedy. As he spoke, Ria found herself becoming increasingly engrossed in the story, her skepticism slowly eroding.

That night, as she lay in her room at the local B&B, Ria couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. She tried to focus on her research, but her mind kept wandering back to Angus's words and the haunted village below.

It wasn't until she stumbled upon an old photograph of Ailsa herself, standing proudly in front of the village hall, that Ria felt a shiver run down her spine. Suddenly, the legend didn't seem so far-fetched anymore. She began to wonder if there was truth to the stories after all – and if Ria Hansen was prepared for what might be lurking in the shadows.

With a newfound sense of unease, Ria settled back into her research, determined to uncover the truth behind Ravenswood's ghostly legend. As she delved deeper into the village's history, she couldn't help but feel that Ailsa Hansen – or whatever lay beyond – was watching her every move.
