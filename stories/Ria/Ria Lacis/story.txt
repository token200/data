Ria Lacis stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station with a practiced air of disinterest. A seasoned traveler, she had grown accustomed to the familiar rhythms of departure and arrival, but there was something about this place that caught her off guard – perhaps the way the sunlight filtering through the grimy windows cast an otherworldly glow over the worn tiles.

As she made her way through the thronging crowd, Ria Lacis's mind began to wander back to the reasons that had brought her here in the first place. She was on a mission to reconnect with a long-lost friend, one whose paths had diverged like the branches of some ancient tree during their university days.

Ria Lacis had often thought about what might have been if she and her friend, Elara, had taken a different path together – but life had a way of unfolding in unexpected ways, and it seemed that fate had brought them full circle once again. She made her way through the crowds, her eyes scanning for a glimpse of Elara's familiar smile.

As she turned a corner, Ria Lacis spotted her friend standing by the ticket counter, her dark hair pulled back into a ponytail and her bright blue eyes shining with warmth as she chatted with a passing stranger. Ria Lacis felt a surge of excitement and relief wash over her – it was good to see Elara again, to reconnect and rediscover the easy camaraderie they had once shared.

Over the next few hours, Ria Lacis and Elara caught up on lost time, reminiscing about old friends and sharing stories of their separate journeys. As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the station, Ria Lacis felt grateful for this second chance – to reconnect with someone who had once been such an important part of her life.

As they parted ways at the train station, Elara leaned in and pressed a small package into Ria Lacis's hand. "For old times' sake," she whispered, before turning to disappear into the crowd.
