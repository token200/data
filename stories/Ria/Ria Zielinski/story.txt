Ria Zielinski stepped into the small café, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a private investigator specializing in cases involving supernatural entities, she had seen her fair share of eerie moments. But this one felt different.

She spotted the owner, old man Jenkins, hunched over a newspaper at his usual corner table. Ria slid into the chair across from him, catching his eye and nodding discreetly for him to finish reading in peace.

Jenkins set down his cup, wiping the condensation from the table with a dirty rag. "Ria Zielinski, what brings you here today?" he asked, his voice laced with curiosity.

"Just doing some research on the latest sightings," she replied, her eyes locked onto a small symbol etched into the rim of his coffee cup. The same symbol that had been popping up in multiple cases around town.

Jenkins leaned forward, his expression grave. "I've been noticing it too, Ria. People have been acting strange lately – nightmares, hearing whispers when no one's around... I think something is brewing."

Ria nodded intently, her mind racing with theories. She pulled out a notebook and began jotting down notes as Jenkins spoke.

"...and last night, the local bookstore owner reported seeing a shadowy figure lurking in the stacks," he continued.

As Ria listened, she felt a shiver run down her spine. She had been tracking this phenomenon for weeks, but nothing could have prepared her for how eerily it was manifesting now.

Just as Jenkins finished speaking, the café door swung open and a chill wind swept in, extinguishing the lights. The patrons gasped in unison, and Ria's instincts screamed at her to get out – fast.

With quick reflexes, she leapt from her chair, grabbing Jenkins' arm and propelling him toward the exit. As they stumbled into the cool night air, the wind died down, and an unsettling silence fell over the street.

Ria Zielinski stood tall, eyes scanning the darkness for any sign of what lurked within. She was ready to face whatever supernatural entity had come knocking – head-on.
