Ria Sten stood tall, her piercing blue eyes scanning the dimly lit corridor. As a detective with the Helsinki police department, she had seen her fair share of gruesome crimes, but this one sent a chill down her spine.

The victim was a young woman, found brutally murdered in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of the city. The only clue was a small note left at the scene, bearing Ria's name and the words "You're next".

Ria knew that she had to act fast. She spent hours poring over the evidence, searching for any connection between the victim and her own past. But the more she dug, the more elusive the answers seemed.

As the night wore on, Ria received a call from an anonymous source claiming to be the killer. The voice on the other end was distorted, but one thing was clear: they knew Ria's deepest secrets.

"You think you're so smart, don't you?" the voice sneered. "But I've been watching you for months. I know all about your mistakes, Ria. And soon, everyone will."

Ria's grip on her phone tightened as she realized that this was no ordinary stalker. This person had a personal vendetta against her, and they would stop at nothing to destroy her.

Despite the fear that gripped her heart, Ria refused to back down. She knew that she couldn't let her past define her, not now. With newfound determination, she set out to track down the killer, following a trail of cryptic clues and red herrings that led her deeper into the dark underbelly of Helsinki.

As the sun began to rise over the city, Ria finally stumbled upon a lead - a small tattoo on one of the victim's wrists, matching an identical symbol on a tattoo artist she had met years ago. It was a connection, no matter how tenuous.

With her next move carefully planned, Ria prepared for a showdown with the killer, knowing that this time, it wouldn't be just about solving a crime - it would be about confronting the demons of her own past.
