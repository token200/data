Ria Borromeo stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar station. As the daughter of a wealthy industrialist, she was no stranger to travel, but there was something about this small town that felt different. The air was thick with an otherworldly silence, punctuated only by the distant rumble of the river.

Ria Borromeo took a deep breath, feeling the cool mist fill her lungs. She had come to this tiny town in search of solace, fleeing the chaos of her family's business empire and the constant scrutiny that came with it. Her mother, Viviana, would be furious if she knew Ria was here, but for once, she just wanted to be alone.

As she made her way through the deserted streets, Ria Borromeo couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. Every step seemed to echo off the buildings, and the shadows seemed to twist and writhe on the walls. She quickened her pace, her heart beating a little faster with every passing moment.

Finally, she reached the small hotel where she had booked a room for the night. The proprietor, an elderly woman named Madame Dupont, greeted her warmly and handed over the key with a smile. "Room 314, upstairs," she said. "You'll find everything you need in there."

Ria Borromeo took the stairs two at a time, her feet pounding out a rhythm on the worn wooden steps. She burst into room 314, slamming the door shut behind her and leaning against it to catch her breath.

For a moment, she simply stood there, listening to the silence. It was oppressive, heavy with secrets and whispers, but for once, Ria Borromeo felt like she could finally exhale. She took off her coat and hung it on a hook by the door, letting out a sigh of relief as she sank onto the bed.

As she looked around the small room, she felt a sense of peace wash over her. This was where she belonged â€“ not in the whirlwind of her family's business or in the spotlight, but alone, with only her thoughts to keep her company.
