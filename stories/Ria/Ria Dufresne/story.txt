Ria Dufresne stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the cool mist of the sea air enveloping her like a warm hug. She had spent years away from this small coastal town, chasing dreams in the city and building a name for herself as a journalist. But after a painful loss and a grueling job, she found herself drawn back to the place where it all began.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Ria felt the weight of her past bearing down on her. She had always been close to her family, but growing up in Ravenswood-by-the-Sea had also meant being acutely aware of its limitations – the stifling smallness, the gossip that spread like wildfire, and the relentless scrutiny of everyone's business.

She stopped at her childhood home, a small beachside cottage with a wraparound porch where she'd spent countless hours reading, daydreaming, or simply watching the waves. Her mother's old wooden rocking chair sat on the porch, creaking gently in the breeze – it was a sound Ria hadn't heard since her return from the city.

As she pushed open the door to the cottage, a wave of memories washed over her. There were the summers spent building sandcastles with her siblings, the winter storms when the windows would fog up and they'd sit by the fire listening to her father's tales of sea-faring adventures. And, of course, there was the summer she'd almost drowned herself as a teenager.

Ria had always struggled to come to terms with that incident – the pain, the shame, the feeling of being trapped in a town where everyone knew and judged her every move. But as she stood on the porch now, listening to the sound of the gulls overhead, she realized that it was those same memories that drew her back.

She felt the warmth of the sun seeping into her bones, and with it, a sense of hope and renewal. She'd come home to find herself, not just to escape the city's noise and distractions. Ravenswood-by-the-Sea might be small, but its rhythms – the ebb and flow of the tides, the laughter of children on the beach, the scent of salt in the air – were what had always anchored her soul.

For Ria Dufresne, this return to home was not just about starting anew; it was about embracing her past, and all its pain and beauty, as a stepping stone to the future.
