Ria Muti stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station with a mixture of curiosity and trepidation. She had always been drawn to the sea, and now, after years of living in the city, she had decided to take a leap of faith and return to her hometown by the ocean.

As she made her way through the crowded streets, Ria Muti couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her. She had grown up playing on these very beaches, learning to surf and swim from her father, who had passed away when she was just a teenager. Her mother had raised her alone, working multiple jobs to make ends meet, but Ria Muti's heart had always felt like it belonged somewhere else.

She finally arrived at the small beachside cafe where her best friend, Akira, worked. The bell above the door jingled as she pushed it open, and Akira looked up from behind the counter with a warm smile. "Ria! It's been too long!" She exclaimed, as Ria Muti slid onto a stool at the counter.

Over steaming cups of coffee, Ria Muti filled Akira in on her decision to leave the city behind. She had been feeling unfulfilled and restless, like there was something missing from her life that she couldn't quite put her finger on. Akira listened intently, nodding along as Ria Muti talked.

As they chatted, a group of tourists stumbled into the cafe, looking for a place to grab a quick breakfast before heading out onto the waves. Ria Muti watched them with a sense of longing, wondering what it would be like to trade in her corporate job for a life by the ocean. She had always been drawn to the freedom and simplicity of life at the beach.

As she finished up her coffee, Akira handed her a small key. "I have something to show you," she said, a mischievous glint in her eye. Ria Muti followed her out of the cafe and down the street, the sound of the waves growing louder with every step. They finally arrived at an old, weathered shack on the edge of town, the key jingling as Akira unlocked the door.

 Inside, a collection of surfboards and beach gear was strewn about the room, but what caught Ria Muti's eye was a small, leather-bound journal lying open on a nearby table. The pages were filled with her own handwriting, words spilling out onto the page like tears. It seemed that Akira had known all along that Ria Muti needed to come home.
