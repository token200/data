Ria Kalnins stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small town of Ravenswood as if searching for a familiar face. It had been years since she'd returned to this place, but the memories still lingered like the scent of old books on a dusty shelf.

As a child, Ria Kalnins had spent countless summers exploring these woods with her grandfather, a renowned botanist who'd taught her everything he knew about the delicate balance of nature. His passing had left a void in her life, but it was here, among the towering trees and whispering streams, that she felt closest to him.

The stationmaster's wife approached her, a warm smile on her face. "Ria Kalnins! It's been far too long. How did you find us?"

"Just as I expected," Ria replied, shaking off the fatigue of travel. She'd left Ravenswood with a sense of restlessness, unsure of what lay ahead but drawn to this place like a moth to flame.

As she made her way through town, familiar faces nodded in recognition – the baker's children would now be old men; the postmaster had retired and taken up gardening. Everyone seemed older, yet wiser. In Ravenswood, time was measured not by years but by seasons.

A knock on Ria's door interrupted her reverie as she settled into a small cottage overlooking the woods. It belonged to Emily, a childhood friend who'd long since moved away. "Ria! Come in!" Emily exclaimed, ushering her inside.

Together they sipped tea and exchanged stories of distant lives – Ria Kalnins of city parks, Emily of distant landscapes. But as the afternoon wore on, it became clear that Ravenswood still held a piece of Ria's heart, like an old key fitting into its worn lock. She felt at home here, as if some part of her had always been meant to stay.

As night fell and the stars began their whispered lullaby above, Ria stood up from her chair, letting out a soft sigh. This was where she'd returned – not to reclaim a past that would never be hers alone, but to rediscover a sense of belonging that had long eluded her.
