Ria Kovacs was a force to be reckoned with in the world of high-stakes art dealing. Her sharp mind and quick wit had earned her a reputation as one of the most skilled negotiators on the market. With a background in fine art history, Ria had honed her skills over years of building relationships with collectors, curators, and artists alike.

As she navigated the crowded streets of Manhattan, Ria's eyes scanned the crowded sidewalks for any sign of trouble. Her instincts were always on high alert, and she knew that one misstep could mean disaster in her line of work. With a quick flick of her dark hair, she ducked into an alleyway to avoid a group of rowdy teenagers.

Reemerging onto the sidewalk, Ria spotted her contact, Jack, waiting for her outside the Gagosian Gallery. They had arranged to meet here to discuss a potentially lucrative sale – a rare piece by the Hungarian artist, Gyula Kerner. Rumor had it that this particular work, 'Nocturne', was one of only five in existence.

As they stepped inside, Ria felt a thrill run through her veins. This could be the deal of a lifetime, and she was determined to see it through. Jack handed her a folder containing all the details, including price negotiations and documentation for provenance.

Over coffee, they pored over the documents, discussing every nuance of the sale. Ria's keen eye picked out potential pitfalls, while Jack's calm demeanor kept the conversation steady. The air was thick with tension as they weighed their options – would they take a risk on this prized artwork, or play it safe?

As the meeting drew to a close, Ria knew that she had made her decision. With a confident smile, she reached for her phone and dialed the number of her business partner, Ivan. "It's done," she said, without hesitation. And with that, the wheels were set in motion. The fate of 'Nocturne' hung precariously in the balance, but Ria Kovacs was ready to take on whatever came next.
