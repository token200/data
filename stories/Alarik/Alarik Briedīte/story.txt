Alarik Briedīte stood at the edge of the frozen lake, his eyes scanning the horizon as if searching for something that only he could see. The Baltic wind whipped through his dark hair, and his piercing blue eyes narrowed against the biting cold.

Legend had it that Alarik was a cursed soul, doomed to wander the wilderness until his heart's deepest secret was revealed. Some said he was a prince, stripped of his royal title for treasonous deeds; others whispered that he was an innocent man, wrongly accused and left to rot in prison.

Alarik knew the truth – or at least, what he had come to understand over the years. He was no one. Not prince, nor king, nor commoner. Just a man with a name that meant "noble birth" but felt like a cruel joke to his ears.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Alarik began to pace along the lake's edge, his boots crunching through the frost. He had always been drawn to water – its calming power, its secrets hidden beneath the surface. Tonight, he sought solace in the frozen expanse before him.

Suddenly, a faint cry pierced the air. Alarik's head jerked up, and he followed the sound to a small wooden boat pulled onto the ice. In the center of the boat lay a child – a girl with skin as pale as snow and hair that flowed like the river itself.

Without hesitation, Alarik leapt into the boat and began to row. The wind howled around him, but he felt an odd sense of calm wash over his shoulders. He rowed harder, faster, until they reached the lake's center – a spot where the water seemed to be pulling him toward some unknown destination.

As they floated there, Alarik turned to the girl and saw that her eyes were closed, her chest rising and falling in time with the lapping waves. She stirred, opening one eye as if sensing his presence.

In a voice barely above a whisper, she asked: "Who are you?"

Alarik hesitated, then replied: "I am Alarik Briedīte, no more."

The girl's gaze lingered on him for an instant before she smiled and fell silent. The wind died down, the stars reappeared in the sky, and Alarik felt his heart – or at least, whatever was left of it – begin to mend.

For the first time in as long as he could remember, Alarik Briedīte felt free.
