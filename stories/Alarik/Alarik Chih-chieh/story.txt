The shop was dimly lit, but as her eyes adjusted, Alarik Chih-chieh saw rows of peculiar objects on the shelves: crystal balls, ancient-looking tomes bound in black leather, and strange artifacts that seemed to defy explanation. A figure emerged from the shadows – an old man with wispy white hair and eyes that twinkled like stars.
