Weeks turned into months as Alarik worked tirelessly in his studio. He experimented with different materials and techniques, testing the boundaries of his art. Finally, the day arrived when he presented Madame Dupont with his masterpiece: "Fractured Reality." The painting depicted a swirling vortex of colors, evoking feelings of both order and disorder.
