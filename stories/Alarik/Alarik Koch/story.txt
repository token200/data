Alarik Koch stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. As he waited in line to order, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. It had been months since he'd last seen his brother, and the weight of that silence hung heavy in the air.

When it was finally his turn, Alarik ordered a cup of black coffee and took a seat at the bar, watching as the morning crowd trickled in. He pulled out his phone, scrolling through social media feeds to catch up on old friends' lives. That's when he saw her post – a picture of his brother, smiling with a group of new friends.

Alarik felt a pang of jealousy and anger. Why had his brother moved on so quickly? Hadn't their bond been strong enough to withstand even the toughest challenges? He tried to shake off the emotions, telling himself that he needed to focus on his own life, not dwell on what could have been.

Just then, the door swung open and his brother walked in, unaware of Alarik's piercing gaze. As he spotted him across the room, a look of surprise flashed across his face before quickly fading into a forced smile.

"Hey, Alarik," his brother said, walking over to join him at the bar. "It's been too long."

They exchanged awkward pleasantries, neither one willing to broach the elephant in the room. Alarik couldn't help but notice that his brother seemed different – more carefree, more confident.

As they sipped their coffee and chatted about old times, Alarik found himself growing increasingly frustrated. His brother's new life was a stark contrast to the one they had once shared, and he couldn't shake the feeling of resentment that lingered beneath the surface.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, his brother stood up to leave, saying he had to get back to work. As Alarik watched him go, he realized that their bond might never be the same again – and that was a painful truth he couldn't escape.
