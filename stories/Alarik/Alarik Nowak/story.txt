Alarik Nowak sat alone at his desk, staring out the window as the sun set over the bustling streets of Krakow. A historian by trade, Alarik had spent years studying the rich history of Poland, but tonight he found himself lost in thought.

As a young man, Alarik had always been fascinated by the stories of the past. He devoured books on everything from medieval politics to ancient mythology, and had even spent a summer working at a museum in Warsaw, where he'd spent countless hours pouring over dusty artifacts and documents.

But it wasn't until he stumbled upon an obscure text about a 14th-century Polish king that Alarik's true passion was ignited. The king, named Władysław II Jagiełło, had been a hero of the Polish-Lithuanian union, and Alarik became obsessed with uncovering more about his life and reign.

As he delved deeper into his research, Alarik began to notice strange coincidences between Władysław's life and his own. He'd always felt like an outsider in Poland, with a complicated family history that had left him feeling disconnected from his heritage.

One night, as he was working late at the university library, Alarik stumbled upon a hidden room deep in the stacks. Inside, he found a yellowed letter addressed to Władysław II himself, written by an unknown hand. As he read through the words, Alarik felt a shiver run down his spine - this was no ordinary letter.

The words spoke of a curse that had been placed upon Władysław's family, one that would haunt them for generations to come. Alarik felt a chill run down his spine as he realized that he himself was descended from the same bloodline.

Suddenly, the world around him came into focus. He knew why he'd always felt like an outsider - it wasn't because of his complicated family history, but because he was a direct descendant of Władysław's cursed lineage.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Alarik knew that his life would never be the same again. He had uncovered a dark secret about his own past, one that threatened to upend everything he thought he knew about himself and his heritage.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Alarik gathered his belongings and left the library, ready to embark on a journey to uncover the truth about Władysław II and the curse that had been cast upon him.
