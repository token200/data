Alarik Mägi stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of familiarity. The Estonian poet had been traveling for weeks, gathering inspiration from the rugged landscapes and folk tales of the rural communities he visited. As he made his way to the bar, a low murmur of conversation turned to him, and a few patrons nodded in recognition.

"Alarik Mägi, the Bard of Estonia," one old man called out, rising from his seat. The poet smiled wryly, accustomed to such nicknames. He ordered a mug of dark ale and sat down at an empty table by the fire, pulling out his notebook to jot down any ideas that struck him.

As he scribbled away, a figure slipped onto the stool beside him, their features obscured by the shadows. "Mind if I join you, Mr. Mägi?" a low voice asked. Alarik looked up, sensing the weight of curiosity behind those words.

"Not at all," he replied, folding his arms across his chest. The stranger pushed back their hood, revealing striking features and piercing green eyes that seemed to hold a deep understanding of the poet's craft. "I am Kaidi," they said, their voice rich and melodious. "A listener from the city."

The two sat in silence for a while, sipping their drinks and watching the flames dance across the walls. It was Alarik Mägi who finally broke the spell, turning to Kaidi with an enigmatic grin. "You have heard my words before," he said, his eyes glinting with intrigue.

Kaidi's gaze lingered on him for a moment, as if trying to decipher some hidden meaning behind those simple words. Then, their face creased into a slow smile, and they leaned forward, hands clasped together in a gesture of respect. "Indeed," they said, their voice barely above a whisper. Alarik Mägi felt a shiver run down his spine as Kaidi began to recite an ancient poem, one he had written himself but never shared with anyone.

The tavern patrons watched in rapt attention as the poet and the listener traded verses, each one weaving a spell of longing and enchantment that seemed to weave itself into the very fabric of the night air. Alarik Mägi listened intently, absorbing every word like a parched traveler drinking from an oasis.

As the final lines faded away, Kaidi fell silent, their eyes locked on his with a profound understanding that bordered on recognition. The poet smiled back, nodding in acknowledgment – for he knew that sometimes, the most powerful words come not from one's own pen, but from the hearts of those who listen to our stories.
