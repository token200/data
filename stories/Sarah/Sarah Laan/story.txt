Sarah Laan trudged through the rain-soaked streets, her worn-out umbrella offering little protection from the deluge. She had always hated walking in the downpour, but it was a necessary evil when you lived on the fringes of society like she did.

As she turned a corner, Sarah caught sight of a small, dingy café that seemed to be her only lifeline in this godforsaken city. She quickened her pace, the smell of stale coffee and damp air enveloping her like a warm hug.

Sarah pushed open the door and was immediately hit with the cacophony of sounds emanating from within: the hum of old computers, the chatter of huddled patrons, and the wail of a saxophone drifting through the speakers. She slipped onto a stool at the counter, running a hand through her tangled hair as she scanned the room for an empty seat.

"Hey, Sal," the bartender, a gruff but kind-eyed man named Max, called out from behind the counter, "the usual?"

Sarah nodded, and Max slid a steaming cup of coffee in front of her. As she took a sip, Sarah's eyes landed on a familiar face across the room – Alex, her old friend and confidant.

Alex had always been the optimistic one, the ray of sunshine that pierced through the darkness. But after losing his family to a tragic accident, he'd retreated into himself, drowning his sorrows in whiskey and self-pity.

Sarah watched as Alex downed shot after shot, the look of desperation growing more pronounced with each passing minute. She knew that if she didn't intervene soon, her friend would be lost forever.

Taking a deep breath, Sarah pushed off from the stool and made her way across the room. "Alex," she said softly, dropping onto the chair beside him. "Hey."

For a moment, Alex just stared at her, his eyes red-rimmed and unresponsive. Then, like a dam breaking, tears streamed down his face as he let out a sob.

Sarah wrapped her arms around him, holding him close as he cried himself dry. She'd been there before – she knew the weight of grief and the pain of loss. But in this moment, surrounded by the damp air and stale coffee, Sarah felt like she was home.
