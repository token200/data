Sarah Altmann stepped into the dimly lit alley, her eyes scanning the crowded streets for any sign of trouble. As a private investigator, she had seen it all - the desperation, the lies, and the deceit. But tonight was different. Tonight, she was searching for something more than just answers.

The phone call from her old friend, Alex, had been cryptic. Something about an old case that had never been solved. The one where Sarah's brother, Michael, had gone missing ten years ago. She had given up on ever finding out what had happened to him. But the mention of a new lead, a mysterious woman with information about his disappearance, was too enticing to ignore.

Sarah pushed open the door to the rundown bar on the corner and slid onto a stool at the end of the counter. The bartender, a gruff but kind man named Jack, nodded in her direction without looking up from polishing a mug.

"What's your poison?" he asked, already knowing the answer.

"Scotch," Sarah replied, taking a seat at a small table by the window.

As she sipped her drink, she noticed a figure sitting across the room, sipping on a glass of water. She recognized the woman's profile - Alex had told her that this was the one. The one with information about Michael's disappearance.

Sarah made her move, pushing open the door and making her way to the mysterious woman. As she approached, the woman looked up, their eyes meeting for a brief moment before she quickly looked away.

"Mind if I join you?" Sarah asked, trying to sound casual.

The woman hesitated for a moment before nodding. "I guess not," she said in a low tone.

Sarah sat down across from her, pulling out a small notebook and pen from her pocket. "Let's start with what happened to Michael," she said, her eyes locked on the woman's face.

As the night wore on, Sarah listened intently as the woman poured out a story of secrets and lies that threatened to upend everything Sarah thought she knew about her brother's disappearance. It was just beginning, but Sarah felt a spark of hope ignite within her. Maybe this time, the truth would finally be revealed.
