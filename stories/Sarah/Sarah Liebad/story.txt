Sarah Liebaud was a 25-year-old freelance writer who had always been fascinated by the world of mythology. Growing up in a small town in rural Germany, she spent countless hours poring over dusty tomes and talking to her Oma about the old legends.

As she entered adulthood, Sarah's interest only deepened, and she began to write stories based on the myths she had learned as a child. Her first novel, "The Secret of the Schwarzwald," was a huge success, and soon she was fielding offers from publishers and agents left and right.

Despite her newfound fame, Sarah remained humble and grounded. She continued to live in her hometown, surrounded by the rolling hills and dense forests that had inspired so much of her writing. Her friends and family adored her, and they would often gather at Oma's house for long evenings of storytelling and laughter.

One evening, as Sarah was sipping coffee with Oma in the cozy living room, she mentioned her latest project to her grandmother. "Oma, I'm thinking of writing a novel about the Valkyries," she said, her eyes shining with excitement. "Do you think that's something people would be interested in?"

Oma nodded thoughtfully, stroking her gray hair. "Ah, ja, the Valkyries are always popular," she said. "But don't forget to add a bit of German flair, mein Schatz. We Germans love our mythology."

Sarah smiled, feeling grateful for Oma's words of wisdom. She spent the next few weeks researching and writing, pouring all her knowledge into the book. When it was finished, she sent it off to the publishers, and waited anxiously for their response.

Months went by, and Sarah received a call from her agent telling her that the book had been accepted. She leapt out of bed, screaming with excitement, and then quickly composed herself. "Oma will be so proud," she said, laughing.

And indeed Oma was, when Sarah came to visit and presented her with a copy of the book, inscribed with a message from her granddaughter: "To my dear Oma, with love and respect, Sarah Liebaud."
