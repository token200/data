Rein Tóth was a man shrouded in mystery. A former spy and assassin, his past was marked by bloodshed and betrayal. He had been left for dead on more than one occasion, only to miraculously survive and continue on his path of revenge.

As he walked through the crowded streets of Budapest, Rein's eyes scanned the faces of the passersby, searching for any sign of deception. His skills as a spy were unmatched, and he knew that even the slightest slip-up could be fatal.

Rein had been hired by a wealthy client to retrieve a valuable artifact from a rival collector. The job was straightforward: infiltrate the collector's mansion, snatch the artifact, and escape undetected. Easy enough for someone of Rein's skill level, but not without its risks.

As he approached the mansion, Rein noticed that something wasn't quite right. The guards seemed overly alert, and the windows were boarded up from the inside. A chill ran down his spine as he realized that this might not be the straightforward job he had been told it was.

Rein carefully made his way around the perimeter of the mansion, searching for an entrance. He spotted a small window that was slightly ajar, just big enough for him to squeeze through. With a deep breath, Rein hoisted himself up and slipped inside.

The interior of the mansion was musty and dimly lit, but Rein's trained eyes quickly adjusted to the darkness. He moved swiftly and silently, his movements practiced to perfection. As he navigated the twisting corridors, Rein couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.

Suddenly, a faint noise echoed through the hallway, followed by the soft whisper of a voice. "Welcome, Rein Tóth." The voice sent shivers down his spine, and Rein knew that he had stumbled into something much bigger than himself.
