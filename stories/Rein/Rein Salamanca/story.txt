Rein Salamanca stood at the edge of the desert, his eyes fixed on the horizon. The sun beat down upon him, relentless in its intensity. He had been walking for days, driven by an insatiable hunger for revenge.

As a member of the Cartel de Santa Maria, Rein had long sought to destroy the man who had betrayed him: Hector Salamanca. But Hector was cunning and ruthless, always staying one step ahead of his enemies. Rein's obsession with revenge had become an all-consuming fire that burned within him.

He remembered the day he first discovered Hector's treachery like it was yesterday. Rein had been summoned to meet with his brother, only to find Hector waiting instead. The old man's betrayal cut deep, and Rein vowed never to forgive.

Rein turned away from the horizon and walked back towards his horse. He knew that Hector would not be easy to kill. The old man was a master of manipulation, using every trick in the book to stay alive.

As he mounted up and rode away, Rein's mind began to spin with schemes and plans. He knew that he could not defeat Hector alone, but with time and patience, he might just wait him out.

The days turned into weeks, and Rein continued his relentless pursuit of revenge. But as the landscape shifted around him – from desert to mountains to forests – Rein couldn't shake the feeling that Hector was always lurking in the shadows, waiting for him.

One night, Rein arrived at an old adobe hacienda on the outskirts of a small town. He had heard rumors that Hector was hiding here, and he intended to put an end to it once and for all.

With his heart pounding, Rein dismounted his horse and crept towards the house. But as he reached the entrance, he realized something was off. The air was too still, and there was a sense of unease in the air that didn't feel like Hector's doing.

Rein's instincts told him to flee, but it was too late. From within the hacienda, a voice called out to him – a voice that sent shivers down Rein's spine.

"Welcome, my friend," Hector said. "I've been expecting you."

As Rein turned towards the door, he saw his brother standing in front of him, a sly smile spreading across his face.
