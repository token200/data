Rein Trevisan stepped out of his dimly lit office and onto the rain-soaked streets of Gotham. The city's perpetual gloom seemed to match the melancholy that had been plaguing him lately. As a former detective turned mercenary, Rein had seen his fair share of darkness.

He adjusted his black leather jacket, the soft glow of his cigarette illuminating the puddles around him. A sudden shiver ran down his spine as he spotted a figure watching him from across the street. Rein's instincts kicked in, and he raised an eyebrow. The woman was tall, her raven-black hair pulled back into a sleek ponytail. She wore a black trench coat that seemed to swallow her whole.

Rein approached her cautiously, hand resting on the grip of his pistol. "Can I help you?" he asked gruffly.

The woman smiled, revealing sharp teeth. "I've been looking for you, Rein Trevisan," she said, her voice husky and confident.

Rein's instincts told him to step back, but curiosity kept him rooted. Who was this mysterious woman? What did she want?

"My name is not for sharing," Rein growled, eyeing the gun holstered at her hip.

The woman chuckled, a throaty sound that sent a shiver down Rein's spine. "I know all about your... extracurricular activities, Rein," she said, her eyes sparkling with amusement. "I've been hired to find you."

Rein raised an eyebrow. Who was behind this? He couldn't remember any deals or contracts involving him. Suddenly, the woman pulled out a small device and pressed a button.

"Looks like our employer wants to see you, Rein," she said, handing him a folder containing a photo of a wealthy businessman. "Seems he has a proposition for you."

Rein's eyes narrowed as he scanned the image. A name flickered in his mind - Victor LaGraine, a man with connections to some of Gotham's most unsavory characters.

"What does this have to do with me?" Rein asked gruffly, folding the folder and slipping it into his jacket pocket.

The woman leaned in close, her voice barely audible. "You see, Rein, you used to be a detective. You used to care about justice. But now... now you're just looking for the next big score."

Rein's gut churned with anger. Who was this woman? And what did she know about him?

As he turned to leave, the woman called out after him, "We'll meet again soon, Rein. Maybe I can help you find your lost conscience..."

The rain seemed to grow heavier as Rein vanished into the night, his heart heavy with doubt and uncertainty.
