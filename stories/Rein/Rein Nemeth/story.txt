Rein Nemeth stepped into the dimly lit tavern, the patrons' eyes fixed on her as she made her way to the bar. Her striking features and piercing green eyes commanded attention, but it was her reputation that truly drew people in. As Rein Nemeth, the infamous assassin, no one dared to cross her.

The bartender, a gruff old man with a thick beard, looked up at her with a mixture of curiosity and wariness. "What can I get you, Rein?" he asked, his voice low and cautious.

Rein Nemeth smiled, her full lips curling upwards in a sly smile. "Just a whiskey, neat," she replied, her voice husky and confident.

As the bartender poured her drink, a hooded figure slid onto the stool beside her, their eyes fixed on Rein Nemeth's face. She didn't flinch, sensing that this was someone important. The figure pulled back its hood, revealing a young woman with piercing blue eyes and raven-black hair.

"You're Rein Nemeth," the woman said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I've heard a lot about you."

Rein Nemeth raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the woman's boldness. "And who might you be?" she asked, taking a sip of her whiskey.

"I'm Elian," the woman replied, her eyes locked on Rein Nemeth's. "I've been hired to... discuss something with you."

Rein Nemeth's instincts screamed warning signals, but she remained seated, sipping her drink as Elian began to speak. She listened intently, weighing the pros and cons of getting involved in whatever scheme Elian had cooked up.

As the night wore on, Rein Nemeth found herself drawn into Elian's web of intrigue. Despite the danger and uncertainty that lurked beneath the surface, she couldn't help but feel a spark of curiosity. For once, her reputation as Rein Nemeth, the ruthless assassin, didn't seem to apply.

For now, at least, Rein Nemeth was willing to listen, to consider the possibilities that Elian had presented. But one thing was certain: only one side would walk out of this tavern with their life intact.
