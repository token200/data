Rein Kalnins stepped out of the smoky pub and onto the rain-soaked streets of Tallinn. His eyes scanned the crowded square, searching for any sign of his missing brother, Andrus. It had been three days since they'd last spoken, and Rein's worry was growing by the hour.

As a private investigator, Rein had seen his fair share of shady characters and clandestine dealings. But nothing could have prepared him for the cryptic message that had led him to this dingy alleyway tonight. "Meet me at the old windmill on the outskirts," it read. "Come alone."

Rein's gut told him something was off, but he couldn't shake the feeling that his brother was in trouble. He quickened his pace, dodging umbrellas and raincoats as he made his way towards the windmill.

As he approached the abandoned building, a figure emerged from the shadows. "Rein Kalnins," the stranger said, voice low and gravelly. "I've been expecting you."

The man handed Rein a small package wrapped in brown paper. "This was sent to your brother's flat three nights ago. He didn't take it. You should know what's inside."

Rein unwrapped the package, revealing a small USB drive. A shiver ran down his spine as he inserted the drive into his phone and began to scroll through the contents. What he found made his blood run cold.

It seemed Andrus had stumbled upon something big – something that could put their entire family in danger. Rein knew he had to act fast, but first, he needed more information. The stranger vanished into the night, leaving Rein to unravel the tangled threads of a conspiracy that threatened to destroy everything they held dear.

As Rein made his way back to his office, phone still buzzing with the contents of the USB drive, one thing was certain: Rein Kalnins would stop at nothing to find out what had happened to his brother – and bring those responsible to justice.
