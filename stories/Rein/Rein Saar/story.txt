Rein Saar, a retired Estonian weightlifter, sat in his small cottage on the outskirts of Tartu, lost in thought. He stared out at the frozen pond in front of him, where he used to train with his younger brother, Andres. The once-vibrant colors of the changing leaves had long since faded, replaced by the monotonous whiteness of winter.

Rein's eyes drifted back inside, where his wife, Liina, sat by the fireplace, knitting a warm sweater for their granddaughter. He watched as she carefully placed each stitch, just like he used to do with his brother all those years ago.

Their life had been one of triumph and tragedy. Rein had won multiple championships in weightlifting, while Andres had tragically died during a training session. The loss still lingered, like an open wound that would never fully heal.

As Rein sat there, Liina put down her knitting needles and walked over to him. "What's on your mind?" she asked softly.

Rein looked at her, his eyes filled with unshed tears. "Just remembering," he said. "Remembering the good times, the bad times...remembering Andres."

Liina took his hand in hers, offering a gentle squeeze. "You're not alone anymore," she said. "We have our granddaughter to raise and spoil. She's full of life, just like her grandfather was when he was young."

Rein smiled slightly at the mention of their granddaughter. Maybe there was hope after all.

The sound of scratching on the door broke the silence. It was Rein's son, Kael, home from his own studies in Tallinn. He had heard about Andres' passing and wanted to pay his respects.

As they shared stories and memories of Andres, the weight of grief slowly lifted off their shoulders. For a moment, they forgot about the pain and loss. All that mattered was the life they still had ahead of them â€“ filled with love, laughter, and the quiet moments like this one, by the frozen pond.

As night began to fall, Rein looked at Liina once more, his eyes moist. "You know what?" he said. "I think Andres would want us to be happy."

Liina smiled, her eyes shining. "We are," she replied softly.
