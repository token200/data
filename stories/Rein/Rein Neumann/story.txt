Rein Neumann stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a renowned private investigator in Berlin during the tumultuous 1920s, he had seen it all - from high-stakes espionage to murder mysteries.

As he made his way through the crowded room, a figure caught his attention. A striking woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair sat alone at the bar, sipping on a whiskey sour. Rein's instincts told him that she was trouble, but he couldn't quite put his finger on why.

"Whiskey for you?" a gruff voice asked from behind Rein.

He turned to see the bartender, a burly man with a thick beard and a menacing scowl.

"Just the information I need," Rein replied, taking a seat next to the mysterious woman.

The bartender leaned in close. "You're looking for Frau Müller, I presume?"

Rein's eyes locked onto the woman, who raised an eyebrow as if daring him to confirm her identity.

"Frau Müller was last seen at this very tavern," the bartender continued. "Some say she was meeting with a high-ranking Nazi officer, while others claim she was involved in some shady dealings."

The woman's gaze never wavered from Rein's face. He could sense the danger emanating from her, but he refused to back down.

"I'm looking for information on Frau Müller," Rein said firmly. "If you know something, I want it now."

The bartender snorted. "You're a brave man, I'll give you that. But be warned, Rein Neumann: in this city, loyalty is a luxury few can afford."

As the words hung in the air, the woman slid off her stool and strode toward Rein, her eyes blazing with an inner fire.

"I'm afraid you've just made a very powerful enemy," she whispered, her voice husky as silk. "But I'll give you credit, Neumann - you're the first person to ever dare approach me."

Rein's gut told him that he was in over his head, but he refused to back down.

"Name is Rein Neumann," he said, flashing a charming smile. "And I'm always up for a challenge."

The woman's lips curled into a wicked grin, and Rein knew that this was only the beginning of a very long night indeed.
