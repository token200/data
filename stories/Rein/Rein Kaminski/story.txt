Rein Kaminski stepped out of the misty rain and into the dimly lit bar, shaking the droplets from his long, dark coat. As a private investigator, he'd seen his fair share of shady characters, but tonight was different. Tonight, Rein Kaminski was on the hunt for answers.

A tall, imposing figure sat at the end of the bar, sipping on a whiskey. His face was obscured by a hoodie, and his eyes seemed to bore into Rein's very soul. The air was thick with tension as their gazes locked.

Rein Kaminski knew that look all too well – it was the one he'd seen in the mirror after a particularly rough case went sour. He took a deep breath, squared his shoulders, and approached the mysterious stranger.

"What do you want?" Rein Kaminski asked, his voice firm but measured.

The figure slowly rose from his seat, its movements eerily fluid. As it moved closer, Rein's eyes adjusted to reveal piercing blue irises that seemed to see right through him.

"I'm looking for information," the stranger replied in a low, gravelly tone.

Rein Kaminski raised an eyebrow. "What kind of information?"

The figure hesitated before producing a small folder from its coat pocket. As it handed Rein the contents, their fingers touched briefly – a spark of electricity ran through Rein's veins.

Inside the folder was a photograph of Rein Kaminski himself, taken on a case several years ago. Next to it lay a detailed report detailing his successes and failures as an investigator.

Rein felt a shiver run down his spine as he realized that this stranger knew more about him than he cared to admit. He tucked the folder into his pocket, his mind racing with questions.

"I think we need to talk," Rein Kaminski said finally, his voice tight with a mix of curiosity and wariness.

The figure nodded, its eyes glinting in the dim light. "I think that's exactly what I came here for."

As they turned to leave together, Rein couldn't shake off the feeling that he was walking into a trap – but he also knew he had to see this through. After all, Rein Kaminski had a reputation for solving the unsolvable, and he wasn't about to let anyone – or anything – stand in his way.

The night ahead promised to be long and treacherous, but Rein Kaminski was ready. Bring it on.
