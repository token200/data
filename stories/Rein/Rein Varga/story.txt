Rein Varga stood at the edge of the frozen lake, his eyes fixed on the distant silhouette of a lone figure. He could see nothing but the faint outline, like a ghostly apparition, as if it had materialized out of thin air.

"Are you sure this is where he'll show up?" Rein's voice was low and cautious, to anyone who might be listening.

His companion, a rugged-looking woman with a no-nonsense expression, nodded curtly. "That's the place, Rein. He can't help but come here."

Rein Varga had always been driven by a sense of purpose. As a young man, he'd spent years tracking down his brother, who'd vanished in the midst of the Soviet Union's occupation of Estonia. Now, as a mercenary, he took on odd jobs that involved hunting down missing persons.

This job was different. This one was personal. His brother's disappearance had haunted Rein for years, and he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about this case.

The woman, who'd introduced herself only as Natasha, handed Rein a pair of night-vision goggles. "He'll be harder to spot in the dark."

Rein nodded, his eyes scanning the horizon. He waited. And waited. Until finally, the figure emerged from the darkness, its outline slowly resolving into a young man with piercing blue eyes.

Rein Varga felt a jolt run through him as he took in the sight of the stranger. But something about it didn't feel right. The stranger's eyes seemed... off.

"Who are you?" Rein demanded, his hand reaching for the gun at his side.

The stranger turned to face him, and Rein saw that it was a woman - but her features were wrong, somehow disarranged as if they'd been reflected in a funhouse mirror. "I'm... I'm Lena," she stammered.

Rein's gut told him this was all wrong. But he couldn't quite put his finger on what it was.

Natasha stepped forward, her eyes locked on Lena. "We've got questions for you, kid."

The two women began to circle around each other, their conversation a low hum of tension and hostility. Rein watched, fascinated, as the dynamic played out before him.

Something about this situation didn't add up. And he was determined to find out what it was.
