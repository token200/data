One rainy evening, Rein Keiko received an urgent visit from an old acquaintance, a former colleague named Rachel who had been investigating a string of seemingly unrelated murders. She was desperate for help and begged Rein to take on the case. Convinced that there was more to these killings than met the eye, Rein agreed to take it on.
