Line Eriksson was known for her unyielding spirit and unwavering dedication to justice. A Swedish police detective with an unquenchable thirst for the truth, she had made a name for herself in Stockholm's crime-ridden streets.

Line's past was marked by tragedy – her younger sister had gone missing when she was just a teenager, and despite her father's pleas for silence, Line had become obsessed with finding out what had happened to her. The case remained unsolved, but it fueled her drive to protect others from suffering the same fate.

One fateful evening, Line received an anonymous tip about a potential serial killer operating in the city. With each passing hour, the stakes grew higher as more bodies were discovered across Stockholm. The police department was stumped, and it seemed like the only person who could unravel the tangled threads of evidence was Line herself.

Determined to crack the case, Line spent countless hours pouring over files, interviewing witnesses, and scouring the city for clues. Her colleagues began to question her motives, wondering if she was driven by personal demons or an insatiable need for justice. But Line knew that this was about more than just solving a crime – it was about uncovering a monster who had been hiding in plain sight.

As Line delved deeper into the case, she found herself increasingly drawn to an enigmatic informant known only as 'The Architect.' This mysterious figure seemed to possess an unsettling intimacy with the killer's modus operandi, offering cryptic hints that led Line on a wild goose chase through Stockholm's dark underbelly. Was The Architect working with her, or was it all just a ruse?

One stormy night, Line received a chilling message from The Architect: 'Look again at your own past.' As she re-examined the evidence surrounding her sister's disappearance, a shiver ran down her spine. Could it be that the truth she had been seeking all these years was hiding in plain sight? The possibility sent Line's world spinning out of control.

With each new revelation, the stakes grew higher, and the darkness closing in around her seemed to deepen. Would Line Eriksson finally find justice for her sister, or would she become the next victim of a twisted predator? Only time would tell. But one thing was certain – this tenacious detective was about to face the darkest corners of her own soul head-on, and nothing would ever be the same again.
