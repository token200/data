Magnus Renault stepped into the dimly lit room, his eyes scanning the space for any signs of trouble. As a skilled thief and con artist, he had made a name for himself on the streets of New Haven, but tonight was different. Tonight, he had received a message from an unknown source, offering him a job that could change everything.

Magnus's thoughts drifted back to his childhood, growing up in the rough streets of New Haven under the watchful eye of his mentor, Jack. He had learned the ins and outs of the underworld from a young age, and it was this experience that had honed his skills as a master thief.

The message had been cryptic, but Magnus's curiosity got the better of him. He had decided to take on the job, despite the risks. As he waited for the mysterious client to arrive, he couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off.

Suddenly, the door creaked open and a figure slipped inside. It was a woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair, her presence exuding an air of sophistication. "Magnus Renault," she said, her voice husky and confident. "I see you're a man of your word."

Magnus raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the woman's knowledge of his alias. "Who are you?" he asked, his tone neutral.

The woman smiled, revealing sharp teeth. "My name is Arabella, and I represent a...collectors' guild." She handed Magnus a small package wrapped in black cloth. "Your services are required for a task that requires your unique skills."

Magnus took the package, his mind racing with possibilities. This could be the break he needed to leave the streets of New Haven behind. He handed Arabella a small pouch containing 10,000 gold coins, as agreed upon.

As they parted ways, Magnus couldn't help but wonder what lay ahead. One thing was certain: working for Arabella and her collectors' guild would change his life forever.
