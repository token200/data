Few knew that behind the mask of the notorious thief lay a complex and enigmatic individual, driven by a desire for justice rather than profit.

Magnus Wei had spent years honing his craft, mastering the art of disguise and deception. He could blend in seamlessly with his surroundings, adopting the persona of anyone or anything he chose to become.
