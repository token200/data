Magnus Meyer stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the familiar sights of Ravenswood Station. It had been years since he'd set foot in this small town, but the memories still lingered like a gentle fog. As Magnus Meyer, he'd grown up here, exploring the woods and dreaming of adventure beyond the hills.

Now, at 30, Magnus was back to settle some unfinished business. His father's old cabin had fallen into disrepair, and Magnus had inherited the property along with his late mother's belongings. He'd always felt a connection to this place, where his parents had raised him amidst the whispers of ancient magic that still lingered in the air.

As he made his way through the station, Magnus couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. The same wooden bench where he'd spent countless hours watching the trains arrive and depart was now weathered to a soft gray. The same street lamps cast their warm glow on the cobblestone streets, just as they had all those years ago.

Magnus's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of his phone buzzing in his pocket. It was an old friend from college, checking in to see how Magnus was doing after leaving Ravenswood. "Hey, Magnus Meyer! What brings you back to town?" Alex asked, and Magnus felt a pang of guilt for not responding sooner.

"I'm just taking some time to sort things out," Magnus replied, his eyes scanning the crowded platform as he watched people hurry past him. He hadn't told anyone about the cabin or his mother's belongings; it was something he needed to do alone.

With a nod, Magnus tucked his phone away and continued on his way. The train had already departed, leaving behind a flurry of passengers rushing for connections. As he walked towards the old cabin, Magnus felt a sense of resolve settle within him. He'd face whatever lay ahead as Magnus Meyer, just as he always had.
