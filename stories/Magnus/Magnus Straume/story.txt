Magnus Straume stepped out of the dimly lit alleyway and onto the bustling streets of Oslo. The neon lights of the city's bars and clubs reflected off his sleek black leather jacket, making him almost invisible among the throngs of people.

As a former mercenary and freelance operative, Magnus had built a reputation for being untouchable. His skills were in high demand by governments and corporations alike, who paid top dollar to have him take care of problems that others couldn't or wouldn't touch.

Tonight was no exception. Magnus had been hired by a mysterious client to extract a valuable piece of intel from the clutches of a notorious arms dealer. The meeting was supposed to be a simple drop-and-run operation, but something about it didn't sit right with Magnus.

As he made his way through the crowded streets, Magnus couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He glanced over his shoulder, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Shrugging it off as paranoia, he continued on to the designated meeting point.

The arms dealer, a portly man named Viktor, was waiting for him at the agreed-upon location. A snide remark about Magnus's skills sparked a fierce exchange between them, with Viktor boasting that his security team had seen through Magnus's plans.

Magnus raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the sudden shift in tactics. "You think you can outsmart me?" he sneered, his hand resting on the grip of his gun.

Viktor smirked, unafraid. "We'll see about that."

Without warning, a black SUV careened around the corner and screeched to a halt beside Magnus. The side door slid open, revealing a pair of heavily armed guards who stormed towards him with guns blazing.

Magnus instinctively ducked for cover behind Viktor's bodyguards, taking advantage of their disorganization to swiftly take down his attackers. He quickly dispatched them with ease before turning back to face Viktor and the SUV driver, who now revealed himself to be none other than Magnus's long-lost brother, Hans.

Hans sneered at Magnus, a look of twisted satisfaction in his eyes. "Welcome to the team, big bro," he said, before diving into the fray.

With a swift kick, Magnus sent Hans tumbling out of the SUV and into the nearby alleyway. As he pulled out a phone to call for backup, he couldn't help but wonder what other tricks this mysterious job had in store for him.
