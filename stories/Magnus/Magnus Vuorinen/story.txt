A woman's voice whispered on the other end, hinting at a high-stakes case involving a string of murders that seemed to be connected to an ancient myth. Intrigued, Magnus accepted the challenge and began his investigation.

As he delved deeper into the world of Helsinki's underworld, Magnus encountered a web of deceit and corruption that threatened to entangle him.

The closer Magnus got to the truth, the more he realized that this case was personal – for him, as much as it was for the victims. His connection to the underworld ran deeper than he had initially thought, and the more he dug, the more his own identity became entwined with that of his suspects.
