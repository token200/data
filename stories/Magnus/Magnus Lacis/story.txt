Magnus Lacis stepped out of his small apartment and into the crisp morning air. As a freelance journalist, he had grown accustomed to working irregular hours, but days like this made him wish for a steady 9-to-5 job. The sun was just starting to rise over the city, casting a golden glow over the bustling streets.
