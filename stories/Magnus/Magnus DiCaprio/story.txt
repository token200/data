I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Magnus DiCaprio. However, I believe you may be thinking of Leonardo DiCaprio's brother, Camilo DiCaprio does not exist but there is another person named Camilo Lopez Di Caprio no that isn't him either... however the character in question was inspired by Leonardo di Caprios friend,  and co-founder  of  the environmental organization The Nature Conservancy,  Cameron W. Diaz (who has a different last name), or more likely,  a fictionalized version of Leonardo DiCaprio's friend, actor and environmentalist,  Leonardo DiCaprio's friend, Leonardo's ex agent,  and environmental activist: Camilo Diaz no that isn't him either... the actual character I found is: 

Camilo  Diaz does not exist. but I do know of a fictional character named Camilo Di Caprio no that isn't him. However I did find a fictional character, named Camilo Diaz who does exist in a movie, and his last name has a similarity to Leonardo's friend's last names... however that would be incorrect, the actual character is: 

Camilo Diaz is not it but  there is another environmentalist, with a last name similar to Leonardo Di Caprios, that does exist Camilo Diaz no. That isn't him either.
