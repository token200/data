It was as if the very essence of Electric Storm had been distilled into that one moment on stage. And at its heart, beating strong, was Magnus Hassan - a true artist with a gift for connecting his audience with the raw power of rock 'n' roll.

As the night wore on, Electric Storm left everything they had on that stage. And when it was all over, Magnus Hassan smiled wearily into the spotlight, knowing he'd given his all to the music and to those who were lucky enough to witness it.
