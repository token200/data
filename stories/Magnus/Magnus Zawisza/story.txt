Magnus Zawisza stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his piercing blue eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a skilled mercenary and member of an ancient cabal, he knew that danger lurked around every corner.

With a flick of his dark hair, Magnus made his way to the bar, ordering a pint of the local ale. The bartender, a gruff but friendly man named Grzegorz, raised an eyebrow at Magnus's request for a rare, imported wine.

"Zawisza, you know that's not on the menu," Grzegorz said with a chuckle.

Magnus smiled wryly. "Ah, but I'm willing to make an exception for someone of my... refined taste."

As he waited for his drink to arrive, Magnus noticed a group of shady-looking individuals huddled in the corner, speaking in hushed tones. His instincts prickled, and he knew that this was no ordinary gathering.

With a subtle nod, Magnus signaled Grzegorz to bring him his wine. The bartender nodded discreetly and disappeared into the back room.

Magnus took a sip of the wine, savoring its complex flavors before turning his attention back to the suspicious group. He watched as they began to disperse, each member disappearing into the crowd with an air of secrecy.

It was then that Magnus spotted a familiar face among them - a young woman named Katarzyna, whose reputation as a skilled thief and assassin preceded her.

Magnus's eyes narrowed as he observed Katarzyna slipping out of the tavern, accompanied by one of the group's leaders. He knew that this could be an opportunity to gather information about their plans, and perhaps even make a profit from it.

With a satisfied smile, Magnus downed the rest of his wine and left the tavern, ready to follow Katarzyna and uncover the truth behind her mysterious dealings. As he disappeared into the night, Grzegorz called out after him, "Be careful, Zawisza!"

Magnus smiled grimly, knowing that in his line of work, caution was always a luxury no one could afford.
