Magnus Corbero stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of sea salt and salted air filling his lungs. As he made his way through the crowded station, the sounds and smells of home enveloped him like a warm hug.

A native of the coastal town of Salinas, Magnus had spent years away from the only life he'd ever known. He'd worked on ships, in factories, and in cities far beyond the horizon, but no place felt like home without his beloved Salinas.

After receiving news that his father's old friend, now a respected elder in the community, was passing on to the afterlife, Magnus had decided it was time to return. His mother had passed away years ago, leaving him with a burden of responsibility and a heart heavy with grief.

As he walked through the streets, familiar faces nodded in recognition, their eyes filled with a mix of curiosity and warmth. The townspeople had always been kind to Magnus, never making him feel like an outsider despite his travels. He was Magnus Corbero, after all – the boy who'd left but never truly gone.

Upon arriving at the elder's residence, a simple wooden cottage on the outskirts of town, Magnus was greeted by a gathering of family and friends. The air was thick with the scent of food, cooked over an open flame in celebration of life and remembrance. As he took his seat beside the elder's chair, Magnus felt a sense of belonging wash over him.

For a moment, the world slowed down, and all that mattered was this simple act of coming home. It wasn't about the past or the present; it was about embracing the present with those who had always been there for him – his community, his family, and himself, Magnus Corbero.
