Magnus Young stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. It was 5:00 AM on a typical Monday morning in his hometown of Ravenswood. The sleepy town was still shrouded in darkness, except for the occasional streetlight casting a faint glow.

Magnus, or "Mags" to those who knew him, had been away from Ravenswood for three years. He'd studied engineering in the city and landed a job at a prestigious firm. But after a freak accident in his lab left him with a mysterious scar on his hand and an unshakeable feeling of unease, he found himself returning home.

As he made his way through the quiet streets, Mags couldn't help but feel like a stranger in his own town. People nodded or smiled as he passed by, but there was no warmth or familiarity behind their eyes. It was as if they were all hiding secrets, waiting for him to uncover them.

Magnus stopped at the local café and ordered a coffee. The owner, Mrs. Jenkins, greeted him with a sympathetic smile. "Welcome back, Mags. I've missed you around here."

Mags took his seat by the window and watched as the sun began to rise over Ravenswood. It was a sight he used to love, but now it only filled him with a sense of melancholy.

As he sipped his coffee, Mags noticed a figure lurking outside the café. A young woman with long, curly brown hair and piercing green eyes. She seemed out of place in the sleepy town, like a stranger lost in her own life.

Mags felt an inexplicable pull towards her, as if she held the key to understanding his own strange feelings. He got up from his seat and approached her, feeling a sense of excitement he hadn't experienced in years.

"Mind if I join you?" Mags asked, nodding towards the bench outside.

The woman looked up at him with an air of curiosity. "Not at all," she replied, her voice barely above a whisper.

Mags sat down beside her and began to ask her questions. Who was she? What brought her to Ravenswood? And as they talked, Mags felt a spark ignite within him. It was a flame that had been smoldering for years, waiting for the right moment to burst into life.

For the first time in months, Magnus Young felt like he belonged somewhere again.
