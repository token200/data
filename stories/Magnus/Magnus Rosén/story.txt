Magnus Rosén stepped out of the rain and into the dimly lit café, shaking the water from his trench coat. As a private investigator, he had seen his fair share of rainy nights, but there was something about this one that felt off.

As he waited for his contact to arrive, Magnus took a seat at the bar and ordered a whiskey on the rocks. He sipped slowly, his eyes scanning the crowded room for any sign of trouble. The patrons were a mix of locals and tourists, all huddled together for warmth.

Just as Magnus was starting to think that his wait would be longer than expected, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was a woman with piercing green eyes and long, curly brown hair. She flashed a brief smile at him before taking a seat beside him.

"Sorry I'm late," she said, her voice husky. "I had to take a detour."

Magnus raised an eyebrow. "What kind of detour?"

The woman leaned in close. "A bit of a lead on the Smith case. I think I might have found something."

As they sipped their drinks and discussed the details, Magnus couldn't help but notice that this was no ordinary client. There was something about her that didn't add up.

"Who are you?" he asked finally, his eyes narrowing.

The woman smiled again, a hint of mischief dancing in her eyes. "My name is Sophia Patel. I work for a certain... organization."

Magnus's gut told him to be wary, but he couldn't deny the spark of curiosity that had ignited within him. He leaned in closer, his voice low. "What kind of organization?"

Sophia's smile grew wider. "That would be classified."

As they continued to talk, Magnus found himself becoming more and more entangled in Sophia's web of intrigue. It was going to be a long night, but he knew that it would be worth it – at least for now.

Magnus Rosén smiled to himself as the rain drummed against the café windows. This case just got a whole lot more interesting.
