Magnus Bąk stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble. As a private investigator, he had seen his fair share of shady characters and illicit deals gone sour. But tonight, something about this place felt off.

He made his way to the bar, ordering a whiskey as he eyed the patrons. A hooded figure sat alone in the corner, sipping a mug of ale. Magnus recognized the symbol etched into their cloak - a mark of the infamous Red Vipers, a gang known for their ruthlessness and skill.

Magnus's instincts told him to leave, but his curiosity got the better of him. He approached the hooded figure, introducing himself as private investigator Bąk. The figure slowly stood, revealing a woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair.

"I'm looking for information," Magnus said, taking a seat across from her. "Rumors say the Red Vipers are involved in something big."

The woman nodded, her gaze never wavering. "You're looking for the truth, I presume? My name is Katarzyna 'Kasia' Rybczynska, and I have information about your Red Viper friends."

Magnus's eyes narrowed. "What do you know?"

Kasia leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. "They're involved in a human trafficking ring. The Red Vipers have been selling people to the highest bidder. It's a mess of corruption and greed."

Magnus's grip on his whiskey glass tightened. He had suspected as much, but hearing it from someone who claimed to know firsthand made it all too real.

"What do you want in exchange for this information?" Magnus asked, his eyes locked on Kasia's.

She smiled, her eyes glinting with a hint of mischief. "I'll give you the name of the Red Vipers' leader... and I'll ask for your help taking them down."

Magnus raised an eyebrow. He had a feeling he was in over his head. But he couldn't deny the thrill of the chase, or the satisfaction of finally getting his hands on some real evidence.

"Deal," Magnus Bąk said, extending his hand to Kasia Rybczynska.
