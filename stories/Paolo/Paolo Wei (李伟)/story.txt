Paolo Wei, also known as Lee Wei to his friends and family, was a young and ambitious artist living in Taipei. He spent most of his days painting the vibrant streets and alleys of the city, capturing the essence of Taiwanese culture.

As a child, Paolo had always been fascinated by art. His mother, a skilled painter herself, encouraged him to explore his creativity from a young age. She taught him how to hold a brush and mix colors, and he quickly fell in love with the feeling of creating something new every day.

Growing up, Paolo's passion for art only grew stronger. He spent hours sketching and painting, experimenting with different techniques and styles until he found his unique voice. His friends would often tease him about his "artistic weirdness," but Paolo didn't mind â€“ he knew that he was on the right path.

After completing his studies at a prestigious art school, Paolo began to make a name for himself in the Taipei art scene. His vibrant paintings of street food and night markets quickly gained attention from local galleries and collectors.

One day, Paolo received an email inviting him to participate in a group exhibition in Shanghai
