As she sat down with the mysterious informant, Mila knew that this was going to be a challenge unlike any she had faced before.

With her instincts and journalistic training, Mila set out to verify the claims and build a case against those responsible. The journey would take months, but when it finally came together, it would make headlines around the world.
