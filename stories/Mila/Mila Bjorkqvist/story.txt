Mila Björkqvist was a name that commanded attention in the small town of Ålgarsorp, Sweden. As a child, she had always been known for her bold spirit and fearless approach to life. Her parents, Anna and Johan, had encouraged her curiosity, sending her to art school when she was just 10 years old.

As Mila grew older, her passion for photography only intensified. She spent countless hours behind the lens, capturing the beauty of the world around her. Her talent soon earned her a spot at the prestigious Stockholm University of the Arts, where she honed her skills under the guidance of some of Sweden's most respected photographers.

After graduating, Mila embarked on a journey to document the lives of those in Ålgarsorp's marginalized communities. She spent hours interviewing and photographing local residents, shedding light on their struggles and triumphs. Her work caught the attention of the Swedish government, who awarded her the prestigious Anna Sandell Award for her commitment to social justice.
