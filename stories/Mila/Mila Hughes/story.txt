Mila Hughes stepped out of her small flat and into the crisp morning air, feeling the weight of her responsibilities settle upon her shoulders. As the lead detective on the Special Crimes Unit, she was no stranger to the darker corners of the city. But today's case felt different - a string of seemingly unrelated murders that had left the police baffled.

Mila lit a cigarette as she walked towards her car, her mind racing with theories and possibilities. She had been investigating for weeks, but nothing seemed to be pointing to a clear motive or suspect. Her colleagues were starting to get restless, and Mila knew she needed to crack this case soon if she wanted to keep them from turning on her.

As she drove through the city streets, the sun rising over the towering skyscrapers, Mila's thoughts turned to the latest victim - a young professional who had been found dead in an alleyway with no signs of forced entry or struggle. The only clue was a small note left at the scene with a single word: 'Echo'.

Mila's gut told her that this case was more than just a random string of murders. She recalled a similar pattern from years ago, when a serial killer had used a similar M.O. before being caught and locked away. Could it be a copycat? Or something more sinister?

As she arrived at the crime scene, Mila's instincts told her to tread carefully. The police were already swarming around, collecting evidence and taking statements from witnesses. She pushed her way through the crowd, searching for any sign that might give her a lead.

That was when she saw him - a young man with piercing blue eyes and a scar above his left eyebrow. He seemed out of place among the chaos, but there was something about him that caught Mila's attention. As he locked eyes with her, Mila felt a spark of recognition, like they had seen each other before.

"Can I talk to you?" she asked, her voice firm but controlled.

The young man nodded, and Mila followed him away from the crowd, into the quiet anonymity of the alleyway. "Who are you?" she demanded, her eyes locked on his.

"I'm just a witness," he replied, his voice low and smooth.

Mila raised an eyebrow. "Save it."

The young man smiled, and for a moment, Mila felt like she was staring into the face of something much deeper than herself.
