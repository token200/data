As the owner of the local bookstore, she had a way of bringing people together through her love of literature and learning.

Mila Lacis took him under her wing, recommending books and sharing stories of her own writing adventures. As they talked, she revealed to him the secrets of her success: a love of language, a keen eye for detail, and a willingness to take risks.
