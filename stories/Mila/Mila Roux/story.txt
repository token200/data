One fateful night, as the moon hung low in the sky, Mila found herself at the center of a brewing storm. A local shopkeeper had gone missing, and the whispers began to circulate that dark forces were at play. Mila's curiosity was piqued, and she knew she had to investigate.

Donning her favorite velvet cloak and grasping her trusty athame, Mila set out into the darkness. She navigated through alleys and side streets, gathering clues and piecing together the puzzle that lay before her. The air grew thick with anticipation as she drew closer to the heart of the mystery.

As she entered the shopkeeper's abandoned storehouse, a chill ran down Mila's spine. Shadows danced across the walls, and the scent of decay hung heavy in the air. But it was what lay on the workbench that truly sent shivers coursing through her veins: an intricate wooden box adorned with symbols from the Roux family's own ancient tradition.

Mila's eyes widened as she realized the truth â€“ this was no ordinary disappearance, but a carefully crafted trap set by someone from her own lineage. And with that realization, Mila knew she had to act swiftly to unravel the web of deceit and uncover the secrets hidden within the mysterious box.
