One day, a group of young wrestlers approached Bolesław Mäkinen with an idea - they wanted to start a wrestling school in the community center. They knew that with his expertise and guidance, they could create a program that would not only teach them valuable skills but also inspire others to get involved in sports.

Bolesław Mäkinen was hesitant at first, but as he watched the young wrestlers train, he saw something in them that reminded him of himself all those years ago. He agreed to help, and soon the wrestling school was up and running, thanks in large part to Bolesław Mäkinen's guidance and mentorship.
