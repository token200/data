Boles≈Çaw "Bola" Handschuh was not exactly the most popular figure in Krakow's history books. A member of the lesser nobility, Bola had risen to prominence only after his family's fortune and influence had grown through strategic marriages and calculated risks.

However, during his lifetime, he managed to accumulate a reputation as one of the most ruthless and cunning politicians in 14th century Poland. His nickname "Handschuh," which translates to "gloves" in German, was earned due to his preference for using gloves when negotiating with adversaries - a trait that often made others wary of engaging with him.

Despite this intimidating demeanor, Bola Handschuh had also shown flashes of genius and strategic thinking. As a key advisor to the Duke of Krakow, he played a crucial role in expanding the duke's territories through shrewd diplomacy and military campaigns.

However, his success was short-lived, as Bola's ruthless ambition soon turned against him. In 1374, he was accused of treason for his alleged involvement in a plot to overthrow the King of Poland. Despite maintaining his innocence, Bola was arrested and brought before the king himself for trial.

The trial was a sham, with all evidence pointing to Bola's guilt. However, the king took pity on him, possibly due to the significant influence he had wielded during the Duke of Krakow's reign. Instead of executing him, Bola was sentenced to life imprisonment in a remote castle.

Years went by, and Bola spent his days brooding in solitude. However, even behind bars, he managed to maintain his cunning and strategic thinking. He became known for his ability to manipulate those around him, often playing on the fears and weaknesses of those who visited him.

One day, a young nobleman named Jan arrived at the castle, seeking an audience with Bola Handschuh. The old man was rumored to possess knowledge that could change the course of Polish history, and Jan hoped to use this information for his own gain.

Bola listened intently as Jan proposed his plan, his eyes glinting with a mixture of curiosity and malice. As the young nobleman left the castle, Bola smiled to himself, knowing that he had successfully manipulated another pawn in his game of power. The old man may have thought he was playing by the rules, but Bola Handschuh knew that true power lay in bending them to one's will.
