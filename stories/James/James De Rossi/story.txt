James De Rossi stepped out of his worn leather jacket and onto the sweltering sidewalk, letting the heat wash over him like a wave. He adjusted his faded baseball cap, squinting into the bright sunlight that cast long shadows across the city streets.

As a private investigator, James had seen it all - the good, the bad, and the ugly. But this latest case was different. It was personal. His estranged brother, Luca, had gone missing, leaving behind only a cryptic message scrawled on the fridge: "They're watching me."

James had always been close to Luca, the two brothers sharing a bond forged in their rough-and-tumble childhood. But after their parents' death in a tragic accident, Luca had become increasingly withdrawn, pushing James away with his own demons.

Now, as James walked down the crowded streets of Little Italy, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The city seemed to be watching him too, its narrow alleys and backstreets whispering secrets only known to the initiated.

He stopped in front of a small, rundown caf√© on Mott Street, where Luca had last been spotted sipping espresso with an enigmatic woman named Sophia. James pushed open the door, the bell above it ringing out as he scanned the room for any sign of his brother.

The air was thick with the scent of burnt coffee and stale cigarettes. A haggard barista looked up from behind the counter, eyes darting nervously to James before returning to her phone. "What do you want?"

"I'm looking for Luca," James said, his voice firm but controlled. "Last seen here."

The barista hesitated, wiping down the counter with a dirty rag. "I don't know what you're talking about."

James raised an eyebrow. "Don't play dumb. I've talked to Sophia already. What's going on?"

The barista snorted, pushing her hair behind her ear. "Sophia? You mean the one with the scar on her cheek?"

James nodded. "That's the one. What do you know about Luca and this woman?"

For a moment, the barista seemed like she'd sucked on a lemon, but then a hint of fear crept into her eyes. "Okay, fine. They were together... for a while. But then... they had a falling out. Luca got some bad news. He left town fast."

James's gut twisted with foreboding. "Bad news?"

The barista glanced around nervously before leaning in close. "I think it had something to do with the old man. You know, the one who's been causing trouble on this block for years?"

James's eyes narrowed. The words sent a chill down his spine - Luca was indeed connected to the infamous Salvatore crime family. And if he'd gotten mixed up in their world...
