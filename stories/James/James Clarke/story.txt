One day, James Clarke received a visit from a wealthy businessman named Mr. Smith, who was frantic about a valuable necklace that had gone missing from his mansion. The family heirloom was not only priceless but also held great sentimental value, making its disappearance all the more distressing.

James Clarke listened attentively as Mr. Smith described the events leading up to the theft, carefully taking note of every detail. He asked pointed questions and made thoughtful observations, all while mentally constructing a theory about the case.

As James Clarke delved deeper into the mystery, he discovered that several members of the household had access to the necklace at some point.
