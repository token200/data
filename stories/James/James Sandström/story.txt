As he walked, James felt the weight of his past lifting. He had struggled with self-doubt and anxiety throughout his career, but here in Paris, he felt free to be himself. He was James Sandström, a artist on the cusp of greatness. And with every brushstroke, he knew that he was leaving a piece of himself behind.

As James stood before his paintings, he felt a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over him. He was James Erik Sandström, an artist who had finally found his place in the world.
