James Gomez Perez was a man with a passion for art and music. Growing up in a small town surrounded by vibrant street art, he spent most of his free time exploring the local murals and graffiti that lined the walls.

After college, James took a leap of faith and moved to the city to pursue his dreams. He worked multiple part-time jobs while auditioning for every art opening and gig that caught his eye. It wasn't long before his big break came in the form of a local gallery owner who fell in love with one of his paintings.
