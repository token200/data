James Fischer was among those who sprang into action. He joined forces with other volunteers to help distribute aid, provide shelter for displaced families, and organize relief efforts.

Eventually, as the community began to recover, attention turned to honoring James Fischer's remarkable efforts. A local organization presented him with a lifetime achievement award for his contributions.
