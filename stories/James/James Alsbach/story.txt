James Alsbach stepped out of the misty morning fog and onto the worn stone path that led to his family's estate. The air was crisp with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a smell he'd grown accustomed to over the years. As he walked, the silence enveloped him like a cloak, broken only by the soft crunch of gravel beneath his feet.

James Alsbach had always felt most at home here, among the ancient trees and twisted vines that seemed to hold secrets and stories of their own. His ancestors had tended this land for generations, and James was no exception. He'd spent countless hours exploring these woods as a child, chasing after rabbits and making friends with the creatures of the forest.

As he approached the mansion, he noticed the windows were closed, and the curtains drawn. Mrs. Jenkins, his loyal housekeeper, would always make sure to leave them open on sunny mornings, allowing the warmth to seep in and illuminate the rooms. But today, something felt off.

James Alsbach pushed open the creaky front door and called out into the darkness. "Mrs. Jenkins? Are you here?" There was no response, but he knew she'd be in the kitchen, brewing tea for his breakfast.

He made his way downstairs, his footsteps echoing through the empty halls. The kitchen was warm and cozy, with the scent of freshly baked bread wafting from the oven. Mrs. Jenkins stood by the sink, her eyes red-rimmed from tears. "James Alsbach, I'm so sorry," she whispered, as he took in the sight of the newspaper on the table.

The headline read: "Local Landowner Dies Under Mysterious Circumstances." James's heart sank as he realized this was about his family's estate â€“ and him. The questions swirled in his mind like a storm, but for now, he just stood there, frozen, as the weight of it all settled upon him.
