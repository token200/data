Finally, after weeks of travel, the team arrived at the entrance to the lost city. With hearts racing and cameras at the ready, they stepped into the ancient metropolis, awestruck by the sheer scale and grandeur of its ruins.

As they explored the city, James Totti's knowledge of archaeology proved invaluable, helping the team uncover hidden treasures and deciphering ancient texts that had been lost for centuries.
