He was often seen wearing his signature outfit: a crisp white shirt, slim black pants, and a pair of sleek, minimalist shoes that perfectly complemented the brand's Scandinavian aesthetic.

Despite his success, Juha-Pekka remained humble and dedicated to his mission. He spent countless hours researching new materials and processes that could reduce the environmental impact of fashion production.
