In the sleepy town of Kaunas, Lithuania, there lived a man named Juha-Pekka Koval, a retired mechanic with a passion for restoring old cars. His small workshop was a treasure trove of tools and spare parts, filled with the smell of oil and gasoline. Juha-Pekka spent his days tinkering with engines, bringing new life to discarded vehicles.

One sunny afternoon, as he was working on a 1962 Volvo, the doorbell above his workshop door jingled, signaling the arrival of a customer. In walked a young woman, her dark hair tied back in a ponytail, and her eyes scanning the workshop with a mix of curiosity and concern.

"Hello," Juha-Pekka said, wiping his hands on a rag. "What can I help you with?"

"I'm looking for a mechanic who can fix my old Citroen 2CV," she replied, holding up a manual. "It's been having some issues since I brought it back from France."

Juha-Pekka's eyes lit up as he examined the car. He spent the next few hours diagnosing the problem and explaining the necessary repairs to the woman. As they talked, Juha-Pekka discovered that her name was Maria, and she was a travel writer on a mission to restore classic cars around Europe.

As the sun began to set, Maria asked Juha-Pekka if he would be willing to help her transport the Citroen 2CV to her next destination. Juha-Pekka agreed, and together they loaded the car onto his old van.

The drive was long, but the conversation flowed easily as they talked about cars, history, and culture. As the stars began to twinkle in the sky, Juha-Pekka pulled over at a roadside diner for a break. Over steaming cups of coffee, Maria asked him again if he would be interested in joining her on her travels.

Juha-Pekka smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "I'd love to," he said. "But first, I have one more project to finish."

Maria nodded understandingly. As they continued their journey, Juha-Pekka's thoughts turned to his next task: restoring a 1955 Mercedes-Benz for an upcoming exhibition.

The drive was almost over when Maria mentioned that she would be writing about Juha-Pekka Koval and his remarkable workshop in her article. He blushed at the thought of being immortalized, but his pride shone through nonetheless.
