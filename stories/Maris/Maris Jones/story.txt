Maris Jones stood outside her small apartment, sipping on a lukewarm coffee as she gazed out at the grey London sky. It was just another typical Monday morning in the bustling city, but for Maris, it felt like an eternity had passed since she'd last experienced any real joy.

As she began her daily commute to work, Maris couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness wash over her. She had always been the responsible one, putting others' needs before her own and sacrificing her own desires for the sake of those around her. But as she trudged through the crowded streets, she couldn't shake the feeling that this was all just a facade.

Maris thought back to the last time she'd seen her best friend, Emily. They had been inseparable since childhood, but a falling out over a year ago had left a deep scar. Maris had tried to reach out, but Emily's response had been cold and distant. The pain still lingered, and Maris couldn't help but wonder if she'd ever be able to reconnect with the person who had once brought her so much happiness.

As she arrived at work, Maris took a deep breath and began to sort through the day's tasks. Her colleagues were friendly, but they all seemed to have their own lives and struggles, leaving Maris feeling like an outsider looking in. She longed for someone to talk to, someone who would listen without judgment and offer words of encouragement.

Just as she was starting to feel overwhelmed, a text message popped up on her phone from Emily. It read: "Hey, can we grab coffee soon? I've been thinking about you." Maris's heart skipped a beat as she stared at the screen, tears pricking at the corners of her eyes. Maybe, just maybe, this was the start of something new for Maris Jones - a chance to rediscover herself and reconnect with the person she had lost sight of along the way.

With renewed hope, Maris deleted the coffee shop's address from her phone and typed out a response: "I'd love that."
