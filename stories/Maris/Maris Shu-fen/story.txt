Maris Shu-fen stood at the edge of the bustling market, her eyes scanning the vibrant stalls for any sign of trouble. As a skilled thief and member of the infamous Golden Fox clan, she had spent years honing her skills in the shadows of the city.

With a flick of her wrist, Maris Shu-fen dispatched a tiny vial of sparkling dust into the air, where it was immediately snatched up by a curious child. The child's eyes widened as they chased after the glittering specks, completely unaware of the danger that lurked in the crowd.

Maris Shu-fen smiled to herself, her sharp ears picking up snippets of conversation from the surrounding stalls. She knew that the merchant who sold the rare silks was hiding something valuable - and she aimed to find out what it was.

As she wove through the crowded market, Maris Shu-fen's slender fingers drummed against her thigh, a habit formed from years of impatient waiting. Her eyes darted between the various stalls, drinking in every detail as she searched for any sign of her quarry.

Suddenly, a hand reached out from behind a nearby stall and snagged at her cloak. Maris Shu-fen spun around, her hand flashing towards the wrist that had touched her with lightning speed. The merchant who had been hiding something was caught off guard, but a spark of recognition flared in their eyes as they realized it was Maris Shu-fen, the notorious thief from the Golden Fox clan.

For a moment, they froze, sizing each other up before the merchant slowly backed away, a small pouch clutched in his hand. "You won't leave until you get what you came for, will you?" he said, with a wary smile.

Maris Shu-fen smiled back, her eyes glinting with amusement. She knew that she had found what she was looking for - and now, all she had to do was claim it.
