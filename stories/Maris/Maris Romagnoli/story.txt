Maris Romagnoli stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of saltwater and seaweed filling her lungs. She had been away for a while, but the small coastal town still felt like home.

As she made her way through the quiet streets, Maris Romagnoli couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her. The sun-drenched beaches, the rugged cliffs, and the quaint little shops – it was all still so...her.

She stopped at the local café, where the owner, Giovanni, greeted her with a warm smile. "Maris Romagnoli! It's been too long!" He patted her hand affectionately, as if to say, "Welcome back, kid."

Maris ordered a coffee and took a seat by the window, watching as the fishermen unloaded their nets onto the pavement. She had always loved this time of day – the way the light danced across the waves, casting a golden glow over everything.

As she sipped her coffee, Maris Romagnoli thought back to all the summers she'd spent here, exploring the tide pools and collecting seashells with her best friend, Alessia. Those were carefree days, filled with laughter and adventure.

Giovanni approached her table, a plate of freshly baked biscotti in his hands. "Try these, Maris Romagnoli – they're made just for you."

She smiled, feeling a pang of gratitude towards the old man. He had always been like an uncle to her, taking her under his wing and sharing his secrets. She devoured the biscotti, savoring the crunch and flavor.

As she finished her snack, Maris Romagnoli decided to take a walk along the beach. The sun was beginning to set, casting a warm orange glow over the water. She closed her eyes, feeling the breeze on her skin and listening to the sound of the waves. This, too, was home – this, too, was where she belonged.

In that moment, Maris Romagnoli knew she'd never be far from this place, no matter where life took her. The sea had a way of calling back to you, didn't it? And as she opened her eyes, she saw the familiar outline of Alessia's parents' house on the horizon, beckoning her towards memories yet to be made.
