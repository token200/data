Maris Laine stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the small station for any sign of life. The once-thriving town had seen better days, and Maris couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her as she gazed out at the crumbling buildings.

As she made her way through the deserted streets, Maris Laine's thoughts turned to the reason she had returned to this small town. It had been ten years since she'd left, leaving behind the memories and heartache that still lingered in every corner of Oakwood. She'd thought she'd found closure, but the past few weeks had brought it all flooding back.

Maris stopped at the old café, where she'd spent countless hours as a teenager, sipping coffee with friends and sharing secrets. The owner, Mrs. Jenkins, looked up from behind the counter, a hint of recognition in her eyes.

"Maris Laine," she said softly, as if the name itself held a weight. "It's been far too long."

Maris smiled, feeling a pang of embarrassment at her return. She'd never intended to cause trouble, but the memories that had brought her back seemed too precious to leave behind.

As she sat down at the counter, Mrs. Jenkins slid a steaming cup of coffee in front of her. "On the house," she said with a knowing smile.

The warmth spread through Maris's hands as she took a sip, and for a moment, the past receded. She closed her eyes, letting the flavors wash over her, and felt a sense of peace settle back into her chest.

Maris Laine knew that returning to Oakwood wouldn't be easy. The ghosts of her past would haunt her still, but maybe, just maybe, this time around, she'd find a way to lay them to rest. As she finished her coffee, the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the deserted streets. Maris felt a sense of resolve settle over her – it was time to face the truth and rebuild.
