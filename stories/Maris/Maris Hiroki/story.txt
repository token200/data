Maris Hiroki sat alone on the rooftop, gazing out at the cityscape below. The neon lights twinkled like stars in the dark sky, and the sounds of the city drifted up to join her in a melancholy symphony. As she breathed in the cool night air, Maris Hiroki felt a sense of calm wash over her.

A native of Tokyo, Maris had grown up amidst the bustling streets and ancient traditions of Japan's capital. She had always been drawn to the creative arts, spending hours sketching and painting as a child. After completing art school, she had set out on her own, determined to make a name for herself in the competitive world of Japanese contemporary art.

But success had come at a cost. Maris Hiroki's exhibitions were met with critical acclaim, but also scrutiny. The pressure to constantly produce new work, to push boundaries and innovate, had taken its toll. She often found herself questioning whether she was truly making art, or simply churning out pieces for the sake of recognition.

As she stood on the rooftop, Maris Hiroki felt a sense of disconnection from her own creative voice. The city below seemed to be moving forward, leaving her behind. She thought about all the times she had let external validation dictate her work, and wondered if she was truly being true to herself.

Just as she was starting to feel lost, Maris Hiroki heard the sound of footsteps on the rooftop. It was her friend, Rina, who had stopped by for a visit. "What's wrong?" Rina asked, noticing the look on Maris' face. Maris shook her head, gesturing for Rina to sit down beside her.

For a while, they sat in silence, watching the city lights dance across the sky. Then, without warning, Maris Hiroki spoke up. "I need to remember why I started doing this in the first place," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. Rina nodded, and together they sat in contemplative silence, as the city below seemed to fade into the background.
