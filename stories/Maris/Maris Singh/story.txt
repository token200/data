Maris Singh stepped onto the worn wooden floorboards of her family's old bookstore, inhaling deeply as she took in the familiar scent of dusty tomes and fresh paper. As the owner's daughter, she had grown up surrounded by books, and it was a feeling that never got old.

As she made her way through the narrow aisles, Maris Singh couldn't help but think about the day's schedule. She had promised her mother that she would finish restocking the shelves before the lunchtime crowd arrived, and so far, it was going well. Her father, Ravi, was running late, as usual, and Maris Singh was determined to get everything done before he walked in.

She carefully placed a stack of novels on the shelf, next to a collection of poetry by her favorite author, Rupi Kaur. As she worked, her mind began to wander back to college, where she had studied literature and decided to follow in her parents' footsteps and take over the family business.

As the morning wore on, the store started to fill with customers, each one eager to explore the shelves and discover new titles. Maris Singh was happy to oblige, recommending books and answering questions with a passion that only came from someone who truly loved reading.

Just as she was finishing up the last of the restocking, her father walked in, a cup of steaming coffee in hand. "Morning, beta," he said, using his affectionate term for daughter. Maris Singh smiled, feeling a sense of relief wash over her. She knew that with her parents' support, she could make this business thrive.

Together, the three of them worked side by side, creating a haven for book lovers and bringing people together through the power of words. As the day drew to a close, Maris Singh felt grateful for this life, surrounded by books and loved ones. She knew that she had made the right choice in following her dreams, just like her parents had done before her.

As they locked up the store and headed home, Maris Singh couldn't help but feel content, knowing that tomorrow would bring another day of discovery and joy for all who entered their little bookstore.
