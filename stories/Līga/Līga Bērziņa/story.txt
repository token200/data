Līga Bērziņa stepped off the bus and onto the sun-baked streets of Riga, her eyes scanning the historic buildings as if searching for a familiar face. She had returned to her hometown after a decade abroad, and the mix of emotions swirling inside her was only matched by the layers of stone and brick that seemed to stretch on forever.

Līga, or Lee as she had come to be known, took a deep breath, letting the scent of old wood and damp earth fill her lungs. She hadn't been back in years, not since leaving for university, where she had pursued a degree in architecture that had taken her to the farthest corners of Europe.

As she made her way through the winding streets, Lee spotted a small café tucked away between two old townhouses. The sign above the door read "Pārsmitība" – A Place To Meet – and a flutter in her chest betrayed the nostalgia welling up inside her.

Inside, the café was warm and cozy, with wooden tables and chairs scattered around like family heirlooms. Lee spotted her childhood friend, Jānis, sitting by the window, nursing a cup of coffee. He looked just as he had all those years ago – bright-eyed, quick-witted, and sporting that same mischievous grin.

Over steaming cups of coffee, they caught up on each other's lives, Lee sharing stories of her travels and Jānis regaling her with tales of his own adventures in the world of entrepreneurship. The conversation flowed easily, like no time had passed at all.

As the afternoon wore on, Lee felt a sense of peace settle over her, as if this little café, tucked away in the heart of old town, was exactly where she belonged. For a moment, the worries and doubts that had followed her abroad seemed to recede, replaced by the simple joys of homecoming.

Līga Bērziņa, architect, traveler, and adventurer, found herself drawn back into the warmth and comfort of her native Riga, a city that still held secrets and stories waiting to be uncovered.
