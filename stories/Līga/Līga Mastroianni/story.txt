As word of her talents spread, she began to receive requests from local restaurants and cafes, who wanted to feature her baked goods on their menus.

Despite the success, Līga Mastroianni remained humble and true to her roots. She continued to experiment with new recipes and techniques, always pushing herself to innovate and improve. Her full name became a badge of honor, symbolizing the culmination of her passion, talent, and dedication to her craft.
