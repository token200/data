Līga Sundberg stepped into the crowded café, scanning the room for her friend. She spotted him sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee and staring intently at his laptop screen. As she approached, he looked up and flashed a warm smile.

"Līga! Good to see you," he said, setting aside his laptop. "I was just about to order us some cake. What's your favorite flavor?"

Līga chuckled, taking a seat beside him. "Always chocolate, of course."

Their friendship had started in college, bonding over late-night study sessions and endless cups of coffee. Since graduating, they'd remained close, despite Līga pursuing a career as a journalist while her friend worked as a freelance writer.

As they waited for their cake to arrive, they chatted about everything from politics to pop culture. Līga was known for her sharp wit and ability to effortlessly switch between serious topics and lighthearted humor, which often left her friends in stitches.

When the cake arrived, they dug in, savoring the rich flavors and textures. It was moments like these that Līga cherished – simple pleasures with someone she loved.

After finishing their cake, they decided to take a walk along the nearby riverbank. The sun was beginning to set, casting a golden glow over the water. They strolled in comfortable silence, watching as children played on the shore and couples strolled hand-in-hand.

As they reached a particularly scenic spot, Līga's friend turned to her with a curious expression. "You know, Līga Sundberg, you've always been one for telling stories," he said. "What draws you to journalism?"

Līga thought for a moment before responding. "I think it's the need to uncover truth and give voice to those who might otherwise go unheard. It's not always easy, but it's what gets me out of bed in the morning."

Her friend nodded, taking her words to heart. They continued their walk, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere and each other's company.

As they turned to leave, Līga's friend placed a hand on her arm. "Thanks for being such an amazing friend, Līga Sundberg," he said softly. "You mean the world to me."

Līga smiled, feeling grateful for their friendship. She knew that no matter what life threw their way, she could always count on him to be there for her.
