Līga Gupta stepped out of her small apartment and onto the bustling streets of Mumbai. As a freelance journalist, she was always on the lookout for the next big story, and today was no exception. She had received a tip about a potential exposé involving the city's corrupt real estate developers.

As she walked through the crowded market, Līga Gupta's sharp eyes scanned the scene, taking in every detail. She stopped at a small street food stall, ordering a plate of spicy vada pav as she waited for her contact to arrive. The vendor, an old friend named Ramesh, greeted her with a warm smile.

"Ramesh, my friend, how's business?" Līga Gupta asked, taking a bite of the crispy snack.

"It's been slow today," Ramesh replied, shaking his head. "People are too busy to eat out."

Līga Gupta nodded sympathetically, making a mental note to investigate the economic downturn affecting many small businesses in the city. Her contact, a whistleblower named Rohan, was due to meet her any moment now.

As she turned the corner onto Commercial Street, Līga Gupta spotted Rohan lurking behind a stack of crates. He was a young man with a look of nervous desperation etched on his face.

"Līga Gupta, thank goodness you're here," Rohan said, breathlessly. "I have evidence of corruption involving some of the biggest developers in the city."

Līga Gupta's eyes narrowed as she listened to Rohan's account. This was the story she had been waiting for – a chance to expose the corrupt elite and bring about real change.

As they parted ways, Līga Gupta couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. She knew that this exposé would be a risk, but it was one worth taking. For Līga Gupta, journalism wasn't just about reporting the news – it was about using her voice to make a difference.

With a newfound sense of purpose, Līga Gupta returned to her apartment, already brainstorming ways to bring Rohan's evidence to light. The battle ahead would be tough, but she was ready for the challenge.
