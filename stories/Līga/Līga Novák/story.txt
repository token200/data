Līga Novák stepped into the dimly lit room, her eyes scanning the space with an air of caution. The city's underworld was known for its unpredictability, and she had learned to trust her instincts above all else.

As a skilled enforcer for the Tālava crime family, Līga had earned a reputation for being ruthless and efficient. Her sharp mind and quick reflexes made her the go-to person for delicate operations that required finesse.

Tonight's mission was no exception. A local businessman, known to be difficult to deal with, had refused to pay his dues to the Tālava family. Līga's boss, Sergei, had deemed it necessary to teach him a lesson – one way or another.

She took a deep breath, surveying her surroundings as she waited for confirmation from her contact on the inside. A low hum filled the air, accompanied by an unmistakable whiff of cigarette smoke.

Suddenly, the door swung open and a man in a crumpled suit stepped forward. 'Līga, it's done,' he said, his voice laced with urgency. 'He's ready to meet you.'

Without a word, Līga fell into step beside him, her hand resting on the grip of her pistol. The businessman waited anxiously at the other end of the corridor.

In a matter of minutes, the two men sat face-to-face in a small office cubicle, surrounded by cold concrete walls and sterile fluorescent lighting. The air was heavy with tension as Sergei's representative laid out the terms of their "arrangement." A chilling silence settled over the room.

One final step – just enough time for Līga to gauge her opponent's resolve. She nodded once, a calculated decision sealed into her expression. Then, with an air of detachment, she produced a small folder from her coat pocket and handed it to the businessman. Inside lay a collection of documents detailing his non-payment and repayment terms.

A stunned look took its place on his face, slowly giving way to tears as he accepted defeat. Sergei's demands had been met; for now, the Tālava family was secure.

Breathing out softly, Līga returned her pistol to its holster, an exercise in control. Her mission was complete; but in this dark world of power and compromise, nothing ever truly ended – just delayed until another day.
