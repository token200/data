Līga Stenström was a brilliant and reclusive mathematician who had made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of fractal geometry. Her unique perspective on the subject had led to the development of a new theoretical framework, which she had published in a prestigious scientific journal under her full name: Līga Stenström.

The article, titled "Fractal Self-Similarity in Nature and its Applications," had sparked intense debate among mathematicians and scientists worldwide. Many were skeptical of her claims, but Līga's unwavering dedication to her research had earned her a reputation as a trailblazer in the field.

One evening, as she was working on her next project, Līga received an unexpected visit from her former colleague, Dr. Jānis. He arrived at her small, cluttered apartment, unannounced and unprepared for any conversation other than discussing his latest research findings. As they sipped coffee and engaged in a heated discussion about the implications of fractal geometry on modern physics, Līga couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her.

Dr. Jānis had always been one of Līga's closest friends and confidants during their time at university. They had spent countless hours collaborating on projects, bouncing ideas off each other, and exploring the mysteries of mathematics together. As they delved deeper into their conversation, Līga found herself reminiscing about the old days when her name was not yet synonymous with cutting-edge research.

Over coffee and cigarettes, Dr. Jānis revealed his latest discovery – a novel method for generating fractals using artificial intelligence. Intrigued by the possibilities, Līga proposed an experiment to test the efficacy of this new approach. Together, they spent hours poring over code, debating algorithmic strategies, and collaborating on a groundbreaking study that would further solidify her reputation in the scientific community.

As Dr. Jānis prepared to leave, he handed Līga a note with his full name – Jānis Kozlovskis – scribbled on it in hasty handwriting: "Remember, for me, you'll always be Līga Stenström – the greatest mathematician I've ever known." The small gesture left her heart swelling with gratitude and warmth.
