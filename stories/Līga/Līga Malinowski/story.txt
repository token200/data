Līga Malinowski had always been a free spirit, with an infectious laugh and an adventurous heart. She lived in a small town surrounded by rolling hills and dense forests, where everyone knew her name and her quirks. As a child, Līga spent hours exploring the woods, collecting leaves and pinecones, and chasing after rabbits.

As she grew older, Līga's love for nature only deepened. She became an expert botanist, able to identify even the rarest of plants by their unique scent and texture. Her friends would often join her on her walks, marveling at her knowledge and enthusiasm.
