Līga Woźniak was a 25-year-old Polish-Latvian musician who had been making waves in the indie music scene with her unique blend of folk and electronic elements. Born and raised in Riga, Latvia, Līga's music was heavily influenced by her Eastern European heritage and her experiences growing up as a non-binary individual.

Līga's journey to music began when she was just a teenager, teaching herself to play the guitar and writing songs about her feelings of isolation and disconnection. As she grew older, she began to experiment with electronic production software and eventually formed her own band, "Woźniak & Co." The name was a nod to her Polish surname, which she had adopted in adulthood as a way of honoring her cultural roots.

With the help of her partner, guitarist Mariusz Kowalski, Līga set out to create music that was both introspective and anthemic. Their debut EP, "Saudēties" (which translates to "To Grieve"), was met with critical acclaim from fans and critics alike, with many praising Līga's raw emotional honesty and the band's innovative sound.

As their popularity grew, so did Līga's confidence as a performer. She began to take on increasingly larger stages, including festivals like Latvia's own Pasaules Daina (World Song) festival. There, she performed alongside some of the biggest names in Eastern European music, sharing her story with audiences from all walks of life.

One night, after a particularly rousing performance, Līga took the stage once more to announce that "Woźniak & Co." would be embarking on their first world tour. The crowd erupted into cheers as Līga took her place at the microphone, microphone in hand and a fierce glint in her eye.

With Līga Woźniak at the helm, the band embarked on a journey that would take them to cities across the globe. Along the way, they collected an astonishing array of fans, all drawn by Līga's infectious energy and the band's genre-bending sound. Wherever they went, Līga was there, spreading her message of self-love and acceptance through music.
