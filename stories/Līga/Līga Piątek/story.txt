Līga Piātek was known for her fiery spirit and unapologetic attitude towards life. Born to a family of artists in Latvia, she grew up surrounded by colors, textures, and emotions that would later influence her vibrant street art.

As a teenager, Līga began creating murals in the streets of Riga, using bright hues to convey messages about social justice and environmental sustainability. Her work quickly gained attention from locals and tourists alike, who were drawn to the raw emotion and energy that radiated from each piece.

Despite facing criticism from some quarters for her bold style, Līga remained committed to her art, convinced that it was a powerful tool for change. She spent countless hours perfecting her craft, experimenting with techniques and mediums until she had developed a unique voice that was unmistakably hers.

Līga's big break came when she was commissioned to create a large-scale mural in the heart of Riga, near the city's iconic Old Town Square. The project allowed her to showcase her skills on a grand scale, using over 100 different colors and materials to bring her vision to life.
