One sunny afternoon, Ádám García Fernández received an unusual visit from an elderly woman named Señora Rodríguez.

Intrigued by the peculiar nature of the crimes, Ádám García Fernández agreed to take on the case. He began by questioning Señora Rodríguez and her employees, taking note of every detail, no matter how seemingly insignificant.
