Ádám Laine stood at the edge of the bustling market square, scanning the crowds for any sign of her missing sister, Szofi. It had been weeks since she'd last seen her, and Ádám's anxiety was starting to get the better of her. She took a deep breath and stepped forward, weaving through the stalls selling everything from fresh bread to rare spices.

As she walked, Ádám's eyes landed on a familiar face - their childhood friend, János. He was rummaging through a pile of goods, his brow furrowed in concentration. Ádám quickened her pace, hoping he might know something about Szofi's disappearance.

"János!" she called out, trying to get his attention.

He looked up, startled, and their eyes met for a moment before he smiled and beckoned her over. "Ádám Laine! I hadn't seen you in ages," he said, using her full name as if it was a title of respect.

Ádám rolled her eyes good-naturedly. "János, stop with the formalities. What do you know about Szofi?"

János hesitated, his expression serious. "I haven't seen her, but I have heard rumors. There's talk of a group operating on the outskirts of town, taking in young women and... doing who-knows-what to them."

Ádám's grip on János's arm tightened. She had suspected as much, but hearing it out loud made it feel all too real. "Do you know where they might be?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

János shook his head. "I'm afraid not, Ádám Laine. But I'll help you find out. We'll search the town together, talk to everyone we meet."

Together, they set off on their quest, determined to uncover the truth about Szofi's disappearance and bring her home safely. As they walked, Ádám felt a sense of resolve wash over her - she would stop at nothing to find her sister.
