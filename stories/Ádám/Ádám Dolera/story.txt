Ádám Dolera stood at the edge of the city, his eyes gazing out over the sprawling metropolis. He wore a faded denim jacket and scuffed up combat boots, giving him the appearance of a perpetual outsider. His dark hair was messy, as if he'd just rolled out of bed and stumbled into the world.

He lit a cigarette, taking a long drag before exhaling slowly. Ádám had always been a solitary figure, content to spend hours lost in thought rather than surrounded by the noise and chaos of other people. But lately, something was different. He couldn't quite put his finger on it, but he felt... restless.

As he stood there, a memory surfaced from his past. Ádám's parents had been travelers, always on the move from one place to another. They'd taken him with them, teaching him how to navigate by stars and live off the land. But when Ádám was just a teenager, they vanished without warning. He'd spent years trying to track them down, but it seemed as if they'd disappeared into thin air.

The fire in his stomach had been burning for weeks now, ever since he'd stumbled upon an old map in a dusty antique shop. It was yellowed and worn, but Ádám was certain it was the same one his parents used to study late at night. The route was unclear, but something about it resonated with him.

He flicked the cigarette butt into the gutter and took off in a jog, weaving through the crowded streets until he reached the edge of town. There, a small airfield lay waiting, its runways stretching out like skeletal fingers towards the sky. Ádám had spent hours watching the planes take off and land from this very spot, dreaming of escape.

He rented a small Cessna, the owner eyeing him warily before handing over the keys. "You're sure you know what you're doing?" he asked for the umpteenth time.

Ádám nodded curtly, strapping himself in as the engine roared to life beneath him. The plane lifted off with a smoothness that belied his inexperience. As they soared above the treetops, Ádám felt the weight lifting from his shoulders. This was what he'd been searching for – freedom.

He banked hard to the left, feeling the G-force press him back into his seat. The wind rushed past in a deafening roar, whipping his hair back and forth like a flag. Below, the city dwindled to a tiny patchwork of streets and buildings. He felt a thrill run through him as he spotted the outline of a vast desert on the horizon.

Ádám leveled out the plane, taking in the endless expanse stretching out before him. He had no destination in mind, only an overwhelming urge to move, to explore, to lose himself in the unknown. The map from the antique shop still clung to his mind like a talisman – it would guide him through this uncharted territory.

Hours passed as he flew over scrublands and rocky outcroppings, eventually spotting the outline of a range of mountains on the horizon. He banked again, swooping down towards the peaks with an exhilaration that bordered on madness. The air grew cooler as they climbed higher, until Ádám found himself wrapped in a misty blanket.

The plane sputtered and coughed once before dying completely. Ádám cursed under his breath, peering out into the swirling fog for any sign of landmarks or danger. But there was nothing. Just an unsettling stillness that seemed to cling to every particle of air like a damp shroud.

He sat in silence for what felt like hours, his eyes straining against the gray haze until he spotted something – a shape, indistinct but unmistakable, jutting from the rocky face above him. Ádám's heart was racing as he killed the engine and let the plane coast downwards on momentum alone.

The impact was slight, more of a gentle thud than anything else. As he emerged from the cockpit, Ádám blinked in confusion – where were they? The mountainside stretched out around him like a rugged cocoon, but there was no sign of civilization anywhere. He looked down at the map still clutched in his hand, squinting as if it might suddenly reveal its secrets to him.

This was just the beginning, Ádám thought with a thrill that left his skin tingling.
