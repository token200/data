Ádám Singh walked into the small café, his eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. It had been weeks since he'd last seen his best friend, Rohan, and he was starting to get worried. As he waited in line, he noticed a figure sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee. The man's dark hair and sharp jawline looked eerily familiar.

As Ádám reached the counter, the barista asked him what she could get for him. He ordered a coffee and asked her to keep an eye out for Rohan. A few minutes later, the barista came over to him and whispered that Rohan was sitting in the corner, looking anxious.

Ádám made his way over to Rohan, who looked up as he approached. "Hey, man, what's wrong?" Ádám asked, concern etched on his face. Rohan sighed and rubbed his temples. "I don't know, Ádám Singh. I just can't seem to shake this feeling that something is off."

Ádám sat down beside him and ordered another cup of coffee for himself. As they sipped their drinks, Ádám tried to reassure Rohan that everything would be okay. But as the conversation went on, it became clear that Rohan was struggling with more than just a bad day.

As it turned out, Rohan had been receiving strange messages from an unknown number, warning him to back off from a project he'd been working on. The messages were threatening and menacing, making Rohan feel like he was in grave danger.

Ádám listened intently as Rohan recounted the events, his expression growing darker by the minute. When Rohan finished speaking, Ádám made a decision. He knew someone who owed him a favor, someone who could help them get to the bottom of this mystery.

With newfound determination, Ádám Singh stood up and began making phone calls, determined to uncover the truth behind Rohan's troubles. As they left the café, Rohan looked at his friend with gratitude in his eyes. "Thanks, Ádám. I don't know what I'd do without you."

Ádám smiled, a sense of satisfaction washing over him. "That's what friends are for, Rohan." Together, they set out to uncover the truth and bring justice to those who threatened their friend.
