Ádám Wiśniewska stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for a familiar face. As the lead singer of the indie rock band "Echoes in the Attic," Ádám was no stranger to crowded venues, but tonight felt different. Tonight, she was on a mission.

Ádám spotted her manager, Janek, sitting in the corner, sipping a cup of coffee. She made her way over, her long blonde hair swaying with each step. As she reached the table, Janek looked up and smiled.

"Ádám, darling, it's so good to see you," he said, rising from his seat to greet her with a warm hug.

Ádám hugged him back, feeling a sense of relief wash over her. Tonight was the night they would finally discuss the possibility of signing with a major label. She had been hesitant in the past, worried that it would compromise the band's artistic vision, but Janek assured her that this time would be different.

As they ordered their drinks and sat down, Ádám couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness. The music industry was constantly changing, and she knew that one wrong move could spell disaster for "Echoes in the Attic." She took a deep breath and let Janek fill her in on the details.

The major label had been impressed with their latest EP, and they were willing to make an offer. Ádám listened intently, weighing the pros and cons. On one hand, the exposure would be incredible, but on the other hand, she feared losing control over the band's creative direction.

Just as they were about to leave, a young journalist approached their table, notebook and pen at the ready. Ádám exchanged a nervous glance with Janek, sensing that this might be an opportunity she couldn't pass up. She smiled brightly and began to answer the reporter's questions, her passion for music shining through.

As the night drew to a close, Ádám knew that she had made the right decision. Signing with the major label would give "Echoes in the Attic" the chance to reach new heights, and she was ready to take on the challenge. With Janek by her side, she left the café feeling empowered, eager to see what the future held for Ádám Wiśniewska and her band.
