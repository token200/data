Her eyes pleaded with him for help, and Ádám Fuentes knew he couldn't turn his back on her. He took on the case, pouring over every shred of evidence in search of the truth.

As he delved deeper into the investigation, Ádám Fuentes became increasingly convinced that there was a web of corruption at play.
