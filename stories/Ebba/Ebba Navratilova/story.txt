I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Ebba Navratilova. However, I did find that Martina Navratilova is a well-known tennis player.

Let me write a story about her:

Martina Navratilova was a tennis legend who dominated the sport in the 1980s and 1990s. But what many people didn't know was that she had a secret talent - singing. Ebba, Martina's childhood nickname, would often sneak away from her tennis racket to belt out show tunes in the shower.

As a young girl growing up in Prague, Ebba (or Martina, as she was known professionally) was enchanted by the music of Rodgers and Hammerstein. She spent hours practicing her vocal range and perfecting her rendition of "The Sound of Music."

Despite her passion for singing, Martina's parents encouraged her to pursue a career in tennis instead. And so, Ebba (or Martina) focused on becoming one of the greatest tennis players of all time.

But even as she soared to international fame on the tennis court, Ebba's love of music never faded. In fact, it became a source of comfort and inspiration for her during the most intense moments of competition.

As Martina's career reached its peak, she began to make appearances at charity events and fundraisers, where she would perform songs like "Defying Gravity" from Wicked. Her powerful vocals brought the house down every time, and she became known as one of the greatest tennis players with a secret talent for singing.

Years later, when Martina retired from tennis, she opened up about her love of music in an interview. "Ebba's always been my creative outlet," she said. "It's where I find my true self." And even though she may not be strutting down the catwalk or serving ace on the tennis court, Ebba Navratilova - or Martina Navratilova, for that matter - will always be remembered as a champion of music and tennis alike.
