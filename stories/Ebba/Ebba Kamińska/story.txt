Ebba Kamińska stepped out into the crisp autumn evening, her eyes scanning the dimly lit streets of Warsaw's Old Town. As a journalist for the city's largest newspaper, she had heard whispers of a long-buried secret hidden within the historic buildings. Her curiosity was piqued, and she knew that she had to investigate.

A native Wrocławian, Ebba had returned to her hometown in Poland after working abroad as a freelance reporter. She found solace in uncovering stories that shed light on the country's often-turbulent past. The locals whispered about a mysterious woman who was said to have infiltrated the Warsaw Uprising during World War II.

Rumors spoke of Ebba's great-aunt, Anna Kamińska, a member of the resistance movement. Some claimed she had been part of an elite unit known as "Wolność" – freedom fighters – while others believed she was merely a sympathizer. Ebba knew that her great aunt had kept this information hidden for decades.

Determined to find out more about Anna's life and death, Ebba started asking questions around town. She spoke with elderly residents who remembered stories from the past but were reluctant to share their knowledge publicly. Some claimed to have seen Ebba's great aunt in action during battles against German forces.

One evening, while exploring the streets, Ebba stumbled upon a small café tucked away between historic buildings. Inside, an old woman named Ewa sat sipping tea, her eyes twinkling with memories of the past. Recognizing Ebba's great-aunt's name, she invited her to sit down and share stories.

As they talked, Ebba learned about Anna's role in "Wolność" – leading a group of Polish soldiers during a raid on the German-occupied radio station, broadcasting messages of resistance to an international audience. According to Ewa, Anna's bravery had earned her the respect of fellow fighters and enemy forces alike.

Though still much was unclear, Ebba felt like she was uncovering just the beginning of the truth. She realized that sometimes history needed to be revealed through voices we least expected – those who lived it and those who knew them best.
