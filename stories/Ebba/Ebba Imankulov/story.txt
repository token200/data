Ebba Imankulov was a brilliant and reclusive astronomer who had spent her entire career studying the mysteries of the universe. Her small, cluttered office in the heart of Istanbul was a testament to her dedication to her craft, with papers, books, and equipment scattered everywhere.

Despite her success, Ebba was a loner, preferring the company of stars to that of people. She had few friends and no family, having grown up on the streets of Istanbul after her parents' untimely death in a tragic accident.

One day, while pouring over ancient texts in the university library, Ebba stumbled upon an obscure reference to a long-lost star system. Her curiosity piqued, she spent the next several weeks poring over every available resource, determined to uncover the truth about this enigmatic celestial body.

As she delved deeper into her research, Ebba began to notice strange occurrences around her office - equipment malfunctioning, papers flying off shelves, and an unshakeable feeling of being watched. She tried to brush it off as mere paranoia, but the sensation only grew stronger.

Convinced that something was amiss, Ebba sought out the expertise of her colleague, Dr. Selim. A renowned expert in the field of astrobiology, Dr. Selim was known for his calm and rational demeanor, which was a welcome respite from Ebba's growing unease.

Together, they pored over the data, searching for any clues that might explain the strange happenings in Ebba's office. As they worked, Ebba couldn't help but feel grateful for Dr. Selim's presence - his steady hand and wise eyes were a balm to her frazzled nerves.

After days of tireless work, they finally made a groundbreaking discovery - the lost star system was real, and it was on the brink of collapse. Ebba's heart swelled with excitement as she realized that her life's work had led her to this moment. And though she still shied away from social interactions, Ebba felt a sense of purpose and belonging that she had never known before.
