I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Ebba Bąk. However, I can create a story for you.

In the small town of Gdańsk, Poland, lived Ebba Bąk, a 25-year-old photographer with a passion for capturing the beauty of the Baltic Sea. Her long, curly brown hair and bright blue eyes sparkled whenever she was behind the lens, searching for the perfect shot.

Ebba's love for photography began when her grandfather, a skilled sailor, would take her on boat rides along the coast. She'd sit at the bow, camera in hand, as the wind whipped through her hair and the sun shone down on her face. Those moments inspired her to capture the world around her, frozen in time.

As she grew older, Ebba's photographs began to gain attention from local galleries and publications. People were drawn to her unique perspective, which blended the beauty of nature with a touch of melancholy. Her images told stories of the sea's power and fragility, of the people who lived and worked on its shores.

One day, while exploring the historic center of Gdańsk, Ebba stumbled upon an old, abandoned lighthouse. Something about it resonated with her, and she knew she had to capture its beauty on film. She spent hours taking shots, experimenting with different angles and lighting setups. As the sun set over the city, casting a golden glow over the scene, Ebba knew she had found something special.

With her camera full of memories, Ebba returned to her darkroom, where she developed the prints. The resulting images were hauntingly beautiful, capturing the lighthouse in all its glory. She titled the series "Beacon of Memories" and submitted it to local galleries, hoping to share her vision with the world. And so, Ebba Bąk's photographs continued to tell stories of the sea and its people, inspiring others to see the beauty in the world around them.

Years went by, and Ebba's work became more renowned, but she never forgot those moments on the boat with her grandfather, or the abandoned lighthouse that had inspired her. Her passion for photography remained strong, a reflection of her connection to the sea and its people.
