**Character Profile:**

Background: Born and raised in Krakow, Poland, Ebba grew up fascinated with history and archaeology. She studied at the Jagiellonian University, where she earned her Ph.D. in Archaeology.

**Short Story:**

Ebba Jasińska crouched beside the ancient stone wall, her eyes scanning the weathered surface for any signs of damage or neglect. As an archaeologist, she had spent years studying the medieval architecture of Krakow, but this particular site held a special significance - it was believed to be the location of the legendary King Casimir's palace.

Legend had it that Casimir, who ruled Krakow in the 14th century, had been buried alongside his wife in the very foundations of the palace. Ebba was determined to find out if this was true, and spent hours combing the site for any clues.

As she worked, Ebba's mind wandered back to her childhood, when her grandmother used to tell stories of Casimir's bravery and wisdom. She remembered feeling a sense of wonder and awe as a child, listening to her grandmother's tales by the fireplace in their cozy Krakow apartment.

Suddenly, Ebba's gaze landed on a small crack in the stone wall - just large enough for a small object to fit through. Her heart racing with excitement, she carefully inserted a small brush into the crack and began to probe deeper.

After what felt like an eternity, her brush touched something smooth and metallic. "It can't be," Ebba whispered to herself, hardly believing her luck. She carefully excavated the object, revealing a beautifully crafted silver pendant in the shape of a lion's head - the exact symbol of King Casimir.

Ebba's eyes welled up with tears as she realized that this discovery could rewrite history and shed new light on one of Poland's most beloved monarchs. With shaking hands, she carefully packed up her tools and headed back to the lab, already planning her next move in unraveling the secrets of King Casimir's palace.
