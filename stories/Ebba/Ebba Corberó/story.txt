I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Ebba Corberó. It's possible that this character doesn't exist or is not well-known.

However, I can suggest an alternative story featuring the Spanish actress Eva Corberó, who is known for her role as Sandra "La Casa de Papel" (Money Heist) in the Netflix series of the same name.

Here's a 400-word story about Eva Corberó:

Eva Corberó was a master thief with a reputation for being one step ahead of the law. She had spent years honing her skills, studying the intricacies of security systems and learning how to manipulate people into doing her bidding.

As she slipped on her gloves and adjusted her wig, Eva felt a sense of excitement and nervousness wash over her. Tonight was the night of the big heist – the biggest job of her career.

She nodded to herself as she made her way through the dimly lit corridors, her eyes scanning the security cameras and guards for any sign of weakness. She had studied this place inside out, knew exactly where the alarms were located and how to disable them.

As she approached the vault, Eva could feel her heart pounding in her chest. This was it – the moment of truth. She inserted the keycard into the reader and smiled to herself as the lock disengaged with a satisfying click.

With a flourish, Eva pulled open the door to the vault and gazed inside at the treasure trove of cash and jewels that lay before her. She quickly got to work, stuffing bags with as much money and gold as she could carry.

But just as she was about to make her escape, Eva's phone buzzed in her pocket. It was her partner, Alex, calling to check in. "Everything okay?" he asked, his voice low and urgent.

Eva hesitated for a moment before responding, her voice steady despite the butterflies in her stomach. "Yes, everything's fine. Just need to wrap up here."

As she made her way back through the corridors, Eva couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. She glanced over her shoulder, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Shrugging it off as nerves, she continued on to meet Alex and make their getaway.

Little did Eva know, however, that this heist would set off a chain reaction that would change her life forever.
