Ebba Ken stood at the edge of the rooftop, the wind whipping her dark hair into a frenzy as she gazed out over the city. She was a loner, content to spend her days lost in thought, scribbling in her journal or staring up at the stars. Few people knew much about Ebba's past, and even fewer had ever gotten close enough to pry the secrets from her.

As she stood there, a figure emerged from the shadows below. It was Lena, an old friend from childhood who had somehow managed to track Ebba down. Lena looked worried, fidgeting with the hem of her jacket as she approached Ebba's side.

"Ebba, I've been looking all over for you," Lena said, her voice low and urgent. "I just got a call from our mutual friend, Sofia. She says something terrible has happened."

Ebba raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite herself. What could be so bad that it would warrant Sofia's frantic phone calls? But before she could ask any questions, Lena plunged on.

"Sofia's sister is missing," Lena explained. "She was out exploring the woods near town and never came back. The police are stumped, and Sofia is beside herself with worry."

Ebba felt a pang of curiosity. She had always been drawn to mysteries and puzzles, and this one seemed particularly intriguing. Without saying a word, she nodded at Lena and took off down the rooftop's stairs, her long legs eating up the distance as they made their way into the city.

They found Sofia pacing outside her apartment building, her face etched with worry lines. Ebba exchanged a brief glance with Lena before focusing on the distraught young woman.

"I'm so glad you're here," Sofia exclaimed, rushing to grab Ebba's hand. "I've been going crazy trying to find out what happened to Emma."

Ebba smiled gently, her eyes locking onto Sofia's. "We'll find out what happened to your sister," she promised. "But first, we need some information. Tell me everything you can about the last time you saw Emma."

Sofia launched into a detailed account of their conversation earlier that day, and Ebba listened intently, her mind racing with theories and possibilities. As they walked through the city streets, Ebba's thoughts turned to the woods, dark and mysterious as ever.

The investigation had just begun, but already Ebba felt a thrill of excitement. This was going to be an adventure unlike any other â€“ one that would require all her skills, intelligence, and cunning. And with Lena by her side, she knew they could conquer even the most daunting mystery.
