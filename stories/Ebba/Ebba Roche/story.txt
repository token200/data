Ebba Roche stepped into the dimly lit pub, the smell of smoke and stale beer enveloping her like a familiar shroud. She slid onto a stool at the bar, ordering a whiskey on the rocks as she scanned the room with a practiced air of disdain.

As a private investigator, Ebba had seen it all - from petty theft to high-stakes blackmail. But there was something about this case that had her spooked. A wealthy businessman had hired her to track down his missing daughter, and so far, every lead seemed to end in a dead-end alleyway.

Ebba's eyes landed on a figure huddled in the corner, nursing a mug of beer. There was something about him that caught her attention - a look of quiet desperation that spoke volumes about his story. She made a mental note to approach him later.

As she sipped her whiskey, Ebba's mind wandered back to the case at hand. The daughter in question, Sophie Roche, had been reported missing three days ago. Her parents were frantic, and the police seemed more interested in covering up the scandal than getting to the bottom of it.

Ebba had a reputation for being one of the best in the business, but she knew that this case was different. There was something about Sophie's disappearance that didn't add up. Ebba's instincts told her that there was more to the story than met the eye.

Just then, the figure from the corner got up and ambled over to her stool. "Mind if I join you?" he asked, his voice low and gravelly. Ebba shook her head, and he slid onto the stool beside her. "I'm Marcus," he said, extending a rough-looking hand. "And you are...?"

"Ebba Roche," she replied, shaking his hand firmly.

Marcus's eyes locked onto hers, and for a moment, they just stared at each other. Then, without another word, he turned and disappeared into the crowd, leaving Ebba with more questions than answers.
