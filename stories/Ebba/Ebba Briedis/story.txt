Despite her success, Ebba remained committed to using her art as a tool for social change. She collaborated with organizations focused on environmental sustainability and digital literacy, helping to educate young people about the importance of responsible technology use.

Ebba's latest project, "The Cybernetic Human," explores the intersection of technology and human identity in a world where machines are increasingly integrated into our daily lives. The piece features a stunning installation that combines virtual reality, 3D printing, and traditional art forms to create an immersive experience that challenges viewers to rethink their relationship with technology.
