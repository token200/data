Ebba Maria Makinen was no stranger to hard work and dedication. As a young apprentice in Helsinki's prestigious woodworking shop, she spent countless hours honing her craft under the watchful eye of Master Craftsman Kari. With her natural talent and insatiable curiosity, Ebba quickly surpassed her peers and proved herself to be one of the most skilled woodworkers in the city.

One day, Ebba received an offer from a prominent architectural firm in Stockholm to create a custom piece for one of their high-profile clients. The project was a huge challenge, requiring Ebba to work with a rare and exotic type of wood that few craftsmen had ever seen before. Undaunted by the prospect, Ebba threw herself into the task, pouring over books and seeking advice from her mentors.
