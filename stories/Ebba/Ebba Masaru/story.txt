Ebba Masaru stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the quaint station. She had been traveling for hours, and the worn wooden benches and faded signs seemed to match the melancholy mood that had settled over her.

As she made her way through the station, Ebba's gaze landed on a small caf√© tucked away in a corner. A sign above the door read "Kokoro," and the scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted out, drawing her in. She pushed open the door and slipped inside, taking a seat at the bar.

The barista, a young woman with a kind smile, greeted Ebba warmly. "Welcome to Kokoro. What can I get for you?" Ebba ordered a cup of black coffee and sat back, watching as the barista expertly crafted her drink.

As she sipped her coffee, Ebba noticed an old man sitting at a table by the window, staring intently out into the rain-soaked streets. He seemed lost in thought, and Ebba felt a pang of recognition. She too knew what it was like to feel adrift, searching for a sense of belonging.

The barista returned with a napkin and placed it on Ebba's lap. "Sorry about that," she said quietly. "I think he might be new around here. We don't get many strangers."

Ebba smiled kindly at the barista, feeling a connection to this young woman who seemed just as vulnerable as she was. The old man still sat lost in thought, but Ebba didn't press her luck. Instead, she pulled out a small sketchbook from her bag and began to draw.

The rain pounded against the windows, creating a soothing melody that ebbed and flowed with Ebba's pencil strokes. As she drew, she felt a sense of peace settle over her, like the quiet calm before a storm. The old man looked up, noticing her focused gaze, but he didn't interrupt. He simply sat, watching as Ebba's art brought order to the chaotic world outside.

Time passed slowly, and eventually, the rain subsided, leaving behind a stillness that felt almost palpable. As Ebba finished her coffee, she closed her sketchbook and smiled softly at the barista. "Thank you for the moment," she said quietly. The old man stood up, brushing off his coat, and walked out into the newly washed world, while Ebba stepped back onto the platform, feeling a renewed sense of purpose.
