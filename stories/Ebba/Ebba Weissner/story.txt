Ebba Weissner stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar streets of Copenhagen. She had left Berlin in a hurry, fleeing the Nazi's rising tide of terror that threatened to consume everything she held dear. As a young artist, Ebba had always felt suffocated by the very politics she sought to express through her work.

The city was a blur as she walked, her thoughts consumed by the rejection letter from the Deutscher Beratungsring, a prestigious art organization that had once hailed her as one of their most promising talents. Now, it seemed they saw her as too radical, too subversive for the stagnant status quo.

Ebba's thoughts were interrupted by the soft chime of a bicycle bell outside the caf√© where she planned to meet her friend, Helga. The small, unassuming building was tucked away in a quiet alleyway, its wooden sign creaking in the gentle breeze.

As Ebba pushed open the door, Helga looked up from the sketchbook in her lap, a warm smile spreading across her face. "Ebba! It's been too long."

The two friends hugged, their laughter mingling with the scent of fresh coffee and baking bread wafting from the kitchen. Helga was a painter, and her bold colors and abstract compositions had become a staple of Copenhagen's thriving art scene.

Over steaming cups of coffee, they talked of everything except politics. Ebba showed Helga her latest collection of sketches, each one a raw expression of her frustration and longing for freedom. As the sun dipped below the rooftops, casting long shadows across the table, Ebba knew she had found a new home in this quiet Danish city.

Though the memories of Berlin still lingered, like a faint scent on her skin, Ebba felt a sense of liberation wash over her. In Copenhagen, she could finally express herself without fear of reprisal, her art becoming a beacon for those seeking refuge from the turmoil of Europe.

As they parted ways, Helga pressed a small package into Ebba's hands. Inside, a handful of charcoal and a scribbled note read: "For when the words won't come."
