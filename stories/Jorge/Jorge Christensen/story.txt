Jorge Christensen wiped the sweat from his forehead as he gazed out at the sprawling metropolis before him. A city born of steel and stone, its skyscrapers seemed to touch the sky, their peaks hidden in the clouds. As a journalist, Jorge had spent years reporting on this city's darker corners, but tonight he was here for a different reason.

He stood outside the gleaming glass tower that housed the office of wealthy businessman, Julian Styles. Rumors swirled about Julian's dealings - some said he was involved in shady investments, while others whispered that he had connections to the underworld. Jorge had always been skeptical, but his latest tip hinted at a story big enough to shake the foundations.

He took a deep breath and pushed open the door. The lobby was slickly decorated, with polished marble floors and velvet drapes that seemed to whisper secrets as he passed by. A receptionist looked up from her console, her eyes flicking over Jorge before dismissing him with a curt nod.

"Sorry, sir, I don't have time for visitors tonight."

Jorge flashed his press badge. "I'm here to see Julian Styles. It's a matter of public interest."

The woman hesitated, glancing at the phone on her desk before nodding. "Okay... but just for one minute."

As Jorge was led through the winding corridors, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He had dealt with people like Julian before - slick, calculating men who played the game by any means necessary. But tonight felt different. Tonight, something in the air seemed to vibrate with tension.

When they reached Julian's office, Jorge spotted a figure slumped over his desk, their head thrown back as if in exhaustion or despair. A look of shock crossed Jorge's face - it couldn't be...

"Styles?" Jorge called out, but there was no response.

The room fell silent, except for the sound of heavy breathing from the body on the floor. As Jorge approached, he noticed something glinting in Julian's hand - a small key, partially concealed beneath his palm.

Suddenly, the pieces clicked into place. This wasn't just about business deals or shady investments; it was about something far more sinister. And Jorge knew that this story would change everything.
