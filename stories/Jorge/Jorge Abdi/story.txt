As the sun began to set, Jorge Abdi finally took a moment to rest. He sat back in his chair, exhausted but content. His reputation as a healer had spread far and wide, and he knew that one day, he would be called upon to tend to the most revered leaders of the land.

For now, though, Jorge Abdi was happy to serve those in need. As he closed his eyes, the soft chanting of the Berber monks outside drifted into his mind, a soothing melody that seemed to lull him into a peaceful slumber.
