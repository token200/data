Jorge Hassan stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of his brother, Carlos. It had been years since they'd last spoken, but a chance encounter at a mutual friend's party had sparked a renewed interest in reconnecting.

As he made his way through the crowded station, Jorge spotted a familiar face - his old high school friend, Maria. She was now a successful businesswoman, and her bright smile lit up the dimly lit space.

"Jorge! It's been ages!" she exclaimed, embracing him warmly.

"I know, it feels like just yesterday we were studying for our exams," Jorge replied, laughing.

Maria introduced him to her new partner, who seemed pleasant enough, but Jorge couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. As they parted ways, Maria whispered a cryptic message in his ear: "Be careful around Carlos, Jorge Hassan. He's changed."

Jorge shrugged it off as mere gossip, but the words lingered in his mind like a shadow.

As he waited for what felt like an eternity, the train finally arrived, and Jorge spotted Carlos standing at the entrance of the station. They exchanged awkward smiles before Carlos took charge, ushering Jorge into a sleek black car.

The drive was silent, with only the soft hum of the engine breaking the tension. Jorge tried to engage Carlos in conversation, but his brother's responses were evasive and distant.

Finally, they arrived at an opulent mansion, where Carlos introduced him to his new wife - Maria, whose smile had once lit up Jorge's life.

"Welcome, Jorge Hassan," she said, her voice dripping with sweetness. "I see you're just in time for dinner."

The evening was a blur of small talk and forced laughter, but Jorge couldn't help but feel like an outsider looking in. As the night drew to a close, Carlos offered him a drink, his eyes gleaming with a knowing glint.

"Let's catch up sometime, brother," he said, clinking glasses. "Over whiskey."

Jorge nodded politely, but his mind was racing with questions and doubts. Who was this man, really? And what secrets had Maria been hiding all along?
