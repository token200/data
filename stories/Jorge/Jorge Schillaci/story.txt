Years went by, and the stranger became a regular at Schillaci's Shack. He would stop by every week, sharing tales of his travels and adventures. Jorge would listen with a warm smile, pouring himself a cup of coffee to match the stranger's. As their bond grew stronger, Jorge began to share stories about his own life – growing up on a farm, learning the secrets of his famous chili from his abuela.
