One day, Jorge received an offer to showcase his work at a local gallery. It was a huge opportunity for him, and he was determined to make the most of it. He spent weeks preparing for the exhibition, selecting his best pieces and creating elaborate displays to showcase them.

The night of the exhibition arrived, and Jorge's studio was filled with people eager to see his work.
