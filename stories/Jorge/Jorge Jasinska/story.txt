Born Jorge Javier Jasinska in the vibrant city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, Jorge's love affair with music began at a young age. His parents, both classical musicians themselves, encouraged his talent and nurtured it until he was old enough to take up an instrument himself.

As Jorge Jasinska grew older, his style evolved from traditional Argentine tango to modern jazz fusion. He studied under some of the greatest musicians in the world, absorbing every note and nuance that crossed his path.
