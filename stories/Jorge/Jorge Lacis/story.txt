Jorge Lacis stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of life. He had been traveling for hours, and the fatigue was starting to wear on him. As he made his way through the crowds, a gentle voice called out behind him.

"Señor Lacis?"

Jorge turned to see a young woman with piercing green eyes and long, curly brown hair. She smiled warmly and handed him a small piece of paper.

"I'm Sofia," she said. "I've been waiting for you."

Jorge's mind was a blank, but he recognized the desperation in her eyes. He took the paper from her hand and read the note scrawled on it: "Meet me at Café del Sol. Come alone."

He nodded to Sofia, his gut telling him that she might be the only one who could help him now.

As Jorge walked through the streets of San Sebastián, the cool ocean breeze carried the scent of saltwater and freshly baked bread from the café. His stomach growled with hunger, but he pushed on, driven by a sense of duty.

When he finally arrived at Café del Sol, Sofia was already seated at a small table, sipping a cup of coffee. She rose to greet him, her eyes locking onto his with an intensity that made Jorge feel like she could see right through him.

"Jorge Lacis," she said, as if reading his thoughts aloud. "I've heard so much about you."

The past few years had been a blur for Jorge Lacis, but he knew that Sofia was referring to the scandal that had rocked the small town where he grew up. The one that had left him with more questions than answers.

Sofia sat down across from him, her eyes never leaving his face. "We need to talk," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Jorge nodded, knowing that this conversation would change everything. He leaned forward, ready to face whatever secrets Sofia might reveal about the mysterious past he had always tried to keep hidden.
