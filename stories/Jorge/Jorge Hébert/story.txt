Born in the scorching deserts of Egypt, Jorge's fascination with the past began at a tender age. He would spend hours pouring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls, devouring every morsel of information he could find on ancient history. As he grew older, his passion only intensified, driving him to dedicate his life to uncovering the truth about long-lost empires.

Jorge Hébert's latest obsession was the lost city of Zerzura, a fabled metropolis hidden deep within the Egyptian sands.

Jorge Hébert was about to embark on the adventure of a lifetime, one that would take him into the very heart of ancient Egypt and unlock the secrets of the lost city of Zerzura.
