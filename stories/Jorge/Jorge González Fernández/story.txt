Jorge González Fernández stepped out of the misty dawn, his eyes fixed on the endless expanse of the Andes. The wind carried the scent of eucalyptus and damp earth as he breathed in deeply, feeling alive. He was a man of few words, but his gaze spoke volumes.

As a young boy, Jorge had grown up in this rugged landscape, learning to survive off the land from his abuelo, a wise and weathered mountain man. His eyes had seen the harsh beauty of the Andes – the snow-capped peaks, the turquoise lakes, and the lush valleys below. He knew every hidden stream, every secret meadow, and every ancient trail that wound its way through the mountains.

Jorge was a shepherd now, tending to his flock of sheep as they grazed on the grassy slopes. His hands were worn from years of work, but his movements were fluid and effortless, like those of a wild animal. He knew this land better than anyone, and he knew its secrets.

As the sun climbed higher in the sky, Jorge spotted something moving in the distance – a figure on horseback, riding towards him with purpose. It was his amigo, Mateo, who had come to visit from the nearby village. Mateo was a bit of a city boy, but he had a deep respect for the land and its people.

"Jorge, mi hermano!" Mateo exclaimed, as he dismounted his horse and approached Jorge's flock. "I've brought some bread and cheese from the village. Let me help you with the sheep."

Together, they worked in silence, their movements choreographed by years of experience. Jorge watched Mateo work, a small smile playing on his lips. He knew that Mateo would never understand the way he felt about this land – the way it spoke to him in a language only he could hear.

As the day wore on, Jorge and Mateo took a break to sit on a rocky outcropping, watching the sun set over the mountains. The sky was ablaze with color – oranges, pinks, and purples that seemed to pulse with the rhythm of the land. Jorge closed his eyes, feeling the weight of the world lift from his shoulders.

"This is it, Mateo," he said finally, when they stood up to return to their work. "This is where I belong."

Mateo nodded in agreement, his eyes shining with understanding. "I know, Jorge. You're a son of this land, just like me."

And as they walked back to the flock, Jorge felt a sense of peace wash over him – the knowledge that he was exactly where he belonged, under the watchful gaze of the Andes.
