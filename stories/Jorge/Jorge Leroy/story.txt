Jorge Leroy stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his piercing green eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. The patrons were a rough bunch, but Jorge had dealt with worse. He was a man of few words, but when spoken, they carried weight.

As he made his way to the bar, the bartender, a gruff old man named Joe, looked up and raised an eyebrow. "The usual?" he asked, nodding towards Jorge's drink of choice.

Jorge nodded silently, taking a seat at the bar as Joe slid him a whiskey. The bartender knew better than to ask questions about Jorge's business. Some secrets were meant to stay hidden behind closed doors.

A commotion erupted from the corner of the room, where two men were arguing over a game of cards. One of them, a burly man with a thick beard, had taken a nasty spill and was now nursing his wounded pride.

Jorge watched the scene unfold, his mind working overtime to assess the situation. He knew these guys – they were local thugs, always looking for a fight. Jorge's instincts told him to intervene, but he kept his mouth shut, letting events play out.

The bearded man glared at Jorge, accusing him of cheating. Jorge remained still, his eyes locked on the rival patron as if daring them to take another step forward. The air was thick with tension, but Jorge refused to back down.

Just when it seemed like things were about to escalate, a slender woman slipped into the tavern and wove her way through the crowd. Her dark hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall of night, and her bright blue eyes sparkled with mischief.

She sidled up beside Jorge, ordering him a drink as she leaned against the bar next to him. The bartender raised an eyebrow at this unexpected move, but Jorge merely smiled, accepting his drink.

The woman – Sophia, he knew from experience – was trouble, just like anyone who walked into the tavern. But there was something about her that didn't quite add up. She seemed... lost, searching for someone or something.

As she sipped her drink and chatted idly with Jorge, the atmosphere in the room began to shift. The thugs at the table slunk away, their tails between their legs. Even Joe relaxed a little, watching the exchange with curiosity.

Sophia leaned in close, her voice barely audible over the sounds of laughter from around the tavern. "Jorge Leroy," she whispered, "I need your help."

Jorge raised an eyebrow, but he knew better than to turn down Sophia's pleas for aid. He nodded quietly, and she took off into the night, leaving Jorge with more questions than answers.

The whiskey burned his throat as he watched her disappear into the shadows, the game having just begun in this particular round of life.
