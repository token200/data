Jorge Kozlowski stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, his eyes scanning the deserted station. As the son of a Polish immigrant, he had grown up with a sense of disconnection from his heritage, but this trip to Poland was an attempt to reconnect.

As he walked through the station, Jorge noticed a young girl watching him from across the way. She couldn't have been more than ten years old, with bright blue eyes and curly brown hair. She smiled at him, and Jorge felt a jolt of surprise.

He approached her cautiously, unsure what to expect. "Hello," he said softly.

"Hello," she replied, her accent thick and musical. "I'm Kasia."

Jorge's mind reeled as he tried to place the name. Suddenly, it clicked - this was the same Kasia who had written him a letter months ago, saying she had seen his father in an old photograph.

Over the next few days, Jorge met with various relatives and acquaintances, trying to piece together his family history. He learned about his great-grandfather's struggles during World War II, and how he had been forced to flee Poland due to persecution.

Jorge Kozlowski felt a sense of pride and belonging wash over him as he listened to these stories. This was who he came from, after all - not just some faceless immigrant in the United States, but a proud Pole with roots stretching back generations.

As he prepared to leave, Kasia approached him once more. "I'm glad I met you," she said, her eyes shining.

Jorge smiled, feeling a sense of connection he had never experienced before. "Me too, Kasia." He took out his notebook and jotted down the address on the letter she had given him - the address of a small family farm in rural Poland.

"I'll come back soon," Jorge promised.

Kasia nodded, her smile still shining bright. As Jorge boarded the train to leave, he felt a sense of hope that he hadn't felt in years - hope that one day he would truly be able to call himself Jorge Kozlowski, son of Polish soil.
