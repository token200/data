Jorge Ozoliņa stepped off the train and onto the platform, gazing out at the unfamiliar streets of Riga. A historian from Argentina, he had traveled across the world to study the city's complex past. Jorge Ozoliņa's eyes scanned the buildings, taking in the mix of Art Nouveau and Soviet-era architecture.

As he wandered through the Old Town, Jorge Ozoliņa came across a small café tucked away on a side street. He pushed open the door and was enveloped in the warm scent of freshly brewed coffee. The barista, an elderly woman with kind eyes, greeted him with a smile. "Welcome, señor," she said. "What can I get for you?"

Jorge Ozoliņa ordered a black coffee and sat down at a small table by the window. He pulled out his notebook and began to transcribe notes from his research on Riga's Jewish community during World War II. His mind wandered back to his own family history, growing up in Buenos Aires with tales of his grandfather's Lithuanian heritage.

As he worked, Jorge Ozoliņa noticed a group of locals huddled at the next table, speaking in hushed tones. They glanced over at him suspiciously, and one of them muttered something under their breath. Jorge Ozoliņa ignored it, focusing on his research.

After a few hours, the café began to close, and the barista came over to collect Jorge Ozoliņa's things. "You're a researcher, señor?" she asked, curiosity getting the better of her.

Jorge Ozoliņa nodded, showing her his passport. The woman smiled knowingly. "I have family here," she said. "My grandfather was Jewish. He told me stories about Riga before the war."

Their conversation flowed easily, and Jorge Ozoliņa learned more about the city's history from a local's perspective than he had in hours of reading. As he left the café, the woman pressed a small package into his hand. "A gift," she said. Inside, Jorge Ozoliņa found a photograph of a young woman with striking features – probably taken in the 1930s.

He looked up at the barista, her eyes sparkling with understanding. "My mother's daughter," she whispered. "I think you'll find this interesting."
