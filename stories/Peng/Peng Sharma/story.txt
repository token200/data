Peng Sharma was a name that struck fear into the hearts of his enemies, but not for the reasons you might think. In a world where superpowered beings were the norm, Peng Sharma was known as the "Guru" - a master strategist and tactician who could outmaneuver even the most powerful foes.

Born with no discernible powers, Peng had always relied on his intellect to stay ahead of the game. He spent years studying the tactics of others, learning from their strengths and weaknesses, and adapting them to fit his own unique approach.

As a young man, Peng had worked as a mercenary, taking on high-risk missions for top dollar. But after a close call with a rival mercenary, he decided it was time to hang up his guns and use his skills for good.

Peng formed an elite team of agents, each with their own unique abilities - but none of them superpowered. There was Jax, a skilled hacker; Lena, a master of disguise; and Zara, a genius engineer. Together, they took on cases that the authorities couldn't or wouldn't handle.

Their latest mission was to infiltrate a heavily guarded facility owned by a notorious tech mogul. The target was a revolutionary new device capable of hacking into even the most secure computer systems. Peng's team had a plan - and it involved getting inside the facility disguised as catering staff, with Jax creating a digital diversion while Lena created a fake identity for themselves.

As they made their way to the control room, Peng expertly manipulated the guards, using his knowledge of human psychology to keep them distracted. Zara worked her magic on the security cameras, disabling them just long enough for the team to slip past.

Once inside, it was a cat-and-mouse game between Peng's team and the facility's security forces. But Peng remained calm, using his years of experience to stay one step ahead. Jax hacked into the ventilation system, creating a diversion while Lena snuck into the control room. Meanwhile, Zara worked on disabling the device itself.

As they made their escape with the revolutionary new technology, Peng couldn't help but smile. It was moments like these that reminded him why he had become the Guru - to use his intelligence and cunning to bring justice to those who needed it most.

The team vanished into the night, leaving behind a trail of confusion and chaos. The tech mogul would never know what hit him. But Peng knew that this was just the beginning - for in a world where superpowers reigned supreme, he was content to be the master strategist, always one step ahead of the game.
