One fateful afternoon, a distraught young mother named Sarah burst into the community center, tears streaming down her face. Peng Naoko immediately sensed that something was amiss and ushered Sarah into a quiet room, where she began to listen attentively as Sarah poured out her heart about the struggles of raising two rambunctious toddlers alone.

Peng Naoko's own experiences with her late father, who had been a single parent himself, allowed her to connect with Sarah on a deeper level. She shared stories of her childhood and the challenges she had faced in balancing work and family life. As the afternoon wore on, Sarah began to open up about her own fears and doubts, feeling seen and understood by this stranger-turned-friend.

With tears of gratitude in her eyes, Sarah thanked Peng Naoko for offering a helping hand, assuring her that she was not alone in this journey.
