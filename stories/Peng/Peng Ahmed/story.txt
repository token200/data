Peng Ahmed sat alone in his small, cluttered apartment, staring at the worn photograph on his mantle. The faded image depicted his parents, taken on their wedding day in their homeland of Somalia. He hadn't seen them since he was a child, after they were separated during a brutal civil war.

As he gazed at the picture, memories flooded his mind - laughter, tears, and moments of joy shared with loved ones now lost forever. His eyes drifted to the stack of letters on his coffee table, addressed to him but never sent. Written by an unknown pen pal, they told stories of adventures, dreams, and struggles faced by people across continents.

Determined to break free from the past, Peng opened a journal he had purchased recently. He poured out his thoughts onto its pages - hopes for a better life, frustrations with the world's injustices, and fears of what lay ahead. The words flowed effortlessly as if carried by an unseen force, urging him forward.

The night air outside filtered through the gaps between the windows, carrying whispers of those who came before him. It was then that Peng felt the presence of his ancestors, guiding him toward a brighter future. Their wisdom and resilience stirred something within him – a flame of determination to forge his own path.

Peng's thoughts drifted back to the photograph as he stood up from his chair. He took a deep breath, feeling an unshakeable resolve settle in his chest. He began to walk toward the suitcase by the door, packed with everything he would need for his journey ahead - clothes for a new life, documents for unknown addresses, and letters to be postmarked before they could fade away.

As Peng Ahmed grabbed his backpack, he closed his eyes, embracing the uncertainty that awaited him. The air inside the room changed; the whispers of ancestors quieted. But amidst the stillness, one voice spoke – "Go." It was as if his parents were saying farewell once more.
