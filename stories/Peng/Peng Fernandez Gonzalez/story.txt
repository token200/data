These early influences shaped his artistic voice, which would soon take him on a global journey.

After completing his studies in fine arts, Peng Fernandez Gonzalez set out to explore the world, soaking up inspiration from diverse cultures and landscapes. He traveled to Spain, where he honed his skills in Impressionism; to Mexico, where he immersed himself in the vibrant colors of Frida Kahlo's art; and to Japan, where he discovered the delicate beauty of traditional ukiyo-e woodblock prints.

He began to incorporate elements of Filipino folklore into his work, weaving tales of mythical creatures and legendary heroes. His paintings became more than just visual representations; they were immersive experiences that transported viewers to a world of wonder and enchantment.

One of Peng's most famous works, "Selda ng Katapangan" (The Sword of Courage), told the story of a young warrior who battled fierce dragons and overcame impossible odds. The painting was met with critical acclaim, and soon Peng Fernandez Gonzalez found himself hailed as one of the Philippines' most prominent artists.

Despite his success, Peng remained humble and true to his roots. He continued to create art that celebrated Filipino culture and history, inspiring a new generation of artists and art enthusiasts.
