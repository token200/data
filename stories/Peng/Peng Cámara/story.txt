Born Peng Wei-yen Cámara on a sunny day in April 1995, in the vibrant city of Taipei, Taiwan, she grew up surrounded by the sounds of traditional Taiwanese music, which would later influence her distinctive sound. Peng's love for music began at a young age, when she would watch videos of American folk musicians, mesmerized by their storytelling and emotional delivery.

After completing her studies in music composition, Peng set out to forge her own path as an artist.
