Peng Kozłowski was a name that didn't often cross anyone's lips in polite company. Born to a family of Polish immigrants who had settled in the United States, Peng grew up with a unique blend of cultures and traditions. Despite the awkwardness of their full name, Peng had always felt a strong connection to their heritage.

As a child, Peng would spend hours listening to their grandfather's stories about the old country, where coal mining was an industry staple and pierogi were a national dish. The smell of fried dough wafting from the kitchen would transport Peng back to those carefree days spent playing with friends in the streets of Krakow.

As Peng grew older, they began to feel restless, yearning for something more than the familiar rhythms of their family's life. They applied to art school, much to their parents' dismay – "Who wants to waste their time on 'arts' when there's a steady job to be had?" – but Peng knew that creativity was the spark that would set them free.

In college, Peng discovered a talent for sculpture, their hands moving deftly as they shaped and molded clay into incredible works of art. Their professors were impressed, but it wasn't until Peng exhibited at a local gallery that people began to take notice. The crowd that gathered to admire their pieces was diverse, with people from all walks of life drawn in by the beauty and emotion that Peng had captured on canvas.

Peng's full name often raised eyebrows, but once they'd met, people were won over by their warmth and kindness. They became a beloved fixture in the art community, known for their generosity and willingness to mentor young artists.

Years went by, and Peng's studio became a beacon of creativity, attracting visitors from far and wide. Though their family had always been skeptical of their career choices, they came to see the value in Peng Kozłowski's unique talents, and were proud to call them their own. As Peng looked out over the city, their hands stained with clay and paint, they knew that they'd found their true calling – and that their full name was finally something to be proud of.
