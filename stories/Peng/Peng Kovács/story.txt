Peng Kov√°cs was a man shrouded in mystery. His past was a blank slate, and his face was a map of lines and creases that told the tale of countless battles fought and won. He moved with a quiet confidence, his long strides eating up the distance as he navigated the bustling streets of Budapest.

Few knew much about Peng, but those who did whispered stories of his unparalleled martial arts skills and uncanny ability to sense the emotions of those around him. Some said he was a former member of the Hungarian military, trained in the art of combat from a young age. Others claimed he was a wandering monk, seeking enlightenment through the study of ancient fighting techniques.

One thing was certain: Peng possessed an aura of authority that commanded respect. His piercing green eyes seemed to see right through you, as if sizing up your very soul. He wore his dark hair long and straight, often binding it with a leather strap around his head like a hood.

As the sun began to set over the Danube River, Peng strode into the city's oldest tavern, where a group of rowdy locals had gathered for a night of drinking and games. He swept through the door, his eyes scanning the room until they settled on the player at a solitary table near the fire.

The man was shuffling cards with lightning speed, but lost interest when Peng took a seat beside him. "You play?" Peng asked, his voice like a calm storm.

The stranger hesitated before nodding and handing over his hand of cards. Peng studied them for a moment before folding his own cards into the pot. The two players continued to duel with cards until the night wore on, but when the final score was tallied, it became clear that Peng had been holding back.

As he collected his winnings, Peng offered the stranger a quiet smile. "Your skills are impressive," he said, before turning and disappearing into the shadows like a ghost.
