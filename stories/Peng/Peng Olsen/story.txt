Peng Olsen stepped into the dimly lit tavern, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a private investigator specializing in paranormal cases, he'd seen it all – from ghostly apparitions to demonic possessions.

The patrons fell silent as Peng made his way to the bar, their gazes following him like dark specters. The bartender, a gruff but kind-hearted man named Grimbold, nodded at Peng without looking up.

"What brings you here, Olsen?" Grimbold growled, wiping down the counter with a dirty rag.

Peng slid onto a stool, his eyes locking onto a hooded figure sitting in the corner, nursing a mug of ale. "I'm waiting for someone," he said, his voice low and even.

Grimbold snorted, gesturing to the hooded figure. "You mean Ragnhild? She's been asking about you, Olsen."

Peng nodded, his eyes never leaving the figure. "Tell me more."

Ragnhild pushed back her hood, revealing piercing blue eyes and raven-black hair that cascaded down her back like a waterfall of night. Her skin was deathly pale, as if she'd spent too many years under the pale light of the moon.

"Peng Olsen," she said, her voice husky and hypnotic. "I need your help. I've been having...visions. Dark, twisted visions that feel all too real."

Peng's gut tightened with anticipation. He knew that look – it was the same one he'd seen in the mirror when he gazed upon his own troubled past.

"What kind of visions?" he asked, leaning forward over the counter.

Ragnhild shuddered, her eyes glazing over as if she were reliving a nightmare. "I see my brother's corpse, torn apart by some unseen force. I hear my mother's screams echoing through the halls of our childhood home. And I feel...feeling like I'm being pulled toward something dark and ancient."

Peng's grip on the counter tightened. This was no ordinary haunting – it was something bigger, something that spoke to the very heart of his own existence.

"I'll help you, Ragnhild," he said, a plan already forming in his mind. "But we'll need to be careful. There are those who'd love to get their hands on your...gift."

Ragnhild nodded, her eyes flashing with determination. Together, they would uncover the truth behind her visions – and confront whatever darkness lay waiting for them. The shadows might seem invincible, but Peng Olsen was ready to face whatever terrors lurked within.

As he stood up to leave, Grimbold leaned in close, his voice barely above a whisper. "Be careful, Olsen. Some secrets are better left unspoken."

Peng smiled, a cold glint dancing in his eye. "That's what makes the job so interesting."
