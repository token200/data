Peng Keiko was known for his unyielding dedication to justice. As a renowned detective in Tokyo, he had solved cases that baffled the authorities and left the general public mystified.

One fateful evening, Keiko received a cryptic message from an anonymous source, hinting at the location of a priceless artifact stolen from the Japanese Museum. The note read: "Look to the night sky for answers." Intrigued, Keiko decided to follow the lead.

As he pondered the riddle, he couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off about the message. He recalled an old case involving a mysterious astronomical phenomenon known as "The Starlight Serenade." A peculiar occurrence where a lone astronomer would compose music inspired by celestial events on the night of the summer solstice.

Intrigued, Keiko scheduled a meeting with the reclusive Dr. Akira Matsumoto, who had gone missing years ago during the Solstice night. When he arrived at the old astronomer's residence, he was met with an eerie silence.

Suddenly, a small music box lid opened by itself, revealing a piece of handwritten sheet music. Keiko recognized the melody as "The Starlight Serenade" - only a handful of people in Japan knew its tune. On the page were cryptic symbols and equations that seemed to point towards the artifact's location.

Enthusiastically, Keiko set out to decipher the clues. Following the cryptic instructions, he discovered an underground cave hidden beneath Tokyo's bustling streets. As he descended into darkness, the sound of celestial music echoed through the air.

Inside the cave, he found himself face-to-face with a breathtakingly beautiful nebula projected onto the walls in vibrant hues. The artifact - an intricately carved jade orb - lay on a pedestal at its center. Keiko realized that the thief had been trying to convey a hidden message all along.

With his eyes locked on the jade orb, Keiko detected a faint echo of the music box melody coming from within it. With newfound comprehension, he carefully lifted the artifact and, as if guided by an unseen force, returned it to its rightful place in the Japanese Museum.

As news of Keiko's success spread like wildfire through Tokyo, whispers began circulating about the unassuming detective with a penchant for deciphering the universe's hidden secrets. Though Peng Keiko had cracked this case, he knew there were still countless mysteries waiting to be unraveled beneath Japan's surface - and in the night sky above.
