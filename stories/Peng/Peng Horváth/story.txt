I couldn't find any information on the character Peng Horváth. It is possible that this person or character does not exist in popular culture or media.

However, I can try to write a short story based on a character with a similar name, as there may be a real person named Peng Horváth who inspired the creation of this fictional character.

Please note that this is just an example and not based on any specific information about a person named Peng Horváth. 

Here's a 400-word story about a fictional character Peng Horváth:

In the misty mountains of Transylvania, there lived a mysterious figure known only as Peng Horváth. With skin like alabaster and eyes that shone like stars on a clear night, he was a creature of legend among the villagers.

Few knew much about Peng Horváth, but one thing was certain: he possessed an uncanny ability to communicate with animals. His home, a ramshackle cottage nestled at the foot of a ancient forest, was said to be filled with the songs and whispers of the creatures that lived within its walls.

One winter's eve, a young girl named Sophia stumbled upon Peng Horváth while searching for firewood in the woods. She had heard stories about him from her grandmother, who claimed he could talk to animals as easily as she talked to the village elder.

At first, Sophia was wary of Peng Horváth, but as she watched him tend to a wounded owl perched on his shoulder, she felt an inexplicable sense of calm wash over her. He offered her a warm cup of tea and invited her to sit by the fire, where they spoke long into the night about the secrets of the forest.

As the seasons passed, Sophia returned to Peng Horváth whenever she needed guidance or comfort. She learned that he was an ancient guardian, tasked with protecting the creatures of the forest from harm. And though his powers seemed magical, Peng Horváth's presence was gentle and wise, reminding her that even in a world filled with mystery, there was beauty and wonder waiting just beyond the edge of town.

Years went by and Sophia grew up to be a skilled healer, thanks to the lessons she learned from Peng Horváth. She traveled far and wide, using his knowledge to help animals and humans alike. And whenever her path crossed with that of Peng Horváth, she would smile knowing that even though he was shrouded in mystery, his heart remained as pure as the alabaster skin that covered it.

Though many legends spoke about him and the power he possessed over nature, few truly understood Peng Horváth. But for Sophia, the enigmatic figure became a guardian of hope, and together they roamed the misty mountains, bringing peace to all creatures they met.
