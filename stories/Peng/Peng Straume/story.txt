Peng Straume stood at the edge of the dock, gazing out at the vast expanse of water. The wind whipped through his dark hair, and he pulled his hood tighter over his face. It was a chilly autumn evening, and Peng was not one for idle chit-chat. He had more pressing matters to attend to.

As he scanned the horizon, his eyes landed on a figure approaching from the shore. It was Ragnar, his childhood friend and confidant. Ragnar's rugged features and weathered skin spoke of a life spent working the land and facing its unforgiving elements.

"Peng Straume," Ragnar called out as he drew closer, "what brings you here tonight?"

Peng turned to face him, his eyes narrowing slightly. "I'm waiting for someone," he replied, his voice low and even.

Ragnar nodded, his gaze drifting back out to sea. "And who might that be?" he asked, his tone neutral.

Peng's jaw clenched. He hated being kept in the dark about matters that concerned him. But sometimes, necessity demanded discretion.

"It's a delivery," Peng said finally, turning back to the water. "A package from the East."

Ragnar raised an eyebrow but said nothing more. The silence between them was heavy with unspoken questions and concerns. As they stood there, the stars began to twinkle overhead, casting a mystical glow over the landscape.

Just then, a figure emerged from the darkness, a woman with long, curly hair and a bright smile. "Peng Straume," she said, using his full name as if to reassure herself that she was indeed speaking to him. She extended a hand, and Peng took it, feeling an inexplicable jolt of electricity.

Ragnar watched them exchange a few hushed words before nodding and turning away. As he disappeared into the night, Peng turned back to the woman, his eyes never leaving hers. "Tell me," he said, his voice low and urgent, "what exactly is in that package?"

The woman's smile faltered for a moment before she replied, her voice barely above a whisper, "That, Peng Straume, would be telling."
