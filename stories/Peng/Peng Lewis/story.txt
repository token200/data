Peng Lewis, the greatest detective Sydney had ever known, sat at his desk, staring at the latest case file in front of him. The phone on his desk rang, breaking the silence.

"Peng Lewis Investigations," he said firmly, recognizing the voice on the other end.

"Mr. Lewis, it's Emily Wilson from the police department. We have a high-profile case that requires your expertise."

Peng's ears perked up as he scribbled down some notes on his pad of paper. "What's the situation?"

"It appears that a priceless diamond necklace has been stolen from the Museum of Antiques in the city. The owner is frantic, and we need someone with your unique skills to help us track down the thief."

Peng smiled to himself as he hung up the phone. This was exactly the kind of case he loved - high-stakes, intellectual challenges that required a keen mind and a sharp instinct.

He arrived at the museum an hour later, his eyes scanning the opulent halls for any sign of disturbance. Emily Wilson greeted him warmly and led him to the display case where the necklace had been kept.

As Peng examined the scene, he noticed a small scratch on the glass shelf. "This wasn't done by human hands," he said to Emily, who nodded in agreement.

With his trusty magnifying glass in hand, Peng began his investigation. He interviewed the museum staff and security guards, looking for any inconsistencies in their alibis or behaviors. He studied the security footage, searching for any clues that might have been missed.

Hours passed, with Peng's mind racing as he pieced together the evidence. Finally, he had a breakthrough - a faint smudge of lipstick on the display case handle matched the shade used by Emily's sister, a part-time waitress at a local diner.

Peng called Emily and requested her presence at his office. As she arrived, she looked worried. "Did I inadvertently help steal the necklace?" Peng asked, a hint of amusement in his voice.

Emily shook her head firmly. "No, Mr. Lewis. My sister was hired to steal it by someone else. But why?"

Peng smiled as he revealed his conclusion. "Because, Emily, your sister was trying to frame you for the crime. The thief must have known that no one suspected anyone from a high-end restaurant."

Emily's eyes widened in surprise. "Oh my goodness... I never thought of that!"

With Peng Lewis on the case, justice had been served once again - and this time, with the help of Emily Wilson's sharp instincts and trusty brother.
