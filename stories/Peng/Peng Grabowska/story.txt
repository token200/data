Peng Grabowska was an unlikely hero, known for her peculiar name and even more peculiar habit of collecting antique door knockers. As a child, she would spend hours rummaging through thrift stores, searching for the perfect addition to her collection.

As she grew older, Peng's love of door knockers never faded. She became fascinated with the history behind each one, from the intricate carvings to the subtle design cues that indicated their age and provenance. Her friends would often tease her about her fixation, but Peng didn't care – for her, every door knocker was a tiny work of art.

One day, while exploring a dusty antique shop, Peng stumbled upon an unusual door knocker in the shape of a lion's head. It was covered in moss and had a strange symbol etched into its forehead. Intrigued, Peng purchased the door knocker on the spot and took it home to display proudly.

As she admired her new acquisition, Peng began to experience strange occurrences around her apartment. Doors would slam shut on their own, and the sound of a lion's roar could be heard echoing through the halls at night. At first, she dismissed these events as mere coincidence, but soon, they became more frequent and intense.

It wasn't until one evening, when Peng heard the door knocker in her living room suddenly spring to life, that she realized something was amiss. A low, rumbling voice spoke a single word: "Open."

Peng's heart racing, she slowly turned the handle of her front door. As it swung open, a gust of wind swept through the hallway, extinguishing all the lights and plunging the apartment into darkness.

When the lights flickered back to life, Peng found herself face-to-face with a lion – its mane wild and fiery, its eyes glowing like embers. The creature regarded her calmly before speaking in that same low voice: "Welcome, Peng Grabowska. You have freed me."

Over the next few weeks, Peng discovered that she had been chosen to care for the ancient door knocker, now revealed as a magical artifact from an ancient civilization. As she learned more about its history and magic, Peng realized that her love of door knockers was not just a quirk – it was a key to unlocking secrets she never knew existed.

And so, Peng Grabowska found herself at the center of a strange and wondrous world, where door knockers held secrets and magic lurked around every corner.
