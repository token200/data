Juris Cooper stepped out of the rain and into the warm glow of the coffee shop. She shook her head, sending droplets flying in all directions, as she took a seat by the window. The barista, a friendly young woman with a pierced nose, greeted her with a smile.

"Hi there, Juris! Coffee, or something else to drink?" she asked, her voice a soothing balm for Juris's frazzled nerves.

Juris Cooper took a deep breath and ordered a large coffee, black as the night that had been weighing on her mind lately. As she waited for her drink, she pulled out her phone and began to scroll through emails from various law firms in town. She was still waiting to hear back from a few potential clients, and the silence was starting to get to her.

Just then, the door swung open and a tall, imposing figure strode in. Juris's eyes narrowed as she watched him scan the room, his gaze locking onto hers with an unnerving intensity. She felt a shiver run down her spine as he approached her table.

"Juris Cooper," he said, his deep voice sending a thrill through her veins. "We need to talk."

Juris raised an eyebrow as he sat down across from her, his eyes boring into hers like hot coals. She set her coffee cup down on the table, her hands shaking slightly as she waited for him to speak.

"What is it?" she asked finally, her voice barely above a whisper.

The man leaned in, his face inches from hers. "I have information about your sister," he said, his voice low and menacing. "Information that could put you in grave danger."

Juris's eyes widened as she felt a wave of fear wash over her. Who was this stranger, and what did he want? She pushed her chair back, her heart racing with anticipation.

"Tell me," she said, her voice firm despite the trembling of her hands.

The man smiled, his lips curling up in a cold smile. "We'll get to that soon enough, Juris Cooper," he said, his eyes glinting in the dim light of the coffee shop.
