Juris Lin sat in his small, cluttered office, staring blankly at the computer screen in front of him. As one of the top detectives in the Singapore Police Force, he had seen it all - from petty thefts to high-profile murders. But despite his impressive credentials, Juris couldn't shake off the feeling that something was missing.

Just as he was about to give up for the day, there was a knock at the door. It was his partner, Detective Rachel Tan. "What's up?" Juris asked, already knowing the answer.

"I've got a case for you," she said, flashing her bright smile. "Rich businessman found dead in his mansion. No signs of forced entry or struggle. Just...poisoned."

Juris raised an eyebrow. This sounded like a job for him. He and Rachel headed to the scene, where they met with the victim's family and started investigating.

As they dug deeper, Juris discovered that the victim was involved in some shady business dealings. There were whispers of embezzlement and money laundering. But Juris wasn't convinced - this didn't feel like a simple murder for gain.

After days of tireless work, Juris finally got his break. He found a small piece of fabric caught in the victim's door handle. It matched the material of Rachel's jacket. She had been to the crime scene earlier that day, but claimed she hadn't touched anything.

Juris was torn. On one hand, he trusted Rachel with his life. But on the other hand, this was a murder investigation, and loyalty couldn't cloud his judgment. He decided to bring her in for questioning.

As they sat down in the interrogation room, Juris couldn't help but notice that Rachel seemed...nervous. She denied any involvement, but Juris could see the faintest hint of guilt behind her eyes.

"I think we need to take a closer look at our witnesses," Juris said, his voice calm and collected. "Let's go back through their statements and see if anyone has an alibi for that time."

Rachel nodded, still looking shaken. For the first time in years, Juris felt like he was in over his head. He trusted Rachel with his life, but now she seemed to be hiding something from him.

As they left the interrogation room, Juris couldn't shake off the feeling that this case was going to be more complicated than he thought. And he knew that his trust in Rachel might just be tested to its limits.
