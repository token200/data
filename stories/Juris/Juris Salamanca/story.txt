Juris Salamanca, the infamous crime lord from the world of Breaking Bad, sat in his luxurious office, surrounded by the finest art and antiques. His piercing eyes scanned the room, taking in every detail, as he contemplated his next move.

It had been years since his last major scheme went awry, with Jesse Pinkman's betrayal still fresh in his mind. But Juris was a master of survival, always adapting to new circumstances. He had built his empire from scratch, one deal at a time, and no one knew his game better than himself.

As he pondered his next step, the phone on his desk rang, breaking the silence. "Salamanca," he replied, his deep voice commanding attention.

"Juris, we have a problem," said the voice on the other end. It was his trusted lieutenant, Mike Ehrmantraut. "There's been a mole within our organization, feeding intel to the DEA."

Juris's expression remained impassive, but his mind began racing with possibilities. Who could be working against him? He had thought he had built trust throughout his ranks.

The line went silent for a moment as Juris digested the information. "Find out who it is," he commanded finally. "And make them regret ever crossing me."

Mike acknowledged the order and hung up, leaving Juris to contemplate the implications. A mole within his own ranks was a betrayal of the highest order. It was a risk he couldn't afford to take.

Juris decided to act quickly, assembling a team of his most trusted agents to root out the traitor. He would not let this threat stand in his way. As they set out to gather evidence and track down the mole, Juris's eyes narrowed further, plotting every move, anticipating every step.

In the world of crime, loyalty was a luxury he couldn't afford. Survival was all that mattered, and Juris Salamanca would stop at nothing to protect himself and his empire.

As the night wore on, Juris made one call, a voice message left for the mole: "You have two options. Cooperate with us, or suffer the consequences. The choice is yours." He sat back in his chair, a cold smile spreading across his face. In this game of cat and mouse, he was always the predator.

Juris Salamanca was a master of deception, but in this case, he knew the truth would be revealed soon enough.
