Juris Eglītis stood atop the wind-swept hill, gazing out at the vast expanse of Riga's cityscape. The snow-capped rooftops and spires of the medieval buildings sparkled like diamonds in the fading light of day. As a historian and folklorist, Juris had always been drawn to the stories of his ancestors, who had lived through centuries of war, famine, and revolution.

As he breathed in the crisp air, Juris felt a sense of pride and connection to his heritage. His full name, Juris Eglītis, was etched on the family crest that hung proudly above the hearth in his small apartment. It was a symbol of tradition and continuity, a reminder of the many generations who had come before him.

Juris's thoughts turned to his own life's work, which had been centered around uncovering the secrets of Latvian folklore. He had spent years pouring over dusty tomes and crumbling manuscripts, searching for clues about the myths and legends that had once been passed down through oral tradition. His latest discovery was a particularly exciting one – an ancient text that spoke of a powerful sorceress who had lived in these very hills centuries ago.

As he pondered the significance of this find, Juris felt a presence behind him. He turned to see his colleague and friend, Elīna, standing at the edge of the hill. She was a talented linguist, and had been instrumental in helping Juris decipher the cryptic language of the ancient text.

"What have you made of it?" she asked, her eyes shining with curiosity.

Juris smiled, feeling a sense of camaraderie with his colleague. "I think we may be onto something big," he said. "The sorceress's name is... well, it's what my ancestors called me."

Elīna's eyebrows shot up in surprise. "Really?" she asked. "And what did they call you?"

Juris chuckled. "They called me Juris Eglītis – the keeper of the old ways."
