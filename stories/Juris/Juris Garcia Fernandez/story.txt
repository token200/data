Juris Garcia Fernandez stepped into the small, dimly lit bar, scanning the room with a discerning eye. As a private investigator specializing in cases involving espionage and counter-intelligence, she had seen her fair share of shady characters. But there was something about this place that drew her in.

She spotted a familiar face across the room - Victor Martinez, a former CIA operative turned rogue agent. Their history was complicated, to say the least. Once partners in a high-stakes game of cat and mouse, they had found themselves on opposite sides of the law. Now, as Juris sipped her whiskey, she wondered if he was here for a clandestine meeting.

A tall, lean figure with piercing blue eyes slid onto the stool beside her, ordering a drink without a word. Juris didn't flinch, accustomed to reading people like a book. Victor's gaze locked onto hers, and for an instant, they were back in the trenches, fighting for survival.

"Juris," he said finally, his voice low and smooth. "I hear you're looking for work."

She raised an eyebrow. "That's what I get paid for, Vic. What do you want?"

Victor leaned in, his eyes never leaving hers. "I have a job that requires... delicacy. Discretion. And someone with your particular set of skills."

Juris snorted, running a hand through her dark hair. "You know I'm not just some pawn in your game anymore, Victor. What's the real pitch?"

He flashed a disarming smile. "Let's just say it involves international intrigue, ancient artifacts, and people who would kill to get their hands on them. Are you interested?"

Juris hesitated for a fraction of a second before nodding. She knew better than to trust Victor completely, but she had a feeling that this case was going to be worth taking the risk.

"Tell me more," she said, her voice firm and commanding.

Victor leaned back in his chair, a look of satisfaction spreading across his face. "Ah, Juris Garcia Fernandez. Always a pleasure working with you."
