Juris Rosen was a man of few words, but his actions spoke volumes. A retired detective with over two decades of experience, he had seen it all - from the darkest alleys to the highest echelons of power. His no-nonsense approach to crime-solving had earned him respect and fear in equal measure.

As he sat in his cozy living room, surrounded by mementos from a lifetime of service, Juris couldn't help but reflect on the cases that still haunted him. There was the infamous 'Ghost Killer' serial murderer, whose identity Juris had never quite shaken off. And then there was the high-profile embezzlement case that had almost landed him in hot water.

Juris's mind wandered to his old partner, Detective Maria Rodriguez, with whom he had shared countless late-night conversations and adrenaline-fueled stakeouts. They had worked together like two sides of the same coin, each one complementing the other's strengths and weaknesses. After all those years, Juris still couldn't help but feel a pang of regret that their partnership had never led to anything more.

Just then, his phone rang, shrill and insistent. It was an old acquaintance from the department, someone who knew Juris well enough to know when not to bother him with trivial matters. The conversation was brief, but it left Juris feeling a little more connected to the world outside his comfort zone.

As he hung up the phone, Juris's eyes drifted back to the photograph on his mantle - a picture of himself and Maria, taken at their retirement party, beaming with pride as they accepted a well-deserved commendation. It was one of those moments that made you feel like you were walking on air, like nothing could ever bring you down.

Juris's gaze lingered on the photo for a moment longer before he got up and put it away, lost in thought once more. His mind began to wander down dark alleys again, but this time, it was with a sense of peace, knowing that some wounds would never fully heal, but others could be left to slowly fade like embers dying out.
