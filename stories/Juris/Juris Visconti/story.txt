As a young man, Juris had shown a keen eye for politics and a talent for manipulation, earning him the respect and fear of his peers.

Despite his formidable reputation, Juris was not without his vulnerabilities. A tragic accident in his youth had left him with a permanently scarred face, a constant reminder of his mortality. This physical imperfection seemed to have made him even more determined to succeed, to prove that he was more than the sum of his parts.

As he rose through the ranks of Milanese society, Juris Visconti became increasingly entangled in the city's intricate web of alliances and rivalries. He played the part of the loyal subject perfectly, always presenting a mask of deference to those who held power over him. But behind closed doors, Juris was a man with a hidden agenda, scheming and plotting to further his own ambitions.

One fateful evening, Juris Visconti found himself in a private meeting with the Duke of Milan himself. The duke, impressed by Juris's cunning and strategic mind, offered him a position as his trusted advisor. Overjoyed at this new opportunity, Juris accepted without hesitation, eager to prove himself as a worthy ally.

As the days passed, Juris Visconti proved to be an invaluable asset to the duke, providing counsel on matters of state and war. His reputation grew exponentially, earning him the respect of his peers and the admiration of those who had once feared him. And though he still walked with a scarred face, Juris knew that it was no longer a liability but a reminder of his strength and resilience.

Juris Visconti's journey from obscurity to power had been long and arduous, but in the end, it had made him the master of his own destiny. He knew that as long as he remained cunning, ruthless, and adaptable, there would be no stopping him from achieving greatness.
