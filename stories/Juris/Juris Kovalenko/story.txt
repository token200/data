Juris Kovalenko stepped into the dimly lit bar, his eyes scanning the room with a practiced intensity. As a former Spetsnaz operative turned private investigator, he had seen it all - from high-stakes espionage to low-level corruption. The bartender, a gruff old man with a thick beard, nodded at him as he slid onto a stool.

"Vodka, neat," Juris said, his voice firm and detached.

The bartender obliged, sliding a glass down the bar to him. Juris tossed back the vodka in one swift motion, his eyes never leaving the room.

He had been hired by a wealthy businessman with a problem - a missing girlfriend who was last seen heading into the city's seedy underbelly. The businessman suspected foul play, but needed proof before he could take action.

Juris's phone buzzed on the bar, shrill in the silence. He picked it up, his eyes flicking to the screen as he listened for a moment before responding.

"Alright, I'll meet you at the Red Diamond tonight," he said, tucking the phone back into its holster.

As he downed another shot of vodka, Juris's mind began to work overtime. He had a reputation for being one of the best in the business - for being able to extract information from even the most reluctant sources. But this case was different. Something about it didn't sit right with him.

He finished his drink and slid off the stool, making his way out into the night air. The city streets were always alive at night, but tonight they seemed particularly raw and unforgiving.

Juris lit a cigarette, taking a long drag as he walked through the crowded streets. He knew every alleyway, every backstreet, every hidden spot in this city - all of it had a story to tell.

And so did his missing girlfriend.

As he turned onto Red Diamond Street, Juris's eyes locked onto a figure waiting for him on the corner. She was dressed in a tight red dress, her hair slicked back and her eyes flashing with fear.

"I knew you'd come," she said, as Juris approached her.

Juris took her hand, his grip firm but gentle. "What happened?" he asked, his voice softening ever so slightly.

The girl's eyes darted around the street before settling on his face. "He didn't want me to leave," she whispered. "But I had to get out."

Juris nodded grimly, his mind racing with possibilities. This was just the beginning - and he knew that whatever lay ahead would be a fight for survival.
