Juris Nowakowski adjusted his thick-rimmed glasses and leaned back in his worn leather armchair, surveying the cluttered room with a critical eye. As a professor of folklore at the University of Latvia, he had spent countless hours collecting and studying tales from the country's rich cultural heritage.

His eyes landed on a dusty shelf lined with volumes of 19th-century Latvian folk songs, accompanied by intricate woodcut illustrations. Juris's own research into these songs had been met with skepticism by some colleagues, but he was convinced that they held secrets to understanding the nation's identity.

Suddenly, his phone buzzed with an incoming message from his colleague, Dr. Krišjānis Krumins. "Juris, I need your expertise on a new folk song I came across," it read. The message included a hastily transcribed version of the lyrics, accompanied by a sketch of a mysterious figure in traditional Latvian dress.

Juris's curiosity was piqued. He quickly got up and began to pace around his office, running through possible interpretations. As he walked, his mind conjured images of forest spirits, ancient rituals, and hidden meanings encoded within the song's melody.

He made his way back to his desk, pulled out a piece of paper, and began to scribble notes in hasty handwriting. "Moonlit procession," he wrote. "Water witches." The phrase 'Mūzaņu lietāba' - the Moon Goddess's invocation - flashed into his mind. This was it – this song had to be connected to a long-forgotten myth or legend.

With newfound enthusiasm, Juris dived back into the world of folk songs and mythology. Hours passed as he pored over ancient texts, consulted with local musicians, and even ventured out into the streets of Riga at midnight, searching for any hint of connection between the song and its possible origins.

As dawn broke, Juris leaned forward, his eyes shining with a mix of excitement and determination. "This is it," he whispered to himself. "I have cracked the code." The mysterious figure in traditional dress seemed to materialize before him, like a ghost from the shadows. He knew that this song was more than just an old tune – it held the key to understanding Latvia's hidden past, and his place within it.
