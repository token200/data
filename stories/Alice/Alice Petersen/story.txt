Alice Petersen, a brilliant and feisty journalist, sat at her desk, sipping her lukewarm coffee as she poured over the latest police reports. Her sharp mind was always on high alert, searching for clues that could crack the toughest of cases. With years of experience under her belt, Alice had built a reputation as one of the most tenacious and respected reporters in the city.

One case, however, had been plaguing her for weeks – the disappearance of 25-year-old Sarah Johnson, whose body was found floating in the river just outside of town. The lack of leads and witnesses had stumped even the most seasoned detectives, but Alice was determined to uncover the truth.

As she delved deeper into the investigation, Alice's eyes scanned the pages of her notebook, filled with scribbled notes and theories. She had interviewed Sarah's family, friends, and acquaintances, but every lead seemed to end in a dead-end. It was as if Sarah had vanished into thin air.

Just then, Alice's phone rang, breaking the silence. "Hello?" she answered, her voice crisp and confident. On the other end was Detective James, who briefed her on the latest development – a security camera caught a glimpse of someone lurking around Sarah's apartment building on the night of her disappearance.

Alice's ears perked up as she scribbled down every detail in her notebook. "What can you tell me about this person?" she asked, her mind racing with possibilities. James hesitated before answering, "We're not sure yet, but we're working on enhancing the footage."

Alice's determination spiked. This was it – the break she had been waiting for. She thanked Detective James and hung up, her eyes locked onto a single sentence in her notebook: "Find Sarah Johnson." The words seemed to leap off the page, echoing in her mind as she rose from her chair, ready to take on the next step in the investigation. With Alice Petersen on the case, justice would soon be served.
