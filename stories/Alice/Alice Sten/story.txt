Alice Sten was a name whispered in hushed tones among the literary circles of Copenhagen. A reclusive writer, she had been producing novels that defied explanation – tales of forgotten memories and the labyrinthine corridors of the human psyche.

Her most recent book, "The Echoes of Winter," had generated a mixture of awe and unease from critics. Some praised her lyrical prose, while others found it unsettlingly bleak. But one thing was certain: Alice Sten's work spoke directly to those who dwelled in the shadows of their own minds.

Alice herself remained elusive, rarely giving interviews or making public appearances. Those who claimed to know her described a woman with an enigmatic smile and eyes that seemed to hold the weight of the world. Her writing process was shrouded in mystery, as if she conjured entire worlds from the ether itself.

I had been tasked with interviewing Alice for our magazine, but I knew it would be futile. She rarely granted access, and those who did often reported feeling disoriented by her presence. The words of another writer – a friend, not an acquaintance – echoed in my mind: "Alice Sten is like the echoes themselves: they come to haunt you when you least expect it."

The day of the interview arrived, and I stood outside Alice's modest Copenhagen apartment, trying to calm the butterflies in my stomach. A sudden gust swept through the hallway, extinguishing the lone candle that cast a warm glow on the landing. The sound was like a sigh from the void itself.

I entered the apartment, where a haze of incense and silence enveloped me. Alice sat by the window, her eyes half-lidded as if lost in thought. I approached cautiously, sensing the unspoken boundaries around us. We began to talk – about books, ideas, and life's labyrinthine paths.

The hours flew by like snowflakes on a winter's day. As we parted ways, Alice handed me a small package wrapped in worn paper. Inside lay a single sheet of typed text: "In the crevices of time, I find myself waiting for you."
