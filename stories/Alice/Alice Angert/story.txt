One rainy afternoon, a distraught woman walked into Alice Angert's workshop, clutching a stuffed rabbit she had received as a gift from her late husband. Overwhelmed by grief, the woman couldn't bear the thought of parting with the beloved toy, fearing it would leave an empty space in their home. Alice Angert listened attentively, nodding sympathetically as the woman poured out her story.

With gentle hands, she carefully mounted the rabbit onto a wooden base, infusing each movement with love and care. As the finished piece took shape, the room filled with a sense of hope and new beginnings. The woman's eyes welled up with tears as Alice Angert handed her the completed work, saying, "This is not goodbye, it's a memory to hold onto."

In her workshop, surrounded by life-sized deer heads and intricately crafted bird mounts, Alice Angert smiled knowingly. She had taken something beautiful – life – and turned it into something eternal – art.
