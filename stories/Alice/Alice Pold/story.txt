Alice Pold had always been fascinated by the abandoned carnival on the outskirts of town. Rumors swirled that it was cursed, but Alice didn't believe in such superstitions. She spent countless hours exploring the rickety booths and rusty Ferris wheel, imagining what it must have been like to attend a lively festival under its bright lights.

One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Alice decided to sneak into the carnival once more. This time, she brought her camera, determined to capture some proof of its eerie beauty. As she wandered through the empty grounds, her footsteps echoed off the dilapidated buildings. The air was heavy with the scent of decay and neglect.

Alice's eyes landed on a worn-out sign that read "Pold's Palace of Wonder" in faded letters. It was a name she recognized - her great-grandfather, Henry Pold, had founded this very carnival many years ago. Alice felt a shiver run down her spine as she gazed upon the relic. She couldn't help but wonder what stories its walls must hold.

As she delved deeper into the carnival, Alice stumbled upon an old ticket booth, still adorned with dusty signs and faded advertisements. She carefully removed the glass pane, revealing a hidden compartment beneath. Inside, she found a trove of yellowed photographs, Polaroids of people laughing and smiling amidst the colorful chaos of Pold's Palace.

Alice spent hours pouring over the pictures, lost in the stories they told. She saw her great-grandfather standing proudly beside a gleaming rollercoaster, his eyes shining with excitement. She saw children playing tag around a rickety merry-go-round, their faces aglow with delight. And she saw couples strolling hand-in-hand beneath a twinkling starry sky.

As the night wore on, Alice reluctantly gathered her belongings and left the carnival behind. Though it was dark and deserted now, she knew that Pold's Palace of Wonder would forever hold a special place in her heart. She vowed to share its secrets with the world, to ensure that this forgotten piece of history would never be lost again.
