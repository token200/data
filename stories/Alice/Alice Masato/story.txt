Alice Masato had always been fascinated by the world of science fiction. As a child, she spent hours devouring books and watching movies in this genre, dreaming of adventure and possibility. Now, as a young adult, she was determined to make a career out of her passion.

After completing her degree in physics, Alice landed a job at a top-secret research facility on the outskirts of the city. Her specialty was in advanced propulsion systems, and she was thrilled to be working alongside some of the brightest minds in the field.

But despite her success, Alice couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. She felt restless, like there was more to life than the humdrum routine of her job. That was when she received an unexpected email from a mysterious organization, inviting her to join their team on a top-secret mission.
