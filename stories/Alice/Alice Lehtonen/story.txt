Alice Lehtonen had always been fascinated by the world of mystery and detective work. Growing up in Helsinki, Finland, she spent countless hours poring over Sherlock Holmes stories and watching detective shows with her father. It wasn't long before she decided to follow in their footsteps and pursue a career in law enforcement.

After completing her studies at the University of Helsinki, Alice landed an internship at the Helsinki Police Department, where she quickly proved herself to be a valuable asset to the team. Her sharp mind and keen observational skills made her a natural fit for the job, and she soon found herself assigned to some of the department's most high-profile cases.

One day, Alice received a call from the chief inspector, requesting her presence at a crime scene in the upscale neighborhood of Katajanokka. Upon arrival, she was greeted by a gruesome sight: the body of a wealthy businessman lay on the ground, a victim of murder.

Alice began to survey the area, taking note of every detail, no matter how small. She spotted a piece of torn fabric caught in a nearby bush and carefully collected it as evidence. As she continued her examination, she noticed a suspicious letter opener lying near the victim's hand. The symbol etched onto its blade seemed eerily familiar.

Back at the police station, Alice pored over her notes and compared them to the business owner's background. She discovered that the victim had been involved in some shady dealings, including a high-stakes real estate deal gone sour. It was then that she made the connection: the letter opener belonged to none other than the victim's business partner.

Arresting the partner on the spot, Alice secured his confession and helped bring closure to the victim's family. The case was closed, but for Alice Lehtonen, it marked just the beginning of her illustrious career as a detective. With her exceptional skills and unwavering dedication, she would go on to solve some of Helsinki's most baffling crimes, earning her reputation as one of the city's top detectives.
