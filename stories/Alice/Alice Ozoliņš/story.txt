Alice Ozoliņš stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the quaint station for any sign of life. As she made her way through the deserted streets, a sense of unease settled in the pit of her stomach. It had been months since she'd received the letter from her estranged father, inviting her to return to her hometown in Latvia.

Alice Ozoliņš had always felt like an outsider in her own family. Her father's departure when she was just a child had left a gaping hole in her life, one that she'd never quite filled. But something about the letter had stirred up old emotions, and she found herself packing her bags and boarding the train to Riga.

As she walked through the city, Alice Ozoliņš felt like a ghost haunting her own memories. The streets seemed narrower and darker than she remembered, and the people passing by looked at her with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. She couldn't blame them – she was a stranger in her own skin, a foreigner in a land that was both familiar and strange.

Despite the initial unease, Alice Ozoliņš found herself becoming lost in the rhythms of Riga. She spent hours wandering through the Old Town, taking in the Gothic spires and Baroque fountains. She visited her childhood home, now abandoned and crumbling, but still holding secrets of its own. And she met people – old friends, new acquaintances, and even a few who seemed to see right through her.

For the first time in years, Alice Ozoliņš felt like herself again. The letter from her father had been a catalyst for change, a nudge that had set her on a path of rediscovery. As she sat on a bench overlooking the Daugava River, watching the sun set behind the city's skeletal skyscrapers, she knew that she would never be the same outsider again. She was finally finding her way back home.
