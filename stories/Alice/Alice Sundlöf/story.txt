Alice Sundlöf stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the deserted station. The sun had long since set, casting a dim orange glow over the small town of Ravenswood. As she collected her luggage, Alice couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. She had been looking forward to this trip for months, but now that she was finally here, she wasn't so sure.

Alice Sundlöf, a renowned journalist, had always been drawn to the unknown and the unexplained. Her latest assignment had brought her to Ravenswood, where rumors of paranormal activity had long been circulating. Alice was determined to get to the bottom of it all, but as she made her way through the quiet streets, she couldn't help but feel like an outsider.

Her first stop was the local inn, where she hoped to gather some information from the townsfolk. The proprietor, a friendly woman named Agnes, welcomed Alice with a warm smile and offered her a room for the night. As they chatted over dinner, Alice mentioned her investigation, and Agnes's expression turned serious.

"I've heard stories about strange happenings in Ravenswood," Agnes said, glancing around the empty dining room. "Some folks say it's cursed, while others claim to have seen ghostly apparitions. But I don't know if any of that is true."

Alice Sundlöf leaned forward, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. "Do you know anyone who might be able to shed some light on this?"

Agnes nodded, pulling out a small notebook from beneath the counter. "There's an old man who lives just outside town," she said. "He's said to have knowledge of the supernatural. But be warned, he's not one for strangers."

Alice thanked Agnes and set off into the darkness, her heart pounding with excitement. She followed the winding road that led out of town, the trees growing taller and the air thickening with an eerie energy.

As she approached the old man's cabin, Alice could feel a strange presence watching her from the shadows. She took a deep breath and knocked on the door, ready to face whatever lay within.
