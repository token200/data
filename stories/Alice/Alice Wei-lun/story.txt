Alice Wei-lun had always been fascinated by the world of mythology and folklore. As a child, she spent hours poring over dusty old books in her grandfather's antique shop, devouring tales of magical creatures and legendary heroes. Her love of these stories only grew stronger as she entered adulthood, leading her to pursue a degree in mythology and folklore.

After completing her studies, Alice Wei-lun landed a job at a prestigious museum, where she was tasked with curating exhibits on the world's most fascinating myths. She threw herself into her work, determined to bring these ancient tales to life for audiences around the world.

One day, while researching a particularly obscure myth from Eastern Europe, Alice Wei-lun stumbled upon a mysterious artifact that had been passed down through generations of her family. The small, ornate box was adorned with strange symbols and markings that seemed to shimmer in the light.

As soon as she touched the box, Alice Wei-lun felt a sudden jolt of energy course through her body. She was flooded with visions of ancient forests, mythical creatures, and forgotten deities. It was as if the box had unlocked a doorway to another world, one where the boundaries between reality and myth blurred.

Over the next few weeks, Alice Wei-lun found herself becoming increasingly obsessed with the box and its secrets. She spent every spare moment studying it, trying to decipher the symbols etched into its surface. And then, one night, she finally uncovered the box's greatest secret: a hidden compartment containing a note written by her own great-grandmother.

The note revealed that Alice Wei-lun's family had been guardians of the mythological realm for generations, tasked with keeping the balance between the worlds of magic and reality. It was a weighty responsibility, one that Alice Wei-lun felt both honored and intimidated to bear. As she gazed at the box, now glowing with an otherworldly light, she knew that her life would never be the same again.
