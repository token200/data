Alice Eglītis stepped into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the crowded room for a familiar face. As she made her way through the throng of patrons, the soft hum of conversation and clinking cups provided a comforting background noise.

A native of Riga, Latvia, Alice had always been drawn to the vibrant artistic scene that thrived in the city's cultural heart. She was an avid painter herself, known for her bold brushstrokes and vivid depictions of Latvian landscapes.

Tonight, however, Alice wasn't here to paint or indulge in her love of art. She had received a cryptic message from an old acquaintance, inviting her to meet at this very café. The note had been brief and mysterious, but the curiosity that lingered within her had finally proven too great to ignore.

As she waited for her contact to arrive, Alice's gaze roamed over the eclectic assortment of patrons. A young musician on the verge of stardom sat huddled in a corner, fingers moving deftly across his instrument; an elderly couple laughed and whispered secrets as they clinked tea cups together.

Just as Alice was beginning to feel like she'd been standing for hours, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was Markēts, her old friend and fellow artist. The two had grown up exploring the Latvian wilderness, sharing stories of myth and magic that lingered long after they left childhood behind.

"Markēts," Alice said, her voice soft with warmth as she slid into a chair beside him.

"I see you've received my message," he replied with a wry smile. "I suppose I had to make sure the place wasn't overrun by ghosts before I could find you."

Alice laughed and shook her head, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "Only you, Markēts, would think of inviting me on a ghost hunt."

Together they sipped their coffee, catching up on each other's lives as the night wore on. It was a meeting long overdue – one that promised to reconnect old bonds and spark new creative endeavors.

In this small café, surrounded by strangers yet somehow connected through shared passions and memories, Alice Eglītis felt at home.
