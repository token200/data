Alice Zieliński stepped off the train and onto the platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station. As a detective with the Warsaw Police Department, she had seen it all - from petty theft to high-stakes corruption. But there was something about this case that had caught her attention.

A wealthy businessman, Marek Kowalski, had been found dead in his mansion on the outskirts of the city. The police were stumped, and the family was demanding answers. Alice's boss had given her the case, hoping that her sharp instincts would lead her to the killer.

As she made her way through the crowd, Alice's mind worked overtime. She thought about Marek Kowalski, a man who had made his fortune in real estate and had a reputation for being ruthless in business. He was also known to have many enemies, both personal and professional.

Alice Zieliński arrived at the mansion, where she met with Marek's wife, Barbara. The woman was distraught, but Alice could see a hint of something else beneath her tears - guilt. She asked Barbara about the events leading up to Marek's death, but the woman seemed evasive.

Undeterred, Alice began to search the mansion, looking for any clues that might lead her to the killer. In one of the bedrooms, she found a piece of paper with a cryptic message scrawled on it: "You'll never find me." She tucked the note into her pocket, a spark of determination igniting within her.

As she continued her investigation, Alice discovered that Marek Kowalski had many secrets. He was involved in some shady dealings, and there were several people who stood to gain from his death. But none of it seemed quite right, like something was off.

Alice Zieliński sat at her desk, staring at the evidence in front of her. She knew that she had to piece together the puzzle, but it wasn't going to be easy. The case was complex, and the players were all too skilled at deception. Still, Alice was determined to uncover the truth. She would follow every lead, no matter how small or unlikely.

With a fierce determination burning within her, Alice Zieliński set out to solve the mystery of Marek Kowalski's death.
