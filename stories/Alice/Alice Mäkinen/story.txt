Alice Mäkinen sat alone at the small café, sipping her cold coffee and staring out the window. It was a grey and rainy day in Helsinki, the kind of day that made you want to stay inside with a good book and a warm cup of tea.

But Alice wasn't one for comfort. She was a wanderer, always on the move, always searching for something more. As she sat there, lost in thought, her mind began to wander back to her past. Growing up in the small town of Kauniainen, she had always felt like an outsider. Her Finnish parents had immigrated to the States when she was a child, and Alice had grown up caught between two cultures.

She had tried to fit in, of course. She had joined the school choir, taken art classes, and even started dating a boy from her hometown. But it hadn't been enough. She felt like a ghost, invisible and irrelevant.

So she had set out on her own, traveling the world and trying new things. She had worked as a waitress in Paris, a barista in Tokyo, and a freelance writer in New York. And through it all, she had kept moving, never staying in one place for too long.

But now, at 25 years old, Alice was starting to feel restless again. She had been on the road for months, taking odd jobs and working odd hours just to make ends meet. It wasn't the life she wanted, but it was all she knew.

As she sat at the café, lost in thought, a woman with bright pink hair walked by outside. Alice watched her go, feeling a pang of envy. She had always wanted to be that kind of person, free and wild and untamed. But as she looked back out the window, she saw something else. A glimpse of herself, standing on the edge of the world, looking out at the vast expanse of nothingness.

For the first time in months, Alice felt a spark of excitement. Maybe it was time to stop running, and start facing whatever lay ahead. She took a deep breath, set her coffee cup down, and stood up, ready to take on the world once again.
