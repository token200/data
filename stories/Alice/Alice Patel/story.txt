Alice Patel walked into the dimly lit café, her eyes scanning the room for any sign of her friend. She had been searching for her all morning, and was starting to get worried. As she made her way to the counter, a familiar face caught her attention.

"Hey, Alice! Long time no see!" exclaimed Rohan, a fellow student from their art class.

Alice smiled, relieved to have found her friend. "Rohan! I was starting to think you'd disappeared on me." She ordered a cup of coffee and joined him at the table.

As they sipped their drinks, Rohan filled Alice in on his latest project. "I'm working on a painting series about urban decay," he explained. "It's really taking shape."

Alice listened intently, admiring her friend's talent. She had always been drawn to Rohan's art, and was impressed by his skill with capturing the gritty realism of city life.

Just then, their art professor walked in, a look of excitement on her face. "I've got some news for you all," she announced. "The annual art show is coming up soon, and we're looking for submissions from our students."

Alice's heart skipped a beat as she considered the possibility of showcasing her own work. She had been working on a series of photographs that explored themes of identity and belonging.

As they chatted with their professor, Alice couldn't help but think about how far she'd come since joining the art program at school. From struggling to find inspiration, to creating pieces that truly represented her voice – it was a journey worth celebrating.

Rohan noticed her distraction and leaned in, concerned. "Hey, are you okay? You seem a little lost in thought."

Alice shook her head, focusing on the present moment. "I'm just excited about the art show," she admitted. "And thinking about all the people who have supported me along the way – like my family, who encouraged me to pursue my passion."

Rohan smiled, his eyes lighting up with understanding. "You're going to crush it at that show, Alice Patel. I can feel it."
