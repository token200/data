Alice Krumina stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, her eyes scanning the bustling station for any sign of the address she had written down on her map. She had been searching for this small town in the countryside for weeks, ever since she received a letter from an old acquaintance with only one clue: "Follow the sun to find me."

Alice Krumina had always been drawn to the mysterious and unknown, and this journey was no exception. As a renowned detective specializing in cases involving the supernatural, she had seen her fair share of bizarre occurrences, but there was something about this case that piqued her interest.

She hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address, watching as the sun dipped below the horizon behind them. The taxi wound its way through the rolling hills and quaint villages, finally arriving at a small cottage nestled among the trees.

Alice Krumina paid the driver and stepped out of the cab, gazing up at the cozy cottage with its smoke curling from the chimney. She took a deep breath, feeling a thrill of excitement course through her veins. This was it – the moment she had been waiting for.

She knocked on the door, and after a brief pause, it creaked open to reveal an elderly woman with kind eyes and a warm smile. "Welcome, Alice Krumina," she said, beckoning her inside. "I've been expecting you."

Alice Krumina followed the woman into the cottage, taking in the warm atmosphere and the scent of baking bread wafting from the kitchen. She sat down at the table, feeling a sense of relief wash over her as she realized that this was just the beginning of a journey that would uncover secrets she never could have imagined.

Over tea and biscuits, the old woman told Alice Krumina stories of the town's history and the mysterious forces that lurked in its shadows. As they spoke, the darkness outside seemed to recede, replaced by an air of trust and companionship. For Alice Krumina, this was just the start of a new adventure – one that would lead her down paths she had never dared to tread before.
