As a child, Michał would spend hours watching old films about Verdi, the renowned Italian composer. He was fascinated by the way Verdi could evoke emotions through his music and strive to emulate that skill in his own compositions.

Excited by the opportunity, he threw himself into the project, pouring all his energy and creativity into the music. As the days turned into weeks, Michał's composition began to take shape, with each note and melody seeming to come alive.

Finally, the night of the premiere arrived, and Michał's heart swelled with pride as he watched the curtain rise on his opera.
