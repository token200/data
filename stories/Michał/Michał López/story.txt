Michał López sat alone at the small café, nursing his lukewarm coffee. It had been five years since he'd left Poland, and yet the pain still lingered. His parents' tragic car accident on the way to visit him had left a gaping hole in his life.

As he stared out the rain-soaked window, memories flooded his mind. He remembered the vibrant streets of Krakow, the taste of his mother's pierogi, and the smell of his father's pipe tobacco. Tears pricked at the corners of his eyes as he thought about the countless moments they'd shared, the laughter, and the arguments.

Michał took a deep breath, forcing himself to shake off the emotions that had been building inside him for so long. He needed to move on, to focus on the future. That's what his therapist had told him, after all. But how could he move on when every step felt like walking through quicksand?

Just then, the café door swung open and a young woman with striking green eyes walked in. She scanned the room until her gaze landed on Michał, and for a moment, they just locked eyes.

"Mind if I join you?" she asked, her voice husky and confident.

Michał hesitated before nodding, intrigued by the stranger's warmth.

As they introduced themselves – her name was Ana – Michał found himself opening up to her in ways he hadn't thought possible. She listened attentively, asking gentle questions that pierced his defenses.

Over steaming cups of coffee, Michał shared stories about his parents, their love, and their loss. Ana listened without judgment, her expression softening with each passing minute.

As the afternoon sun filtered through the rain-veiled window, Michał felt a weight lifting off his shoulders. For the first time in years, he began to see a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, he wasn't alone anymore.

Ana reached across the table and placed her hand on Michał's knee. Her touch was like a spark to dry tinder – it ignited a flame within him.

"Let's not talk about your parents today," she said with a gentle smile. "But let's focus on us. What do you want, Michał?"

Michał López looked into the depths of Ana's eyes and saw a future that didn't include the ghosts of his past. With her by his side, he felt ready to face whatever lay ahead – as long as it wasn't alone.
