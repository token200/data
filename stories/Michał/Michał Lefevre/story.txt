Michał Lefevre stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of life. As a private investigator, he had grown accustomed to the quiet hours of dawn and dusk when the city was at its most still. The patrons here seemed to be sipping their coffee in silence, lost in their own thoughts.

Michał Lefevre slid into a corner seat, his gaze drifting over the scattered pages of the newspaper he had been studying all morning. He was searching for a lead on a missing person case that had gone cold weeks ago. The victim's family was growing restless, and Michał knew he needed to find something – anything – to revive the investigation.

As he sipped his own coffee, a figure caught his eye. A young woman with piercing green eyes sat at a table near the window, typing away on her laptop. There was something about her that drew Michał in. Perhaps it was the way she seemed completely absorbed in her work, or maybe it was the hint of sadness etched into her features.

Michał Lefevre watched as she typed furiously, her brow furrowed in concentration. He couldn't help but wonder what had brought her to this city, and what secrets she might be hiding behind those piercing eyes. As he observed her, a spark of curiosity ignited within him. This could be the break he needed.

Without drawing attention to himself, Michał Lefevre stood up and made his way over to the woman's table. "Mind if I join you?" he asked, his voice low and gentle. The woman looked up, startled, and Michał felt a jolt of surprise as their eyes met. For a moment, they simply stared at each other, the world around them melting away.

"I don't mind," she replied finally, her voice husky. "I could use some company." And with that, Michał Lefevre sat down beside her, ready to unravel the secrets she seemed to be hiding – and perhaps uncover a lead in his own case.
