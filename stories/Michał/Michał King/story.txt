Michał King stood on the edge of the cliff, the wind whipping his dark hair into a frenzy as he gazed out at the vast expanse of the Polish countryside. It was a view that had become all too familiar to him over the years, yet one that still held a sense of wonder.

As a young boy, Michał had always been drawn to the stories of his great-grandfather, a renowned explorer who had mapped much of Eastern Europe and beyond. Though King had never set foot on an expedition himself, he felt a deep connection to the thrill of discovery and the sense of adventure that came with it.

Now, as a man in his mid-thirties, Michał had traded in his backpack for a suit and tie, working as a curator at the local museum. But the itch to explore remained, and so he spent every spare moment researching and planning his next adventure.

Tonight was no exception. The wind howled through the trees as Michał stood on the cliff's edge, lost in thought. He had been pouring over old maps and documents, searching for any sign of a hidden treasure or lost city that might have lain within reach. Some said it was nothing more than myth, but Michał knew better.

As he stood there, the stars began to twinkle overhead, casting a silver glow over the landscape. Suddenly, a gust of wind sent his hat flying off into the darkness. Michał cursed under his breath and chased after it, laughing as it bobbed through the air before landing at his feet with a soft thud.

In that moment, he knew what he had to do. He would put aside his museum duties for good and set out on a new quest – one that would take him from the ruins of ancient castles to hidden monasteries deep in the forest. The thrill of discovery called to him, and Michał King was ready to answer.

With a grin spreading across his face, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a crumpled map, unfolding it to reveal the outline of a long-forgotten city. The wind died down, the stars shone brighter, and Michał felt the familiar stirrings of excitement within him. Tonight was just the beginning – and little did he know that tomorrow would bring a journey that would change his life forever.
