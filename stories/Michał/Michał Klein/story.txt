Michał Klein, a former KGB agent turned secret investigator, stood outside the rundown café on Ulitsa Fergansa. The Moscow rain pattered against the pavement as he checked his watch for what felt like the hundredth time that evening.

It had been five years since Klein left the Soviet Union, after a decade of serving as a low-ranking KGB agent in East Germany. He'd witnessed unspeakable atrocities and grown disillusioned with the regime's ideology. But it was too late to turn back; his life was already irrevocably entwined with that of the oppressive system.

A knock at the door broke the silence, and Klein turned to face a disheveled figure clad in a worn leather trench coat. The man introduced himself as Viktor Kuznetsov, an ex-Spetsnaz operative who now worked for the Russian intelligence agency, FSB.

Klein raised an eyebrow as Kuznetsov handed him a small, high-tech camera. "A device from a former colleague," the man explained. "The manufacturer wants me to track down my cousin – she's gone missing in Berlin."

Intrigued by the prospect of uncovering a genuine Russian mole within the FSB's ranks, Klein agreed to take on the case. The two men spent the next few hours discussing the finer details and Kuznetsov provided Klein with cryptic information about his cousin.

Over steaming cups of black coffee, Klein began his investigation, scouring Berlin for leads and interviewing a network of contacts – former East German informants and dissidents who had managed to escape. Each conversation revealed a tantalizing thread: whispered rumors, half-remembered conversations, and scattered intelligence all hinted at the presence of an enemy within the heart of the FSB.

As the night wore on, Klein found himself drawn into the world he'd once fled, one he thought he'd left behind forever. Yet, his instincts told him that something was off about this case – a nagging feeling that Kuznetsov's information wasn't entirely trustworthy.

Klein's gaze met the rain-drenched pavement as the neon lights of Berlin danced across the night sky. He took a deep breath and stepped out into the wet evening air, camera slung over his shoulder. This was where the game began – in the shadows, behind closed doors, where loyalty and deception blurred into an endless dance of cat and mouse.

The city seemed to whisper its secrets to him on that drizzly Moscow night: "Look closer, Michał."
