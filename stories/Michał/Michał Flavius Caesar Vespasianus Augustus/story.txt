In the bustling streets of Rome, a young boy named Michał Flavius Caesar Vespasianus Augustus marveled at the grandeur of the Roman Empire. With an aura of nobility surrounding him, Michał's eyes shone with curiosity as he watched the senators and nobles strut about.

As the scion of a prominent family, Michał had been groomed for greatness from a tender age. His parents, Flavius and Julia, had instilled in him the values of loyalty, duty, and strength. And indeed, their son embodied these qualities with an unyielding determination that bordered on ferocity.

For a moment, he forgot about the expectations placed upon him and simply smiled, knowing that he was ready to take on whatever challenges lay ahead.
