Michał Polo stepped off the train and onto the platform, his eyes scanning the bustling station. As he made his way through the crowds, he couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. This was where it all began for Michał, where he had first set foot in the world of photography.

Years ago, Michał Polo had arrived at this very station with a small bag slung over his shoulder and a camera tucked away in his pocket. He had been chasing a dream, one that had taken him from the streets of Warsaw to the alleys of Tokyo, capturing the beauty in the mundane.

As he emerged onto the street, Michał Polo was greeted by the familiar sight of his old friend, Jacek. The two men clasped each other's shoulders, a hearty laugh erupting from their reunion.

"What brings you back to Krakow?" Michał Polo asked, as they walked towards the city center.

Jacek shook his head, "Just visiting some old friends, and I thought it would be nice to catch up with you too."

Michał Polo smiled wistfully. He had been away for a while, chasing projects in Europe and beyond. But something about coming back to this place felt right.

They walked in silence for a few moments, taking in the sights and sounds of the city they both loved. Michał Polo stopped at a small café, ordering a coffee as Jacek settled onto a bench outside.

As he waited for his drink, Michał Polo pulled out his camera and began to shoot, capturing the vibrant colors and textures of the Krakow streets. It was a habit that had stayed with him throughout his travels, a reminder of where he came from and what had brought him to this place.

When he returned to Jacek's side, they walked together through the winding streets, Michał Polo pointing out landmarks and sharing stories of his adventures. As the sun began to set, casting a warm glow over the city, Michał Polo felt a sense of peace settle over him.

For a moment, it was like no time had passed at all, and he was once again that young photographer, camera in hand, taking on the world one frame at a time.
