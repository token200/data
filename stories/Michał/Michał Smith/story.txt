Michał Smith stood at the edge of the city, gazing out at the sprawling metropolis before him. A foreigner in this Polish landscape, he felt like an outsider, yet somehow at home. The city lights twinkled like a thousand stars as night began to fall.

A journalist by trade, Michał had always been drawn to the darker corners of human nature. He spent his days interviewing witnesses, pouring over records, and digging up secrets in his quest for the truth. His latest assignment had brought him to Kraków, where whispers of corruption and deceit hung in the air like a thick fog.

As he walked through the narrow streets, Michał felt an affinity with the city's worn stone buildings and cobblestone roads. He sensed that Kraków held its own secrets, just waiting to be uncovered by someone with his drive and determination.

One evening, while researching at the local library, Michał stumbled upon an old case file. The date was etched on a faded note: November 11th, 1956. According to the records, a young woman named Katarzyna had gone missing in this very city, leaving behind only a cryptic letter and a whispered rumor.

Michał's curiosity was piqued. He spent the next few days tracking down Katarzyna's family and friends, listening to their stories and piecing together fragments of her life. As he delved deeper into the mystery, he began to feel an unsettling connection to the missing woman – as if she shared a hidden bond with him.

One chilly autumn night, Michał stood outside the old apartment building where Katarzyna was last seen. He lit a cigarette and took a long drag, feeling the familiar sting of nicotine on his lips. Suddenly, he felt a presence behind him. Turning to face it, he saw an elderly woman with piercing green eyes, her gaze locked onto his.

For a fleeting moment, Michał swore that Katarzyna stood before him – alive, smiling, and radiating an otherworldly glow. But when the moment passed, only the woman remained, whispering a single word: "Run."

Michał's heart pounded in his chest as he watched her disappear into the night, leaving behind only the echoes of her enigmatic warning. He knew then that his search for truth had just become an all-consuming quest – one that would lead him down a dark and winding path, where secrets lurked around every corner and the line between reality and madness was thin indeed.
