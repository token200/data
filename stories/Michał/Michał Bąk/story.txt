Michał Bąk was a man consumed by his own darkness. A former soldier, he had seen his share of battles and horrors that would haunt any man for a lifetime. After leaving the military, he thought he had found solace in a quiet life as a carpenter. However, the memories of what he had experienced continued to plague him.

One day, while working on a new piece of furniture, Michał received an unexpected visit from his estranged brother, Jakub. It had been years since they last spoke, and Michał wasn't sure why Jakub had come now, but the need for answers was too great to ignore.

As they sat down in Michał's small workshop, the tension between them was palpable. Jakub told Michał that their family's past held secrets that Michał knew nothing about. Their father, a man Michał remembered as cold and distant, had been involved in some sort of illicit activity that had driven him out of the country.

Michał listened intently, his mind racing with questions. Why was his brother telling him this now? What did it have to do with him? The more Jakub spoke, the more Michał felt a sense of unease. His father's secrets were beginning to unravel, and he wasn't sure if he wanted to know.

As the conversation wore on, Michał found himself drawn back into his past. He remembered stories their father used to tell them as children - tales of war and loss, of secrets kept hidden behind a mask of respectability. The more he listened to Jakub, the more Michał realized that their family's history was far from what he had thought.

The visit ended all too soon, leaving Michał feeling lost and confused. He looked at his hands, once skilled in woodworking but now clumsy with worry. His brother's words had awakened a part of him he thought he'd left behind. It was as if the darkness that had haunted him for so long had finally caught up with him.

As he sat back down at his workbench, Michał felt a strange sense of clarity. He knew that he couldn't go on living in the shadows of his past forever. The secrets and lies had to come to light, no matter how painful it would be. And so, with a newfound determination, Michał Bąk began to unravel the tangled threads of his family's history, determined to find the truth, even if it meant facing the darkness head-on.
