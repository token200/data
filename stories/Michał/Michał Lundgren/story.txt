Michał Lundgren was known for his rugged good looks and imposing physique, but it was his mysterious past that made him a legend in his own right. A Polish martial artist and former Special Forces operative, he had spent years honing his skills on the streets of Warsaw before fleeing to the States.

After serving in the Polish military, Michał had joined the elite 2nd Tymczasowa Infantry Regiment, where he quickly rose through the ranks due to his exceptional combat prowess. His time in the regiment was marked by brutal efficiency and an unyielding dedication to duty. But when a catastrophic accident left him with serious injuries, Michał knew it was time to leave.

He made his way to New York City, where he took up residence in the concrete jungle of Manhattan. Under the alias "Mike Lundgren," he built a new life for himself as a freelance bodyguard and security consultant. Word quickly spread about Mike's impressive skillset, drawing clients from all walks of life.

One evening, while walking home through Central Park, Michał received an unsolicited phone call from an unknown number. The voice on the other end claimed to have information about his sister, killed in action during a mission gone wrong back in Poland. It seemed that someone was still hunting for her, and only Michał could stop them.

Hesitant but driven by curiosity, Michał agreed to meet with the mysterious caller at an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. As he entered the dimly lit space, he was greeted by a figure shrouded in shadows.

The voice revealed itself to be a former intelligence operative, working for a clandestine organization tasked with uncovering and dismantling organized crime rings. They had been tracking Michał's sister's killers for years and believed that Mike Lundgren might hold the key.

With his instincts on high alert, Michał agreed to take on the mission. The stakes were high, but he knew that this was a chance to right an old wrong. For the first time in years, he felt the rush of adrenaline course through his veins as he accepted the challenge.

As the night unfolded, Michał found himself entangled in a world of violence and deception. His skills would soon be put to the ultimate test.
