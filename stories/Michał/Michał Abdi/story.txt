Michał Abdi stepped out of the bustling streets of Krakow and into the quiet courtyard of his family's old apartment building. The worn stone walls seemed to whisper secrets of the past as he made his way to the small garden behind the door. It was here that Michał Abdi would often escape the chaos of everyday life, surrounded by the familiar scent of blooming lavender and the gentle hum of bees.

As a child, Michał Abdi had spent countless hours in this very spot, watching the sunset with his grandparents, who had taught him the importance of patience and observation. He remembered how his Babcia would point out the smallest details – a fluttering butterfly, a curious snail making its way up a leaf – as if to remind him that even the most ordinary moments held beauty.

Years had passed since Michał Abdi last visited this garden with his grandparents. Life had taken him on different paths – art school in Warsaw, stints in Berlin and Paris – but the sense of connection to this place remained strong. He felt an inexplicable pull, as if the garden was calling him back home.

Now, Michał Abdi sat cross-legged on the worn stone bench, his eyes closed as he breathed in the familiar scent. The world outside receded, and for a moment, he was back with his grandparents, feeling small yet connected to something greater. He opened his eyes to find a young girl sitting beside him, her eyes wide with wonder as she examined a tiny flower.

Michał Abdi smiled, recognizing the same curiosity that had driven him as a child. "What's your name?" he asked, his voice low and gentle.

The girl looked up at him, her smile matching his. "I'm Kasia," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

In this moment, Michał Abdi felt a sense of continuity, of threads weaving together past and present. He reached out a hand to gently brush away a strand of hair that had escaped Kasia's ponytail, feeling the softness of her skin as if it were his own sister's. In this garden, surrounded by memories and whispers of the past, Michał Abdi found peace, knowing that some moments would stay with him forever.
