Born Charles Robert Németh, Charlie's passion for caving began at a young age, sparked by tales from his grandfather, a seasoned spelunker himself. He would often spend hours listening to stories of hidden passageways, ancient formations, and the thrill of discovery that came with exploring the unknown depths beneath the earth.
