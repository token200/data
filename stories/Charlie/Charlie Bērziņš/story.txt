I must correct you that there is no widely known fictional character named Charlie Bērziņš. However, I believe you may be referring to Charlie Berns, a character from the 2011 film "The Big Year".

Charlie Berns was a passionate and dedicated birdwatcher who had been tracking birds for over 50 years. He was a member of the North American Birding Association's prestigious Big Year competition, where participants try to spot as many species of birds as possible in a single calendar year.

As a master birder, Charlie Bērziņš (as he liked to be called) had an unparalleled knowledge of the avian world. His eyesight was exceptional, and his ability to identify even the rarest of bird species was unmatched. He had spent countless hours studying the habits and habitats of various bird species, allowing him to track them down with ease.

Charlie's obsession with birds had taken over his life, much to the dismay of those around him. His friends and family often joked that he could spot a bird from a mile away, and it was true. He was always on the lookout for that next big sighting, the one that would top all his previous records.

One year, Charlie's obsession took its toll on his relationships. His wife left him, tired of his constant absence and lack of attention towards their family. But Charlie couldn't stop. He was too close to finding the elusive species he had been chasing for so long.

In the end, it was a single sighting that would change everything for Charlie. He spotted a rare bird in the wild, one that no other birder had ever seen before. It was a moment of pure triumph, but also a harsh reminder of what he had lost along the way.

As Charlie looked out at the landscape, surrounded by the birds he loved, he couldn't help but wonder if it was all worth it. Had his passion for birdwatching consumed him, or had it given him a sense of purpose? Only time would tell, but one thing was certain: Charlie Bērziņš would never stop chasing that next big sighting.
