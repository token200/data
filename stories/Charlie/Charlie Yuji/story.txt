Charlie Yuji was a quiet and unassuming high school student who lived in the small town of Tsurugi, nestled in the mountains. He was known among his peers as "the genius" - not for his academic prowess, but for his uncanny ability to predict what others would do in any given situation.

One day, while walking home from school, Charlie noticed a classmate named Takumi stumble and almost fall on the sidewalk. Without hesitation, Charlie rushed over to help Takumi up, allaying his fears and reassuring him that he was fine.

"What made you do that?" Takumi asked later, still shaken by the incident.

Charlie shrugged, his eyes fixed on some invisible point in space. "I just knew what you were thinking," he said matter-of-factly.

As word of Charlie's abilities spread throughout school, students began to seek him out for advice and guidance. He was always willing to lend a listening ear or offer sage counsel, never once revealing the source of his knowledge.

Charlie's teachers took notice too, inviting him to share his insights during class discussions. And although he never spoke up in class himself, his words seemed to come from nowhere, offering profound wisdom that left his peers speechless.

But Charlie's greatest asset was not just his intuition - it was also his complete lack of personal opinion or desire for fame. He did not crave attention or recognition; instead, he preferred to stay behind the scenes, observing and learning.

Despite his reserved nature, students found themselves drawn to Charlie's quiet strength and unwavering empathy. He had a way of understanding them without needing to ask questions - as if he could see right through their facade, into the very heart of who they were.

And so, Charlie continued to walk among his peers, quietly observing and guiding those around him with an uncanny sense of knowing exactly what they needed to hear.
