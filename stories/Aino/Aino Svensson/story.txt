As a child, Aino would spend hours exploring the woods, collecting wildflowers and watching the wildlife.

As she grew older, Aino's love for nature only deepened. She became an avid hiker and camper, spending every spare moment outdoors. Her friends and family would often joke that she had a special connection to the earth, as if she could communicate with the trees and animals themselves.
