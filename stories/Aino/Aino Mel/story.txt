Aino Mel stood at the edge of the cliff, her long black hair whipping in the ocean breeze as she gazed out at the endless expanse of water. The waves crashed against the shore below, their rhythmic beat like a symphony to her ears. She felt most alive when she was by the sea.

As a child, Aino had spent hours playing on these same cliffs, collecting seashells and watching the tide pools for anemones. Her parents, both artists, had encouraged her creativity, and she had grown up with a love of music as well. In fact, she played the lyre with skill and passion, often performing at local festivals and gatherings.

But life had taken Aino on a different path. She had left her village to pursue a career in medicine, determined to help those in need. Her father's illness had been a turning point for her – seeing him suffer, unable to heal the pain that coursed through his veins, had made her realize how precious every moment was.

As a doctor, Aino had seen her share of tragedies and triumphs. She had helped many people recover from illnesses, but she had also lost count of the number of patients who had slipped away from her grasp. It was a bittersweet experience that left her questioning the nature of mortality.

Aino's thoughts were interrupted by a young girl, no more than ten years old, who wandered onto the cliff and began to weep. Aino recognized the look in her eyes – it was the same one she had seen so many times before, full of fear and uncertainty.

Without hesitation, Aino set down her medical bag and knelt beside the child. She wrapped a comforting arm around her shoulders and asked gentle questions, coaxing out the story of why this little girl had come to the cliff in distress. As they sat together on the beach, watching the sun dip below the horizon, Aino realized that she was not just treating bodies, but also souls – healing wounds both physical and emotional.

The memory of her father's words echoed in her mind: "A good doctor is not just a healer, but a guardian of hope." And with this thought, Aino Mel stood up, took the girl's hand, and led her down from the cliff into the warm light of the fading day.
