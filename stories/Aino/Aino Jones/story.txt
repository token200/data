Aino Jones stood alone on the worn wooden dock, her eyes fixed out at the endless expanse of ocean. The sun was setting over the water, casting a golden glow over the waves. She breathed in deeply, feeling the salty air fill her lungs.

It had been five years since Aino's mother had passed away, leaving her with a small inheritance and a sense of loss that still lingered. But as she stood there, watching the sun dip below the horizon, she felt a sense of peace wash over her. She knew that she would never forget her mother, but she also knew that she couldn't stay stuck in the past.

Aino had always been drawn to the ocean. As a child, she spent hours exploring the tide pools and watching the seagulls soar overhead. And now, as an adult, she found solace in its vastness. She felt small yet connected to something much bigger than herself.

As she stood there, lost in thought, Aino's mind began to wander back to her childhood. She remembered the way her mother used to take her on walks along the beach, pointing out shells and seaweed, teaching her about the creatures that lived beneath the surface. She recalled the way her mother's laughter echoed across the waves as she tried to catch a particularly elusive seagull.

Aino smiled to herself, feeling a warmth spread through her chest. She realized that even though her mother was gone, she would always carry a piece of her with her. The lessons, the love, and the memories - they were all still there, buried beneath the surface like the ocean's depths.

Just as Aino was about to turn away from the dock, she felt a gentle tug on her sleeve. She turned to see her old friend, Kai, standing behind her. "Hey, Aino," he said, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he smiled. "What are you doing out here?"

Aino shrugged, feeling a sense of comfort wash over her. "Just watching the sunset," she replied.

Kai nodded, understanding in his expression. "It's beautiful," he said. "Sometimes I think it's even more breathtaking when we're alone."

The two friends stood there for a moment, watching as the sun dipped below the horizon. Aino knew that life was full of ups and downs, but she also knew that she would always have her mother to remember, and Kai by her side to share in the journey.

As the stars began to twinkle overhead, Aino turned to Kai and smiled. "Thanks for reminding me it's okay to be alone," she said, feeling a sense of peace settle over her once more.
