Aino Dąbrowska was an enigmatic figure, shrouded in mystery and intrigue. As a young woman with an affinity for the occult, she had always been drawn to the unknown, the unseen forces that governed the world beyond the veil of reality.

Born into a family of Polish mystics, Aino had been trained from a tender age in the ancient arts of magic and divination. Her full name, Aino Dąbrowska, was whispered in reverence by those who knew her, for it was said that she possessed a spark of divine power within her.

As she grew older, Aino became increasingly fascinated with the concept of astral projection, believing that it held the key to unlocking the secrets of the cosmos.
