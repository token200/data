Aino Gonzalez stepped into the small café, scanning the room for a familiar face. She spotted her friend, Luna, sitting in the corner sipping a cup of coffee. Aino made her way over, dropping into the chair across from Luna with a soft thud.

"Aino González, what brings you here today?" Luna asked, raising an eyebrow as she took a sip of her drink.

Aino smiled wryly. "Just needed to get out of the house for a bit. I've been cooped up working on that new project all week."

Luna nodded sympathetically. "I know how that feels. Sometimes you just need to take a break and clear your head."

As they chatted, a figure caught Aino's eye from across the room. It was her old high school sweetheart, Alex. She hadn't seen him in years, not since their messy breakup. But there he was now, sitting alone at a table by the window.

Aino felt a pang of surprise and curiosity. What was he doing here? And what had brought him back to town after all these years?

Luna followed her gaze, following Aino's eyes to Alex. "Ah, I think you know that guy," she said quietly.

Aino nodded, feeling a flutter in her chest. She got up from the table and made her way over to Alex, who looked up as she approached.

"Aino González," he said, his voice low and smooth. "I didn't expect to see you here."

Aino smiled, feeling a little self-conscious. "Just grabbing a coffee before work."

Alex stood up, towering over Aino, and offered her his seat. As they sat down together, the three of them fell into an easy conversation, catching up on old times and sharing stories about their lives.

It was clear that some things never changed – despite the years apart, Alex and Aino still had a spark between them. But as they talked, Aino realized that this time around, she wasn't sure what the future held for them.
