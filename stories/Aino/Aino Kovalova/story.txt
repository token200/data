Aino Kovalova stepped onto the crowded platform, her eyes scanning the sea of strangers as she clutched her worn leather suitcase to her chest. She had been traveling for weeks, and yet the familiar feel of exhaustion was still a welcome companion.

As a nomadic writer, Aino had grown accustomed to living out of a suitcase, never staying in one place for too long. Her life was a patchwork quilt of hotel rooms and coffee shops, each thread carefully stitched together by her own two hands. And yet, despite the freedom she enjoyed, there were moments like this when the weight of her solitude threatened to overwhelm her.

Aino spotted a familiar face amidst the crowd - her friend, Mika, who was now running for city council. The two had met in college, bonding over their shared love of poetry and late-night conversations. Aino had always admired Mika's passion, but also respected her drive. It was no surprise that she had decided to run for office.

As they hugged, Aino couldn't help but feel a pang of envy. Mika seemed to have it all figured out - a clear sense of purpose and direction. But what about Aino? She had always known what she wanted to write about - the stories of forgotten lives, the struggles of those living on the fringes. It was a niche market, to say the least.

As they made their way through the city streets, Mika filled Aino in on her campaign promises and strategies. Aino listened intently, nodding along as she pulled out her notebook to jot down some ideas. She had always been a bit of a writer, but lately, she'd been feeling stuck - unsure of how to capture the world around her onto paper.

As they stopped at a small caf√© for coffee, Mika turned to Aino with a curious expression. "You're not thinking of running for office too, are you?" she asked, a hint of amusement in her voice. Aino shook her head, laughing. No, she wasn't ready for that just yet.

But the question had sparked something within her - a glimmer of possibility that she hadn't considered before. Maybe it was time to take a chance on herself, to write about more than just the lives she'd lived. As she sipped her coffee and watched Mika disappear into the crowd, Aino Kovalova felt a spark of excitement ignite within her. She wasn't sure what lay ahead, but for the first time in weeks, she felt truly alive.
