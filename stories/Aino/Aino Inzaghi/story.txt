Aino Inzaghi was a young and ambitious journalist, known for her fearless pursuit of the truth. Born in Rome, Italy, to a family of journalists herself, Aino had always been drawn to the world of investigative reporting. She spent countless hours studying the greats - Bob Woodward, Carl Bernstein, and Gloria Steinem - and honing her craft.

After graduating from journalism school, Aino landed an internship at a prominent Italian newspaper, where she quickly made a name for herself with her sharp instincts and tenacious questioning style.
