Aino Mercier stepped into the dimly lit café, the soft hum of conversation and clinking cups enveloping her like a warm hug. She took a seat at the counter, running her fingers over the worn surface as she waited for her drink to arrive.

Aino Mercier was no stranger to these sorts of places – cramped, eclectic spots that catered to the city's creative underbelly. As an artist and musician, she'd spent countless nights here, sketching inspiration from the patrons and listening to musicians strum their guitars on makeshift stages.

As she sipped her coffee, Aino Mercier's eyes wandered to the chalkboard menu scrawled across one wall. Tonight's specials included an intriguing-sounding soup made with foraged wild mushrooms and a seasonal salad featuring locally-sourced greens. Her stomach growled in anticipation as she deliberated between the two options.

Just then, a figure slid onto the stool beside her, sending the coffee shop's regular, Mrs. Jenkins, into a gentle cough. Aino Mercier smiled sympathetically as the older woman hobbled out of the café, complaining about creaky joints and early bird specials gone wrong.

A young musician settled in across from Aino Mercier, lugging his instrument case onto the stool beside him. He fished out his phone to scroll through a music platform before turning to face her with an endearingly nervous smile. "Mind if I join you? Music's always better when shared."

With some hesitation, she agreed, and they started discussing everything from songwriting tips to favorite art movements. Aino Mercier found herself lost in the cadence of his words, the way he spun tales about local landmarks turned her ears perked up with curiosity.

Over a cupcake and a side of conversation, they effortlessly transitioned into each other's orbits – their laughter echoing softly through the café as strangers became unlikely companions. As Aino Mercier finished off her dessert and prepared to leave, she smiled warmly at the young musician. "I'm so glad I ran into you tonight," she said, offering a gentle hand of friendship.

He took it in his own, eyes shining with gratitude before releasing – but only for a fleeting moment, when he asked if they could meet again sometime soon.
