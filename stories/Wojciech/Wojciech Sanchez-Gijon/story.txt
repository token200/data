A violin built from the skeleton of a ancient instrument, surrounded by swirling patterns of LED lights? A working prototype of a device that seemed to defy gravity?

Despite the accolades, Wojciech remained an enigma. Few knew the truth behind his eccentricities, or the turmoil that lay beneath his mercurial surface. But one thing was certain: this master showman had woven a web of intrigue that would captivate audiences for years to come.

In the midst of it all, Wojciech Sanchez-Gijon stood at the center, an axis around which his world revolved. And as he gazed out upon the gathering, a knowing smile crept across his face, hinting that there was still much more to reveal about this most elusive of characters.
