She rose to prominence in the 1970s and 80s, becoming one of the most dominant players of all time. Her incredible skill and versatility earned her numerous accolades, including 18 Grand Slam singles titles.

Despite her success, Wojciech faced intense scrutiny for her personal life. Her relationship with a female tennis coach, Barbara Woodworth, sparked outrage and debate among fans and media outlets. The controversy surrounding their romance led to Wojciech's withdrawal from several high-profile tournaments, further fueling the public's fascination with her private life.
