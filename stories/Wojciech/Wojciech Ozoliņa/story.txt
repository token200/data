One of Wojciech Ozoliņa's most famous installations, "Ephemeral Landscape," took place in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of the city. The space was transformed into a surreal environment, filled with glowing orbs, pulsating lights, and an eerie soundscape that seemed to shift and adapt as viewers moved through it.

As visitors wandered through the installation, they were invited to contribute their own sounds and movements to the environment, blurring the lines between creator and audience.
