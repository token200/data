I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Wojciech Totti. It's possible that this character is not well-known or has not been written about in popular media.

However, I can create a story about a character with the name Wojciech Totti. Here it is:

Wojciech Totti was a brilliant and eccentric scientist who had spent his entire life studying the mysteries of the universe. Born to a family of modest means, Wojciech had always been fascinated by the workings of the human mind and the secrets of the cosmos.

As a young boy, Wojciech would spend hours gazing up at the stars, dreaming of the day he could unlock their secrets. He spent years studying physics, mathematics, and philosophy, eventually earning his Ph.D. in theoretical astrophysics from a prestigious university.

Wojciech's groundbreaking research on quantum entanglement and black holes earned him international recognition and acclaim. His peers saw him as a visionary, and his theories were soon being applied to some of the most pressing problems facing humanity.

Despite his many achievements, Wojciech remained humble and kind. He was beloved by his colleagues for his wit and sense of humor, which could often be found in his clever quips and witty one-liners.

As Wojciech approached the end of his life, he looked back on a career that had been filled with wonder and discovery. His name would go down in history as one of the greatest minds of all time, and his legacy would continue to inspire future generations of scientists and thinkers.

Wojciech Totti passed away peacefully at the age of 95, surrounded by his loved ones and the stars he had spent his life studying. His work would live on, a testament to the power of human curiosity and ingenuity.
