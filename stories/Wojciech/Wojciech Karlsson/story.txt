Few people knew much about him, except that he had an uncanny ability to solve complex puzzles and unravel tangled mysteries. His skills were in such high demand that he had become a sort of mythical figure, known only by his nickname: "The Whiz Kid."

Wojciech Karlsson's origins were unclear, but it was rumored that he had grown up on the streets of Warsaw, honing his problem-solving skills as a young boy. He would spend hours poring over dusty tomes in the city's library, devouring knowledge and developing an insatiable curiosity.

One such case caught Wojciech Karlsson's eye: a series of burglaries in London's wealthy districts, with each theft leaving behind a cryptic message etched into the walls.
