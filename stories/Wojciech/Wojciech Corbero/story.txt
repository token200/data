Wojciech Corbero stepped into the dimly lit café, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of trouble. As a former assassin, he had made a career out of being one step ahead of his enemies. His skills were unmatched, and his reputation preceded him.

"Wojciech Corbero," the barista whispered as she poured him a cup of black coffee. "I've heard so much about you."

Wojciech smiled wryly, taking a sip of the bitter brew. He had long since retired from the life of a hitman, but the ghosts of his past still lingered.

As he sipped his coffee, a figure caught his eye - a young woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair. She was sitting alone at a corner table, her gaze fixed intently on Wojciech.

"Can I help you?" he asked, his voice low and even.

"My name is Lena," she replied, her voice husky. "I've heard stories about your... talents. I have a job that requires someone with your particular set of skills."

Wojciech raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. "What kind of job?"

Lena leaned forward, her eyes locked on his. "I'm looking for someone to retrieve a valuable artifact from a heavily guarded mansion. It's said to be hidden deep within the estate's library."

Wojciech's mind began to whir with possibilities. He had always been drawn to challenges, and this one seemed particularly appealing.

"I'll take it," he said finally, standing up to leave.

As he walked out of the café, Lena called after him. "Be careful, Wojciech Corbero. There are those who would love to get their hands on that artifact."

Wojciech smiled, a cold glint in his eye. He was always ready for a fight, and with Lena's job hanging in the balance, he knew he had just gotten himself into something big.

With a sense of anticipation building in his chest, Wojciech Corbero stepped out into the night, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
