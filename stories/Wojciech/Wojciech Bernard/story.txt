Wojciech Bernard was a man shrouded in mystery. Few people knew much about him beyond his piercing green eyes and chiseled features. But those who did knew that he was a master of disguise, able to blend into the shadows with ease.

As a young man, Wojciech had grown up on the streets of Krakow, surviving by his wits and his cunning. He quickly learned how to adapt to any situation, taking on different personas and roles to suit his needs. This skill would serve him well in his later years as a spy, where he worked for the Polish government to gather intelligence on their enemies.

Wojciech Bernard's latest assignment took him to the heart of Berlin, where he was tasked with infiltrating a high-stakes poker game hosted by the infamous German businessman, Viktor Krieg. Wojciech had heard rumors that Krieg was hiding something big, and he aimed to uncover it.

He arrived in Berlin under an assumed identity, donning a tailored suit and adopting a charming accent. He made his way to the exclusive club where the poker game was being held, mingling with the other guests as he searched for Viktor Krieg.

As the night wore on, Wojciech Bernard found himself seated next to none other than the man himself. Krieg seemed nervous, fidgeting with a cigar as he dealt out the cards. Wojciech knew that this was his chance - he needed to get close enough to Viktor Krieg to extract some information from him.

Wojciech played the game like a pro, using all of his skills and experience to win hand after hand. As the stakes grew higher, so did the tension in the room. But Wojciech Bernard remained calm, his eyes fixed intently on Krieg as he waited for his moment to strike.

Finally, with the game coming down to its final showdown, Wojciech made his move. He laid down a straight flush, beating out Viktor Krieg and earning himself a small fortune in cash and property. As he collected his winnings, Wojciech Bernard couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction - he had completed his mission, and now it was time to leave Berlin behind.

Wojciech Bernard slipped away into the night, disappearing into the shadows as quickly as he had appeared. But those who knew him would always remember the man with the piercing green eyes, and the legend that surrounded him like a shroud.
