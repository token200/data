One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Zbigniew Visconti strolled through the city's quiet streets, lost in thought. The soft glow of street lamps cast long shadows behind him, casting an eerie ambiance that seemed to suit his introspective mood. He paused at a small café, ordering a cup of black coffee as he took a seat at the bar.

As he sipped his coffee, Zbigniew Visconti's gaze wandered over the patrons, taking in the varied faces and stories they told through their expressions. A young artist sat hunched over her sketchbook, lost in creativity; an elderly couple laughed and chatted, hands intertwined; a businessman pored over his phone, eyes narrowed in concentration.
