Zbigniew Wo≈∫niak, a former Polish soldier turned hitman, sat in his dingy flat, staring at the photograph on his mantle. It was a picture of him as a young man, full of hope and ambition, standing proudly with his fellow recruits during a parade in Warsaw.

As he gazed at the image, memories flooded back to him - the camaraderie, the training, the promises made to one another that they would return home heroes. But life had other plans for Zbigniew. After years of service, he found himself disillusioned with the system and caught up in the underbelly of Polish organized crime.

It was then that he discovered his true calling - taking out targets on behalf of the highest bidder. His skills as a soldier translated surprisingly well to the world of contract killing. Zbigniew's reputation grew, and soon he was in high demand by some of the most powerful figures in Eastern Europe.

As the years went by, however, Zbigniew began to lose himself in the process. He became detached from his emotions, viewing people as mere objects to be eliminated. His relationships were few and far between, and those that did exist felt superficial and transactional.

One evening, a mysterious client approached him with an offer he couldn't refuse - to take out a high-ranking government official who had been involved in some shady dealings. The pay was substantial, and the risk relatively low.

Zbigniew accepted the job, knowing it would be his last. He had grown tired of living on the fringes of society, tired of being a ghost with no discernible purpose. As he waited for the signal to proceed, something unexpected happened - a voice in his head whispered doubts about the morality of his actions.

The official was killed, but not without Zbigniew's conscience getting the better of him. For the first time in years, he felt the sting of regret. As he walked away from the body, he caught a glimpse of himself in a window reflection - a hollow-eyed shell of a man who had lost his way.

Zbigniew returned to his flat, the photograph still clutched in his hand. This time, however, it showed him a different perspective - one that hinted at redemption and forgiveness. Though his path was far from clear, he knew that he couldn't stay stuck on this trajectory forever.
