Zbigniew White was a man shrouded in mystery. A Polish-born spy, he had spent his life navigating the shadows, leaving behind only whispers of his existence. His eyes, an unsettling shade of blue, seemed to bore into those he met, as if searching for hidden truths.

Born in the small town of Szczecin, Zbigniew grew up with a sense of restlessness, always feeling like an outsider. He found solace in the world of espionage, where loyalty was a luxury and allegiances were forged and broken at will.

Zbigniew's skills as a spy were unmatched. He could blend into his surroundings with ease, adopting the mannerisms and speech patterns of those around him. His talent for deception was matched only by his ability to extract information from even the most guarded sources.

One day, Zbigniew received a message from an old acquaintance, requesting a meeting in Berlin. The note was cryptic, but Zbigniew's curiosity was piqued. He made his way to the agreed location, a nondescript café on the outskirts of the city.

As he waited for his contact, Zbigniew sipped on a coffee and watched the patrons through the window. A woman with piercing green eyes caught his attention, sitting alone at a table by the door. She seemed out of place among the bustling crowd, yet there was something about her that drew him in.

The woman emerged from the café, her gaze locking onto Zbigniew's. "You're late," she said, her voice low and husky.

Zbigniew smiled, his eyes never leaving hers. "I'm worth waiting for."

Their meeting was brief, but the information they exchanged would change the course of Zbigniew's life forever. He left Berlin with a new purpose, driven by a sense of restlessness that had been simmering beneath the surface.

As he disappeared into the night, the woman watched him go, her eyes narrowing in thought. She knew that she had just made an enemy, one who would stop at nothing to uncover the truth about himself. Zbigniew White may have been a master spy, but for now, he was just another target on her radar.

The city lights blurred as Zbigniew vanished into the shadows, leaving behind only his whisper: "I'll be back."
