Noah Novák stepped out of his worn denim jacket, revealing a scattering of fresh bruises on his arms. He rubbed them absently, as if trying to erase the ache in more ways than one. It had been three months since he'd last spoken to his estranged father.

Noah's relationship with his family was complicated at best. His parents' messy divorce when he was just a kid left him with a deep-seated feeling of abandonment and insecurity. As he grew older, he found himself drifting further away from them – in both physical and emotional distance.

But it wasn't until the summer before college that Noah finally realized what was driving his behavior. He'd spent weeks trying to fill the void within himself, but nothing seemed to stick. The fleeting highs of partying and adrenaline-rush activities had numbed him more than he cared to admit.

A restless sleeplessness and a lingering sense of disconnection sent Noah on a cross-country road trip. He'd packed his battered old van with enough food and supplies for the journey ahead, hoping to lose himself in the open roads and rediscover what made him whole.

Driving through desolate landscapes, Noah felt his mind untangle like the threads of an unraveling blanket. Memories of happier times began to resurface – laughter-filled days spent building forts in the backyard with his little sister, late-night conversations about life's meaning with his father when he was younger.

The open road had a way of stripping away distractions, leaving only the wind, wheels humming, and endless miles stretching before him. Noah felt more himself than ever before as he watched sunrises over mountains, cradled between two worn armrests that now seemed like an extension of his own battered arms.

But when, after months of driving, the sun dipped below a mountain range and revealed a faint outline on the horizon – a small wooden sign reading "Welcome to Willow Creek" in wobbly letters – Noah hesitated. There was something he'd overlooked until now: his sister might be waiting for him there.
