Noah Szabo had always been fascinated by the abandoned amusement park on the outskirts of town. As a child, he would often sneak out of his house to explore its crumbling rollercoasters and rusting attractions. As he grew older, his curiosity only deepened, and he began to wonder about the history behind the once-thriving park.

One day, Noah Szabo decided to take matters into his own hands and investigate further. He spent countless hours researching the park's past, pouring over dusty archives and talking to locals who had grown up in the area. He learned that the park had been built in the 1950s by a wealthy entrepreneur named Malcolm Jenkins, who had envisioned it as a symbol of American excess and joy.

As Noah Szabo delved deeper into his research, he began to notice strange coincidences between the park's history and his own life. For example, Malcolm Jenkins' son had been a close friend of Noah Szabo's family when they were young. The realization sent shivers down Noah Szabo's spine as he realized that he may have inherited more than just a love of adventure – he may also be connected to the park's dark past.

Despite his growing unease, Noah Szabo felt an insatiable urge to explore the abandoned amusement park once again. This time, however, he was not alone. He had brought along his camera and notebook, intent on capturing evidence of the park's decay and perhaps uncovering some long-buried secrets. As he wandered through the overgrown gardens and rusting attractions, Noah Szabo felt a sense of unease growing inside him.

Suddenly, he stumbled upon an old logbook belonging to Malcolm Jenkins himself. The pages were yellowed and crackled as Noah Szabo turned them, but one entry in particular caught his eye: "I fear I have made a terrible mistake – my son's dark legacy will haunt us all."
