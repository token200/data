Noah Hiroki was a man in his mid-thirties, with an unassuming demeanor that belied a fierce determination within. He lived and breathed music, spending most of his days working as a sound engineer at a small recording studio in Brooklyn.

Despite the lack of recognition or accolades, Noah poured his heart and soul into every project he took on. He was particularly drawn to jazz, with its rich history and improvisational spirit. His own playing style was a fusion of traditional and modern techniques, blending classic jazz with contemporary influences.

Noah's passion for music had been sparked by his father, who had taught him how to play the saxophone as a child. After high school, Noah had pursued formal training at a prestigious music conservatory, but eventually, he found himself at odds with the traditional approach of playing only in concert halls and symphonies.

The more he listened to jazz musicians pushing the boundaries of their art form, the more Noah became convinced that this was where his own talents lay. So, after completing his studies, he dropped out of the conservatory and took a job as an assistant sound engineer at the studio mentioned above.

Over time, Noah honed his skills as a sound engineer and gradually began to make names for himself in the New York jazz scene. His unique touch and attention to detail earned him recognition from some of the biggest names in music. Some notable musicians came to him seeking advice and guidance on their recordings.
