Noah Corbero stepped off the train and onto the worn platform, the familiar scent of saltwater and seaweed filling his lungs. He had returned to the small coastal town of Ravenswood, where he grew up, for a visit with his family. His parents had passed away a few years ago, but his brother and sister still lived here, and Noah felt a sense of comfort in their presence.

As he made his way through the station, Noah's eyes scanned the crowd, searching for familiar faces. He spotted his sister, Emma, standing by the ticket counter, her bright blue hair a beacon in the drab surroundings. She waved at him as he approached, a smile spreading across her face.

"Hey, Noah!" she exclaimed, giving him a warm hug. "It's so great to see you!"

Noah smiled back, feeling a sense of belonging wash over him. "Hey, sis," he replied. "It's good to be here."

Emma led Noah through the winding streets of Ravenswood, pointing out old haunts and sharing stories about their childhood adventures. They walked past the old lighthouse, its beam slicing through the fog that rolled in off the sea.

As they strolled, Noah couldn't help but think about his own life. He had left Ravenswood after high school to pursue a career in music, moving to the city to play with various bands and working odd jobs to make ends meet. But despite his success, he felt unfulfilled, like something was missing.

As they approached their family's old house, Emma noticed Noah's expression and asked if everything was okay. Noah sighed, feeling a little guilty for not sharing his troubles with her sooner.

"It's just...I don't know what I want anymore," he admitted. "I feel lost, I guess."

Emma nodded sympathetically. "You'll figure it out, Noah Corbero," she said, using the full name that only family used. "You always do."
