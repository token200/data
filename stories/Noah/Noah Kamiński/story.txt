Noah Kamiński's eyes scanned the dimly lit alleyway, his trained gaze picking out every detail. A former CIA operative turned private investigator, he had seen it all - the good, the bad, and the ugly. His latest case had brought him to this seedy part of town, where the shadows seemed to writhe like living things.

He spotted a figure darting around the corner, weaving between trash cans and discarded crates. Noah's gut told him this was his target: a young woman with piercing green eyes and a mop of curly brown hair. Rumor had it she was running from the wrong people - or so her panicked message claimed.

As he followed the woman, his phone buzzed in his pocket. An anonymous text read: "Back off, Kamiński. This is beyond your pay grade." Noah snorted. Whoever was behind this knew he wouldn't be intimidated. He had a reputation to uphold, after all.

He emerged onto a crowded street, dodging pedestrians and taxis as he zeroed in on his quarry. The woman ducked into a dingy pub, her hand grasping at the sleeve of her jacket as if it might anchor her to reality. Noah smiled wryly; she was more likely to lose herself in the crowd than find safety.

Stepping inside, the bartender eyed him warily, but Noah flashed his PI badge. "I'm looking for a young woman," he said, scanning the room. A harried waitress spotted him and pointed to a corner booth near the window. That's where the green-eyed beauty sat, nursing a whiskey on the rocks.

Noah approached cautiously, not wanting to spook her. As he sat down across from her, she flinched, hand reaching for her jacket as if it might still be real. "Who are you?" she whispered.

"My name is Noah Kamiński," he said with a slow smile. "I'm here to help."

Her eyes searched his face, and for an instant, Noah thought he saw glimmer of trust. Then it was gone, replaced by determination. "You don't understand what's at stake," she warned. "You can't protect me."

Noah leaned forward, intrigued despite himself. Maybe this case wouldn't be a walk in the park after all.

The game had just begun, and he was ready to play.
