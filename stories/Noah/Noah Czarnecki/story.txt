Noah Czarnecki stared out at the rain-soaked streets of Brooklyn, his eyes tracing the outlines of the towering skyscrapers that seemed to stretch on forever. It was a typical New York morning - gray, damp, and chaotic. But for Noah, it was just another day.

As a private investigator, he'd grown accustomed to the city's gritty underbelly. He'd seen it all - from the seedy bars on 5th Avenue to the cramped alleys of Williamsburg. His latest case had brought him to this very spot, where a wealthy businessman named Marcus Thompson was rumored to be hiding something.

Noah pulled out his cigarette and lit it, blowing a stream of smoke into the chill air. He was supposed to meet Thompson in an hour, but he wasn't sure what to expect. The man's reputation for ruthlessness had preceded him - rumors whispered that Thompson would stop at nothing to get what he wanted.

Just as Noah was about to leave, his phone buzzed with a text from his sister, Rachel. "Hey, Neph! Just got out of the hospital. The doc says I'll be okay, but I need you to keep an eye on my stuff." Rachel had been in a terrible car accident over the weekend and was currently recovering at home.

Noah smiled wryly, feeling a pang of worry for his sister's well-being. He tucked away his phone and set off towards Thompson's high-rise office building. The streets were slick with rain as he made his way up to the lobby - security guards eyeing him warily as he flashed his PI badge.

Thompson was waiting for him, sipping a glass of scotch in a plush leather armchair. "Ah, Noah," he said, extending a manicured hand. "I see you're running a little behind schedule."

Noah took the handshake firmly, his eyes scanning Thompson's immaculate suit and perfectly coiffed hair. He knew this man was trouble - and he had a feeling their conversation would be short-lived.

"I'm here to discuss some... business," Noah said, producing a folder from his coat pocket. "I have reason to believe that you may not be telling me the whole truth about your dealings."

Thompson's smile faltered for an instant, before he regained his composure. "Oh? And what makes you think that?"

Noah smiled, feeling a thrill of anticipation. This was going to be fun.

The rain-soaked streets outside seemed to grow darker and more menacing as Noah began to peel back the layers of Thompson's deception.
