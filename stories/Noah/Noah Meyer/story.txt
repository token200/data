His colleagues questioned whether he was willing to sacrifice his own well-being for the sake of a good scoop.

Noah stood firm, undeterred by the criticism. He knew that his work had the power to shape public opinion, to bring about real change. As he sat at his desk, typing away into the late hours of the night, Noah felt a sense of purpose that went beyond just reporting the news – it was about shaping the world he lived in.
