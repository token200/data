Noah Saar walked into the small café, scanning the room for his friend, Ava. She was already seated at the table by the window, sipping on a cup of coffee and typing away on her laptop. Noah couldn't help but smile as he spotted her, feeling a sense of comfort in her presence.

As he waited in line to order, Noah's mind wandered back to their conversation earlier that morning. They had been discussing their plans for the upcoming summer, and Noah was excited to share his latest idea with Ava. He had always been passionate about photography, and this summer promised to be the perfect opportunity to capture some amazing shots.

When it was finally his turn to order, Noah took a seat next to Ava, who looked up from her laptop as he sat down. "Hey, what's up?" she asked, smiling warmly at him.

"Not much," Noah replied, unwrapping his scarf and taking a deep breath. "Just thinking about the summer. I was thinking of going on a road trip with my family."

Ava raised an eyebrow. "Where did you have in mind?"

Noah hesitated for a moment before launching into a passionate speech about the different landscapes he wanted to capture, from the rugged mountains to the serene lakes. Ava listened intently, her eyes sparkling with excitement as Noah's words painted vivid pictures of his vision.

As they finished their drinks and prepared to leave, Noah pulled out his phone and showed Ava some of his latest shots. There was a stunning sunset over the ocean, a misty forest at dawn, and a cityscape under the stars. Each image told a story, and Noah couldn't wait to share them with the world.

The rest of the evening flew by in a blur as they laughed and talked about everything from art to music. It was moments like these that reminded Noah why he loved spending time with Ava – she made him feel seen and heard in a way that few others did.

As they parted ways, promising to meet up again soon, Noah couldn't help but feel grateful for his friend and the adventures they would have together. With full heart and an empty camera, Noah walked out into the night, already looking forward to what the future held for him – and Ava – under the stars.
