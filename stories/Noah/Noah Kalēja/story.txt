Noah KalÄ“ja sat alone on the sandy beach, his eyes fixed on the waves crashing against the shore. As a former child soldier in the war-torn nation of Azalia, he had seen and experienced things no one should ever have to endure. But as he grew older, Noah found solace in the simple act of watching the ocean.

It was a habit he had adopted after escaping the brutal regime that had forced him into the fight when he was just a teenager. He had been a mere child then, with a future filled with hope and promise. Now, at 25, his past weighed heavy on his shoulders.

Noah's thoughts wandered back to the friends he had lost, the innocent lives cut short by the brutal hand of war. He thought of his mother, who had been killed in a bombing raid when he was just a child. His eyes stung as memories came flooding back.

As he sat there, lost in thought, a small child approached him cautiously. The boy couldn't have been more than 8 years old, with big brown eyes and a mop of curly hair. He looked up at Noah with curiosity, asking "Mister, why are you sitting here all alone?"

Noah hesitated for a moment before responding softly, "I'm just trying to watch the waves, kiddo. They remind me of my home, back when I was a kid."

The boy's eyes widened in understanding. "My mom says that sometimes watching the ocean makes her feel better too," he said with a smile.

Noah smiled back, feeling a sense of connection he hadn't experienced in years. For a moment, he forgot about his troubles and let himself be present. The waves washed away some of the pain and trauma, leaving him feeling lighter.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the horizon, Noah knew it was time to leave. He stood up, brushing off the sand, and offered the boy his hand. "It was nice meeting you, kiddo. Maybe we can watch the waves together sometime?"

The boy grinned and nodded enthusiastically before running off towards his family's makeshift shelter. As Noah watched him go, he felt a sense of hope rise within him. Perhaps, just perhaps, he could find redemption in this quiet, peaceful place, surrounded by beauty and innocence. And maybe, just maybe, he could start to heal.
