* Highly intelligent and calculating, always thinking several steps ahead to achieve his goals.

Despite his enigmatic nature, Almasbek has a deep fascination with human emotions and experiences. He is intrigued by Sophia's blue eyes, which seem to hold a sadness that resonates with him on some fundamental level. For the first time in years, he feels a spark of genuine interest and connection with someone - but it remains to be seen if this will lead to anything more profound than mere manipulation or exploitation.
