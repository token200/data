Here is a summary of the fictional character Almasbek Woźniak:

**Physical Attributes:** Woźniak stands at an unassuming height of 5'7" (170 cm) with an angular face and piercing green eyes that seem to gleam with intensity. His unruly brown hair often falls across his forehead, giving him a perpetually introspective air.

**Personality:** Woźniak is eccentric and reclusive, preferring the company of his inventions to people. He has a mischievous streak, often taking pleasure in watching others' reactions to his unconventional ideas. Despite being an outsider among his peers, he exudes confidence and conviction, which can be both captivating and unnerving.

**Interests:** Woźniak's passion lies in theoretical physics, particularly time and space theory. He is fascinated by the mysteries of the universe and spends countless hours studying, experimenting, and theorizing about ways to manipulate these fundamental forces. His other interests include collecting peculiar artifacts and observing the night sky for signs of hidden patterns or energies.

**Additional Details:** Woźniak has a fondness for old-fashioned clothing, often wearing worn tweed jackets and patterned trousers that seem out of place in modern Warsaw. He moves with an air of quiet purpose, as if every step is guided by a hidden force. His workshop, though labyrinthine, appears to be a reflection of his mind – cluttered with contraptions, symbols, and sketches that hint at the workings of his imagination.

Woźniak's love for the night sky and the whispers from beyond reality suggests he may have an intuitive connection to the cosmos, one that informs his inventions and fuels his curiosity. His obsession with time travel has become all-consuming, driving him to push the boundaries of what is thought possible, even if it means risking the perceptions of those around him.
