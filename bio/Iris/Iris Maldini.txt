She's intensely passionate about her work, willing to take risks and push boundaries to capture the perfect shot. Her sharp wit and quick tongue have earned her both admiration and respect from her peers, as she's never afraid to speak truth to power or challenge the status quo. Despite her tough exterior, Iris has a soft spot for underdogs and marginalized communities, which fuels her desire to tell stories that need to be told.

She's also an avid collector of cameras, lenses, and other equipment, often seeking out rare and unique pieces to add to her arsenal. As someone who thrives in the city, Iris is deeply attuned to its rhythms and textures, able to capture the essence of urban life with remarkable precision.

**Quirks and Habits:** Iris has a tendency to scribble notes on her camera settings and observations in a battered leather notebook, which she's filled with insights and sketches from years of photographing the city. She's also known to take breaks at local cafes, sipping strong coffee and people-watching as she refocuses and recharges for her next shoot.

**Goals:** Iris's ultimate goal is to continue pushing the boundaries of photography, using her platform to amplify the voices and stories of marginalized communities. She hopes to one day establish a network of photographers who share her vision, working together to create a more just and equitable world through the power of visual storytelling.
