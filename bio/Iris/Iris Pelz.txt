Here's a summary of Iris Pelz' personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Iris is a determined and resourceful private investigator. She has seen her fair share of dark alleys and seedy characters, but she doesn't let that deter her from taking on tough cases. She's sharp-witted and can hold her own in tense situations. However, as revealed in the story, she also has a vulnerable side, especially when it comes to her past.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'6" (168 cm) - petite but athletic build
* Eye Color: Brown - not mentioned in the original text, so I've filled in this detail

**Interests:** Iris is an avid coffee lover and has a favorite coffee shop in the city. She also seems to have connections with law enforcement, suggesting that she might be part of a larger network or organization.

Additional details:

* Iris' background: Given her interest in taking on high-profile cases and her ability to connect with Lena, it's possible that Iris comes from a working-class or middle-class family. Her determination to take down The Architect suggests that she may have experienced personal loss or trauma in the past.
* Personality traits: Iris is likely fiercely independent and self-reliant, which serves her well in her line of work. However, she may also be haunted by demons from her past, making it harder for her to form close relationships.
