Based on the story about Giorgio Cannavaro, I can create a fictional character profile for Mathieu Cannavaro. Please note that this information is not verified and is purely imaginative.

Name: Mathieu Cannavaro

Personality: Mathieu is an intelligent and introspective individual with strong leadership qualities. He possesses exceptional problem-solving skills and is known for his ability to remain calm under pressure. As a defender, he exudes confidence on the pitch, but off the field, he is humble and willing to listen.

Physical Attributes:

* Height: 183 cm (6 ft 0 in)
* Eye Color: Blue-Green
* Hair Color: Dark Brown

Interests:

* Mathieu is an avid reader of historical non-fiction books and enjoys learning about ancient civilizations.
* He is a passionate traveler, having visited over 20 countries across Europe, Asia, and South America. His favorite destination is the Italian Amalfi Coast.
* As a foodie, Mathieu loves exploring local cuisine in each city he visits. His weakness for gelato is well-known among his friends.

Mathieu's partnership with Giorgio Cannavaro (in this fictional scenario) would be an interesting dynamic, as both players share a similar leadership quality and tactical acumen on the pitch. However, their personalities might clash slightly due to Mathieu's more introverted nature, while Giorgio is known for his outgoing personality.

Again, please note that all of these details are purely imaginative, and there is no real information available about a fictional character named Mathieu Cannavaro.
