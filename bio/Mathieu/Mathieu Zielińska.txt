He is intensely curious and determined, as evident from his years-long pursuit of unlocking the Fibonacci sequence's deepest secrets. Despite his singular focus on science, he also seems to have a more introspective side, as hinted at by his momentary questioning of whether the secrets of life are just beyond the realm of code.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'11" (180 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue, with a hint of green around the edges
