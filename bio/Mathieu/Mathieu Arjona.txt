Despite this, Mathieu is a sensitive soul with a rich inner life, and his art reveals a depth and complexity that speaks to the human condition.

His hair is likely dark brown or black, with a slight wave to it, and his skin has a warm, golden undertone, as if he spends a lot of time outdoors.

**Interests:** Mathieu's art is his greatest passion, and he pours his heart and soul into each piece. He is drawn to the ocean and its moods, often depicting the sea in his paintings.
