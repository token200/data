Based on the inspiration from Mathieu Kors' life story, I've created a fictional character profile for Mathieu Kortajarena:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep brown with hints of gold
* Hair Color: Dark chestnut brown with subtle waves
* Facial Features: Chiseled cheekbones, prominent jawline, and a small nose

**Personality:**

* Mathieu Kortajarena is a creative soul with a dry sense of humor. He's witty and charming, but also has a vulnerable side that he only reveals to those closest to him.
* As an artist, he's fiercely passionate and dedicated to his craft. He's always pushing himself to innovate and explore new sounds.
* Despite his growing fame, Mathieu remains humble and grounded. He's deeply connected to his roots and values authenticity in all aspects of life.

**Interests:**

* Music is, of course, Mathieu's first love. He's a self-taught guitarist and songwriter who draws inspiration from various genres, including rock, soul, and French folk.
* Poetry and literature are also great passions of his. He's an avid reader and has published several volumes of poetry under a pseudonym.
* Travel and exploration are essential to Mathieu's creative process. He loves immersing himself in different cultures and meeting new people who share his passion for art.

**Additional Quirks:**

* Mathieu has a habit of collecting vintage guitar picks from concerts he attends, which he stores in a special box as mementos.
* Before each show, he performs a pre-stage ritual to calm his nerves â€“ sipping tea, journaling, and playing a few chords on his guitar.
* Despite his stardom, Mathieu still lives a relatively simple life. He's close with his family and values quiet nights at home with good books and music.

This fictional character profile captures the essence of Mathieu Kors' inspiring story, while introducing new dimensions to his personality, interests, and quirks.
