Based on the short story, here is a summary of Mathieu Wei's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Mathieu is portrayed as a brilliant and driven individual with a strong passion for mathematics. He is intensely focused on unlocking the secrets of number theory and has spent years studying the works of great mathematicians. Despite his intellectual curiosity, Mathieu also appears to be introverted and uncertain at times, struggling with self-doubt when faced with the enormity of his research. However, this uncertainty is tempered by his determination and drive to crack the code.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no specific physical attributes are mentioned in the story beyond height and eye color. For the sake of completion, let's assume that Mathieu Wei is:

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown

**Interests:** Mathieu's interests are centered around mathematics, particularly number theory. He is fascinated by the idea that there might be hidden patterns and codes buried within numbers, which drives his research. Outside of mathematics, it can be inferred that Mathieu has an interest in puzzles and brain teasers, as evidenced by his childhood hobby of solving logic problems and cryptograms.

Other interests may include:

* Reading: Mathieu is mentioned to have a vast collection of dusty tomes on mathematics, suggesting he also enjoys reading about the subject.
* Problem-solving: As someone who solves logic problems and cryptograms in their free time, it's likely that Mathieu enjoys other types of problem-solving activities as well.

It's worth noting that these details are not explicitly mentioned in the original story, but can be inferred based on the narrative.
