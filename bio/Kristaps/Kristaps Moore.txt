Kristaps is an introverted yet driven individual who has a passion for cryptography that borders on obsession. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often finding himself at odds with authority figures who fail to understand or appreciate his work. This independence can sometimes lead to Kristaps being perceived as aloof or standoffish by those who don't know him well.
