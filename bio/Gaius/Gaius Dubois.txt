Here is a summary of Gaius Dubois's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Gaius Pierre Marcel Dubois stands at an impressive 6'2" with an athletic yet lean build, allowing him to move with ease and agility. His piercing green eyes seem to gleam with mischief, as if constantly calculating his next move. His dark hair is often impeccably styled, framing his sharp jawline and pointed chin.

**Personality:**
Dubois exudes confidence and charisma, commanding attention without even trying. He has a natural ability to read people, using this skill to manipulate situations to his advantage. As the leader of "The Shadowhand," he is calculating, intelligent, and ruthless when necessary. Despite his tough exterior, Dubois has a dry sense of humor and a hint of vulnerability, often hidden beneath his cunning smile.

**Interests:**
Dubois's interests are centered around high-stakes thievery, art appreciation, and fine living. He has an eye for rare and valuable artifacts, as seen in the London museum heist. His love for luxury is matched only by his passion for outsmarting those who seek to capture him. When not pulling off daring heists, Dubois enjoys indulging in fine wines, exquisite cuisine, and high-society events.

It's worth noting that these attributes are inferred from the short story, but I've tried to create a comprehensive picture of Gaius Dubois based on his actions and reputation as "The Fox."
