Here is a summary of Gaius Petrov's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Gaius Petrov appears to be a complex and introspective individual. As a high-ranking member of the Galactic Union's Council of Leaders, he has likely developed a strong sense of politics and intrigue. However, his willingness to speak candidly with his friend Victor about the council's petty squabbles suggests that he may not always be as polished or composed as one might expect from a leader. Petrov also seems to have a dry sense of humor, evident in his wry smile when ordering whiskey. His interactions with Maya reveal a deeper side of him, hinting at a strong sense of conviction and purpose.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel

While the story doesn't provide an exhaustive description of Petrov's physical appearance, we can infer his height from his presence in the bar and his commanding role as a high-ranking member of the council. The hazel eye color adds a touch of warmth and nuance to his overall appearance.

**Interests:** As a member of the Council of Leaders, Gaius Petrov likely has many responsibilities and commitments, but he also seems to have interests outside of politics. Ordering whiskey at Victor's bar suggests that he enjoys relaxation and indulgence. His conversation with Maya about shaking off the weight of council politics implies a desire for meaning and purpose beyond his professional life.

It's worth noting that the story doesn't provide extensive details on Petrov's personal life, relationships, or interests beyond the initial whiskey-fueled conversation with Victor and Maya. However, based on the short passage, we can infer some aspects of his personality and physical appearance.
