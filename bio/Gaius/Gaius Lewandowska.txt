He's an introverted and intense individual who wears his emotions on his sleeve, often to the point of being unsettling to those around him. His obsession with Ludwig von Krause has become all-consuming, driving him to push boundaries and take risks that leave others worried for his well-being.

Despite this, Gage exudes a quiet confidence and authority in his field, which is evident in the way he commands attention and expects respect from those who know him.

He's also an avid collector of rare books, manuscripts, and artifacts related to the German painter and the hidden society surrounding him.

Gage's all-consuming passion for the mystery surrounding Ludwig von Krause has led him down a rabbit hole of intrigue, danger, and personal discovery, threatening to upend his life in ways he may not fully comprehend or control.
