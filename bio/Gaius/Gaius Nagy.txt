He is a former Roman soldier who has grown disillusioned with the imperialist ambitions that led to countless wars and bloodshed in the name of Rome's greatness.

As he navigates his newfound purpose, Gaius displays a sense of conviction and resolve, willing to risk everything for what he believes is right.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
