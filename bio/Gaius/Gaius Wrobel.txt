**Physical Attributes:** Gaius is a tall, slender man with an unassuming presence. His height is around 6'2" (188 cm), allowing him to appear even more reserved and introspective when standing next to others. His eye color is a striking piercing blue, often described as "ice-blue" by those who have seen it. His hair is dark brown, always neatly combed and slightly tousled, giving him an air of quiet elegance. He wears wire-rimmed spectacles perched on the end of his nose, adding to his intellectual aura.

**Personality:** Gaius Wrobel is a complex individual shrouded in mystery. Few people have seen him smile, making him appear aloof and enigmatic. However, once he opens up about a subject he's passionate about, such as ancient texts or mythology, his enthusiasm becomes contagious, drawing others into his world. He possesses a dry sense of humor, often slipping in witty remarks that catch those around him off guard. Despite his reserved nature, Gaius has a deep empathy for others and can become fiercely protective of the people he cares about.

**Interests:** As a master of ancient texts, Gaius Wrobel's interests revolve around literature, history, and mythology. He is particularly fond of classical works like Homer's "The Iliad" and "The Odyssey". His knowledge spans centuries, and he has a deep appreciation for the cultural and historical contexts that shaped these texts. He also enjoys exploring forgotten civilizations, mythological creatures, and the symbolism behind them.

In his free time, Gaius might be found lost in his bookshop, surrounded by dusty tomes and ancient scrolls, or engaging in lively debates with fellow scholars at local universities. Despite his reclusive nature, he has a hidden sense of adventure and longs to explore the world beyond his doorstep, sharing his knowledge and passion for life with others.
