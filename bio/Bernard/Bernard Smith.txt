His eyes are a deep shade of brown that seem to hold a world of wisdom and understanding, which may contribute to the air of mystery surrounding him.

**Personality:** Bernard is a complex and multifaceted individual, both enigmatic and humbly aware of himself. He has an introspective personality, often lost in thought and with a rich inner life. Despite his reclusive nature, he has a deep love for connection with others, as evidenced by his willingness to meet with Emma and share his writing process. Those who know him speak of his incredible attention to detail, creativity, and ability to tap into the human experience.

He has a deep love for literature in general and is particularly drawn to modernism and traditional forms. His writing style is characterized by its unique blend of complexity, personal depth, and universality.
