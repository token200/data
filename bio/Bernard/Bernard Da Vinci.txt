Based on the short story provided, here is a summary of Bernard Da Vinci's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**
Bernard Da Vinci is described as a "peculiar fellow" who has an uncanny knack for inventing and creating things that often leave people scratching their heads. He seems to be humble and open to new ideas, as evidenced by his willingness to work with Leonardo on the miniature city project. His creativity and innovative spirit are traits that make him stand out.

**Physical Attributes:**
- **Height:** Bernard's height is not explicitly mentioned in the story.
- **Eye Color:** Unfortunately, no information about his eye color is provided.

**Interests:**
Bernard Da Vinci has an obvious passion for inventing and creating innovative devices. His interests seem to be centered around understanding and replicating natural phenomena (such as water movement), and combining science with art to create something entirely new. He appears to have a curiosity-driven approach, often collaborating with others like Leonardo to push the boundaries of his work.

It's also worth noting that Bernard seems to value creativity over perfection or practicality in many situations - his clockwork device for simulating water is presented as an end in itself rather than a means to a more practical end. This focus on innovation could be an area where he draws inspiration from Leonardo, with whom he forms a creative partnership.
