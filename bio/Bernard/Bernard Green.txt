Here is a summary of the fictional character Bernard Green:

**Physical Attributes:** Bernard is a man in his mid-40s with an unkempt appearance that complements his enigmatic personality. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic yet slender build, allowing him to move easily through the city's hidden corners. His eyes are an unnerving shade of indigo, almost purplish in hue, which seems to hold a thousand secrets. His dark hair is often unkempt, and his weathered skin speaks of a life spent exploring the city's underbelly.

**Personality:** Bernard is an intensely curious individual with a passion for uncovering the unknown. He is driven by a desire to understand the world around him, often at the expense of his own well-being. His obsession with urban legends and myths borders on fanaticism, making him a self-proclaimed "expert" in the field. Despite this, Bernard has a deep respect for those who possess knowledge or insight into the mysteries he seeks to uncover.

**Interests:** Bernard's interests are centered around the realm of urban legends, mythology, and the paranormal. He spends most of his free time researching, interviewing reclusive informants, and exploring hidden corners of the city. His work often takes him down dark alleys, abandoned tunnels, and into the company of strangers who possess secrets he seeks to uncover.

**Hobbies:** When not investigating urban legends, Bernard enjoys pouring over dusty bookstores, sifting through ancient texts, and scouring online forums for clues. He is also a skilled photographer, capturing images of the city's hidden corners that tell stories of their own.

**Quirks:** Bernard has an uncanny ability to sense when someone else is onto something extraordinary, often leading him to seek out those who possess a deep understanding of the mysteries he seeks to uncover. His obsession with Echoes, in particular, has become an integral part of his life's work, driving him to explore even the most unlikely corners of the city.

Overall, Bernard Green is a complex individual driven by a desire to understand the world around him. His passion for urban legends and mythology makes him both a compelling investigator and an unwitting ambassador for the mysteries he seeks to uncover.
