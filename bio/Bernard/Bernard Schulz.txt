**Personality:** Bernard appears to be introverted and introspective, with a strong sense of disillusionment and dissatisfaction with his current life. He struggles with feelings of being unfulfilled and restless, but also exhibits resilience and determination when it comes to pursuing his passion for art. There is an underlying passion and creativity that has never truly faded, even if it was pushed aside by the pressures of adulthood.

**Physical Attributes:** Bernard's physical appearance is not extensively described in the story, but based on the age mentioned (35), one could imagine him to be average height, possibly around 5'10" or 175 cm. His eye color is not specified, so let's assume a pair of brown eyes that seem to hold a depth of emotion and intensity.

**Interests:** Bernard's primary interest is art, which has been a passion for him since childhood. He loves sketching, painting, and expressing himself through colors and textures. In the story, it's revealed that he had even considered pursuing art as a career in the past, but was encouraged to settle for something more "stable." This reveals his creative side and desires for self-expression.

Additional interests that can be inferred from the story include:

* Music: The fact that Bernard scrolls through social media posts while watching the news on TV suggests he might enjoy listening to music or has a connection to it in some way. Perhaps he's someone who appreciates art house films, classical music, or indie rock.
* Reading: As an accountant and an art enthusiast, Bernard likely has diverse interests outside of his day job. He spends time reading art books in college, which suggests he values learning and intellectual pursuits.
