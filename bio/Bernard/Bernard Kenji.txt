Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Bernard Kenji:

**Personality:** Bernard Kenji is a pragmatic and calculating individual with an unnerving ability to read people and situations. He has developed a keen intuition that allows him to navigate complex social dynamics with ease. However, beneath his reserved exterior lies a ruthless pragmatist who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals. His reputation among Tokyo's underworld and connections to powerful figures suggest a level of sophistication and cunning.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'11" (180 cm)
* Eye Color: An unnerving shade of blue that seems almost otherworldly
* Face Shape: Chiseled features with a sharp jawline, giving him a chameleon-like ability to blend into his surroundings

**Interests:** Bernard's primary interest lies in uncovering hidden secrets and understanding the motivations of those around him. He is drawn to the shadows, where he can observe and learn without being seen. His skills as a "watcher" have earned him a reputation among Tokyo's underworld, and he has developed a network of connections that serve as his most valuable asset.

Additionally, Bernard seems to be intrigued by the occult and supernatural forces at work in the world. The golden statue he retrieved from the subway system had an unusual effect on him, hinting at a deeper connection between himself and its dark magic. It is possible that Bernard's interests lie not only in uncovering secrets but also in exploring the mysterious and often sinister forces that lurk beneath the surface of Tokyo's streets.

It's worth noting that Bernard's backstory suggests that he has had to develop strong survival instincts due to his upbringing on the streets of Tokyo. This harsh environment has likely shaped his personality and worldview, making him a resilient and resourceful individual who is always on the lookout for the next opportunity or threat.
