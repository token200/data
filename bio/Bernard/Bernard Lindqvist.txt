* Hair: Dark brown, often worn long and unkempt, with hints of auburn undertones that seem to deepen in intensity when he's fully absorbed in his art.
* Build: Lean and athletic, with a wiry physique that speaks to his years of exploring the Swedish wilderness and traveling abroad.

**Personality:**

* Bernard is an enigmatic figure, shrouded in mystery. He exudes an air of quiet confidence, as if he knows secrets that no one else can begin to grasp.
* Despite his reclusive nature, there's a sense of intensity and passion about him that commands attention. When he speaks, his words are laced with conviction and insight, making those who listen feel like they're being privy to a hidden truth.
* Bernard is fiercely individualistic, unwilling to conform to the expectations of others or compromise his artistic vision. This independence has earned him both admiration and resentment from those who see him as an outsider.

**Interests:**

* Bernard is deeply interested in exploring the mysteries of the human psyche, delving into themes of identity, existence, and the subconscious. His art often serves as a reflection of these interests, inviting viewers to confront their own fears, desires, and aspirations.
* He's an avid collector of rare books on mythology, folklore, and mysticism, often using these texts as inspiration for his artistic endeavors.
* Bernard is also known to be fascinated by the night sky, spending hours gazing up at the stars and contemplating the infinite possibilities that lie beyond our terrestrial realm.

**Other characteristics:**

These details, though fictional, capture the essence of the enigmatic artist as described in the original inspiration.
