Based on the life and achievements of Andrea Bocelli, I have created a fictional character profile for Bernard Bocelli:

**Physical Attributes:**
Bernard Bocelli stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with a lean and athletic build. His eyes are an striking shade of dark blue, often described as deep and soulful. He has unruly brown hair that he frequently styles in a messy, effortless manner.

**Personality:**
Bernard is known for his charming and affable nature, making him a beloved figure in the music industry. Despite facing numerous challenges throughout his life, including losing his sight at a young age, he remains incredibly resilient and determined. He is fiercely passionate about his craft and is constantly driven to push himself creatively.

**Interests:**
Bernard has a deep love for classical music, opera, and musical theater. He is particularly fond of the works of Verdi and Puccini, and often incorporates these influences into his own performances. In his free time, he enjoys practicing piano and exploring new culinary recipes from around the world.

While Bernard shares some similarities with Andrea Bocelli, this fictional character's profile has been crafted to be distinct while still capturing the essence of the Italian tenor's spirit.
