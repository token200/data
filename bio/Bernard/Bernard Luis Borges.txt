Based on the inspiration from Jorge Luis Borges' literary legacy, I've created a fictional character profile for Bernard Luis Borges:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep Brown with hints of gold, reminiscent of ancient manuscripts
* Hair: Dark brown, often unkempt and falling across his forehead in wisps
* Face: Strong jawline, high cheekbones, and piercing brown eyes that seem to hold a thousand secrets
* Skin: Pale, almost translucent, as if he spends too much time buried in the pages of old books

**Personality:**

* Bernard is an introverted and enigmatic individual with a passion for discovery. He is drawn to the unknown and the obscure, often finding himself at the crossroads of reality and fantasy.
* His mind is sharp, and his curiosity knows no bounds. He can spend hours lost in thought, devouring new ideas and concepts like they were pages from an ancient tome.
* Despite his obsession with knowledge, Bernard has a dry sense of humor and enjoys poking fun at himself and the world around him.
* As he delves deeper into his research, Bernard becomes increasingly detached from reality. He starts to lose track of time, often forgetting about the outside world as he becomes lost in the pages of his manuscripts.

**Interests:**

* Bernard's primary interest is the pursuit of knowledge and understanding. He devours books on philosophy, history, mythology, and science, always seeking new insights and perspectives.
* He has a particular fascination with ancient civilizations, mystical traditions, and forgotten cultures. The more obscure and lesser-known, the better.
* As an avid bibliophile, Bernard is always on the lookout for rare manuscripts, ancient texts, and hidden libraries. He believes that the secrets of the past hold the key to understanding our present and future.
* In his free time (which he rarely has), Bernard enjoys reading aloud from his favorite books, reciting poetry, or engaging in intellectual debates with like-minded individuals.

**Quirks:**

* Bernard often talks to himself when alone, debating philosophical concepts and pondering life's great mysteries.
* He has a tendency to lose himself in the pages of his manuscripts, sometimes forgetting where he is or what day it is.
* Despite his obsessive nature, Bernard remains surprisingly organized and methodical. His notes and annotations are meticulous and detailed, allowing him to quickly navigate complex ideas and concepts.

As the story progresses, Bernard's obsession with the ancient manuscript will continue to grow, driving him deeper into the world of mystery and wonder. Will he uncover the secrets hidden within its pages, or will his fixation consume him entirely? Only time will tell.
