Here is a summary of Jasper's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Jasper appears to be empathetic, understanding, and patient. Despite being frustrated with Rachel's repeated lateness, he quickly puts himself in her shoes and tries to understand her situation. He also seems to be fiercely loyal and willing to make excuses for those he cares about.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel

**Interests:** Based on the story, it can be inferred that Jasper enjoys:

* Spending time with his loved ones, such as Rachel
* Taking social media breaks to scroll through and catch up on people's lives (as evidenced by his discovery of Rachel's post)
* Reading or following other people's posts online
* Possibly reading or writing books (although this is not explicitly stated)

Additionally, Jasper seems to value reliability, loyalty, and support in relationships. He doesn't demand perfection from others but tries to provide understanding and patience when needed.

As a bonus detail: It's possible that Jasper has some sort of creative side, possibly related to his job at the marketing department (since he works with Emily).
