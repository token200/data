He's a master manipulator, always staying one step ahead of his marks (whether they're wealthy merchants or innocent bystanders).

**Interests:** It appears that Jasper is an expert thief and con artist, which suggests a high level of cunning and adaptability. He's clearly highly skilled in the art of deception and can think on his feet. Additionally, he seems to be interested in high-stakes challenges and the thrill of outsmarting his opponents (as evidenced by his decision to take on Marcellus Thorne's heavily guarded mansion).
