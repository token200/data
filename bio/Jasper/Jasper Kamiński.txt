As a former smuggler turned rogue operative, he has developed a strong moral compass and a keen intuition for navigating high-stakes situations. Despite his tough exterior, he has a dry sense of humor and a tendency to attract people who challenge him and push him out of his comfort zone.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark blue or navy, possibly with a hint of green around the iris
* Facial Structure: Strong jawline, angular cheekbones, and piercing eyes that seem to bore into those he meets
* Build: Lean and athletic, with broad shoulders and a wiry physique honed from years of physical labor and combat training

**Interests:** Jasper is deeply interested in:

* High-stakes negotiations and deal-making
* Tracking down high-value targets for acquisitions (as hinted at by Lena)
* Exploring the underworld of the city, gathering information, and staying one step ahead of his enemies
* Uncovering secrets and piecing together seemingly unrelated events to reveal a larger truth
* Pushing himself beyond his limits, testing his skills, and confronting his own demons

It's worth noting that Jasper's interests may evolve over time as he forms an alliance with Ewa and becomes embroiled in her mysterious operations.
