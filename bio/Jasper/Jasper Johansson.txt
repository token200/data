Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Jasper Johansson's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**
Jasper appears to be a introspective and analytical person, with a strong curiosity for the truth. He is driven by a desire to uncover answers to questions he couldn't quite put into words. This suggests that he is a thoughtful and determined individual who is not easily swayed from his goals. Despite his dedication to his work, Jasper also seems to be haunted by the quiet moments and the echoes of what-ifs, indicating that he may have some emotional scars or personal demons.

**Physical Attributes:**
Height: Jasper's height is not explicitly mentioned in the story, but based on the description of his apartment as "small", it can be inferred that he is likely a shorter person. Let's assume he stands around 5'6"-5'8" (168 cm - 173 cm).

Eye Color: Jasper's eye color is not specified in the story, but considering his introspective nature and analytical personality, let's say they are a deep, piercing brown that seems to bore into those he meets.

**Interests:**
Jasper is clearly fascinated by books, research, and investigation. As a private investigator, he has an extensive knowledge of various subjects and is always on the lookout for new leads. His interest in his grandmother's work as a journalist also suggests that he values truth-telling and journalistic integrity. Additionally, Jasper seems to be drawn to the mysterious and the unknown, which drives him to continue working on complex cases despite the uncertainty and danger involved.

Other possible interests or hobbies that can be inferred from the story include:

* Researching and collecting obscure knowledge (evident by his stacks of dusty books)
* Writing and communication (as he types out urgent messages on his laptop)
* Analyzing patterns and connections (he spends hours poring over pages, searching for answers)

It's worth noting that these are inferences based on a short story, and more details about Jasper's personality, physical attributes, and interests would be needed to create a more comprehensive profile.
