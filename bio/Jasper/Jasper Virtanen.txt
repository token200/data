Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Jasper Virtanen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing blue
- Hair: Dark brown, likely styled in a practical manner to suit his work as a private investigator
- Build: Lean, athletic build from years of physical activity

**Personality:**
Jasper Virtanen appears to be a professional and calculating individual who approaches each case with skepticism. However, as the story progresses, it becomes clear that he has a dry sense of humor and an ability to empathize with others when his investigations lead him to genuinely care about their well-being. Despite being driven by financial gain initially (to solve Lena's mysterious disappearance), Jasper's personality develops into a mix of curiosity and genuine concern for Lena.

**Interests:**
- Music, particularly opera
- Investigation and solving mysteries
- Physical fitness and staying in shape

Jasper seems to have a particular interest in the world of opera, as hinted at by his discovery that Lena was a famous opera singer. This interest likely developed from his initial case with Lena and has since become a fascination for him.

Additionally, Jasper appears to be someone who values independence and precision in their work, given the fact that he is described as having navigated through an alley with ease despite knowing his surroundings weren't typical of private investigator environments. His keen instincts and willingness to follow clues also suggest a strong analytical mind.

It's worth noting that Jasper seems to have a somewhat introverted nature or at least prefers to keep himself separate from others, especially in the initial stages of their case, suggesting he values his own independence while still being drawn into Lena's web of deceit.
