Here's a summary of Jasper Roux's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jasper is a confident and calculating individual, having honed his skills as a high-ranking officer in the South African Police Service's Special Task Force. He is intelligent and resourceful, able to piece together seemingly unrelated clues to form a comprehensive picture of a case. Despite his tough exterior, he has a strong sense of justice and will go to great lengths to uncover the truth, even if it means taking risks.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Blue-Grey (a piercing blue that seems to shift depending on the light)

**Interests:** Jasper's interests are largely centered around his work as a detective and anti-corruption officer. He is fiercely dedicated to uncovering the truth and bringing those responsible for corruption and violence to justice. In his free time, he enjoys reading about history and politics, and is particularly interested in studying the cases of legendary detectives like Sherlock Holmes.

Outside of work, Jasper has few hobbies or interests beyond a passion for whiskey (which he uses to calm his nerves after a long day). He values his alone time and prefers to spend it recharging rather than engaging in leisure activities.
