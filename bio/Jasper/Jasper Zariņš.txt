Here's a summary of Jasper Zariņš' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Jasper is approximately 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with an athletic yet lean build. His eyes are piercing blue, a trait that seems almost unnatural in the dark and gritty world he inhabits. His dark hair is often styled neatly, giving him an air of sophistication that contrasts with his rough-around-the-edges profession.

**Personality:**
Jasper is a complex individual with a deeply rooted moral compass. He has a strong sense of justice, which stems from his experiences as a former KGB agent turned freelance "fixer". This background has taught him to be resourceful, intelligent, and fiercely independent. Despite the rough exterior, Jasper has a certain vulnerability and empathy that drives him to protect those in need.

**Interests:**
Jasper's interests are eclectic and closely tied to his profession as a "fixer". He is highly skilled in surveillance, infiltration, and hand-to-hand combat, making these areas of expertise essential to his work. Outside of his work, Jasper seems to enjoy the finer things in life - good wine, fine art, and literature. His experiences have also given him a deep appreciation for history, particularly those events that shape the world's politics and economies.

It can be inferred that Jasper has an interest in rare artifacts like the gemstone he is involved with in the story.
