**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled in a short, stylish cut
* Face Shape: Oval, with sharp features and a determined expression

**Personality:** Joseph is a driven and analytical individual, known for his exceptional detective skills. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging the status quo to uncover the truth. His unwavering determination and strong sense of justice make him a formidable opponent in any investigation.
