**Personality:**
Joseph is a complex and creative individual with a troubled past. He's haunted by memories of his former life as a street artist, which has left emotional scars but also fueled his passion for art. Despite this, he's determined and driven to rediscover himself and express his creativity in meaningful ways. Joseph is introverted but charismatic, having a deep understanding of human emotions that allows him to connect with others on a deeper level.
