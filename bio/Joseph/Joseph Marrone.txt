He is content with keeping to himself but is not shy or reserved when it comes to sharing his passion for literature. As he gains confidence and recognition, he remains humble and kind, never forgetting where he came from.

**Physical Attributes:**

**Interests:** Joseph has a deep love for classic literature and writing. He is particularly fond of the works of authors like Charles Dickens and Jane Austen. In addition to reading, Joseph enjoys writing short stories and poetry, and he finds great joy in scribbling away in his journal. He also values his alone time and appreciates the quiet solitude that allows him to focus on his writing.

After acquiring the antique typewriter, Joseph's love for words and stories is further enhanced by the tactile experience of typing on an older machine, which seems to bring out a unique style in his writing.
