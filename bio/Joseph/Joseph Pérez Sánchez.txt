Based on the short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Joseph Pérez Sánchez:

Physical Attributes: Joseph Pérez Sánchez is a slender man with an unassuming appearance. He stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) with an average build. His eyes are a deep brown that seem to hold a quiet intensity, a trait that has often led people to underestimate him. His dark hair is thinning on the top, giving him a slightly elderly appearance that belies his true age.

Personality: Joseph Pérez Sánchez is a quiet and introspective person who has learned to navigate the world without drawing attention to himself. He is fiercely independent and prefers to work alone, but once you gain his trust, he opens up to reveal a deep passion for art, nature, and learning. Despite his success as a taxidermist, Joseph struggles with loneliness and feels like an outsider in his own town.

Interests: As mentioned in the story, Joseph has two main passions: taxidermy and the sea. He is an avid student of marine life, learning everything he can about their habits, habitats, and behaviors. His ultimate goal is to create a series of glass-eyed mermaids that seem to come alive in his workshop. In addition to his artistic pursuits, Joseph also enjoys exploring the coast with his friend Sofia, collecting sea creatures and specimens to inspire his next masterpiece.

Additional Traits: Despite being a skilled taxidermist, Joseph has a natural aversion to death and the supernatural. He finds it difficult to talk about his work or the people he has had to "preserve" over the years. This discomfort makes him wary of getting too close to others, but also drives him to create art that is both beautiful and meaningful.

Overall, Joseph Pérez Sánchez is a complex and multi-faceted character who is defined by his passions and his struggles with loneliness.
