**Physical Attributes:** Joseph is a tall and lean man in his late 40s or early 50s, likely standing around 6'2" (188 cm) with an athletic build. His piercing blue eyes are one of his most distinctive features, conveying a deep intensity and sharp intellect. His dark hair is flecked with grey, giving him a distinguished air.

**Personality:** Joseph is a man of few words, preferring to observe and listen rather than dominate conversations. However, when he speaks, his voice carries weight due to its measured tone and authoritative presence.

He is fiercely independent and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him.

**Interests:** Joseph's interests lie in solving puzzles and unraveling mysteries, particularly those related to the unexplained or supernatural. As a former naval officer, he has an appreciation for strategy and tactics, often applying these skills to his investigations. He is also drawn to ancient mythology and legends, which seems to have sparked his interest in Lena Andersson's research.

Overall, Joseph Johansson appears to be a complex and enigmatic figure, driven by a strong sense of justice and a determination to uncover the truth, no matter how elusive or sinister it may be.
