**Physical Attributes:** Joseph stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build, likely honed from his years as a mechanic. His hair is dark brown and messy, often falling across his forehead in a way that adds to his rugged charm. His eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to hold a wealth of emotion within them. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, likely from a childhood accident.

**Personality:** Joseph is a complex and introspective individual with a rich inner life. Despite his rough exterior, he has a compassionate heart and a deep empathy for others. As a musician, he is intensely passionate and dedicated to his craft, but as a person, he is also humble and willing to learn from others. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as introspective or even aloof at times, but those who get to know him soon discover that beneath his reserved exterior lies a deep well of kindness and vulnerability.

**Interests:** Music is Joseph's true passion, and he spends most of his free time practicing, writing songs, and performing. He is fascinated by the way music can evoke emotions and tell stories, and he finds inspiration in the streets and people around him. When not making music, Joseph enjoys fixing cars and working with his hands â€“ a nod to his mechanical past. He is also an avid listener of classic rock and folk music, often citing artists like Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie as influences.

In terms of interests beyond music, Joseph seems to be drawn to the stories and histories of his Polish-American community. He has a deep respect for the people and traditions that have shaped his identity, and he enjoys sharing these stories through his music and performances.
