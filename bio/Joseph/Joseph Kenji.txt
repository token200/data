Here is a summary of the fictional character Joseph Kenji:

**Physical Attributes:** Joseph Kenji stands at approximately 5'9" (175 cm) with an slender yet athletic build. His eyes are a deep shade of brown that seem to hold a world of depth and emotion, which complements his artistic personality. He has unruly dark hair that often falls across his forehead, adding to his introspective nature.

**Personality:** Joseph Kenji is a quiet and reserved individual who prefers to keep to himself, but as he found passion in photography, it brought him out of his shell. He becomes more confident and open with those he trusts, particularly the shopkeeper who introduced him to the world of photography. His creative spirit and love for learning make him an engaging conversationalist.

**Interests:** Joseph Kenji has a deep love for art, music, literature, and above all, photography. Photography is not just a hobby but an extension of his passion for storytelling and capturing the beauty in the world around him. He finds inspiration in exploring the city's hidden corners and learning from those who have mastered their craft.

Other missing details that I've added to Joseph Kenji's character:

* His height (5'9") was not explicitly mentioned, but it seems fitting given his slender yet athletic build.
* His eye color is a deep brown, which complements his artistic personality and introspective nature.
* The unruly dark hair adds to his introverted appearance, contrasting with the spark in his eyes when he talks about photography.

These details help bring Joseph Kenji's character to life, showcasing both his creative side and his unique physical presence.
