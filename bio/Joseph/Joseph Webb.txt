Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Joseph Webb:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown, with a hint of green around the iris
* Hair Color: Brown, often messy and unkempt
* Build: Lean and athletic, with a wiry physique

**Personality:**

Joseph Webb is a determined and resourceful private investigator with a dry sense of humor. He has a strong instinct for justice and will stop at nothing to solve cases that interest him. Joseph can come across as somewhat aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him, but he has a deep empathy for his clients and a strong sense of loyalty. He is fiercely intelligent and intensely focused on the details, which often helps him stay one step ahead of the game.

**Interests:**

Joseph's interests are centered around solving puzzles and uncovering hidden truths. He has a passion for forensic science, history, and criminology, which informs his investigative work. Outside of work, Joseph enjoys reading classic detective novels and watching old film noir classics. He is also an avid coffee connoisseur and can often be found sipping on a strong cup of joe at the local diner or at home in his cluttered office.

One missing detail from the original story that I filled in based on the character description is Joseph's profession as a private investigator, which is not explicitly stated.
