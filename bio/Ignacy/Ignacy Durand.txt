Here is a summary of Ignacy Durand's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Ignacy stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His dark brown hair is often messy and unkempt, adding to his rough-around-the-edges persona. He has a lean build from years of living on the streets, but has begun to fill out slightly since focusing more on his inventions.

**Personality:** Ignacy is a driven and ambitious individual with a passion for solving problems. His wit and cunning serve him well in both his personal and professional life, allowing him to navigate the complexities of the market with ease. However, this same focus can sometimes lead to neglecting his own well-being, as evidenced by his sister's concerns about his health. Despite this, Ignacy remains optimistic and determined, always seeing the world as a puzzle waiting to be solved.

**Interests:** As an amateur inventor, Ignacy is deeply interested in creating innovative solutions to real-world problems. He is particularly passionate about developing technologies that bring people together, rather than drive them apart. His latest project, a language translation device, showcases his creative problem-solving skills and desire to make a positive impact on the world.

In addition to his inventions, Ignacy also enjoys wandering through markets like the one in Krakow, taking in the sights and sounds of vibrant cities. He finds inspiration in the interactions between people from different cultures and backgrounds, and sees these encounters as an opportunity to learn and grow.
