Let us say that Ignacy stands at approximately 5'10" (178 cm) with a slender yet athletic build. His hair is dark brown and often unkempt, while his eyes are a piercing blue that seem to bore into those he meets. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during a particularly heated protest in his youth.

He is also fascinated by philosophy and economics, and enjoys analyzing complex social issues through a critical lens.
