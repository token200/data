Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Imanol Arjona:

**Personality:** Imanol appears to be a determined and courageous individual who is not afraid to take risks to uncover the truth. He has a strong sense of conviction and willpower, as evident from his refusal to back down despite being in danger. However, this bravery also comes with a hint of stubbornness, as he refuses to listen to Ana's warnings about going solo.

**Physical Attributes:** Imanol's physical appearance is not explicitly described in the short story. However, based on the context and the contrast between his rugged, risk-taking nature and the polished, determined woman Ana, it can be inferred that Imanol might have a lean build, possibly with a wiry physique, suitable for someone who has been living on the run for weeks.

Given his profession as a freelance journalist and his ability to evade danger without being caught off guard, I would imagine him to have a height of around 5'10" (178 cm), which allows him to navigate spaces efficiently while still maintaining an air of intimidation.

**Eye Color:** Unfortunately, his eye color is not explicitly mentioned in the short story. However, based on his character traits and background as a journalist, I would speculate that his eyes might be a deep brown or blue-green color, reflecting his resourcefulness and tenacity.

**Interests:** As a freelance journalist, Imanol's primary interest lies in uncovering the truth behind corruption scandals. His work is driven by a strong sense of justice and a desire to hold those in power accountable. Beyond this professional passion, little else about his personal interests can be inferred from the short story. However, it's likely that he enjoys research, investigation, and writing, as these skills are essential to his job.

Additionally, given Imanol's background on the run for weeks, he might have a strong appreciation for stealth, strategy, and tactics â€“ possibly derived from his survival instincts while evading danger.

**Hobbies:** Given his profession and circumstances, it's likely that Imanol's free time is spent researching new leads, writing articles, or practicing self-defense techniques to maintain his safety.
