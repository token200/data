Since Imanol Viljanen is a fictional character without any prior information, I'll create a unique personality profile for him. Here's a summary:

**Physical Attributes:**
Imanol Viljanen is a 5'11" (180 cm) tall young man with an athletic build. His hair is dark brown and messy, often falling across his forehead in a way that makes him look endearingly unkempt. His eyes are a deep shade of indigo, almost purple, which seems to sparkle when he's interested in something. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident, adding a hint of ruggedness to his otherwise soft features.

**Personality:**
Imanol is a free-spirited individual with a passion for exploring the unknown. He's always been drawn to unconventional careers and hobbies, often taking on projects that others might deem too ambitious or impractical. Despite this, he possesses a quiet confidence and determination that allows him to push through challenges and overcome obstacles. Imanol has a dry sense of humor and can come across as sarcastic at times, but beneath his tough exterior lies a compassionate heart and a deep empathy for those around him.

**Interests:**
Imanol's interests are eclectic and diverse, reflecting his adventurous nature. He's an avid rock climber, having scaled some of the most challenging routes in Europe. In his free time, he enjoys playing the guitar, writing poetry, and experimenting with various forms of alternative energy. Imanol is also a keen observer of human behavior and spends countless hours people-watching in cafes, parks, or public transportation, often scribbling notes and stories into a worn leather notebook.

**Other Details:**
Imanol hails from a small town in the Scottish Highlands, where he grew up surrounded by rolling hills, rugged landscapes, and a strong sense of community. He moved to the city for college, where he studied environmental science and began to develop his passion for sustainability and social justice. Now, Imanol travels extensively, working as a freelance writer and photographer, capturing stories about the intersection of technology and nature.
