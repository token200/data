**Personality:**

Juni Oja is a master manipulator, weaver of intricate webs of deception and charm. She exudes confidence and allure, using her beauty to enthrall those around her. Despite her reputation as the "Mistress of Shadows," Juni has grown tired of being objectified and used by suitors seeking to exploit her power. Instead, she revels in the shadows themselves, seeing them as an extension of her own dark magic.

As a teacher, Juni is demanding but fair, pushing her students to excel and master the art of shadow manipulation. She has a particular fondness for those who can see beyond the surface level and appreciate the complexity of her craft. Her patience and understanding are tempered by a sharp wit and a willingness to bend rules when necessary.

**Interests:**

* Shadow Manipulation: Juni's true passion is mastering the art of controlling and wielding shadows as a tool for magic.
* Artistry: She sees shadow manipulation as an art form, using her mastery to create complex illusions and deceptions that leave her enemies bewildered.
* Politics and Power: As the Mistress of Shadows, Juni is acutely aware of the importance of politics and power in shaping the underworld. She uses her network of allies and informants to influence events from behind the scenes.

In addition to these interests, Juni has a growing interest in helping Kael master his own shadow manipulation skills, and potentially exploring new ways of using magic that prioritize freedom over obligation. Her proposal with Kael marks a turning point in her journey, as she begins to question the status quo and seek out new opportunities for growth and self-discovery.
