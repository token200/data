Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Juni Meier's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**
Juni Meier appears to be an introspective and creative individual. She finds solace in art, using it as a way to process her emotions and observations about the world around her. Despite being surrounded by the chaos of city life, Juni seems detached from the rowdy teenagers who come into the café, having seen it all before. However, when she notices a young girl watching her with wide eyes, Juni shows kindness and takes the time to engage with Lily.

**Physical Attributes:**
Juni Meier is likely in her late teens or early twenties, given her independence and artistic pursuits. She has long, damp hair that she runs her hands through when she's anxious (as seen when shaking off rain outside). Her height is not specified, but based on the context of sitting in a booth by the window, it's possible she is slightly above average height.

Her eye color is described as warm and crinkly at the corners, which could be interpreted as being hazel or brown with golden undertones. Unfortunately, there are no other physical descriptions provided to further flesh out her appearance.

**Interests:**
Juni Meier has a passion for art, particularly drawing inspiration from city street murals that bring people together. She is drawn to the vibrant colors and energy of these murals, which seem to capture the essence of urban life.

In addition to her artistic pursuits, Juni appears to be a curious observer of human behavior, having noticed the ebb and flow of teenage energy in the café. Her ability to watch others with detachment suggests she may also enjoy observing people from afar, perhaps making her a quiet and introspective individual who prefers to keep to herself.

It's worth noting that Juniper Meier seems to be using a nickname "Juniper" instead of Juni Meier, which might imply that the character's full name is not widely known or used by those around her.
