**Physical Attributes:** Juni Petrenko stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is dark brown, often worn in loose waves that frame her heart-shaped face. Her eyes are an intense shade of green, almond-shaped and fringed with thick lashes that add to their allure. A smattering of light freckles across the bridge of her nose adds a touch of whimsy to her features.

**Personality:** Juni is a deeply emotional and introspective person, with a profound connection to the human experience. She has a rich inner life, and her art reflects this - her music and performances are raw, honest, and unflinchingly vulnerable. This intensity can make her come across as intense or even intimidating to those who don't know her, but beneath her reserved exterior lies a warm and empathetic soul.

**Interests:** Juni's passions lie at the intersection of art and emotion, where music, poetry, and storytelling converge. She is drawn to exploring the complexities of human relationships, love, loss, and the search for meaning in a chaotic world. In addition to performing, Juni is also an avid reader and collector of rare books, particularly those focused on psychology, philosophy, and mythology. She has a deep appreciation for nature and the great outdoors, often finding solace in solitary walks or hikes when her creative energies are overwhelming.
