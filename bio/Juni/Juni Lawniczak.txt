Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Juni Lawniczak's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Juni appears to be a feisty and adventurous person who values her friendships and memories. She is nostalgic for her childhood adventures with Janek "JD" Dąbrowski and seems to have a strong sense of purpose. Juni also seems to be someone who appreciates the simple things in life, such as sipping coffee at a quaint café.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story doesn't provide explicit details about Juni's height, but based on her comparison with JD's "gangly teenager" physique and his current confident young man appearance, it can be inferred that Juni is likely of average to slightly above-average height. Her eye color is not mentioned in the story, so I will make an educated guess that she has a shade of brown or hazel eyes similar to those often found in Polish people.

**Interests:** Juni's interests seem to be centered around nostalgia and reminiscing about her past adventures with JD. However, based on JD's mention of his passion for photography, it can be inferred that Juni might also have an interest in visual arts or capturing memories through photographs. Additionally, Juni seems to appreciate the beauty of Europe, as mentioned when JD is sharing his upcoming trip plans.

Keep in mind that these attributes are based on a limited story and may not be comprehensive representations of Juni's personality, physical attributes, and interests.
