**Personality:** Juni Wróbel is described as having an unwavering dedication to justice, unrelenting pursuit of the truth, incredible focus, determination, and passion. She is also shown to be tireless, driven by her conviction that she is closing in on the culprit. Her colleagues notice her tireless work ethic and keen eye for detail, indicating a strong sense of responsibility and commitment.
