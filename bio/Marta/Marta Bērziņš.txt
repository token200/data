Marta's eyes are a bright shade of hazel, reflecting her connection to nature and passion for birdwatching. Her long, dark brown hair is frequently tied in a ponytail, revealing a scattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose. She has a small tattoo of a sparrow on her left wrist, which serves as a symbol of her profession.
