Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Marta Meinstein's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Marta is a brilliant and reclusive physicist who is deeply focused on her research. She is driven by an all-consuming passion for understanding dark matter, which has led to her becoming increasingly isolated from the world outside of her laboratory. Despite this, she is shown to be fiercely protective of her findings and hesitant to share them with others due to fear of upsetting established theory. However, when she meets Sofia, a new dynamic is introduced, and Marta begins to see the value in collaboration and sharing her discoveries.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (172 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often pulled back into a tight ponytail
* Skin Tone: Olive-toned, with a subtle scattering of freckles across her cheeks

**Interests:** As mentioned in the story, Marta's primary interest is the study of dark matter and its properties. She spends most of her time researching and analyzing data related to this topic, often to the exclusion of other aspects of her life. However, as she begins to work with Sofia, it becomes clear that she is also interested in collaboration and sharing knowledge with others.

Other interests that can be inferred from the story include:

* Reading: Marta was known to spend hours pouring over papers by Einstein and Hawking in her father's dusty library.
* Coding: She is an expert programmer and spends a significant amount of time working on computer code related to her research.
* Experimentation: As a researcher, she enjoys conducting experiments and gathering data to support her theories.

It's worth noting that Marta's interests and personality traits are likely shaped by her intense focus on dark matter research, which has led to her becoming somewhat reclusive and isolated.
