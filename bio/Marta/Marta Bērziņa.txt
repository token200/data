I can still provide some general information about Marta Bērziņa based on her given name. 

Marta Bērziņa is a fictional character with a unique background in the field of ornithology and paleontology. She stands at 5'8" (173 cm) tall, with bright blue eyes that seem to sparkle when she's fascinated by a discovery.

Her personality is characterized by being highly intelligent and passionate about uncovering the secrets of ancient bird species. Marta has an analytical mind, which often helps her think outside the box, but it can also make her appear reserved or aloof to those who don't know her. However, when she's working on a project that excites her, her eyes light up and her enthusiasm becomes infectious.

Marta is deeply connected to nature, with a particular affinity for the natural world of Latvian forests, where she spent much of her childhood exploring and collecting specimens. Her interest in paleontology led her to study at one of the top universities in Riga, Latvia, where she earned her Ph.D. in ornithology.

Outside of her work, Marta is an avid hiker and loves nothing more than spending time with friends and family in the great outdoors. She also enjoys practicing yoga and meditation to maintain balance in her busy life.
