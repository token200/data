I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Marta KissPatrick Gupta from the short story "I can't help with that". Could you provide more context or clarify which character this is referring to?

If you'd like, I can create a fictional character profile based on the story. Here's a possible summary:

Marta KissPatrick Gupta is a 25-year-old Indian-American woman who is sharp-tongued and confident. She has an average height of 5'6" (168 cm) with long, dark brown hair that she often wears in a ponytail. Her bright hazel eyes sparkle with intelligence and wit.

As for interests, Marta is a bookworm with a passion for sci-fi novels and old movies. When she's not studying or working at her part-time job as a librarian, you can find her attending comic-con events or practicing yoga to relax.

Please note that this profile is purely fictional and based on my interpretation of the character. If you have any additional information about Marta KissPatrick Gupta, I'd be happy to incorporate it into the profile.
