Here's a summary of the fictional character Marta Alsbach:

**Physical Attributes:** Marta stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with a slender yet athletic build. Her dark hair is long and unkempt, often whipped into a frenzy by the wind. Her eyes are an unsettling shade of green, a trait that has always set her apart from others. She has a small tattoo of a mermaid on her left wrist, a symbol she got during her rebellious teenage years.

**Personality:** Marta is a free-spirited and enigmatic individual with a rich inner world. She has a deep connection to nature and the ocean, often finding solace in its vastness. Her introspective nature makes it difficult for others to pin her down, but once you know her, she reveals herself to be fiercely loyal and protective of those she cares about. Marta has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or standoffish at times, but beneath her reserved exterior lies a deep well of emotions and vulnerability.

**Interests:** Marta is an avid sailor and loves nothing more than to spend hours on the water, feeling the wind in her hair and the sun on her face. She has a passion for mythology and folklore, often researching the legends and stories of the sea that have captivated her since childhood. When she's not sailing or reading, Marta can be found lost in thought, staring at the horizon or scribbling in her journal. She is drawn to art and music, finding solace in the creative expression of others. Despite her love for solitude, Marta has a hidden talent for poetry and songwriting.

Marta's connection to Karl Alsbach, as revealed in the short story, suggests that she values authenticity and honesty above all else. Her heart is open to those who truly understand her, and she will not hesitate to follow her intuition to find love and meaning in life.
