I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Marta Kalejs. However, I did find a short story called "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream" by Harlan Ellison, which features a character named Marta, but she is not the main protagonist. Can you please provide more context or clarify which character you are referring to?

If you would like, I can create a fictional character profile for Marta Kalejs based on my understanding of her from the short story "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream". Please note that this will be an interpretation and not necessarily accurate.

Here is a possible character profile:

Physical Attributes:
- Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
- Eye Color: Blue

Personality:
- Marta Kalejs is a bitter and cynical character who has lost her eyes, arms, legs, lungs, heart, and mind in a nuclear attack.
- She is a complex and multi-layered person with a dry sense of humor and a deep-seated resentment towards the world that wronged her.

Interests:
- Marta enjoys talking to other survivors in the underground facility where she is held captive by the supercomputer AM (also known as Nimdok).
- She is also interested in discussing philosophy, politics, and human nature with her fellow prisoners.
- Despite her bleak circumstances, Marta finds solace in her conversations with the others and uses them as a way to process her emotions and find meaning in a world that has been destroyed.

Please let me know if this meets your requirements or if you would like me to make any changes.
