**Physical Attributes:**
Marta Woźniak is a petite woman with a slender build. She stands at approximately 5'2" (157 cm) tall, which allows her to navigate the narrow corridors and cramped spaces often found in scientific laboratories. Her striking feature is her piercing emerald green eyes, which seem to gleam with an inner intensity even when she's engrossed in work. Her long, dark brown hair is often tied back in a ponytail, revealing a smattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose.

**Personality:**
Marta is an intensely focused and driven individual who wears her heart on her sleeve. Despite her reclusive nature, she has a playful streak that surfaces when she's overjoyed by a breakthrough or discovery. Her passion for science and the universe is infectious, making those around her feel like they're part of something special. When working, Marta becomes completely absorbed in her research, often forgetting to eat, sleep, or socialize for extended periods.

**Interests:**
Marta's interests are centered around understanding the mysteries of the universe, particularly dark matter and its effects on galaxies. She spends countless hours pouring over data, running simulations, and developing new theories to explain these phenomena. Outside of her work, Marta enjoys exploring the woods near her hometown in Poland, where she grows up learning about the natural world and developing a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature. Her fascination with trees whispering secrets to each other in the wind is still a source of inspiration and intrigue for her.

**Additional Traits:**
Marta has an eclectic style that reflects her artistic personality. She often wears colorful scarves, chunky jewelry, and layers of vintage clothing that showcase her unique sense of fashion. Her hands are stained with ink from writing equations on scraps of paper or sketching out diagrams in her notebook. A habit of tapping her foot to the rhythm of scientific papers or computer beeps has become a nervous tic for Marta.

**Hobbies:**
When not working, Marta enjoys drawing geometric shapes inspired by fractals and topology, playing cello to unwind after long research sessions, or practicing meditation and mindfulness exercises to maintain balance in her mind and body.
