Here is a summary of Ishaan Zielinska's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the inspiration provided:

**Personality:** Ishaan has a tough exterior, having grown up on the streets, but beneath this façade lies a vulnerable and sensitive soul. He is guarded by his past experiences, making it challenging for others to penetrate his defenses. However, with Luna's kindness and understanding, he begins to open up, sharing fragments of his story and slowly revealing a more complex personality.

**Physical Attributes:** Ishaan stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with a lean and athletic build, honed from years of navigating the city streets. His hair is dark brown, often messy and unkempt, framing his angular features. His eyes are a deep, piercing green, which seem to hold a hint of sadness and longing.

**Interests:** As Ishaan begins to open up to Luna, he starts to explore the world beyond the alleys and dumpsters he's known all his life. Together, they discover hidden corners of New Haven, exploring street art, abandoned buildings, and underground music scenes. Ishaan finds solace in creativity, drawn to music, poetry, and visual art, which become outlets for his emotions and a way to express himself beyond the confines of his tough exterior.

With Luna's encouragement, Ishaan also starts to pursue his passion for writing, scribbling fragments of stories in a battered notebook that becomes his own private sanctuary. As he begins to find solace in creative expression, Ishaan slowly discovers that there's more to life than just survival on the streets – and that with Luna by his side, he can face his demons and explore new horizons.
