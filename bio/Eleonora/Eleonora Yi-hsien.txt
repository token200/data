Here is a summary of Eleonora Yi-hsien's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Eleonora is a brilliant and tenacious detective with a sharp mind for solving complex cases. She has a no-nonsense attitude and is not afraid to take risks or challenge authority. Her years of experience have made her fiercely independent and confident in her abilities, but also deeply compassionate and empathetic towards those affected by crime.

**Physical Attributes:** Eleonora stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build, typical of a Taiwanese woman who has honed her physique through martial arts training. Her dark hair is often styled in a sleek bob, framing her heart-shaped face and accentuating her piercing brown eyes. Her features are finely chiseled, giving her an intelligent and refined appearance that belies her tough exterior.

**Interests:** As a detective, Eleonora has a keen interest in criminology, forensic science, and psychology. She is meticulous in her approach to solving cases, often spending hours poring over evidence and interviewing suspects. Outside of work, she enjoys practicing tai chi and meditation to clear her mind and stay focused.

Eleonora's passion for justice and her drive to uncover the truth behind Lily's murder also reveal a more personal side: a strong sense of loyalty to those who have been wronged and a determination to bring perpetrators to account. This mix of intellectual curiosity, physical skill, and emotional depth makes Eleonora a formidable detective in the eyes of Taipei's citizens.

In this fictional character, I've made up any missing details by assuming she is a woman from Taiwan with Asian features and an athletic build typical for women from East Asia.
