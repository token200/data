**Physical Attributes:** Eleonora stands at 5'9" with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is long and black, often whipped into a frenzy by the wind. Her eyes are piercing green, a trait that seems to hold a world of secrets within their depths.

She is fiercely intelligent and determined, with a strong sense of justice that drives her to solve even the most baffling cases. Despite her intimidating reputation, she has a compassionate side and is deeply empathetic towards those who are suffering.

**Interests:** Eleonora's passion for the ocean is matched only by her passion for detection. She spends most of her free time studying the tides, observing marine life, and collecting seashells and other treasures from the shore. She is an avid reader of mythology and folklore, often drawing inspiration from these stories when solving cases. In her office, she keeps a collection of seagulls' eggs, conch shells, and other oceanic trinkets that hold sentimental value to her.

As a detective, Eleonora is meticulous and thorough in her investigations, often poring over case files for hours until the smallest detail comes together. She has an uncanny ability to piece together seemingly unrelated clues, which has earned her a reputation as one of the most skilled detectives in the coastal town of Tenerife.
