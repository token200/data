**Physical Attributes:** Eleonora stands at 5'8" with an slender yet athletic build. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that falls in loose waves down her back, often tied up in a ponytail to keep it out of the way while she works on her loom. Her eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to sparkle with creativity whenever she's immersed in her craft. She has a smattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose and a small tattoo of a thread on her left wrist.

**Personality:** Eleonora is a passionate and dedicated individual who pours her heart and soul into every aspect of her life, including her art. She is fiercely independent and self-motivated, having learned to rely only on herself from a young age. Despite this, she has a compassionate side and is always willing to listen to others and offer guidance when needed. Her confidence and self-assurance are evident in the way she moves with purpose, but she also knows when to humbly acknowledge her own mistakes.

**Interests:** Eleonora's primary interest is textile art, particularly weaving and embroidery. She has a deep appreciation for traditional techniques and modern innovations alike, and is constantly seeking new ways to push the boundaries of what is possible with yarn and thread. In addition to her artistic pursuits, she values her relationships with family and friends, and enjoys spending time in nature, whether it's taking long walks or practicing yoga.
