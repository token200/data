Here is a summary of the fictional character Eleonora Davies:

**Physical Attributes:** 
Eleonora has an unlisted height, however, given the fact that she seems to be able to keep up with Thomas on their expeditions through Ravenswood, it's likely her height is around 5'8" (172 cm). Her eye color is dark brown.

**Personality:**
Eleonora appears to be a driven and determined individual. As a young journalist who had spent years chasing stories in the city's underworld, she was disillusioned with the shallow headlines and empty praise that defined her work. This led to her seeking refuge in Ravenswood, where she hoped to rediscover the thrill of storytelling amidst the town's quiet rhythms. Her time with Thomas has brought out a passion for stories that go beyond shallow headlines.

**Interests:** 
Eleonora is deeply interested in uncovering hidden stories and secrets within the town of Ravenswood. She enjoys exploring its narrow alleys, hidden courtyards, and crumbling gravestones to learn more about the town's forgotten past, including tales of coal miners' strikes, wartime evacuations, and abandoned factories. Her experiences with Thomas have reignited her passion for storytelling and encouraged her to explore topics that truly matter.

Eleonora's newfound connection to Ravenswood suggests she will continue to be fascinated by its rich history and hidden stories.
