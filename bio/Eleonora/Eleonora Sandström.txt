**Interests:** Botany is Eleonora's greatest passion, and she spends most of her time studying the properties and behaviors of plants. She is particularly fascinated by rare and unusual species, which leads her to explore the Swedish wilderness in search of new discoveries. When not working, she enjoys spending time outdoors, foraging for herbs and observing the natural world around her.
