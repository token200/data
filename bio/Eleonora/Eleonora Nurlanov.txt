**Physical Attributes:**
Eleonora stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her hair is dark brown, often styled in sleek, sophisticated waves that frame her heart-shaped face. Her eyes are a piercing emerald green, a trait inherited from her Eastern European heritage. Her features are finely chiseled, with high cheekbones and a sharp jawline that accentuates her determined gaze.

**Personality:**
Eleonora is a complex and enigmatic individual, shrouded in mystery due to her past as a KGB agent turned rogue. She exudes an air of quiet confidence, born from years of navigating treacherous espionage landscapes. Her demeanor is reserved and calculating, yet she possesses a deep sense of empathy and compassion for those who have been wronged. Eleonora's instincts are honed, and her gut often proves to be the most reliable guide in high-pressure situations.

**Interests:**
Eleonora's interests are diverse and eclectic, reflecting her experiences as a spy and her newfound passion for justice. She is an avid reader of philosophy and psychology texts, particularly those that explore the human condition and the nature of morality. When she's not embroiled in covert operations or planning her next move, Eleonora enjoys practicing yoga and meditation to center herself. Her love for classic literature – particularly the works of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky – provides a welcome respite from the world of espionage.

Additionally, Eleonora has a keen interest in geopolitics, international relations, and the intricacies of global power dynamics. She is well-versed in various languages, including Russian, Arabic, and French, which she has acquired during her years of operating in the shadows. Her curiosity about the world of arms trading led her to learn more about the subject, and now she sees it as an area where justice can be served through her own unique brand of vigilance.

It's worth noting that Eleonora's personal life is largely unknown, and she prefers it that way.
