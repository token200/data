Her fearless approach to photography stems from her passion for understanding human connections and the beauty in everyday life. She exudes a quiet confidence and has an uncanny ability to make those around her feel seen and heard.

**Interests:**
Chantal's love of photography is only surpassed by her love of storytelling, music, and culinary traditions from different cultures. She finds solace in the rhythmic sound of markets and street vendors, often using these settings as inspiration for her photographs. Her travels have not limited her exposure to various cuisines; she can often be found sipping exotic teas or trying out new recipes inspired by the flavors of the world.

**Additional Details:**
