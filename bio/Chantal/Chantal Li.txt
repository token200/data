**Personality:** Chantal is a force to be reckoned with, known for her ruthless and cunning business tactics. She is confident, assertive, and unwavering in her pursuit of success. Her reputation precedes her, striking fear into the hearts of competitors and inspiring others to follow in her footsteps.

Despite her tough exterior, Chantal has a complex inner life. She is fiercely determined and driven, willing to make tough decisions and take risks to achieve her goals. However, this same drive also makes her emotionally reserved and difficult to connect with, leaving some to wonder if she has a softer side beneath the surface.

**Interests:**

* Technology and innovation

* Reading about history, economics, and politics

As the CEO of her own tech firm, Chantal's interests are largely centered around the world of business and technology. She is always looking for ways to innovate and improve, whether it's through new products or services or cutting-edge technologies. When she's not working, she enjoys reading about history, economics, and politics - likely due to her interest in understanding the underlying forces that shape the global landscape.

It's worth noting that Chantal's interests may be influenced by her upbringing as a Chinese immigrant family. She has spoken publicly about the sacrifices her parents made for her education and career, and how this experience has shaped her values and work ethic.
