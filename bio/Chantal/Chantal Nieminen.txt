Here's a summary of Chantal Nieminen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Chantal is known for her unapologetic attitude and sharp wit, but beneath her tough exterior lies a complex and sensitive soul. As a child, she was an outcast who preferred to spend hours lost in fantasy novels rather than playing with peers. This sensitivity and introversion suggest that Chantal may be an empathetic and emotional person who wears her heart on her sleeve. However, her struggles with rejection and vulnerability indicate that she may also be guarded and cautious when it comes to opening up to others.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the original story doesn't provide much information about Chantal's physical appearance. Based on the context, I would make some educated guesses:

* Height: 5'7" (170 cm) - This height suggests that Chantal is slender and likely has a petite build.
* Eye Color: Green or hazel - These eye colors are often associated with creativity, intuition, and empathy, which are all traits that might be attributed to an author like Chantal.

**Interests:** As mentioned in the original story, Chantal's love for fantasy novels is evident. Her passion for storytelling and writing suggests that she may also be interested in:

* Reading: In addition to her own writing, Chantal likely enjoys reading other authors' work, particularly those who specialize in fantasy and mythology.
* Research: To create her intricate world-building and mythology, Chantal might be interested in researching historical and cultural contexts, folklore, and mythology from around the world.
* World-building: As an author of epic fantasies, Chantal is likely fascinated by creating complex and immersive worlds, complete with their own geography, politics, and magical systems.

Overall, Chantal Nieminen seems to be a creative and sensitive person who wears her heart on her sleeve. Her physical attributes suggest that she may have a petite build and striking eye colors, while her interests reveal a passion for storytelling, research, and world-building.
