Based on the short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Chantalle Bērziņš:

**Physical Attributes:**
Chantalle is likely to be of average height for her ethnic background, as she is of Latvian descent. Her physical attributes are not described in detail, but it can be inferred that she is attractive and has a slender build. Given the mention of bright blue eyes in the story, it's possible that Chantalle has light blue or pale blue eyes.

**Personality:**
Chantalle appears to be a free-spirited and adventurous individual who values independence and self-discovery. She is also introspective and emotionally intelligent, as evidenced by her habit of journaling as a way to process her thoughts and emotions. Despite having recently gone through a painful divorce, Chantalle seems to be resilient and determined to make the most of this new chapter in her life.

**Interests:**
Chantalle has an interest in history, architecture, and writing. She is drawn to the Baltic region's rich cultural heritage and is fascinated by its stunning natural beauty. As a writer, she values the therapeutic benefits of journaling and uses it as a tool for self-expression and growth.

It's worth noting that I made some assumptions about Chantalle's background and physical attributes based on the mention of her Latvian surname, but these are not explicitly stated in the original story.
