In terms of personal struggles, Chantal is still navigating the aftermath of a difficult event in her life, which makes her more introspective and vulnerable to strong emotions. However, meeting Jack "The Ace" Anderson at the jazz club serves as a catalyst for her to confront her troubles and rediscover her passion for music and life.
