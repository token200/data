**Personality:** Chantal is a creative and passionate individual who finds solace in her art. She is introverted and may prefer to spend time alone in her studio, but she also values human connection and is willing to step out of her comfort zone to share her art with others.

* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn loose or tied back in a ponytail

**Additional Quirks:** Chantal has a habit of talking to herself when she's working on a painting, often muttering phrases like "this color is too bright" or "that brushstroke needs more texture." She is also known to be a bit of a perfectionist, which can sometimes make her frustrated with herself when things don't turn out as planned.
