While Chantal may claim to be a writer, she doesn't necessarily have a passion for writing itself. Instead, her interest lies in collecting and preserving rare texts, and using them as a way to learn about the past and understand herself better.

As a person with a complex and mysterious past, Chantal is drawn to those who can see beyond the surface level and connect with her on a deeper level. Her encounter with Luna marks a turning point in her life, as she begins to confront her emotional scars and find a sense of belonging and purpose.
