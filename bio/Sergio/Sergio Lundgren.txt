Background:
As a former stuntman and professional bodybuilder, Sergio Lundgren has had a long and varied career in the entertainment industry. Born Arne Robert Lundgren, he adopted the stage name "Sergio Lundgren" to reflect his growth as an actor and performer. With his imposing physique and natural charisma, he has become one of the most recognizable action heroes in the world.
