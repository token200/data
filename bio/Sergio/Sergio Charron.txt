He is intelligent, resourceful, and fiercely independent, having retreated from the world to live a life of solitude. Despite his reclusive nature, he has a strong sense of justice and is driven by a desire to uncover the truth. Sergio is also highly analytical and methodical in his approach, relying on his exceptional skills of surveillance and detection to solve complex cases.

**Physical Attributes:** Sergio stands at an impressive 6'2" (188 cm) with a lean and athletic build, honed from years of physical activity. His hair is dark brown, always neatly trimmed, and his eyes are a piercing blue that seem to bore into those he meets. He has a sharp jawline and prominent cheekbones, giving him an authoritative presence. Sergio's style is understated yet sophisticated, often dressing in tailored suits and worn leather gloves.

This makes him an enigma among those who know him, but his dedication to his craft is unwavering, earning him the respect and admiration of his peers.
