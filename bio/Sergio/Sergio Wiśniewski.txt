Based on the short story, here is a summary of Sergio Wi≈õniewski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Sergio is a determined and driven individual, consumed by his work as a detective. He has a strong sense of justice and a deep-seated need to uncover the truth, often putting himself at risk. His obsession with solving crimes and unraveling mysteries can lead him down dark paths, but it also fuels his determination to bring about closure for those affected.

**Physical Attributes:** Sergio is likely in his mid-to-late 40s, with a slender yet athletic build, honed from years of physical activity while working as a detective. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he interrogates. His dark hair is often mussed, and his angular face is framed by a sharp jawline.

**Interests:** Sergio's primary interest lies in solving crimes and unraveling mysteries, particularly those related to cold cases or unsolved disappearances. He has a deep passion for justice and will stop at nothing to uncover the truth. Outside of work, he likely enjoys spending time alone, lost in thought as he ponders the intricacies of his cases.

Additionally, it can be inferred that Sergio's personal life is somewhat lacking due to his intense focus on his work:

- He has a deep emotional scar from his brother's disappearance and the case remaining unsolved.
- His colleagues have come to view him with concern for his own safety, suggesting he may have limited social connections outside of his professional circle.

While his determination for justice drives him forward, it also leaves him vulnerable to manipulation by those who might seek to use him.
