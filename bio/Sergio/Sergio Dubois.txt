Based on the short story, here is a summary of Sergio Dubois' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Sergio is a complex individual with a charming exterior. He has a sharp wit and quick tongue, but beneath this facade lies a web of emotions, making him guarded and vulnerable at times. He struggles to connect with others on a deeper level due to past experiences, leaving him feeling disconnected. However, when he meets Maya, his demeanor changes, and he becomes more open and genuine.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark Brown
* Hair Color: Light Brown with subtle hints of auburn
* Body Type: Lean and athletic, reflecting his dedication to a healthy lifestyle

**Interests:** As the CEO of a thriving tech firm, Sergio's work is a significant part of his life. He has a strong interest in innovation, social responsibility, and technology's potential for positive change. However, this focus on work comes at the cost of personal connections and meaningful relationships.

Beyond work, Sergio seems to have little known interests or hobbies beyond possibly reading books on psychology, philosophy, or self-improvement. His life was centered around his intellect and professional accomplishments, which led him to neglect other aspects of himself until he met Maya.

As he begins to reevaluate his priorities and invest time in building meaningful relationships, Sergio's interests may shift towards more personal and emotional pursuits. He might become interested in:

* Personal growth and self-awareness
* Building stronger connections with family and friends
* Exploring creative outlets for relaxation and stress relief (e.g., painting, writing)
* Developing a deeper understanding of emotional intelligence and empathy
