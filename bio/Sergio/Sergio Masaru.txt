His hair is dark brown and usually unkempt, framing his face that has strong facial features, including high cheekbones and a pointed chin.

However, when he finds someone who truly understands his art, as hinted at in his encounter with the young girl, his eyes light up with a warmth that few have seen.

**Interests:** As mentioned, Sergio's primary interest is woodworking, specifically creating intricate and beautiful works of art that tell stories of their own. His latest passion project, a life-sized wooden replica of a Japanese garden, showcases his incredible skills and attention to detail. He finds solace in the smell of sawdust, the sound of power tools, and the feel of wood shavings between his fingers.

**Childhood Influences:** Sergio's love for woodworking began at a young age, thanks to his father, a skilled carpenter who taught him the basics of woodwork when Sergio was just a boy. This early exposure instilled in Sergio a deep appreciation for the craft and a sense of pride that continues to drive his creative endeavors.

**Other Interests:** While not explicitly stated, it is clear that Sergio's connection to nature, inspired by his childhood experiences in Argentina, plays a significant role in shaping his artistic vision. His attention to detail and dedication to precision might also hint at an interest in other crafts or activities that require similar focus and skill.
