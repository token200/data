His favorite song is "La Murga" by Victor Jara, suggesting that he appreciates the emotional power of storytelling through lyrics. He also appears to be interested in social justice and human rights issues, as evidenced by his inspiration from Victor Jara's message and his own experiences with protests and rallies.
