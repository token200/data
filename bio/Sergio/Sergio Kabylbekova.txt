Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Sergio Kabylbekova's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Sergio Kabylbekova appears to be an enigmatic and introverted individual. Her ability to evoke emotions through her art suggests that she has a deep understanding of human psychology and can tap into the complexities of the human experience. She may also possess a strong sense of resilience, having navigated the challenges of growing up in post-Soviet Russia and dealing with the emotional weight of her artistic themes.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there is no information provided about Sergio's height, but it is mentioned that she is Russian-born and Kazakh-stationed. Assuming she was born in Moscow (as hinted at in the story), we can make an educated guess about her potential physical attributes. However, without further context or confirmation, I will refrain from making any assumptions.

As for her eye color, let's assume it to be a striking feature that complements her artistic expression. Given the dramatic and emotive nature of her work, Sergio might have piercing green or blue eyes that seem to hold a depth of meaning and introspection.

**Interests:** As an artist who specializes in exploring themes of "nothingness," Sergio likely has a deep fascination with:

1. **Artistic Expression**: Her paintings are not only a reflection of her inner world but also an exploration of the boundaries between reality and abstraction.
2. **Philosophy and Psychology**: Sergio's artwork touches on fundamental human questions, such as the nature of existence, identity, and the human condition.
3. **Central Asian Culture**: Growing up in Russia and Kazakh-stationed, Sergio has a strong connection to the rich cultural heritage of Central Asia, which undoubtedly influences her artistic perspective.
4. **Music and Visual Storytelling**: The enigmatic figure that she is, it's possible that music plays an important role in her creative process, allowing her to tap into emotions and convey complex ideas through multiple art forms.

Please note that these attributes are speculative and based on the provided story. The actual Sergio Kabylbekova might be vastly different from this description.
