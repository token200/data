Based on the short story, here's a summary of Sophie Corbero's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Sophie appears to be a creative, emotional, and empathetic person. She is nostalgic and sentimental, often getting lost in memories of her past. Her nervousness about her art show suggests that she is also self-conscious and uncertain at times. However, her friendship with Maria shows that she values support and connection.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story doesn't provide much information about Sophie's physical appearance. Based on the mention of Barcelona as her childhood home, I would imagine her to be a Mediterranean-looking person with olive skin, dark hair, and expressive eyes.

Let's fill in some missing details: Sophie is approximately 5'7" (170 cm) tall, with an athletic yet slender build, which is reflected in her design career. Her eye color is a warm, golden brown that seems to sparkle when she talks about her art or shares stories of her childhood.

**Interests:** As an artist, Sophie's primary interest is creating and showcasing her work, particularly pieces inspired by the vibrant colors and textures of her Barcelona childhood home. She values creative expression and connection with others, as evident in her close friendship with Maria. Her design career also suggests that she has a practical side and appreciates functional art.

In addition to her artistic pursuits, Sophie likely enjoys spending time outdoors, exploring new places, and immersing herself in the beauty of nature. Her nostalgic tendencies also imply a love for reminiscing about happy memories and revisiting favorite spots, such as this caf√© where she shared countless moments with Maria.
