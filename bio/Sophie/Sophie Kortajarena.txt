Based on the story provided, I've created a fictional character profile for Sophie Kortajärvi:

**Physical Attributes:**
Sophie Kortajärvi is 5'8" (173 cm) tall with long, curly dark brown hair and piercing green eyes. She has a slender yet athletic build, honed from years of dancing and gymnastics as a child.

**Personality:**
Sophie is a determined and driven individual who has always been passionate about acting. She is fiercely independent and confident in her abilities, but also remains humble and grounded despite her growing success. Sophie is known for her quick wit and sharp intelligence, which serves her well both on and off the screen.

**Interests:**
In her free time, Sophie enjoys practicing yoga and meditation to maintain balance and focus in her life. She is also an avid reader, devouring books on psychology, philosophy, and history to broaden her knowledge and understanding of the world. When she's not working or reading, Sophie loves to explore new cities and try different cuisines, always seeking out fresh experiences and inspiration for her next role.

As a nod to the real-life Sophie Kort-Hägerman, I've kept some similarities in the physical attributes and personality traits mentioned above, while also adding fictional details to flesh out this character profile.
