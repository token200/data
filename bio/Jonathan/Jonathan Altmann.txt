Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Jonathan Altmann's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jonathan is an introverted and introspective person with a unique blend of creativity, passion, and stubbornness. He has a dry sense of humor and can be wary of outsiders, as evident in his initial reaction to his mother's unexpected visit. However, once he opens up, he becomes more expressive and enthusiastic about his art and ideas. Jonathan is fiercely independent but values meaningful relationships and is willing to take risks for the sake of his craft.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no specific physical attributes are mentioned in the story, except that Jonathan seems to be a tall person (implying that "the beauty of taxidermy" surrounds him rather than being a physical characteristic).

However, considering this was not explicitly stated and we don't have all details about his eye color.
