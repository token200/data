**Personality:**

Jonathan Popov is an enigmatic figure with a detached demeanor. He moves through life with an air of observation, never quite participating in the world around him. This reserved nature makes it difficult for others to get close to him, but those who do notice him are often drawn to his quiet intensity. Despite his aloof exterior, Jonathan seems to be searching for something – a connection to his past, perhaps, or a way to understand the mysteries of the universe.

**Interests:**

Jonathan's true passions lie in uncovering forgotten knowledge and lost memories. He is fascinated by ancient texts, particularly those with mysterious symbols or cryptic messages. His interest in the occult and the supernatural drives him to seek out rare and obscure books that hold secrets beyond their pages. As a collector of lost memories, Jonathan is drawn to objects, artifacts, and experiences that whisper tales of the past.

Some specific interests include:

* Studying ancient languages, such as Latin and Sumerian
* Reading literature from various time periods and cultures
* Exploring abandoned locations, like churches and hospitals, for hidden artifacts and relics
* Collecting rare books and manuscripts with mysterious symbols or inscriptions

Jonathan's obsession with the book found in Mrs. Jenkins' antique shop has opened up new avenues of research and exploration, leading him to investigate the enigmatic sentence: "The memories we leave behind are not our own." His true nature remains shrouded in mystery, but one thing is certain – he is driven by an insatiable curiosity about the past and its secrets.
