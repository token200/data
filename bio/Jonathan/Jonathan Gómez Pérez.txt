Despite his tough exterior, he has a heart of gold and is able to understand people in a way few others can match. He is driven by a strong sense of justice and is willing to take risks to uncover the truth.

**Physical Attributes:**

**Interests:** Jonathan's interests are largely centered around investigative journalism and storytelling. He has a fascination with the darker corners of life and is drawn to stories about marginalized and oppressed communities. His work often takes him to the fringes of society, where he seeks to expose injustices and bring light to those living in darkness.

It's worth noting that Sophia's appearance (piercing blue eyes and a scar above her left eyebrow) has not been described as Jonathan's physical attributes, so I have only added details about himself.
