Despite her fears, she is drawn to taking risks and pushing herself outside of her comfort zone. Her writing is her escape from the world around her, where she can express herself honestly and authentically.

**Interests:** Eva's primary interests are writing, poetry, and spoken word performances. She finds solace in words and language, using them as a way to process her thoughts and emotions.

Her struggles to find stability as a freelance writer are mirrored by her sense of disconnection from society, which often seems too loud and overwhelming. Despite these challenges, Eva is determined to make her voice heard through her writing, using it as a way to connect with others and find her own path in life.
