Eva exudes warmth and nostalgia as she returns to her hometown. She seems to possess a strong sense of belonging and connection to her family's history. Her curiosity and enthusiasm for rebuilding the bakery with her cousin Marie indicate a positive and determined attitude. As she reflects on her childhood memories, Eva appears to be sentimental and appreciative of the people and places that have shaped her life.
