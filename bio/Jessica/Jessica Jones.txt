Here's a summary of Jessica Jones' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jessica Jones is a complex and multi-dimensional character with a dark past. She has a strong sense of determination and resilience, which allows her to face her demons head-on. Despite being held captive by Kilgrave for years, she retains her dignity and refuses to back down from a fight. Her sharp wit and sarcasm often serve as a coping mechanism to deal with the trauma she's experienced.

However, Jessica also struggles with PTSD, anxiety, and trust issues, which can make it difficult for her to form close relationships or let people in. She has a tendency to self-sabotage and push away those who try to help her, making it challenging for others to understand her inner workings.

**Physical Attributes:** Jessica Jones is 5'6" (168 cm) tall with striking blue eyes that seem almost purple in the right light. Her dark hair is often styled in a messy, undone look, framing her heart-shaped face. She has a petite build and a lean physique, which belies her fierce strength and determination.

**Interests:** Jessica Jones' interests are largely centered around her own survival and revenge against those who have wronged her. She's fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority and pushing boundaries to get what she wants.

As an investigator, Jessica is drawn to the darker corners of the world, where she can use her skills to uncover secrets and bring justice to those who deserve it. She has a strong sense of justice and will go to great lengths to protect the people she cares about, even if it means putting herself in harm's way.

In her free time, Jessica enjoys reading and watching TV (despite her initial disdain for superhero shows), as well as sipping whiskey and brooding about her life. She has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic at times, but deep down, she's a deeply vulnerable and empathetic person who is always looking to connect with others on a deeper level.

As the story progresses, Jessica's interests expand beyond personal revenge to include fighting against larger threats like the Hand and exploring her relationships with those around her, particularly Luke Cage and Matt Murdock.
