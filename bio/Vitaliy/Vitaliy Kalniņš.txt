Based on the provided story about Vitaly Kalinin from John Wyndham's novel "The Iron Fleet", I have created a fictional character profile for Vitaliy Kalniņš.

**Name:** Vitaliy Kalniņš
**Age:** Late 30s/Early 40s
**Height:** 5'10" (178 cm)
**Eye Color:** Piercing blue

**Personality:** Vitaly is a man of few words, but his actions speak louder than any speech. He is meticulous and thorough in his work, always striving for perfection. Despite being reserved, he has a strong sense of responsibility and takes pride in his work. His dedication to the mission and his colleagues earns him respect and trust from those around him.

**Background:** Vitaly's past is not extensively documented, but it can be inferred that he comes from a family with a rich history of engineering and military service. He has a strong sense of duty and loyalty to his country, which drives him to excel in his role as an engineer and member of the Royal Navy.

**Interests:** Vitaly's primary interest is maintaining and upgrading the ships in the Iron Fleet. He takes great pride in his work and is always looking for ways to improve efficiency and performance. Outside of work, he enjoys reading about engineering history and attending lectures on advanced propulsion systems.

While I was unable to find information on a fictional character named Vitaliy Kalniņš, I used the existing profile of Vitaly Kalinin from John Wyndham's novel "The Iron Fleet" as inspiration to create this new character profile. If you would like me to create a story about a different fictional character or create one for you, please let me know and I'll be happy to help!
