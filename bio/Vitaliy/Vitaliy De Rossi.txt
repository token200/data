However, there are hints of artificiality in his movements and demeanor, suggesting that he may be hiding something beneath his exterior.

**Interests:** Vitaliy's interests seem to revolve around uncovering the truth about the Soviet regime and its darkest secrets. He is drawn to conspiracy theories and has a knack for deciphering encrypted messages. His journey takes him deep into an underground world of shadowy figures, human experimentation, and forbidden knowledge. As he navigates this complex web of intrigue, Vitaliy becomes increasingly obsessed with uncovering the truth about his own past and the fate of his brother Misha.

**Additional Traits:** Some rumors surround Vitaliy's existence, suggesting that he may be more than human or even a product of the Soviet government's secret programs. Others speculate that he is working to dismantle the conspiracy from within, using his talents for good. Whatever his true intentions, Vitaliy De Rossi remains an enigma, shrouded in secrecy and whispers.
