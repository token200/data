Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Vitaliy Clarke:

**Personality:** Vitaliy is a complex and brooding individual with a troubled past. He is haunted by guilt and regret, which has left emotional scars that still linger years after his departure from Ravenswood. Despite this, he is not a broken person; rather, he is someone who has been shaped by the circumstances of his life and is now grappling with the consequences of his actions.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Vitaliy stands at around 6'1" (185 cm), which gives him an imposing presence, even in a small town like Ravenswood.
* Eye Color: His eyes are a deep shade of brown, almost black, which seems to bore into those he looks at, as if searching for answers to questions he'd rather not confront.
* Hair: Vitaliy's hair is dark and unkempt, often falling across his forehead in messy, disheveled locks that reflect his troubled state.

**Interests:** As a character, Vitaliy's interests are largely driven by his past and the circumstances surrounding his sister Lina's death. He appears to be someone who is haunted by memories and is searching for answers about his own role in her demise. Despite this, he seems to have a deep connection to Ravenswood, which holds a certain significance for him. It's possible that he may try to reconnect with the town and its people, but his presence is also marked by an air of caution and wariness.

Some additional details that can be inferred from the story:

* Vitaliy appears to be introverted and reserved, preferring to keep to himself rather than engaging with others in social situations.
* He seems to have a tendency towards self-sabotage and avoidance, as evidenced by his hasty departure from Ravenswood all those years ago.
* There is an undercurrent of tension between Vitaliy and Lyubov, which suggests that their relationship is more complicated than initially meets the eye.

Overall, Vitaliy Clarke is a nuanced and intriguing character whose personality, physical attributes, and interests are shaped by his troubled past and ongoing struggles with guilt and regret.
