Vitaliy Kalējs is a complex and enigmatic individual with a troubled past. He exudes an aura of confidence and authority, which belies the weight of his years as an intelligence officer. His eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for potential threats or opportunities. Despite this, there's a hint of dry wit and sarcasm in his tone, suggesting that he's not one to be underestimated.

Kalējs is fiercely independent and non-conformist, having defected from the Russian intelligence service and now operates outside the bounds of traditional authority. He has a strong sense of justice, but it's tempered by his own pragmatism and willingness to take risks. This moral ambiguity makes him a formidable operator in the world of private security.

As a former intelligence officer, Kalējs has a deep understanding of the inner workings of organized crime syndicates and corrupt governments. He's always on the lookout for new opportunities or challenges that will test his skills and keep him engaged.

Outside of work, Kalējs seems to have few personal interests or hobbies, preferring to focus on his mission-critical objectives. However, there are hints that he has a soft spot for certain women (like his mysterious contact from the brief extraction operation) and may be drawn to those who challenge his worldview or push him out of his comfort zone.

Overall, Vitaliy Kalējs is a man of action, driven by a strong sense of duty and loyalty. His years as an intelligence officer have left their mark, but he's adapted and evolved into a formidable operator in the world of private security.
