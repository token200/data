Here's a summary of Marat Kalējs' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Marat is a driven and analytical individual with a strong sense of justice. He has a knack for solving complex cases, which stems from his keen observational skills and ability to think critically. As a result, he can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him. However, this facade hides a deep emotional wellspring and a strong sense of loyalty to those he cares about. His experiences have made him wary of getting too close to people, but when pushed by someone he trusts, like his sister Anastasija, he will go to great lengths to protect them.

**Physical Attributes:** Marat stands at 6'1" with a lean and athletic build, honed from years of walking long distances in the rain-soaked streets of Riga. His hair is dark brown and always neatly trimmed, framing his sharp features. His eyes are an unsettling shade of gray, almost blue-gray, which seems to bore into those he meets. He has a distinctive nose shape, slightly upturned at the tip, giving him a distinctive and striking appearance.

**Interests:** As a detective, Marat's primary interest lies in solving complex cases that intrigue him intellectually. However, beyond his professional work, he is deeply passionate about uncovering the truth behind people's secrets and understanding their motivations. This desire for knowledge drives him to dig deeper into the lives of those around him, often pushing him to take risks and face challenges head-on. In his free time, Marat enjoys reading about history, particularly the darker aspects of human nature, which fuels his interest in the cases he works on.

**Additional details:** Marat's love for black coffee is legendary among his acquaintances, and he always orders it at his favorite café. His sister Anastasija's revelation has brought up memories of their complicated past, and Marat will have to confront his own demons in order to help her with the mysterious case that has just landed on his lap.
