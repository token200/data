She is also an avid collector of rare books on physics and mathematics, many of which she has written herself in the margins. Her love of solitude is a coping mechanism for the emotional scars she's accumulated over the years, but her interactions with Sarah and others like her have begun to chip away at this armor, revealing a more vulnerable side to her personality.
