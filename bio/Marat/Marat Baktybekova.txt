**Physical Attributes:** Marat Baktybekova is described as a skilled martial artist, but specific details about her physical appearance are not provided. However, we can infer that she is physically fit and capable due to her proficiency in martial arts. One detail mentioned is her piercing eyes, which seem to bore into those around her. Assuming the story implies that her eyes are an important aspect of her appearance, it's possible that they are a striking feature that commands attention.
