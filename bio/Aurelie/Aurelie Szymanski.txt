Here's a summary of Aurelie Szymanski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Aurelie is a cunning and resourceful individual with a strong sense of self-reliance. She has honed her skills as a pickpocket and thief to become a master of her craft, but beneath her tough exterior lies a deep-seated desire for excitement and challenge. Her reputation as a skilled thief has earned her both admiration and fear from her peers, and she takes pride in being able to stay one step ahead of the law. Aurelie is also fiercely independent and non-conformist, often taking risks that put her at odds with authority.

**Physical Attributes:** Aurelie stands at approximately 5'7" (170 cm) tall, with a slender yet athletic build. Her striking features include bright hazel eyes and curly brown hair that she often wears in a ponytail. She has a small tattoo of a snake coiled around her left wrist, which is said to be a symbol of her affinity for stealth and deception.

**Interests:** Aurelie's primary interest is thievery, and she takes great pleasure in the thrill of the heist and the art of deception that comes with it. She has a deep respect for other skilled thieves and collectors, and is often drawn to rare and valuable artifacts. In her free time, Aurelie enjoys exploring the streets of Paris, trying new foods, and listening to music - particularly French cabaret and jazz.

**Additional Details:** Aurelie grew up on the streets of Paris, surviving by her wits and cunning from a young age. She began her life as a pickpocket at around 16, quickly learning the ins and outs of the trade from experienced thieves who took her under their wing. Over the years, she honed her skills and built a reputation for herself as one of the best thieves in Paris. Despite her success, Aurelie has always felt like something is missing - that there's more to life than just taking things without giving back. Her encounter with Colette may be exactly what she needs to find purpose and meaning in her life once again.
