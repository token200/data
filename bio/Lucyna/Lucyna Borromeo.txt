Based on the short story, here is a summary of Lucyna Borromeo's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm) - tall enough to stand out in the crowd but not so tall that she appears imposing.
* Eye Color: Piercing green eyes, reminiscent of her shop owner friend and a nod to his mystical nature.

**Personality:**
Lucyna is a free-spirited individual who feels stifled by traditional expectations. She's curious and adventurous at heart, with a desire to break free from the mold and forge her own path in life. Despite her family's rich heritage, she's been held back by the weight of duty and responsibility. However, after discovering Musea Magica, she finds a sense of liberation and begins to assert herself, showing that she's not afraid to take risks and follow her passions.

**Interests:**
Lucyna is intrigued by the mysterious and unknown. She has a fascination with ancient artifacts, rare books, and curious trinkets, which are all on display at Musea Magica. Her love for learning and exploration led her to the shop, where she discovered a new sense of purpose and belonging. As she ventures out into the world, Lucyna is likely to be drawn to other unconventional pursuits, such as art, music, or spirituality.

It's worth noting that there are no explicit details about Lucyna's interests outside of Musea Magica in the original story, so these are based on inference from her actions and emotions.
