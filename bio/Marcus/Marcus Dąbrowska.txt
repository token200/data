Based on the short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Marcus Dąbrowska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Marcus appears to be introspective, nostalgic, and melancholic. He has a strong connection to his past and the town of Lipno, which seems to evoke a sense of comfort and familiarity in him. He is also somewhat detached from the world beyond Lipno, as hinted at by his parents' decision to leave. There's an air of resilience around him, as he navigates the challenges of growing up and leaving home.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: A deep shade of blue, almost indigo, with a hint of green around the iris
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often messy and unkempt

The story doesn't provide much detail about Marcus's physical appearance beyond these attributes.

**Interests:** It seems that Marcus has a strong interest in history, particularly the stories of his grandparents about Poland after the war. He is also drawn to nature and the outdoors, as evidenced by his afternoon wanderings through the empty streets and his visit to the riverbank at sunset. His love for Lipno's eerie beauty suggests that he values solitude and contemplation.

Marcus seems to be someone who appreciates the simple things in life – a worn rocking chair, a familiar landscape – and finds comfort in the quiet rhythms of small-town life.
