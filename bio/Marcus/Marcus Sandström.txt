Here's a summary of Marcus Sandström's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Marcus is a humble and dedicated individual who remains grounded despite receiving widespread attention for his groundbreaking research. He is passionate about understanding the intricacies of nature and is driven by a desire to share his discoveries with others. His calm demeanor and sense of privilege when studying the color-changing whale suggest that he is an empathetic and introspective person.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the original story doesn't provide specific details on Marcus's physical attributes beyond his height and eye color. Based on this lack of information, I will make some educated assumptions:

* Height: 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm) - This height would allow him to stand out as a marine biologist and give him an advantage when observing whales from the research vessel.
* Eye Color: Blue or Hazel eyes - These colors are common among people who spend time outdoors, such as scientists who study marine life. They also complement his Scandinavian surname, "Sandström," which hints at his Nordic heritage.

**Interests:** Marcus's passion for the ocean and its creatures drives his work as a marine biologist. He is fascinated by the behavior and physiology of whales, particularly the color-changing phenomenon he discovered. His interests extend beyond research, as he enjoys sharing his discoveries with others and inspiring the next generation of marine biologists.
