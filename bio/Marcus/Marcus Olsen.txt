Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Marcus Olsen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Marcus appears to be introverted and content with his solitary life as a freelance writer. He values quiet moments and has grown accustomed to the routine of writing, researching, and sipping coffee. However, he also seems to have a creative and empathetic side, as evidenced by his interest in capturing the raw energy of Seattle's underground music scene and connecting with Emily on a deep level.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, only one physical attribute is explicitly mentioned: Marcus's height is not specified, but it can be inferred that he is likely slender or average build, given that he walks to a nearby caf√© without any visible struggles. His eye color is also unknown, although his appreciation for the "damp and overcast" grey sky may suggest that he has darker-colored eyes.

**Interests:** Marcus's primary interest appears to be writing, particularly freelance writing and profile pieces on various topics, including music and local culture. He also seems to have an appreciation for street art, Seattle's underground music scene, and rainy days. Additionally, his meeting with Emily reveals a shared interest in design, as they discuss her book about Seattle's street art scene.

As Emily is the main character of this passage, Marcus could be interpreted based on how he reacts with her rather than having explicit details.
