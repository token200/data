Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Urmas Sharma:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing blue
- Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled neatly for his high-end heists
- Build: Lean and athletic, allowing him to blend into tight spaces and avoid detection
- Facial Features: Strong jawline, angular cheekbones, and piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he interacts with.

**Personality:**
Urmas is a calculating individual with a keen sense of strategy. He's driven by the thrill of the chase, always seeking to outsmart his opponents and push the boundaries of what's possible. His confidence in his abilities borders on arrogance, which often leads him to take on jobs that others would deem impossible.
However, beneath this exterior lies a fiercely independent individual with a strong sense of loyalty towards those he considers friends or associates. He has a tendency to be enigmatic and aloof, preferring to keep people at arm's length rather than letting them get too close.

**Interests:**
Urmas has an innate passion for rare artifacts, particularly jewels like the Star of Riga that hold historical significance. His interests lie in understanding the stories behind these artifacts, which often fuel his curiosity about human history and culture.
Apart from jewelry, Urmas also enjoys traveling to new locations, studying local customs, and learning about art and architecture. These experiences tend to inspire him, helping him develop new skills and strategies for future heists.

These interests play a significant role in shaping Urmas's career as "The Ghost," as his expertise spans more than just pickpocketing or safecracking â€“ it encompasses cultural appreciation, historical knowledge, and the thrill of discovery.
