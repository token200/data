Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Urmas Hebert:

**Physical Attributes:**
Urmas Hebert stands at approximately 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm) tall. His eyes are a bright blue color, often seeming piercing due to his intense focus on his work. His dark brown hair is often unkempt and sticks out in every direction, giving him a somewhat eccentric appearance. He has a slender build, but his years of hunching over his workbench have given him a slightly stooped posture.

**Personality:**
Urmas Hebert is a brilliant and eccentric scientist with an unwavering passion for discovery. His unorthodox theories and methods often lead to controversy within the scientific community, but he remains undeterred in his pursuit of knowledge. Despite this, he is deeply respected by his colleagues for his groundbreaking contributions to the field. Urmas has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or standoffish at first, but once you gain his trust, he reveals a kind and generous side.

**Interests:**
Urmas Hebert's primary interest is in unraveling the mysteries of the universe through experimentation and research. He is particularly fascinated by quantum mechanics and its applications to cosmology. In addition to science, Urmas has a deep love for reading (particularly philosophy and theoretical physics texts) and enjoying complex music (he often listens to classical compositions while working). He also has a curiosity about the human condition, often pondering the mysteries of existence in his free time.
