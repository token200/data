Personality:
Urmas Puccini appears to be an individual with a strong passion for his work in taxidermy. He takes great pride in his craft, spending hours meticulously arranging the details of deceased animals, and seems to have a sense of satisfaction and belonging when working on projects that bring him joy.

Physical Attributes:

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark Brown
* Urmas likely has an unassuming appearance, with a slender build and perhaps some minor facial features that make him blend into the background. His long brown hair may be often unkempt, giving off a slightly disheveled look.

Interests:
Taxidermy is clearly Urmas's primary interest and passion. He spends most of his days in his workshop creating intricate and beautiful arrangements from deceased animals. The exact nature of his interests or hobbies outside of taxidermy are not specified, but it can be inferred that he values creativity, attention to detail, and perhaps a sense of community (as evidenced by the collaboration with Mr. Jenkins).

Additional Details:
It's possible that Urmas has a quiet, reserved personality and may struggle to connect with others due to his isolated profession. His passion for taxidermy could be seen as both a source of comfort and a potential barrier to social interaction.
