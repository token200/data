Based on the provided story, I've created a fictional character profile for Urmas Luis Borges:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 6 feet (183 cm)
- Eye Color: Deep, piercing emerald green
- Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn long and messy
- Facial Features: Strong jawline, prominent nose, and a scattering of freckles across his cheeks

**Personality:**
Urmas is an enigmatic individual with a dry sense of humor. He's intensely curious and has an innate ability to piece together seemingly unrelated fragments of information. His kind heart and willingness to help others often puts him at odds with the mysterious and potentially dark world he becomes increasingly entangled in.

**Interests:**
- Cryptography and coding
- Ancient languages and forgotten civilizations
- The occult and mystical practices
- Puzzle-solving and deciphering complex systems
- Reading and collecting rare, out-of-print books

Urmas's fascination with the unknown is a driving force in his life. He's drawn to secrets, codes, and hidden truths that others overlook or ignore. As he delves deeper into these mysteries, he becomes increasingly obsessed with uncovering the underlying truth, often at great personal risk.

In Tartu, Estonia, Urmas Luis Borges walks among the cobblestone streets with a quiet confidence, his piercing green eyes scanning the crowds for clues and hidden opportunities. Despite his enigmatic nature, those who know him recognize his kind heart and quick wit, which makes him a formidable ally in the world of mystery and intrigue.
