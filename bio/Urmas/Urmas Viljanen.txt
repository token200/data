Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Urmas Viljanen:

**Personality:**
Urmas Viljanen appears to be a man with a complex past, driven by a mix of motivations. On one hand, he seems driven by a desire for revenge and self-preservation, having spent years as a spy for the KGB during the Cold War. However, after meeting Natalia Petrova, it becomes clear that he may be open to using his skills for good, rather than evil. He is likely a calculating and strategic individual, having honed his skills as a spy over the years.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown or possibly blue-green, given his affinity for green eyes of the woman Natalia Petrova
* Build: Lean and athletic, likely honed from years of physical activity during his espionage career
* Hair: Dark brown, possibly worn short to avoid drawing attention
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, piercing eyes (dark brown or blue-green), and a scar or two (possibly visible on his face or neck)

**Interests:**
Urmas's interests seem to revolve around espionage, politics, and international relations. As a former KGB spy, he has likely developed strong knowledge of global affairs, geopolitics, and counterintelligence tactics. He may also be fascinated by the world of high-stakes espionage, where allegiances are often blurred and loyalty is tested.

It's worth noting that Urmas's past experiences have made him somewhat of a loner, preferring to keep to himself rather than forming close relationships or attachments. However, his meeting with Natalia Petrova suggests that he may be willing to re-engage with the world of espionage, this time with a greater sense of purpose and morality.
