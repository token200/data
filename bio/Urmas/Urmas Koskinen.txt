**Personality:**

Urmas is a deeply analytical and introspective individual with a keen eye for detail. He has a natural talent for observation, which serves him well in his work as a detective. Despite his focus on solving cases, Urmas is not averse to taking risks or trusting his instincts, often finding himself drawn into the darker corners of the city that he's supposed to be investigating.

Urmas is also intensely private and can come across as aloof to those who don't know him. However, once you get past his reserved exterior, he has a dry sense of humor and a deep empathy for those affected by crime.

In his free time, Urmas enjoys reading classical literature (particularly Finnish authors like Kaarina Aitinen) and listening to jazz music. He's an avid coffee drinker and can often be found sipping on a strong cup at the local caf√©.

Urmas also has a passion for traditional Finnish cuisine, particularly karjalanpiirakka (Karelian pasties). He finds solace in these comforting, simple foods when he needs to unwind after a long day of investigating.

Despite his analytical mind, Urmas is not a fan of routine or monotony. He enjoys taking long walks along the Helsinki harbor and exploring new neighborhoods, always on the lookout for hidden stories or untold secrets.
