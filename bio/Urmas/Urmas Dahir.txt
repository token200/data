Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Urmas Dahir's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Urmas Dahir is a mysterious and enigmatic individual with an air of quiet confidence. He exudes a sense of calmness and serenity, but also hints at a deep emotional complexity. His music has the power to evoke strong emotions in those who listen to it, suggesting that he may be passionate and empathetic, yet also guarded and introspective. The fact that legends whisper about him being cursed by the moon goddess implies that he may have a deeper understanding of himself and his place in the world.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Urmas stands at an impressive 6'2" (188 cm), with a slender yet athletic build.
* Eye Color: His eyes are an piercing shade of indigo, almost purple, which seems to deepen when he gazes intensely into someone's soul.
* Hair: His hair is dark brown and unruly, often falling across his forehead in a way that makes him look even more brooding.
* Facial Features: Urmas has strong facial features, with high cheekbones, a sharp jawline, and full lips that curve slightly upwards when he smiles.

**Interests:** Urmas's primary interest is music. He is a wandering musician who travels the vast expanse of Estonia on his lute, playing haunting melodies that weave tales of love, loss, and longing into the very fabric of the night. He seems to have a deep connection with nature, often performing under the stars or in forests shrouded in mist.

Despite his love for music, Urmas also appears to be deeply interested in the mysteries of life and death. The legend of him being cursed by the moon goddess suggests that he may be drawn to the supernatural or the mystical. His ability to evoke strong emotions in those who listen to his music implies that he may have a deep understanding of human psychology and emotion.

It is also possible that Urmas has a romantic streak, given the way he connects with Ava through their shared experience of music and moonlight. However, this aspect of his personality remains unclear until further development.
