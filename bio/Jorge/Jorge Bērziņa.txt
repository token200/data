Jorge Bērziņa is a brilliant, yet reclusive scientist with an introverted personality. He is fiercely dedicated to his work and prefers the company of his machines over people. Despite this, he has a profound intellect that allows him to think outside the box and make groundbreaking discoveries. His reserved nature makes it difficult for others to gauge his emotions or understand his motivations, but those who do know him appreciate his wit and dry sense of humor.

**Interests:**
- Studying the mysteries of the universe
- Conducting experiments and analyzing data in his laboratory
