Based on the story of Jānis Kalniņš, I've created a fictional character profile for Jorge Kalniņš:

**Name:** Jorge Kalniņš

**Age:** Late 20s to early 30s

**Height:** 6'0" (183 cm)

**Eye Color:** Bright blue with hints of green, reflecting his Latvian heritage

**Personality:** Jorge is a quiet and introspective individual, often lost in thought as he contemplates complex mathematical problems. He has an innate ability to simplify intricate concepts, making him an exceptional teacher and mentor. His passion for mathematics drives him to continually challenge himself, pushing the boundaries of human understanding.

Despite his analytical nature, Jorge has a creative side, often expressing himself through music and art. When not working on a problem, you can find him playing the guitar or painting vivid landscapes inspired by Latvia's stunning natural beauty.

**Interests:**

* Mathematics (Diophantine equations, prime number theory, geometry)
* Music (guitar, folk-inspired music from Latvian culture)
* Painting (landscapes, abstract art)
* Hiking and exploring Latvian wilderness
* Reading (mathematical history, philosophy)

**Background:** Jorge was born in Riga, Latvia, to a family of modest means. He showed exceptional mathematical aptitude from an early age and was encouraged by his parents to pursue higher education. Despite facing some challenges along the way, Jorge's dedication and perseverance paid off, earning him a Ph.D. in mathematics at a young age.

Now, he travels the world, sharing his knowledge and passion for mathematics with others. His research focuses on developing new algorithms for solving Diophantine equations and exploring the intersection of prime number theory with cryptography.
