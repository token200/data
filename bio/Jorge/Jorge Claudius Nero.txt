**Physical Attributes:**

- Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
- Eye Color: Deep, expressive brown eyes with a hint of warmth
- Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn long and unkempt to emphasize his rugged connection to the earth
- Build: Slightly lean, indicating years of dedicated physical labor

**Personality:**

Jorge Claudius Nero is a complex individual driven by an unwavering passion for pottery. He is fiercely dedicated to his craft, putting in countless hours to hone his skills and perfect his technique. Despite his success, he remains humble and grounded, always mindful of the weight of expectation that comes with being a master potter. His connection to his late father Marcelo Claudius has instilled in him a strong sense of responsibility and dedication to carrying on the family legacy.

**Interests:**

- Pottery: Nero's true love is pottery, which he views as a means to express himself creatively and connect with the natural world.
- History and Tradition: As a proud descendant of Marcelo Claudius, he has an innate respect for the traditions and techniques passed down through generations.
- Philosophy: The process of shaping clay into art can be meditative, allowing Nero to explore philosophical ideas about creation, impermanence, and the human condition.
- Nature: Spending time outdoors, particularly in Redemption's desert landscape, provides Nero with a sense of clarity and inspiration that he often channels into his work.

**Quirks and Habits:**

Nero has developed certain habits over the years to maintain focus while working. He may hum softly or listen to the sound of the wheel spinning as he shapes his pieces. His long fingers are well-suited for handling clay, but they also reveal a small imperfection - a birthmark in the shape of a bird that runs along the length of one finger, a reminder of a childhood accident where he got caught by a sparrow.

These characteristics encapsulate the essence of Jorge Claudius Nero: an artist whose work is deeply personal and connected to his experiences as a child, a son, and a master potter.
