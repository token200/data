Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Jorge Leroy:

**Personality:** Jorge is a man of few words but carries weight when spoken. He has a strong sense of intuition and can assess situations with ease. He is fiercely independent and knows how to keep his own counsel, preferring not to get involved in unnecessary conflicts. Despite this, he has a soft spot for those who are genuinely in need and will step in to help when called upon.

**Physical Attributes:** Jorge stands at 6'1" with piercing green eyes that seem to see right through you. His dark hair is often unkempt, and his rugged features give him a brooding appearance that commands respect. He has a lean build, honed from years of living on the streets and surviving by his wits.

**Interests:** Jorge's interests are largely centered around self-preservation and observing those around him. He has a keen eye for detecting potential threats or opportunities, making him an expert at reading people and situations. Outside of work (or "business"), he seems to enjoy whiskey, solitude, and the simple pleasures in life. He also has a fascination with the mysterious woman Sophia, whom he has had dealings with in the past.

One notable detail not present in the original story is Jorge's voice. It is described as carrying weight when spoken, implying that his words are laced with a quiet authority and gravitas.
