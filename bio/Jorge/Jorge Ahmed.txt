Here's a summary of Jorge Ahmed's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jorge is an intense and focused individual, driven by his insatiable curiosity for knowledge. He has a strong sense of determination and persistence, which has helped him achieve success in his business ventures. However, this same drive can also lead to obsessive behavior, causing him to neglect his personal relationships and well-being. Despite this, Jorge's passion for discovery and exploration makes him a charismatic and engaging person who is drawn to others with similar interests.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel
* Hair Color: Dark Brown
* Build: Lean and athletic, with a hint of gauntness due to his intense focus on work.
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, prominent nose, and piercing hazel eyes that seem to bore into those he meets.

**Interests:** Jorge's interests are centered around ancient texts, rare artifacts, and hidden knowledge. He is particularly fascinated by the study of forgotten civilizations and lost lore. When not working on his business ventures or deciphering ancient texts, Jorge enjoys:

* Collecting rare books and manuscripts
* Studying ancient languages (e.g., hieroglyphics, cuneiform)
* Exploring hidden passageways and secret chambers in old buildings
* Traveling to distant lands in search of new knowledge and experiences

These interests have led Jorge to develop a broad range of skills, including linguistics, cryptography, and historical research. His love for discovery has also made him an expert in code-breaking and puzzle-solving.

As he embarks on his journey with "The Chronicles of Azsar", Jorge's personality will be put to the test. Will his obsessive drive lead him down a path of discovery or ruin? Only time will tell.
