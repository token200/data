Here's a summary of Jorge Meyer's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jorge is a complex individual with a tough exterior and a soft interior. On stage as the lead singer of Electric Storm, he is unpredictable and erratic, but off stage, he is quiet, introspective, and vulnerable. He has a deep sense of passion for music and a willingness to confront his demons. Despite his struggles with addiction, Jorge is fiercely loyal and protective of those he cares about.

**Physical Attributes:** Jorge stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build that reflects his love of rock music and energetic performances. His hair is dark brown, often messy and unkempt, and his eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to see right through you. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he got in a bar fight a few years ago.

**Interests:** Music is Jorge's primary passion, and he spends most of his free time writing songs, playing guitar, or practicing his stage presence. He is also an animal lover and volunteers at the local animal shelter, where he finds solace in caring for stray animals who have been abandoned or neglected. In addition to music, Jorge enjoys philosophy, poetry, and photography (although he's not a skilled photographer like Sophia!).
