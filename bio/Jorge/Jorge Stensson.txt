**Personality:** Jorge Stensson is a private investigator with a dark past and an affinity for the unknown. He has a keen sense of intuition and can read people well, which serves him in his line of work. However, he also has a somewhat troubled psyche, as evident from his emotional response to the case, feeling like it's whispering a "whispered secret in the dead of night".

**Interests:** As a private investigator, Jorge is drawn to the darker side of human nature. He has a fascination with the complexities of human behavior, particularly in relation to deception and secrets. His case work involves piecing together seemingly unrelated facts and uncovering hidden truths, which speaks to his analytical mind. Outside of his profession, Jorge's interests are not explicitly stated, but based on his introverted nature and tendency to seek out solitude (e.g., when he says "I need to talk to someone. Anyone"), it is likely that he values quiet time and contemplation.

Overall, Jorge Stensson is a complex and intriguing character with a rich inner life. His profession as a private investigator has left him with scars, but also provides him with a sense of purpose and meaning in his work.
