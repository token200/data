Here is a summary of Jorge Olsen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jorge Olsen is a rugged and unyielding individual with a complex psyche. He has a rough past as a former police officer, which has left him with emotional scars and a permanent limp. However, despite his gruff demeanor, he is a deeply compassionate and empathetic person who wants to help others heal from their own pain. Jorge has a dry sense of humor and can come across as intimidating or unapologetic at first, but beneath the surface lies a deep sense of kindness and a desire to connect with others.

**Physical Attributes:** Jorge Olsen stands approximately 6'2" (188 cm) tall with an athletic build, honed from years of physical labor. His hair is a thick, dark brown that is often messy and unkempt, and his eyes are a piercing blue that seem to bore into those he meets. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which adds to his rugged appearance.

**Interests:** Jorge's interests lie in two main areas: fishing and creating seaglass jewelry. He finds solace in the quiet, meditative act of fishing, where he can escape the chaos of his past and connect with nature. Creating seaglass jewelry allows him to express his artistic side and share his stories with others through the intricate designs and craftsmanship involved.

In addition to these interests, Jorge has a deep appreciation for history and law enforcement, which is reflected in his love of sharing tales from his time as a police officer. He also values resilience, resourcefulness, and the human capacity for growth and transformation, as seen in his mentorship of young Lila.

As he grows older and eventually retires from mentoring Lila, Jorge finds new purpose in his life, realizing that his work is not just about polishing seaglass but about helping others heal and find beauty in their brokenness.
