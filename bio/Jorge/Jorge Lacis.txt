**Personality:** Jorge appears to be introspective and guarded, as evidenced by his inability to recall his past or respond to Sofia's initial greeting. However, when he meets Sofia, he seems driven by a sense of duty and a willingness to face the truth about his mysterious past.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)

While his eye color is not specified in the story, it's reasonable to assume that his eyes are a deep, warm brown. His height and hair color suggest a rugged, earthy appearance.

* Uncovering the truth about his mysterious past
* Helping Sofia with whatever problem she is facing (implied by her note and words of urgency)
