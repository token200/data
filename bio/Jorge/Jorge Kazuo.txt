Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Jorge Kazuo's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jorge is a introspective and emotionally complex individual. He has experienced loss and betrayal in his past, which has left him feeling disconnected from the world around him. Despite this, he possesses a strong sense of determination and resilience, as evident when he decides to face his past head-on and take control of his destiny. However, he also struggles with office politics and can come across as uncertain or hesitant at times.

**Physical Attributes:** Jorge is likely to be a bit on the shorter side, but no specific height is mentioned in the story. His eye color is not explicitly stated either, so I will assume it's brown, given his Latin American heritage. He may have dark hair, possibly with some wave or texture to it, and a slender yet athletic build from his experience living on the streets of Buenos Aires.

**Interests:** Jorge seems to be fascinated by the unknown and the promise of a fresh start that Japan offers him. He is drawn to the cultural and historical aspects of Tokyo, but also feels disconnected from its fast-paced and purpose-driven environment. His thoughts often wander back to his native Argentina and the life he left behind. It's clear that Jorge values his heritage and is looking for a way to reconnect with it in his new surroundings.

**Additional Details:** Based on the story, I would imagine that Jorge has an artistic or creative side, possibly influenced by the tango music of his childhood. He may enjoy exploring Japanese art, literature, or cuisine, which could help him feel more connected to his new environment. However, his struggles with self-identity and belonging suggest that he might be on a journey of self-discovery, trying to find his place in Tokyo and reconcile his past with his present.
