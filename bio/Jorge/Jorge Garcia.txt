Here's a summary of the fictional character Jorge Garcia:

**Physical Attributes:** 
Jorge Garcia is a man in his mid-40s, standing at 5'8" tall. He has dark brown hair that often falls across his forehead and deep-set brown eyes that seem to hold a perpetual glint of sarcasm.

**Personality:**
Jorge is known for his dry wit, sharp tongue, and quick wit, which often leave those around him in stitches or cringing in discomfort. Despite his sarcastic exterior, he has a heart of gold and is fiercely loyal to his friends. He's also an exasperated but lovable guy who has seen it all - from the highs to the lows.

**Interests:** 
Jorge enjoys making jokes, playing poker (albeit recklessly), and attempting to navigate his way through life with a straight face. In his past life on Oahu, he was known for his passion for surfing and exploring the island's hidden gems. When in Los Angeles, Jorge tries to find solace in more subdued pursuits like cooking and reading.

**Background:** 
Jorge has an extensive network of friends from his island days, including Jack (played by Matthew Fox). After a decade away from Oahu, he returns to LA with plans to turn his life around.
