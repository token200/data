He spends his days hauling nets and repairing boats, finding solace in the gentle lapping of waves against the shore. At night, he is drawn to the vibrant sounds and colors of samba music, which brings him a sense of joy and connection to the community around him.

However, Jorge's past as a spy has left him with an insatiable curiosity about the world beyond his small town. He finds himself fascinated by the hidden corners and secrets of Rio's underbelly, often leading him down paths he never intended to take. His journey with Sophia has reignited this passion for exploration and discovery, leaving him questioning what lies ahead.
