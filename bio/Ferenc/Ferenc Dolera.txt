Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Ferenc Dolera's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ferenc Dolera appears to be a introspective and private individual. He has a tendency to keep his feelings locked away behind a mask of charm and good humor, making it difficult for others to get close to him. This reserve suggests that he may have trust issues or struggles with emotional vulnerability. However, the way he connects with his parents, particularly his mother's warm welcome, indicates that he values family and relationships deeply.

**Physical Attributes:** Ferenc Dolera is likely a man in his mid-to-late 30s, as implied by his job at a bank (presumably an entry-level or mid-management position). There is no specific mention of his height, but based on the description of his movements ("Ferenc Dolera stepped out into the familiar scent..."), he may be a bit lean and agile. His eye color is not specified, but considering the Hungarian setting of the story, it's possible that he has dark eyes (e.g., brown or black).

**Interests:** Ferenc Dolera seems to have a strong connection to his family history and the city of Budapest, as evident from his fond memories of exploring its streets with his grandfather. He also appears to be curious about his own past and uncertain about his future, hinting at a desire for self-discovery. The mention of a "phase" that might be related to his job or love life suggests that he may be interested in exploring new experiences and challenges.

It's worth noting that these attributes are inferred from the provided short story and might not be comprehensive or definitive. Further context or character development would be necessary to fully understand Ferenc Dolera's personality, interests, and physical characteristics.
