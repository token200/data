Based on the provided story, I've created a summary of Ferenc Eglītis' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ferenc Eglītis is a complex and intriguing individual. He possesses unmatched skills as a spy and has an unerring instinct for his work. However, this also suggests that he may be introverted and guarded, with a tendency to keep people at arm's length. Despite this, there's a sense of vulnerability and curiosity beneath the surface, which is evident in his willingness to take risks and listen to the woman's revelations.

**Physical Attributes:** Ferenc Eglītis appears to be a tall and lean individual, but no exact height is specified in the story. His eye color is unknown, but given the French setting of the café scene, it's possible that he has dark eyes, perhaps brown or blue. The description of him sipping absinthe also suggests that he may have a sophisticated and refined appearance.

**Interests:** Ferenc Eglītis' primary interest seems to be his work as a spy, gathering intelligence and uncovering secrets. However, the encounter with the enigmatic woman hints at a deeper fascination with the mysteries of the world and the complexities of human relationships. He appears to be drawn to people who challenge his perceptions and push him out of his comfort zone.

In terms of specific interests, it's possible that Ferenc Eglītis enjoys:

* Reading and learning about history, politics, and philosophy
* Engaging in intellectual debates and discussions with others
* Exploring the city's underworld and experiencing new cultures
* Collecting rare books or other unique artifacts related to his line of work

Keep in mind that these are inferences based on a short story, and Ferenc Eglītis' true personality, interests, and physical attributes may be more complex and nuanced.
