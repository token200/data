Ferenc's primary interest is music, specifically playing the violin and composing pieces that reflect his Hungarian heritage and Jewish roots. He also values community and connection, as evident in his involvement with the underground orchestra and performances for the Hungarian Resistance.

**Additional Details:**
Given Ferenc's background, it can be assumed that he:

* Speaks fluent Hungarian and may have some knowledge of Yiddish or other Jewish languages.
