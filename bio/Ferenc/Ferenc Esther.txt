It's worth noting that while Ferenc Esther is fictional, I've tried to create a well-rounded character by incorporating the following details from the original story:

* His Hungarian heritage and upbringing in Budapest
* His musical talent and education at the Hungarian Academy of Music
* His humility and dedication to his craft
* His passion for traditional Hungarian folk music and classical techniques
