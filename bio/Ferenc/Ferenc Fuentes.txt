As he navigates this inner turmoil, he comes to understand the importance of surrendering to his emotions without judgment, allowing himself to be guided by raw energy and intuition.

His hair is probably dark brown, worn long and unkempt, framing his heart-shaped face. His eyes are an intense, piercing blue that seem to hold a depth of emotion. Ferenc stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) tall.

**Interests:** As an artist, Ferenc's primary interest is in creating meaningful works of art that capture the essence of human experience. He is deeply drawn to exploring themes of melancholy, longing, and introspection through his paintings. In addition to art, Ferenc has a strong interest in philosophy and spirituality, seeking guidance from thinkers like his old friend who told him "Art is not about expressing emotions; it's about being aware of them." He also values the wisdom of his ancestors, particularly his father, a skilled woodcarver, and Gyula Kálmán, the Hungarian émigré artist who taught him in Paris.
