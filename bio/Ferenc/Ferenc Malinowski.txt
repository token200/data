He has a deep sense of vulnerability and insecurity, stemming from his years as a spy and assassin where he had to constantly suppress his emotions and maintain a facade of calmness. Despite this, he has a strong sense of determination and resilience, which allowed him to navigate the treacherous world of espionage. However, his past continues to haunt him, leaving him with emotional scars and a lingering sense of unease.

**Physical Attributes:** Ferenc stands at 6 feet (183 cm) tall, with a lean and athletic build that speaks to his years of martial training and physical discipline. His eyes are an unsettling shade of blue-green, almost gray-blue, which seem to bore into those he meets. They appear piercing and intense, as if searching for hidden truths.

**Interests:** Ferenc has a deep passion for art, particularly painting and photography, which he discovered during his time in Budapest. These creative pursuits have allowed him to reconnect with his own emotions and find solace in the beauty of the world around him.
