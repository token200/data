His dark brown hair is often neatly trimmed, giving him a clean-cut appearance that belies the complexity beneath.

**Personality:** Ferenc Mägi is a man of mystery and intensity, with a commanding presence that draws people to him. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, with a strong sense of loyalty only to those he trusts implicitly.
