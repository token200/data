While the story doesn't provide much information about Patryk's physical appearance beyond Emma's observation of his "gruff exterior," we can infer some details. Patryk likely has a rugged, weathered look due to his age and occupation as an engineer. His sandy blond hair adds a touch of warmth and humanity to his appearance.

**Interests:** Patryk is passionate about fixing mechanical objects and restoring them to their former glory. He finds purpose and fulfillment in this work, which allows him to bring order and beauty back to broken things. This interest is deeply tied to his childhood memories and his late father's legacy as a skilled mechanic.
