Her mentor Naomi sees something special in Ria, and helps her unlock her creative potential.

**Physical Attributes:** Ria has long, dark hair that falls down her back like a waterfall. Her eyes are an intense, piercing green that seem to see right through you.

She has always been drawn to nature and the outdoors, spending hours exploring the woods and collecting leaves and rocks.

She is passionate about exploring themes of identity, belonging, and the search for meaning in a chaotic world through her art.
