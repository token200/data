Based on the short story, here is a summary of Ria González Fernández's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ria is described as a free-spirited artist who is drawn to vibrant environments like La Latina in Madrid. She is an avid observer of human nature, often spending hours people-watching from a bench outside the Plaza Mayor. Her empathetic nature allows her to sense the emotions and struggles of those around her, particularly evident when she connects with Sofia. Ria appears to be curious, creative, and compassionate.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there is only one physical attribute mentioned in the story: Ria's wild curly hair. It can be assumed that her height may vary, but no specific information is provided. Her eye color is not mentioned either, so I will choose a shade of brown as a hypothetical match for her warm and artistic personality.

**Interests:** As an artist, Ria is clearly passionate about art and drawing. She spends most of her days sketching people from the bench outside the Plaza Mayor, capturing their unique stories and emotions on paper. Her interests likely extend beyond just art, given her curiosity about human nature and her desire to connect with others on a deeper level.

It's worth noting that some details are left ambiguous in the story, allowing for interpretation and imagination. However, based on Ria's character, it can be inferred that she is a creative, empathetic, and social individual who values connection and understanding with others.
