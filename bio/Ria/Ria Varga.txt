Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Ria Varga's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ria appears to be a free-spirited individual who is comfortable with uncertainty and adaptability. As a dimensional traveler, she has likely developed a sense of resilience and flexibility due to her constant exposure to new realities. Her ability to laugh at the absurdity of her situation ("That's the life of a temporal traveler") suggests that she has a lighthearted and humorous outlook on life.

She also seems to be drawn to the creative and emotional aspects of her experiences, as evidenced by her fascination with music. This could indicate that Ria values self-expression and has a strong connection to art or other creative pursuits.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the provided text does not provide explicit details about Ria's physical appearance. However, based on the context, we can make some educated guesses:

* Height: Given her ability to navigate busy streets with ease, it's possible that Ria is relatively tall and agile.
* Eye Color: The story doesn't explicitly state Ria's eye color, but considering the description of her as a dimensional traveler with a "vibrant scene before her," it's likely that she has striking eyes (perhaps blue or green) that are expressive and engaging.

**Interests:** As mentioned earlier, music appears to be one of Ria's interests. Her drawnness to the melancholy melody of the jazz band in the alleyway suggests that she values emotional depth and complexity in her experiences.

Additionally, as a dimensional traveler, Ria likely has a deep curiosity about the multiverse and its many possibilities. She may be fascinated by different realities, histories, and cultures, which could drive her interests in science, philosophy, or the arts.

Lastly, given Eli's mischievous grin when he mentions "temporal chaos," it's possible that Ria is also interested in exploring the boundaries of time travel and its effects on reality. This could indicate a more adventurous and thrill-seeking side to her personality.
