Here is a summary of Ria Visconti's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ria is a free-spirited individual who feels trapped by the weight of expectation placed upon her as the eldest daughter of the influential Visconti family. She yearns for something more than the conventions of her aristocratic upbringing and is drawn to unconventional perspectives on life. Her openness to new ideas and experiences makes her a curious and empathetic person.

**Physical Attributes:** Ria stands at about 5'8" with an athletic yet slender build, reflecting her active lifestyle and love for exploring Florence's streets. Her long dark hair falls in loose waves down her back, and her expressive eyes are an deep shade of brown that seem to sparkle with curiosity. She often wears simple yet elegant clothing that allows her to blend into the crowd.

**Interests:** Ria is fascinated by art, literature, and philosophy, which she discovers through her clandestine meetings with Francesca, the artist's sister. Her love for creative expression and exploration of new ideas leads her to spend hours observing artists at work, like the young painter who captures her attention in Florence. She finds solace in discussing these topics with Francesca, who shares her passion for unconventional perspectives on life.

As Ria navigates her relationships with her family and her newfound friend, she begins to realize that duty doesn't have to be suffocating; it can be something more than just bound to a particular family name.
