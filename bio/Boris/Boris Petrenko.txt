Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Boris Petrenko:

**Personality:** Boris is an enigmatic and introspective individual with a sense of detachment. He appears observant and analytical, often blending into his surroundings while observing others with intensity. Despite this aloof exterior, he has a dry sense of humor and can be charming when the occasion calls for it, as evident in his conversation with Natalya about Russian literature.

**Physical Attributes:** Boris is a middle-aged man with piercing green eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. He has rugged features softened by a wispy beard, which adds an air of intellectualism to his appearance. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) tall and often wears a black fedora hat and a long coat that billows behind him like a dark cloud.

**Interests:** Boris is a lover of Russian literature, particularly the works of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. He has a deep understanding of literary theories and can quote lines from classic novels with ease. This intellectualism suggests that he values knowledge, philosophy, and creative expression.

Other interests are not explicitly mentioned in the provided story, but it's possible that Boris is drawn to art, music, or politics, given his enigmatic nature and potential connections to foreign governments (as hinted at by rumors).

**Potential Quirks:** Given his introverted personality, Boris might have a fondness for solitude and quiet contemplation. He could be a solitary figure who prefers the company of books, ideas, and abstract concepts rather than people.

Keep in mind that these details are inferred from the short story provided, and further development would be needed to fully flesh out Boris's character.
