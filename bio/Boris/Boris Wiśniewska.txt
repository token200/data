Based on the short story, here is a summary of Boris Wiśniewska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Boris Wiśniewska, or "Bory" as his friends call him, is a introspective and emotional person. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or standoffish at first, but once you get to know him, he opens up and reveals his vulnerable side. Two years after the accident that changed his life, Bory is still struggling to cope with his grief, but he is determined to move forward.

**Physical Attributes:** Bory is a tall man (around 6'2" or 188 cm) with unruly brown hair, which he often runs his hands through when he's feeling anxious. His eyes are a deep brown color, which seem to hold a wealth of emotions and memories. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, likely from the car accident that occurred two years ago.

**Interests:** Bory is an avid music lover, particularly classic rock and folk music, which he often listens to while lost in thought. He also enjoys photography and has a passion for capturing the beauty of the world around him. Before the accident, he was an active person who loved hiking and exploring new places with his best friend Jakub. Now, he finds solace in quieter pursuits like journaling and observing the people and streets of Warsaw.

It's worth noting that Bory's interests are not explicitly stated in the short story, but based on the context and descriptions, these can be inferred as part of his personality and background.
