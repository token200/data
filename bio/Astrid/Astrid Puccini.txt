- **Hair Color:** Dark, straight hair that falls to her shoulders, framing her heart-shaped face and emphasizing her determined expression.

**Interests:**

Astrid seems to have a passion for music, as hinted at by the fact that she is the daughter of a renowned conductor and composer. However, it's unclear whether she shares her father's love for opera or if she has developed other musical interests. Given her desire to forge her own path, it's possible that Astrid might be drawn to more contemporary genres or creative outlets that allow her to express herself outside of the operatic realm.

Additionally, Astrid appears to enjoy spending time in nature, as evident from her walk through the quiet streets of Ravenswood and her appreciation for the "cool breeze" on a sunny day. She may also appreciate solitude, evident from her decision to step back into the sunlight after finishing her coffee alone.
