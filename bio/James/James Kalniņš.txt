Based on the inspiration from Janis Kalniņš, I've created a fictional character profile for James Kalniņš:

**Name:** James Kalniņš
**Age:** 28
**Nationality:** Latvian-American
**Height:** 5'10" (178 cm)
**Eye Color:** Bright blue with a hint of green

**Personality:** James is a driven and determined individual, always striving to improve himself. He's fiercely competitive but remains humble and grounded, crediting his success to the support of those around him. His passion for figure skating is unmatched, and he's willing to put in the extra effort required to achieve perfection.

**Interests:** Besides figure skating, James enjoys hiking, playing piano, and reading classical literature. He's particularly fond of the works of Latvian authors like Andrejs Pumpurs and Rainis, which fuel his love for his heritage.

**Background:** Born and raised in Riga, Latvia, James began skating at a young age under the guidance of his father, a former figure skater himself. As he grew older, James's natural talent and dedication earned him a spot on the national team, representing Latvia internationally. He now resides in the United States, where he continues to skate and compete while also pursuing a career in music.

**Goals:** James aims to become a world-class figure skater, pushing the boundaries of his art and inspiring others through his performances. In the future, he hopes to establish a skating school in Latvia, sharing his passion with the next generation of athletes.

This fictional character is designed to capture some of the same qualities that made Janis Kalniņš an inspiration – determination, perseverance, and a love for figure skating.
