**Physical Attributes:**
James is likely in his mid-to-late twenties, with an athletic yet lean build that suggests he prioritizes health over appearance. He stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with a subtle, angular face structure that allows him to express a wide range of emotions through his eyes and eyebrows. His eyes are a deep shade of brown that seems to sparkle with curiosity when discussing his latest investigative leads. His hair is dark brown, often neatly trimmed to accentuate his sharp jawline.

**Personality:**
James is an intensely driven individual, willing to push himself to the limits of exhaustion in pursuit of a story that captivates him. His insatiable curiosity and passion for storytelling have earned him a reputation as one of Tokyo's most talented reporters. However, this relentless drive can sometimes lead him to neglect his personal relationships and well-being, causing friction with those around him. James is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority and questioning the status quo in his pursuit of truth.

**Interests:**
James has a deep love for storytelling and investigation, which drives most of his interests outside of work. He's an avid reader, devouring books on history, sociology, and psychology to deepen his understanding of human behavior and motivations. In his free time, James enjoys exploring Tokyo's lesser-known neighborhoods, seeking out hidden gems and unique cultural experiences that fuel his creativity. His fascination with the city's underground art scene has become a defining aspect of his life, leading him to question the power structures and social hierarchies that govern this world.

**Additional Details:**
