**Physical Attributes:** James is a tall and lean man in his mid-40s, standing at around 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic build. His piercing green eyes seem to be one of his most striking features, as mentioned in the story. His dark hair is often unkempt, giving him a rugged and brooding appearance.

**Personality:** James exudes an air of quiet confidence that commands attention without seeking it. He has a razor-sharp mind and quick wit, which serves him well in his work as a private investigator. He is fiercely determined and driven, with a strong sense of justice that motivates him to solve even the most complex cases. Despite his tough exterior, he seems to have a soft spot for those in need, as evidenced by his taking on Sophia's case.

**Interests:** James' interests are centered around solving mysteries and uncovering the truth. He has a deep-seated passion for investigation and is always drawn to the darker side of life. As a private investigator, he spends most of his time researching, interviewing witnesses, and piecing together seemingly unrelated clues. When not working, it's unclear what James enjoys doing in his free time, but it's likely something that allows him to keep his mind sharp and active.

**Other details:** Given James' background as a local gang member from the gritty streets of Warsaw, Poland, he may have a strong connection to the city's underworld. He is well-respected by those in law enforcement, who admire his intelligence and tenacity, but also fear his skill with his fists and his ability to navigate the darker corners of society.
