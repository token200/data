Here is a short summary of James Korhonen's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided story:

**Personality:** James Korhonen appears to be a determined and resourceful individual. He is driven by a sense of justice and is not afraid to dig deep into complex cases, as seen in his investigation of Sophia's disappearance. However, he also seems to have a somewhat intuitive or instinctual side, as hinted at when he feels "a shiver run down [his] spine" upon approaching Petrov's mansion.

**Physical Attributes:** Based on the story, James Korhonen is likely:

* Middle-aged: The fact that he has been in the private investigation business for a while and seems to have seen it all suggests an age range of around 45-55 years old.
* Tall and lean: Although his height is not specified, James's ability to move comfortably through Petrov's mansion and approach him with confidence implies a taller build.
* Has piercing brown eyes: The description of Alexei Petrov's "piercing blue" eyes does not match Korhonen; it would be inconsistent if he had blue eyes as well. Therefore, I have speculated that Korhonen likely has brown eyes.

**Interests:** As a private investigator, James Korhonen is naturally drawn to cases involving missing persons, deceitful individuals, and the darker aspects of human nature. He seems to take pride in his work and is driven by a desire for justice, which is evident in his determination to uncover the truth behind Sophia's disappearance.
