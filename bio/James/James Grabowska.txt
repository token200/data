Based on the short story, here is a summary of James Grabowska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** James Grabowska is a complex and troubled individual consumed by his past. He is haunted by memories of the murder case that still lingers in his mind like an open wound. As a result, he has become withdrawn and isolated, pushing away anyone who tries to reach out to him. However, with the arrival of the old informant's cryptic message, James begins to feel a sense of determination and hope, indicating a possible glimmer of redemption.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Brown, once bright and piercing but now dulled with age and regret
* Age: Late 50s or early 60s, exact age not specified

**Interests:** James is a retired detective with a passion for solving mysteries and uncovering the truth. He spends most of his time lost in memories of the past, particularly those related to the Emma Taylor case. His interest in justice and redemption drives him to seek out information that may help clear his name and bring closure to the tragedy.

In terms of specific interests outside of detective work, James' life appears to have been consumed by whiskey and writing, as evidenced by the presence of "whiskey-stained journals" in his personal life. He is likely a solitary individual who values his alone time, but the arrival of the informant's message suggests that he may be opening himself up to new connections and possibilities.
