**Personality:** James is complex and multifaceted, with a deep inner life that he only fully expresses through his music. He has a charismatic stage presence, but behind the scenes, he struggles with anxiety and depression.

As the lead singer of Echo Fade, he pours his heart and soul into every performance, using his voice as a vessel for emotions and experiences.

As an individual, James is drawn to creative pursuits and is often found writing poetry or working on solo projects that allow him to express himself outside of Echo Fade's spotlight. He is also deeply connected to the natural world and finds solace in spending time outdoors, whether it's walking through parks like the one he stumbled upon that night.

Despite his busy schedule and pressures of fame, James makes room for self-care activities such as meditation, yoga, or simply taking long walks to clear his mind. He is a seeker of truth and authenticity, often questioning the world around him and pushing himself to explore new depths within himself.
