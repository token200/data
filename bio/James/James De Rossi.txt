Here is a summary of James De Rossi's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** James De Rossi is a private investigator with a no-nonsense attitude, having seen the worst of humanity in his line of work. He is fiercely loyal to those he cares about, particularly his brother Luca, and will stop at nothing to uncover the truth and protect them from harm. Despite his tough exterior, there are hints of vulnerability and emotional depth beneath, as evident in his strong bond with Luca and his growing concern for Sophia.

**Physical Attributes:** James De Rossi is a ruggedly handsome man in his mid-to-late 30s. He stands at around 6'1" (185 cm) tall, with broad shoulders and a lean build that speaks to his athletic background. His eyes are a piercing blue, often squinting from the sun or intense situations, while his dark brown hair is flecked with wisps of gray at the temples. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, likely from a past injury or bar fight. His worn leather jacket and faded baseball cap suggest a laid-back, rough-around-the-edges demeanor that belies his sharp mind and quick wit.

**Interests:** As a private investigator, James De Rossi's work is his lifeblood. He has a keen eye for detail, a talent for piecing together seemingly unrelated clues, and an encyclopedic knowledge of the city's underbelly. Outside of work, he enjoys whiskey-fueled nights at the local dive bars, where he can swap stories with fellow investigators and gather intel on the latest cases. He is also an avid fan of classic rock music, often finding himself lost in the sounds of The Rolling Stones or Bruce Springsteen when the mood strikes him. Despite his rough exterior, James has a soft spot for old movies and vinyl records, which he collects like rare treasures.
