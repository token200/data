**Personality:** James is a cunning and resourceful individual with a sharp mind and quick reflexes. He has developed a tough exterior to protect himself from the harsh realities of his environment, but beneath this layer lies a complex and driven person who never gives up (his motto, "El Loco nunca se rinde").

* Thievery and smuggling
* Strategy and planning (as evident from his ability to stay one step ahead of the law)
* Loyalty and trust (particularly when it comes to Ana)
* The thrill of taking risks and pushing boundaries

However, with the emergence of his partnership with Ana and his subsequent involvement in El Jefe's game, James's interests may also expand to include:

* Partnership and collaboration
* Deception and manipulation
* Outwitting his enemies and staying one step ahead
* Seeking revenge against those who wronged him (including his former gang leader)

Overall, James is a multi-faceted individual with a range of interests that reflect his complex personality and circumstances.
