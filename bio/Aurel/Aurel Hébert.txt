Here is a summary of Aurel Hébert's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Aurel Hébert was known for his complex and introspective nature. He struggled with mental health issues and faced numerous setbacks in his relationships, which led to periods of reclusiveness. However, this period of introspection also seemed to fuel his creative output, allowing him to pour his innermost thoughts onto paper. His poetry conveyed a sense of hope, loss, and resilience, suggesting that despite his personal turmoil, he was able to find solace in his art.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no physical attributes are mentioned in the short story, but we can make some educated guesses based on the time period and era in which Hébert lived. Assuming he was of average height for a Frenchman during World War I (around 165-170 cm or 5'5"-5'7"), and considering that eye color is often inherited from parents, let's assume Aurel had dark brown eyes, common in many European populations.

**Interests:** As a poet, Hébert was deeply interested in exploring the human condition through his work. His poetry dealt with themes of love, loss, redemption, and the struggles of everyday life. He seemed to be particularly drawn to the symbolism of nature, as evident in his most celebrated work, "Le Jardin des démons" (The Garden of Demons), which explores the darker aspects of human experience through a symbolic garden.

In addition to his literary pursuits, Hébert's experiences during World War I and its aftermath likely shaped his interests and perspectives. He may have been interested in social justice, pacifism, or other causes related to conflict resolution and human rights. However, these interests are not explicitly mentioned in the short story.
