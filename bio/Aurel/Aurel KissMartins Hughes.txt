**Physical Attributes:**
Aurel is described as an enigmatic figure, but no specific height or age range is mentioned. However, based on her demeanor and behavior, it can be inferred that she is likely in her mid-to-late 30s or early 40s.

Her eye color is not explicitly stated, but given the description of her eyes glinting like stars in the night sky, it's possible that they are a deep shade of blue or grey. Her hair and skin tone are also not specified, but considering her preference for being surrounded by old parchment and dust, she might have pale or fair skin.

**Personality:**
Aurel is portrayed as a recluse, preferring to keep to herself and maintain a sense of mystery around her. This suggests that she values her independence and may be introverted or even socially anxious. However, when Edgar approaches her, she reveals a hint of warmth in her eyes, indicating that she might not be entirely unapproachable.

Her confidence and self-assurance are evident in the way she effortlessly repairs the damaged manuscript, suggesting that Aurel is highly skilled and knowledgeable in her craft. She also possesses an air of enigma, leaving Edgar (and others) wondering about her true identity.

**Interests:**
Aurel's interests are largely centered around art, specifically restoration and preservation. Her vast collection of rare books and peculiar artifacts suggests a deep fascination with the past and a love for learning about obscure techniques and materials.

Her work on restoring damaged or ruined works of art is not just a technical skill but also an artistic expression. Aurel seems to find joy in bringing forgotten masterpieces back to life, and her talent has earned her recognition in the art world.

Additionally, Aurel's affinity for candles, ancient scrolls, and dusty environments suggests that she might have a romantic or spiritual side, finding solace in the quiet, contemplative moments surrounded by artifacts from the past.
