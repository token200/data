**Physical Attributes:** Ben is 5'10" (178 cm) tall with an athletic yet lean build. His striking features include piercing green eyes, jet-black hair, and a small nose ring that adds to his edgy, futuristic style. He often sports a pair of worn-out, black-rimmed glasses perched on the end of his nose, giving him a bespectacled look that belies his razor-sharp intellect.

Beneath his reserved exterior lies a driven and fiercely loyal individual who will stop at nothing to uncover the truth.

**Interests:** As a robotics enthusiast, Ben has a deep passion for artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision. His love for coding, programming languages, and software development is rivaled only by his fascination with human-computer interaction, natural language processing, and cognitive science. In his free time, he enjoys tinkering with old machinery, exploring new tech trends, and attending robotics conferences to stay at the forefront of innovation.

Some additional details that flesh out Ben's character:

* He has a fondness for Japanese cuisine, particularly sushi, ramen, and udon noodles.
* He is an avid reader of science fiction novels, such as Asimov's Foundation series and Gibson's Neuromancer, which fuel his imagination about the future of humanity and technology.
