Based on the provided short story about Ben Solo (Kylo Ren), I have created a fictional character profile for Ben Kenji:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
- Eye Color: Intense, piercing blue, hinting at his strong connection to the dark side
- Hair: Dark brown, often worn long and unruly, reflecting his conflicted personality
- Build: Lean yet muscular, a result of his rigorous training as a First Order warrior

**Personality:**
Ben Kenji is a complex, brooding individual driven by a deep sense of conviction. His strong sense of justice leads him to support the First Order's goals, but it also fuels his inner struggle between loyalty and redemption. He possesses a dry wit and sarcasm, often used as a coping mechanism when dealing with the weight of his responsibilities. Beneath the surface, however, lies a vulnerable and sensitive person grappling with his past mistakes and questioning the morality of his choices.

**Interests:**
- Mastery of lightsaber combat
- Leadership within the First Order
- Uncovering hidden secrets about the dark side and the mysterious powers that drive its users
- Collecting rare, ancient artifacts related to the First Order's history
- Exploring the depths of the Force, searching for answers about his connection to both light and dark sides

Ben Kenji is a formidable figure, driven by a mix of conviction, duty, and personal demons. His struggles to reconcile his past and present selves make him an intriguing character, full of depth and complexity.
