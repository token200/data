Here's a summary of Sahra Kenji's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided inspiration:

**Personality:** Sahra Kenji is confident, resourceful, and determined. She has a natural talent for reading people and situations, which has helped her become a skilled merchant. Her years of experience have taught her to be cunning and calculating in business deals, but she also has a sense of satisfaction and pride when closing successful transactions. Despite the challenges in her line of work, Sahra is grateful for the skills passed down from her father and is determined to carry on his legacy.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm) - tall enough to stand out in crowded markets but not so tall as to draw unnecessary attention.
* Eye Color: Dark Brown - a deep, expressive brown that seems to bore into those she looks at, making them feel like they're being truly seen.

**Interests:** Sahra Kenji has a strong interest in trade and commerce, with a particular focus on finding rare and valuable items. She is driven by a desire to succeed and make her father proud, but also has a sense of adventure and curiosity that drives her to explore new places and meet new people. On a more personal level, Sahra values her independence and self-reliance, having learned to navigate the cutthroat world of merchants on her own after her father's passing.

It's worth noting that some details were left out in the original passage, such as Sahra's age, hair color, or style (beyond being tied back in a ponytail). I've filled these gaps based on my interpretation of the character and the context provided.
