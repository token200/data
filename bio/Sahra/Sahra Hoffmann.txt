Despite her tough exterior, she has a soft spot for those she cares about and is willing to open up and reconnect with others. Her confidence and determination inspire those around her.

**Physical Attributes:** Sahra stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic build. Her hair is a rich, dark brown color that often falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are a deep shade of indigo, almost purple, which seem to sparkle with creativity and intelligence. She has a small tattoo of a paintbrush on her left wrist and a scar above her right eyebrow from a childhood accident.
