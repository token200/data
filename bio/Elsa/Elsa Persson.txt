Here is a summary of Elsa Persson's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Elsa Persson appears to be a introverted and reserved individual who has grown accustomed to being an outsider due to her unique abilities as the Snow Queen. She seems to have a mix of confidence and self-doubt, often hiding behind a mask of familiarity to cope with the constant curiosity and fear surrounding her powers. However, in this specific instance, she shows vulnerability and willingness to accept kindness from others.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Elsa's height is not explicitly mentioned in the story, but based on typical depictions of Snow Queens, it can be assumed that she stands around 5'8" (173 cm) or slightly above average height.
* Eye Color: Her eye color is described as "icy gaze," which suggests that her eyes may be a pale blue or grayish-blue shade.

**Interests:** Elsa's interests seem to revolve around her powers, but also include:

* Learning to control and accept herself for who she is beyond her abilities. She hopes to find ways to harness her magic instead of letting it define her.
* Appreciating the simple pleasures in life, such as hot cocoa on a cold day (as seen when she accepts the cup from the street performer).
* Possibly connecting with others who can see past her powers and understand her as an individual.

Overall, Elsa appears to be a complex character struggling to find balance between her royal duties and personal desires. She is likely curious about exploring her true identity and forming meaningful connections with others who accept her for who she is.
