She is an avid reader of scientific literature, devouring books on everything from relativity to string theory. In her free time (which is rare), she enjoys writing poetry and playing the piano. Despite her reserved nature, Elsa has a deep love for music and often finds solace in the sounds of Chopin or Debussy.
