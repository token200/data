Here is a summary of Elsa Salamanca's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Elsa is an enigmatic and reserved individual, often referred to as "icy" due to her detached demeanor. However, beneath this surface lies a complex and multifaceted person who longs for freedom and adventure. She is intelligent, resourceful, and determined, with a strong sense of justice and a desire to forge her own path.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Elsa stands at around 5'8" (173 cm), with a slender yet athletic build.
* Eye Color: Her eyes are an unsettling shade of pale blue, almost grey, which seems to match the colour of the sky on those grey days she spends alone in her room.
* Hair: Elsa's hair is dark brown and shoulder-length, often kept neatly styled and away from her face.

**Interests:** Elsa has a secret passion for cryptography and hacking, which sets her apart from her family's expectations. She is also highly intelligent and resourceful, able to use her skills to gather intel on her father's operations from the shadows. Her interests extend beyond these technical pursuits as well; she seems drawn to art, music, or other creative outlets that allow her to express herself freely.

It appears Elsa has no hobbies, besides these mentioned, aside from reading and being an avid listener.
