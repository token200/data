Based on the short story, here's a summary of Elsa Jørgensen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Elsa is a complex and introverted individual who has been carrying a deep-seated fear and guilt due to her "accident" on her 18th birthday. She has always felt like an outsider and has struggled to control her powers, leading to a life of isolation and secrecy. Despite this, she shows glimpses of vulnerability and desperation, particularly in her interactions with her sister Anna and her father Helge.

**Physical Attributes:** Elsa is tall, standing at around 5'10" (178 cm), which is above average height for someone from her Scandinavian background. Her striking feature is her icy blonde hair, which falls to her shoulders like a shroud, a constant reminder of the secrets she keeps locked away. Her eyes are an intense blue, almost grey in color, which seems to hold a deep sadness and introspection.

**Interests:** Elsa's interests seem to be centered around controlling and mastering her powers, particularly ice and snow manipulation. She is skilled at creating intricate ice sculptures and has a natural talent for this ability. However, this power comes with great responsibility and emotional weight, as it serves as a constant reminder of her "accident" and the pain she has caused others.

Additionally, Elsa's interest in controlling her powers seems to be tied to finding a sense of belonging and connection with others, particularly those around her, like her sister Anna. She is drawn to the idea of living a life where she can be herself without fear of being discovered or harming others.

It's also worth noting that Elsa appears to have an interest in solitude and quiet contemplation, as evidenced by her preference for avoiding crowds and social gatherings. This desire for alone time suggests that she values her independence and may struggle with vulnerability and intimacy.

Overall, Elsa Jørgensen is a deeply introspective and emotionally complex character, whose personality, physical attributes, and interests are all intertwined with the struggles of controlling her extraordinary powers.
