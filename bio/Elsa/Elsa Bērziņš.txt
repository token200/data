Based on the inspiration from the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Elsa Bērziņš:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build, reflecting her affinity for the icy arts.
- Eye Color: Icy blue, a trait reminiscent of frosty mornings in Riga. Her eyes seem to sparkle like sapphires when she's channeling her powers.
- Hair Color and Style: Elsa's hair is a wild tangle of curly silver locks, a unique feature that sets her apart from others. She often wears it loose, allowing the wind to whip through it as she works with ice and snow.

**Personality:**
Elsa Bērziņš is an introverted yet fiercely independent individual who has struggled to find her place among others. Having been forced to conceal her powers for so long, Elsa initially comes across as reserved or even aloof to those outside of her inner circle. However, once you gain her trust, she reveals a kind and compassionate heart, fiercely protective of those she cares about. Elsa's journey towards self-acceptance has given her the confidence to speak up and express herself authentically.

**Interests:**
Elsa is deeply passionate about ice magic, an ancient lineage that her family has kept hidden for generations. She spends countless hours studying and experimenting with her powers, seeking ways to refine and master them. Beyond her connection to ice magic, Elsa enjoys exploring the frozen landscapes of Riga, finding solace in nature's silence and serenity.

As a member of her secret society, Elsa participates in elaborate snowscapes and sculpture competitions, showcasing her skills as an artist. She finds joy in collaborating with fellow ice enthusiasts, learning new techniques, and sharing ideas that push the boundaries of their art form.

When not immersed in her craft, Elsa likes to read about history, folklore, and mythology related to magic, seeking knowledge that will deepen her understanding of her heritage and help her protect its secrets from those who might misuse them.
