Despite her tough exterior, Elsa is deeply lonely and yearns for human connection.

**Interests:** As an art enthusiast, Elsa has a keen eye for the beauty in Parisian streetscapes and architecture. She is particularly fascinated by the city's history and hidden corners that are shrouded from prying eyes. In private moments, she collects rare books on mythology, folklore, and ancient cultures, drawn to their mystique and secrets. The mysterious allure of the moonstone-eyed woman from her childhood also captivates her imagination.

**Hobbies:** Elsa enjoys midnight strolls along the Seine Riverbank, lost in thought as she contemplates the mysteries of life and art. She finds solace in reading about mythology and history, especially tales of strong women and their untold stories. In quieter moments, she composes music on a rare, antique piano that has been passed down through her family.
