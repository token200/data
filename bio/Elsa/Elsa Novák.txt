**Personality:** Elsa Novák appears to be a compassionate, determined, and introspective individual. She is deeply connected to her family legacy and is driven by a desire to understand and carry on her grandmother's work. Her emotional journey in the story suggests that she may also be someone who values love, connection, and personal growth.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Elsa is likely around 5'6" (168 cm) tall, as this height seems plausible for an adult woman of Eastern European descent.

**Interests:** As a renowned botanist, Elsa's primary interest is in plant research, particularly rare species found in the Czech Republic. However, her encounter with the old man and his grandmother's book suggests that she may also have an interest in family history, legacy, and personal stories. Her emotional connection to the book implies that she values knowledge, love, and storytelling as well.
