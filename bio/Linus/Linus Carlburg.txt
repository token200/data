**Personality:** Linus is a quiet and introspective soul, often lost in thought as he wanders through the bustling streets of Copenhagen. He has a contemplative nature, enjoying the stillness and solitude that comes with exploring art and history.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: A deep, rich brown that seems to hold a world of emotions within its depths
* Hair: Unkempt and sandy blond, often falling across Linus's face in loose, artistic splashes
* Build: Slender and lean, with a wiry physique that belies his creative energy
* Facial Features: High cheekbones, a pointed chin, and a nose slightly crooked from years of reading and sketching

**Interests:** As a young artist, Linus is deeply passionate about the city's vibrant art scene. He spends countless hours exploring galleries, museums, and street art installations, always on the lookout for new inspiration. When not immersed in his own creative pursuits, Linus is drawn to history, music, and storytelling â€“ often finding himself lost in the pages of dusty tomes or the melodies of antique instruments.

The mysterious allure of "Curios and Wonders" has awakened a deep fascination within Linus, as he becomes increasingly enthralled by the shop's peculiar trinkets, relics, and tales. He is particularly drawn to the music box and its haunting melody, which seems to speak directly to his artistic soul.
