This obsessive nature leads to a gradual deterioration in his mental state, causing him to become clouded by desperation.

**Physical Attributes:**
* Height: 6 feet (183 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark blue, which takes on a haunted look as Linus's obsession with The Echo progresses.
* Other physical attributes are not specified in the story, but based on his character development, it can be inferred that Linus is likely slender and gaunt due to his intense focus on his work.

**Interests:**
Linus's primary interest is studying the phenomenon of "The Echo," a rare occurrence where particles from parallel universes collide with our own, creating temporary distortions in space-time. He spends countless hours poring over equations and conducting experiments to understand this phenomenon better.
