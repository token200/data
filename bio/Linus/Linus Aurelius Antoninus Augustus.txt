**Physical Attributes:** Linus stands at an impressive height of 6'2" (188 cm), with a strong and imposing presence. His piercing blue eyes are fringed with thick lashes, giving them an extra layer of intensity. His dark brown hair is always impeccably styled, and he sports a well-groomed beard that frames his chiseled features.

**Personality:** Linus is a complex and introspective individual, often lost in thought as he contemplates the weighty responsibilities of being Emperor. He possesses a sharp mind and quick wit, but his affinity for analysis can make him appear aloof or detached to those who don't know him well. Despite this, he has a dry sense of humor and can be witty when the situation calls for it.

**Interests:** Linus is deeply invested in the welfare of the empire and its people, often spending hours reviewing trade agreements and meeting with his advisors. He is also an avid reader and patron of the arts, frequently attending performances at the Theater of Pompey or visiting the Great Library of Alexandria to stay informed about the latest developments in philosophy and science.

**Flaws:** Linus's tendency to overthink can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from those around him. His love of solitude has earned him the nickname "The Emperor of the Mind" among his courtiers, who worry that he is too removed from their concerns and troubles.

**Strengths:** Despite his introspective nature, Linus possesses exceptional leadership skills, earning the respect and admiration of his people. He is fiercely loyal to those he trusts, such as his brother Marcus, and will go to great lengths to protect them and the empire he has sworn to defend.
