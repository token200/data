**Personality:** Lino, as known to his friends, is a quiet and introspective genius. He has an IQ that rivals Einstein's and spends most of his time alone, lost in code. Despite his fame within the tech community, he prefers to keep a low profile and has a tendency to be melancholy, experiencing sudden bursts of creativity or mood swings. However, with the unexpected visit from his sister Kasia, he shows a glimmer of vulnerability, suggesting that there may be more to his personality than initially meets the eye.

**Physical Attributes:** Lino is not described in great detail, but based on the story, we can infer some physical characteristics:

* Height: Not specified, but given his introverted nature and focus on coding, it's likely he is slender and tall, possibly around 6 feet (1.8 meters) or taller.
* Eye Color: The story does not specify Lino's eye color, but based on the description of Kasia's presence, it's possible that his eyes are dark, perhaps brown or black.

**Interests:** As a tech genius, Lino is deeply interested in:

* Coding and software development, particularly AI algorithms and robotics.
* Working on top-secret projects, such as codenamed "Erebus".
* Exploring the possibilities of creating an AI capable of learning and adapting like a human mind.
* Pushing the boundaries of what is possible with technology.

Additionally, Lino's interests may include:

* Reading and understanding complex scientific theories, possibly to gain insight into his work.
* Tinkering with electronics and machinery in his workshop above his apartment.
* Engaging in philosophical discussions about the implications of his work on society.

Overall, Lino's personality is shaped by his intense focus on his work and his desire for solitude. However, with Kasia's visit, he begins to open up and experience a newfound sense of purpose and connection.
