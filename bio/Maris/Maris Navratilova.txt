Based on the inspiration from Martina Navratilova's character, I've created a fictional character profile for Maris Navratilova:

**Physical Attributes:**
Maris Navratilova is a 5'8" (173 cm) tall woman with striking blue eyes and long, curly brown hair. She has a fit and toned physique, honed from years of playing tennis.

**Personality:** Maris is a kind-hearted and patient individual who exudes warmth and empathy. She is an excellent communicator and mentor, able to break down complex tennis techniques into simple, easy-to-understand concepts for her students. Maris is also fiercely competitive, but she approaches competition with a calm and focused mindset.

**Interests:** Outside of tennis, Maris enjoys hiking, reading literature, and practicing yoga. She is an avid traveler and has a passion for learning new languages, which she often incorporates into her coaching sessions to make them more engaging and interactive.

**Additional Traits:** Maris is a natural teacher with a talent for spotting potential in young players. She is patient, understanding, and willing to go the extra mile to help her students improve their skills. Despite her many successes on the court, Maris remains humble and grounded, always looking for ways to give back to the tennis community.

**Background:** Born and raised in Eastern Europe, Maris has a deep love for the sport of tennis and a strong connection to her heritage. She began playing at a young age and went on to become one of the top-ranked junior players in the region. After years of competing professionally, Maris retired from competitive play to focus on coaching and mentoring the next generation of tennis stars.

This fictional character profile captures the essence of Martina Navratilova's inspiring personality, athleticism, and commitment to sharing her knowledge with others, while also introducing new traits and interests that make Maris a unique individual in her own right.
