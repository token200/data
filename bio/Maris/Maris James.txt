Despite this, she perseveres and remains determined to pursue her dreams.

* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn in a messy bob
* Body Type: Slender and athletic, with a collection of tattoos on her arms that reflect her love for art.
* Skin Tone: Porcelain-like complexion with a smattering of freckles across her cheeks.

**Interests:** Maris is deeply passionate about art, music, and literature. She finds inspiration in the works of Frida Kahlo, Jackson Pollock, and Sylvia Plath, among others. In her free time, she enjoys experimenting with different mediums and techniques, practicing yoga to clear her mind, and listening to indie folk music.

Maris is also an avid reader, devouring books on art history, philosophy, and psychology. She finds solace in the written word, often using writing as a way to express herself when words fail to convey the emotions she feels through her art.

Despite her artistic ambitions, Maris has a dry sense of humor and can come across as sarcastic or introverted at times, which can sometimes make it difficult for others to get close to her. However, once you gain her trust, she opens up and reveals a warm, vulnerable side that is both captivating and endearing.
