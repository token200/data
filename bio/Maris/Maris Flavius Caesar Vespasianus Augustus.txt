**Personality:** Maris Flavius Caesar Vespasianus Augustus is a shrewd and calculating leader. He exudes confidence and authority, commanding attention from those around him. Despite his imposing presence, he is also depicted as being introspective and calculating, often listening intently to reports and weighing the information carefully before making decisions. His resolve is unshakeable, and he has shown himself to be ruthless when necessary. However, there are hints of vulnerability, particularly in moments where the weight of responsibility threatens to crush him.

His exact height is not specified, but it is likely that he stands at least 6 feet (183 cm) tall.

Outside of official duties, I would imagine that Maris Flavius Caesar Vespasianus Augustus enjoys solitude, meditation, or other forms of introspection, allowing him to reflect on his decisions and the weight of responsibility. He may also have a fondness for luxury, as indicated by his ability to command attention from his guards and advisors.
