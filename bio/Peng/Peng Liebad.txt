Based on the inspiration from the short story about Peng Li Badong, I've created a fictional character profile for the legendary warrior:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing emerald green, rumored to be able to see right through deception
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn in a long, braided ponytail
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, high cheekbones, and sharp nose
* Build: Athletic and toned, with a wiry yet powerful physique

**Personality:**

* Peng Li Badong is an enigmatic and confident individual who exudes an aura of quiet authority.
* She possesses a strong sense of justice and will not hesitate to stand up for what she believes in, even if it means challenging the status quo.
* Despite her impressive warrior credentials, she remains humble and grounded, always seeking to learn and improve.
* Her piercing gaze can be unnerving, as if she is constantly assessing the intentions and character of those around her.

**Interests:**

* Martial arts and combat techniques
* Strategic warfare and military tactics
* Ancient history and mythology
* Philosophy and ethics
* Music ( particularly traditional Chinese instruments)
* Poetry and calligraphy

Peng Li Badong's interests reflect her well-rounded personality, with a strong focus on self-improvement, discipline, and strategic thinking. Her passion for martial arts and combat is matched only by her love of learning and intellectual pursuits, setting her apart from other legendary warriors in history.

As a result of her humble beginnings, Peng Li Badong remains deeply connected to the land and her community, always seeking to protect and serve those who are less fortunate than herself. Her legend continues to inspire generations, as she remains an embodiment of courage, honor, and strength in the face of adversity.
