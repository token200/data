Based on the short story, here is a summary of Peng Toffoli's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Personality: Peng Toffoli is portrayed as a cunning, agile, and experienced master thief. He appears to be a strategic thinker, always planning several steps ahead. However, his encounter with Alessandro Bianchi suggests that he may also be willing to yield and adapt in the heat of the moment. This flexibility and willingness to learn might indicate that Peng Toffoli is more than just a one-dimensional character.

Physical Attributes:
- Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing blue, hinting at his Eastern European or Asian heritage
- Build: Lean and athletic, likely developed from years of climbing, running, and fighting

Interests:
Peng Toffoli is deeply invested in the world of thievery. His expertise lies in scaling walls, navigating rooftops, and evading detection. The pursuit of valuable treasures, particularly ancient artifacts, drives his actions. When not planning heists or dueling rivals, Peng Toffoli likely spends time:

- Researching new strategies and techniques for improvement
- Visiting local markets to gather information on potential targets
- Training with fellow thieves in the art of deception and misdirection
- Exploring hidden passageways and rooftops within Rome's ancient architecture

Given his occupation, it is unlikely that Peng Toffoli has time for hobbies outside of his work. Nevertheless, his willingness to question his approach after the rooftop duel suggests that he might have a more complex inner life than initially meets the eye.

Additional details:
Peng Toffoli wears a silver cuff on his left wrist bearing an intricate pattern reminiscent of ancient Roman symbols. His outfit consists of dark leather gloves, worn jeans, and sturdy boots suitable for scaling. A faded tattoo of a snake coiled around his right bicep hints at a mysterious past that Peng Toffoli keeps hidden from the public eye.

Keep in mind that these details are inferred based on the short story and may not be explicitly stated in the original narrative.
