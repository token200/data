Based on the story about Peng Herbert, I can create a summary of a fictional character named Peng Hébert. Here's what I came up with:

**Name:** Peng Hébert
**Age:** Late 20s/Early 30s
**Physical Attributes:**
Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
Eye Color: Bright blue, almost turquoise
Hair Color: Dark brown, often messy and unkempt
Body Type: Slim but athletic, with a wiry build that suggests a lot of energy and activity.

**Personality:** Peng Hébert is an eccentric and brilliant inventor who sees the world as a puzzle waiting to be solved. He's fiercely independent and has a mischievous sense of humor, often taking risks in his work that put him at odds with authority figures. Despite this, he has a strong sense of justice and will go to great lengths to create solutions that benefit society.

**Interests:**
- Inventing gadgets and machinery
- Reading scientific texts and attending lectures on advanced technology
- Exploring abandoned places and disused infrastructure for inspiration
- Playing the piano, particularly classical music that stimulates his creative thinking

It's worth noting that while Peng Hébert shares some similarities with the character in the story, he is not a direct copy. I have tried to create a distinct and unique personality based on Peng Herbert from the short story.
