Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Peng Kuznetsova's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn in a ponytail or braided style

**Personality:**

Peng Kuznetsova is known for her fierce competitiveness and tough love attitude on and off the court. She has a straightforward and honest approach, which can sometimes be misinterpreted as being harsh or intimidating to others. However, those who know her understand that this facade hides a complex and introspective person. Kuznetsova is fiercely dedicated to her craft and is not afraid to push herself to the limit. Despite facing numerous setbacks throughout her career, she remains steadfast in her pursuit of excellence.

**Interests:**

* Tennis (obviously!)
* Outdoor activities such as hiking and skiing, reflecting her Siberian heritage
* Reading and self-reflection, often using these activities to process her emotions and stay focused on her goals

It's worth noting that I made some educated guesses about Kuznetsova's interests based on the story. While it's not explicitly stated in the text, a person from Siberia who loves outdoor activities might enjoy reading about nature and self-improvement books.

As for height, while the story doesn't mention her exact height, 5'9" seems like a plausible figure considering the average Russian woman's height is around 5'7".
