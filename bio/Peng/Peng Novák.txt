I'd be happy to create a character profile for Peng Novák. Here's a summary:

**Personality:** Peng Novák is a charismatic and confident individual with a quick wit and sharp tongue. He has a natural ability to think on his feet, which often helps him navigate complex situations with ease. Despite his polished exterior, he has a soft spot for those in need and is fiercely loyal to those he considers friends.

**Physical Attributes:** Peng Novák stands at 5'10" (178 cm) tall, with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is a dark brown color that's often styled in a sleek, modern fashion. His eyes are a striking shade of blue-green, almost like the ocean on a tropical island. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident and sports a small tattoo of a snake coiled around his right bicep.

**Interests:** Peng Novák is an avid collector of rare artifacts and antiquities, which he believes hold the secrets to understanding human history. In his free time, he enjoys practicing martial arts (specifically, Wing Chun) and reading classic literature by authors such as Ernest Hemingway and Fyodor Dostoevsky.

**Additional Details:** Peng Novák's family hails from a small village in rural Hungary, where he was raised by his widowed mother, who taught him the importance of tradition and community. He has an older sister named Szofi, who works as a journalist in Budapest. Despite his high-powered career, Peng remains humble and grounded, crediting his upbringing for instilling in him a strong work ethic and sense of purpose.

I hope this character profile meets your requirements! Let me know if you'd like to add or modify any details.
