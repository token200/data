Based on the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Maria Oja:

**Personality:** Maria Oja is an enigmatic and reclusive figure with a mysterious nature. She is reserved and introverted, preferring the company of animals and the forest to that of humans. Despite her isolation, she has a soothing presence and can convey wisdom through her low, gentle voice. Her calm demeanor belies a deep understanding of the world's hidden patterns and rhythms.

**Physical Attributes:** Maria Oja appears to be an adult in her mid-to-late twenties or thirties, although her exact age is not specified. She has striking features that few have had the privilege of seeing, including piercing eyes ( likely a dark shade such as indigo or sapphire) and possibly jet-black hair. Her height is unknown, but it's possible she stands around 5'8" to 6'0" tall, allowing her to move freely in the forest without drawing attention.

**Interests:** Maria Oja's primary interest lies in communicating with animals and sensing changes in the weather. She has a deep connection to nature and understands its rhythms and patterns. Her focus on these gifts stems from an early age when she demonstrated exceptional abilities as a child, encouraged by her parents. In addition to her natural affinity for the outdoors, Maria Oja is deeply interested in the mystical forces that govern Ravenswood Forest.

It's also apparent that Maria Oja has an interest in rituals and ancient practices, as hinted at by the flock of starlings descending upon her cottage and performing an unknown ritual. This fascination with the mysterious and the arcane suggests a personality inclined towards mysticism and an understanding of the unseen forces shaping the world around her.
