Here is a summary of the fictional character Jakob Piotrowska:

**Physical Attributes:** Jakob stands at 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His dark hair is often unkempt, with hints of wave and texture that seem to move of their own accord when the wind blows through it. His piercing green eyes are fringed with thick eyelashes, giving them a mysterious, almost hypnotic quality. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during a childhood accident.

**Personality:** Jakob is a man of few words, but those who know him understand that his silences are laced with a depth of emotion that can be both unnerving and captivating. He is intensely introspective and private, often losing himself in thought and memory. Despite this, he has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic when the mood takes him. Jakob is fiercely loyal to those he cares about, but this loyalty comes at a price â€“ he has a tendency to push people away, fearing that his emotions will overwhelm them.

**Interests:** As a photographer, Jakob is deeply interested in capturing the beauty and essence of the world around him. He has a particular affinity for urban landscapes and the stories they tell about their cities' histories and cultures. Outside of photography, Jakob enjoys exploring old buildings and abandoned spaces, searching for hidden corners and secret narratives to uncover.

In terms of his personal interests, Jakob is drawn to the history and mythology of Warsaw's Old Town, which seems to hold a special significance for him on some level. He also has a fascination with the lives of those who lived during the Soviet era in Poland, often finding himself lost in stories of resistance, resilience, and survival.

When it comes to his family's past, Jakob is intensely curious and seeks to understand the complexities and nuances of their experiences. Through his photography, he hopes to not only capture memories but also confront and come to terms with his own emotional baggage.
