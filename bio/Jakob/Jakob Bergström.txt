Here is a summary of Jakob Bergström's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Jakob Bergström stands at 6'2" (188 cm) with an athletic yet lean build, typical of his years as a detective. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he interrogates, making them feel uneasy in his presence. His dark brown hair is always neatly trimmed, and he often sports a well-groomed beard.

**Personality:** Jakob Bergström is a man of introspection and quiet confidence. He has an air of mystery surrounding him, which only adds to the respect people have for him as a detective. Despite his tough exterior, there's a hint of vulnerability in his eyes that suggests he may be hiding secrets of his own. As he navigates the complex web of corruption and deceit, Jakob proves himself to be fiercely determined and relentless in his pursuit of justice.

**Interests:** Outside of his work as a detective, Jakob is an avid reader of history and philosophy, often finding inspiration for his cases in the works of great thinkers like Aristotle and Nietzsche. He's also a passionate lover of classical music, particularly Chopin's nocturnes, which he finds soothing after a long day of solving crimes.

**Additional Details:** Jakob hails from a modest background, with parents who were both high school teachers. This upbringing instilled in him a strong sense of justice and a desire to serve the greater good. He's been married twice, first to a fellow detective who passed away on duty, and then to a journalist who couldn't handle the stress of his line of work. The two had a son together, but their marriage ended in divorce after he left the police force to start his own private investigation firm.

**Quirks:** Jakob has a habit of tapping his pen on the edge of his notebook when deep in thought, often creating patterns with the small pieces of paper scraps he jots down. He's also been known to wear the same silver watch his father gave him as a child, a reminder of where he came from and what drove him to become the detective he is today.
