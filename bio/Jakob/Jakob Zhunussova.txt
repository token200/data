She possesses a calm and centered demeanor, which allows her to navigate even the most turbulent of situations. Jakob's determination and resilience are matched only by her compassion and willingness to listen.

She spends countless hours studying the ancient rituals and incantations passed down through her grandmother's lineage, seeking to deepen her connection to the earth and its creatures.

In addition to these interests, Jakob has a fascination with mythology, folklore, and the symbolism of natural phenomena. She often finds inspiration in the stories and legends of her people, which she weaves into her own meditations and contemplations. Her connection to the land and its inhabitants drives her to listen and learn from the whispers of the trees, and to honor the delicate balance between human and natural worlds.
