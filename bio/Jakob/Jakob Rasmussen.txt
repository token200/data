Here's a summary of Jakob Rasmussen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jakob is a quiet and introspective person who guards his emotions closely. Despite this, when he does speak, people listen due to his commanding presence and wisdom gained from his years as a detective. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or standoffish at first, but once you get to know him, he reveals a kind and compassionate heart.

**Physical Attributes:** Jakob is 6'2" tall with an athletic build, honed from years of fishing and manual labor. His eyes are a deep shade of blue, almost grey, which seem to hold a perpetual warmth despite his reserved nature. His hair is dark brown and unkempt, often falling across his forehead in a way that adds to his rugged charm. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, souvenirs from past encounters.

**Interests:** Jakob's interests are centered around the natural world and solitude. He finds solace in fishing, which allows him to connect with nature and clear his mind. He is also an avid gardener, finding joy in nurturing plants and watching them grow. His love for the ocean is not just superficial; he has a deep appreciation for its power and mystery, which he believes can be calming and inspiring.

In his quieter moments, Jakob enjoys reading books on history and philosophy, particularly works that explore human nature and morality. He also has a fondness for old movies and classical music, which evoke a sense of nostalgia and comfort in his life.
