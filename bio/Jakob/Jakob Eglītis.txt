**Physical Attributes:**

- Age: Mid-30s
- Height: Approximately 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing green

**Personality:**
Jakob seems to be a resilient and determined individual. After facing the loss of his loved one, Sofia, in a tragic accident, he chose not to let her injury define their relationship. Instead, he found solace in being there for her, caring for her, and supporting her through her rehabilitation. This suggests that Jakob has a strong sense of responsibility, empathy, and loyalty.

He also appears to have an adventurous side, given his extensive sailing experience and the fact that he set sail once more after his initial loss. However, it seems that his primary focus is now on building a life with Sofia, rather than pursuing grand adventures alone.

**Interests:**

- Sailing and navigation (he learned from his grandfather)
- The sea and the ocean's rhythms
- Storytelling and sharing experiences with others (he listens to his grandfather's tales of adventure as a child)
- Music or other art forms are not explicitly mentioned, but the love for Sofia might imply an interest in creating meaningful connections with those around him.

Jakob seems to have a deep appreciation for nature, specifically the ocean, which plays a central role in both his personal life and his sense of purpose.
