Here's a summary of Jakob González Fernández's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Jakob is a curious and adventurous individual with a strong sense of wonder. He has been drawn to the sea since his childhood days listening to his father's tales of mermaids, sea monsters, and hidden treasures. At 30 years old, he is still restless, feeling that there is something more out there waiting for him. Jakob appears to be open-minded and receptive to new ideas, as evidenced by his willingness to consider the existence of sea goddesses.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Jakob stands at around 6'1" (185 cm), which would have been considered above-average height in Spain.
* Eye Color: His eye color is not explicitly mentioned, but based on his connection to the Spanish culture and the description of María's piercing green eyes, it is likely that Jakob has darker, more expressive eyes, possibly brown or hazel.
* Hair: Jakob has dark hair, which was whipped into a frenzy by the salty wind as he stood at the edge of the cliff.

**Interests:** Jakob is passionate about the sea and fishing. He respects his father's legacy as a fisherman and enjoys piloting his own boat, the "María", through the waters off Málaga's coast. His interest in the stories of his childhood, particularly those surrounding mermaids and sea monsters, suggests that he has a fascination with mythology and the ocean's mysteries.

It can be inferred that Jakob is also drawn to mystery, wonder, and the unknown, as evidenced by his initial hesitation when discussing the existence of sea goddesses. This curiosity would drive him to explore new ideas and experiences, potentially leading him on a journey of self-discovery and adventure with María.
