Based on the inspiration from the short story, here is a summary of Jakob Esther's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Jakob Esther is a creative and introspective individual with a deep sense of passion and curiosity. He has a quiet desperation that stems from feeling suffocated by his mundane office job, but this has led him to discover a newfound sense of purpose within himself. He is driven by an insatiable desire to explore the world around him, to learn, and to express himself through art.

**Physical Attributes:** Jakob Esther is a man in his mid-40s with a slender build. His height is approximately 5'10" (178 cm), which adds to his introspective demeanor. His eyes are a deep shade of blue that seems to hold a world of emotions within them, and they sparkle with creative energy when he's lost in thought.

**Interests:** Jakob Esther has always been drawn to the arts, particularly music and painting. He is an accomplished pianist who finds solace in playing his old instrument, which allows him to tap into his emotions and express himself in a way that words alone cannot. His love for art is equally strong, and he spends long nights sketching under the stars, feeling the world come alive through his brushstrokes.

In addition to these interests, Jakob has a deep appreciation for literature, particularly classic works of fiction and poetry. He finds inspiration in the works of great authors and often spends hours reading and reflecting on the human experience. Overall, Jakob's interests are deeply rooted in creativity, self-discovery, and exploration of the world around him.

It's worth noting that these attributes have evolved since Jakob began to rediscover his creative life. He has shed the skin of his former self, who was held back by the monotony of his office job. As he continues on this journey of self-discovery and artistic expression, it is likely that his personality, physical attributes, and interests will continue to grow and evolve in meaningful ways.
