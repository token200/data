Here's a summary of Alessio Kovacs' personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the given short story:

**Personality:** Alessio Kovacs is a driven and ambitious individual who has spent years working on top-secret projects. He seems to be accustomed to being in the spotlight, but after years of flying under the radar, he's grown comfortable with keeping a low profile. Despite this, his instincts are always on high alert, suggesting that he's fiercely protective of himself and his work. He also appears to be highly motivated and determined, as evidenced by his reaction to Dr. Covas' visit.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the original text doesn't provide much information about Alessio Kovacs' physical attributes beyond his height and eye color. However, based on the fact that he's described as "petite" (in comparison to a tall woman like Dr. Covas), it's likely that he's of average or below-average height for a male scientist in this field.

**Height:** Let's assume Alessio Kovacs is around 5'6" to 5'8" (168-173 cm) tall, which is relatively average for an adult man.

**Eye Color:** Unfortunately, the text doesn't mention his eye color explicitly. However, considering his European appearance and the fact that Dr. Covas has piercing green eyes, it's possible that Alessio Kovacs has darker or more muted eye colors like brown, blue-gray, or hazel.

**Interests:** As a renowned physicist, Alessio Kovacs is likely deeply interested in various aspects of physics, particularly quantum entanglement and its applications. His work on top-secret projects suggests that he's also fascinated by the intersection of science and secrecy.
