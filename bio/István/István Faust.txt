Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character István Faust:

**Personality:** István Faust appears to be a complex and enigmatic individual with a passion for mathematics and the occult. He is described as being shrouded in mystery, with an air of quiet curiosity that draws others in. Despite controversy surrounding his work and supposed supernatural connections, Faust remains a recluse, refusing to discuss his methods or admit to any dealings with dark forces. However, when he does interact with others, such as László, he exhibits a spark of divine energy and an infectious enthusiasm for mathematical certainties.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Approximately 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: An unsettling shade of indigo or purple, which seems almost otherworldly
* Age: Late middle age to early retirement age, exact years unknown
* Build: Slender and agile, with a hint of wiry energy
* Facial Features: A gaunt face with high cheekbones, piercing eyes that seem to bore into those he looks at

**Interests:** István Faust's primary interest lies in mathematics, particularly topology and fractals. He is also fascinated by the occult and ancient artifacts, which he believes hold secrets of their own. When interacting with others, especially László, Faust reveals a hidden side that combines mathematical certainties with an air of mysticism and spiritual curiosity.

In addition to these interests, it can be inferred that Faust's life work is driven by an insatiable pursuit of knowledge, one that borders on obsession. His fixation on the "equation of nothingness" suggests that he seeks to understand the underlying principles of existence itself, using mathematical and supernatural means as tools to achieve this goal.

Throughout his interactions with László, Faust's fascination with hidden truths and secret histories becomes apparent, hinting at a deeper purpose or mission that drives his work. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that István Faust is more than just a reclusive mathematician – he is a guardian of secrets, a keeper of the hidden truths that lie beyond the veil of reality.
