**Personality:** István is portrayed as an introverted individual with a melancholic nature. He seems to be perpetually lost in thought, weighed down by the weight of his own experiences. Despite his talent, he struggles to connect with others, which has led to strained relationships. His personality appears to be complex, with a deep sense of sorrow and longing that is tempered by an intense passion for music.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: István's height is not explicitly mentioned in the story, but given his age is unknown and he seems older than average, it can be inferred that he is likely around 5'9" to 6'1" (175-185 cm).
* Eye Color: His eye color is not specified in the story, but based on his Hungarian heritage, it is possible that he has blue or brown eyes.

**Interests:** István's interests are deeply rooted in classical music, particularly folk music from his native Hungary. He is drawn to the works of Bartók and Shostakovich, which suggests a strong appreciation for complex, emotive compositions. As a composer himself, he is likely passionate about exploring new sounds and emotions through his music.

**Additional Traits:** Despite his artistic talents, István seems to be haunted by an inner turmoil that makes it difficult for him to connect with others on a deep level. His later years are marked by a sense of disconnection, as if he has observed life from the outside rather than participating in it fully. This sense of detachment is reflected in his cryptic note about the "silence" being what truly allows us to see – suggesting that István may have found solace in the quietest, most introspective moments of his existence.
