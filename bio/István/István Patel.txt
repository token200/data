**Personality:** Istv치n is a brilliant and reclusive scientist who has always been focused on his work.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep brown
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often neatly trimmed and neatly styled
* Build: Slim and slender, due to years of spending most of his time in front of a computer or laboratory equipment.
* Age: Late 30s to early 40s

**Interests:** Istv치n's primary interest is neuroscience, specifically the neural mechanisms of memory and learning. He is also fascinated by quantum physics and existentialism, as evident from his conversations with Sophia. His interests extend beyond science, including:

* Reading and philosophy
* Music (he may enjoy classical music or jazz)
* Traveling (although not much, given his reclusive nature)
* Writing (he may write papers, articles, or even short stories in his spare time)

It's worth noting that Istv치n's personality and interests have undergone some development after his encounter with Sophia, as he begins to open up and share his knowledge with others.
