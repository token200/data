His dark brown hair is often messy and unkempt, framing a sharp, chiseled face that speaks of determination and cunning.

**Personality:** Giacomo is an enigmatic figure, shrouded in mystery and intrigue, as the story suggests. He exudes confidence and charisma, which serves him well in his line of work as a master thief. Despite his reputation for being untouchable, there's a hint of vulnerability beneath his tough exterior. He's driven by a desire for power and wealth, but also seems to be motivated by a sense of curiosity and adventure.

**Interests:** Giacomo is drawn to the art of thievery and the thrill of outsmarting his pursuers. He has a deep fascination with the supernatural and the occult, which led him to seek out the mysterious wooden box and its rumored powers. He's also intrigued by the world of mythology and folklore, often incorporating elements of these stories into his heists.

Giacomo is an avid collector of rare and unusual artifacts, which he uses as tools in his craft or sell for profit.

When not on the job, Giacomo enjoys indulging in fine wine and cuisine, often at exclusive underground gatherings where he rubs shoulders with other outcasts and misfits.
