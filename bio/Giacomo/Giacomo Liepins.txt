Here's a summary of Giacomo Liepins' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Giacomo is a complex and intriguing individual with a mysterious aura surrounding him. As "Il Fantasma" (The Ghost), he has built a reputation as a skilled thief and con artist, but beneath this fa√ßade lies a troubled past and a deep-seated desire for human connection. Despite his tough exterior, Giacomo is vulnerable and emotionally scarred, having been haunted by the consequences of his actions for years.

As he falls for Sofia, however, Giacomo reveals a softer side, sharing his stories and emotions with someone who listens without judgment. He is drawn to her warmth and kindness, which challenges his preconceived notions about love and relationships.

**Physical Attributes:** Giacomo stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with an athletic build, honed from years of navigating the city's rooftops and alleys as a thief. His dark hair is always neatly styled, framing his sharp features and piercing brown eyes that seem to hold a deep intensity.

However, it's Sofia who captures his attention with her striking green eyes, which appear almost otherworldly in their brightness and depth. Her long, curly brown hair frames her heart-shaped face, giving her an ethereal beauty that Giacomo can't help but be drawn to.

**Interests:** As a master thief and con artist, Giacomo has always been fascinated by the art of deception and manipulation. He is skilled at navigating complex social situations, using his wit and charm to get what he wants.

Outside of his thieving escapades, Giacomo enjoys exploring the city's hidden corners, studying its history and architecture with a keen eye for detail. He is particularly fond of reading ancient texts on alchemy and mysticism, seeking answers to the existential questions that plague him.

However, as his relationship with Sofia deepens, Giacomo begins to explore more mundane interests, such as cooking and music, which reveal a more vulnerable side to his personality.
