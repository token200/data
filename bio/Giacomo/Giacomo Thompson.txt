Here is a summary of Giacomo Thompson's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Giacomo appears to be an introverted and reserved individual who prefers quiet company. However, when surrounded by friends and like-minded individuals, he becomes more lively and engaged. He seems to have a dry sense of humor and can be somewhat sarcastic, as evident in his response to Alessandro's announcement about the lost edition of Dante's "Divine Comedy". Despite his reserved nature, Giacomo has a deep passion for rare books and forgotten knowledge, which drives him to connect with others who share similar interests.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown with hints of golden brown around the iris
* Hair: Unkempt, dark brown hair that often falls across his forehead in a way that makes him appear even more introverted
* Facial Features: High cheekbones, prominent nose, and full lips that give him a gentle, introspective appearance

**Interests:** Giacomo's primary interest is rare book collecting and the preservation of forgotten knowledge. He spends most of his days surrounded by dusty tomes and vintage manuscripts, which fuels his passion for discovery and sharing his knowledge with others. Outside of work, he enjoys reading literary classics, attending historical reenactments, and exploring local art scenes.

It's worth noting that Emilia's presence in Giacomo's life seems to awaken new interests and possibilities within him, including a deeper appreciation for art, history, and literature.
