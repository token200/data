His eyes are a bright blue, reminiscent of the Mediterranean Sea on a clear day. His dark brown hair is often tousled, framing his weathered face and piercing blue eyes. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, a souvenir from a childhood accident.

**Personality:** Giacomo is an adventurous and free-spirited individual, with a passion for the sea that borders on obsession. He's fiercely independent, having learned to rely only on himself since his early sailing days. Despite this, he has a warm heart and a quick wit, making him an instant friend to those he meets. Giacomo exudes confidence and authority when navigating the seas, yet he remains humble and open to new experiences.

**Interests:** As you might expect, Giacomo's love for the sea is his primary interest. He spends most of his time sailing, charting new courses, and exploring hidden coves and bays. However, he also has a deep appreciation for history, culture, and storytelling. On his travels, Giacomo collects tales from fellow sailors and passengers, often sharing them with others over a glass of wine or two.

**Additional Traits:** Despite his many adventures, Giacomo remains grounded and practical. He's an expert at reading weather patterns and tides, able to predict changes in the sea with uncanny accuracy. When on shore, he enjoys exploring local markets, trying new cuisine, and learning about the history of the places he visits.

**Quirks:** Giacomo has a fondness for worn leather journals, where he records his sailing logs, notes on navigation, and sketchy memories of past adventures. He's also known to hum or whistle sea shanties when at anchor, his voice carrying across the water as he basks in the freedom of being out on the open sea.
