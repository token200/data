Here is a summary of Paolo Jhih-hao's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Paolo is a complex individual who struggles with the weight of his family's expectations. Despite being the son of a powerful crime lord, he longs for freedom and autonomy, which drives him to join the Nightstalkers. He is determined, resourceful, and skilled, but also sensitive and vulnerable, often feeling suffocated by the constraints of his family's business.

**Physical Attributes:** Paolo is approximately 5'10" (178 cm) tall with a lean and athletic build. His eye color is an striking shade of indigo, which seems almost otherworldly in its intensity. His hair is dark brown and shoulder-length, often styled in a messy, effortless manner. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident.

**Interests:** Paolo's interests are varied but largely driven by his desire for independence and self-discovery. He enjoys:

* Exploring the city and discovering hidden passageways and secret spots
* Learning new skills and techniques, particularly those related to lock-picking and deception
* Reading ancient texts and studying history, which fuels his fascination with the Nightstalkers' target - the silver vase adorned with ancient runes
* Traveling and experiencing different cultures, often through clandestine means

Paolo is also deeply invested in his work as a member of the Nightstalkers, using his skills to bring down targets that his family would otherwise control.
