He is driven by a fierce passion for art, but also has a dark side due to his past as an Italian spy turned art forger.

Outside of art, Paolo enjoys long walks in the city, sipping espresso at local cafes, and indulging in good books and philosophy. He has a weakness for fine wines and expensive cigars, which he uses as a way to relax and unwind after a long day of work.

Despite his love of luxury and excess, Paolo is not without a sense of morality or ethics.
