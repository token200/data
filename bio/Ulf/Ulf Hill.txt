Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Ulf Hill's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ulf Hill is a charismatic master thief and con artist with a quick wit and silver tongue. He has built a reputation for himself in the dark alleys of Oslo, known for his cunning and ability to talk his way out of (or into) any situation. Despite this, he is cautious and doesn't trust people too quickly, particularly after meeting Sofia.

**Physical Attributes:** Ulf Hill stands at an average height of 6'1" with a lean build, likely honed from years of navigating the city's underworld. His eye color is a bright blue, complementing his striking features. Unfortunately, there are no further details provided about his facial hair, skin tone, or other physical attributes.

**Interests:** As a master thief and con artist, Ulf Hill has an affinity for stealing valuable artifacts, rare goods, and other high-stakes treasures. He is likely fascinated by the thrill of the heist and the rush that comes with outsmarting his marks. Additionally, he seems to have a taste for fine whiskey, as seen in Sofia's "whiskey sour" at the seedy bar.

It's worth noting that some details about Ulf Hill's physical attributes are missing from the original story, so I've left those sections intentionally vague to reflect that.
