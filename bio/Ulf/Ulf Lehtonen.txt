Here is a summary of the fictional character Ulf Lehtonen:

Physical Attributes:
Ulf Lehtonen is a tall and imposing figure, standing at 6'2" with a ruggedly built physique that hints at his former life as a special agent. His hair is dark brown, often flecked with snow from the harsh Finnish winters. His eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seem to bore into those he meets, giving off an air of intensity and focus. A small scar above his left eyebrow and a dimple on his chin add to his rugged charm.

Personality:
Ulf is a driven and analytical individual with a no-nonsense attitude. As a former special agent for SUPO, he developed a strong sense of discipline and duty, which served him well in the field. However, after leaving SUPO, he has become more relaxed and less confrontational, allowing himself to balance his work and personal life better. Despite this, Ulf still exudes an air of authority and confidence that commands respect from those around him.

Interests:
Ulf's interests are largely centered around his work in security consulting and solving puzzles. He is fiercely intelligent and has a passion for codes, cryptography, and ancient languages. In his free time, he enjoys reading about history, particularly Finnish history, and listening to classical music by Finnish composers such as Sibelius and Reinhold. Ulf is also an avid outdoorsman who loves hiking in the Finnish wilderness and enjoying a hearty bowl of karjalanpiirakka (Karelian pasties) on cold winter nights.

As a former special agent, Ulf has a strong sense of justice and a desire to uncover the truth, which drives him to take on cases that challenge his skills. He is fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will stop at nothing to protect them. Despite this, Ulf's sharp mind and analytical nature make him a valuable asset in solving complex puzzles and unraveling mysteries.
