**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'5"
* Eye Color: Blue (deep, piercing blue that seems almost icy in intensity)

**Interests:** Ulf is deeply interested in exploring the natural world, particularly the surrounding forests of Oakwood. He is drawn to the unknown and the uncharted, often finding himself on quests to uncover hidden secrets or retrieve legendary artifacts like the Golden Axe.

In addition to his love for exploration and adventure, Ulf also has a strong sense of justice and will go to great lengths to protect those he cares about most.
