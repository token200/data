**Personality:** Ulf Lewandowska is a complex individual with a mysterious past. He has a calm and gentle demeanor, often accompanied by a warm smile that puts those around him at ease. However, beneath this fa√ßade lies a deep-seated intensity and a history of violence, which he carefully conceals from the world. Despite his tough exterior, Ulf is fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will go to great lengths to protect them.

**Physical Attributes:** Uulf stands at around 6 feet (183 cm) tall with an athletic build, honed from years of street fighting and physical labor. His eyes are a piercing blue, which seem to bore into those he meets, making him appear both intimidating and trustworthy at the same time. His dark hair is flecked with grey, hinting at his age and life experiences.

**Interests:** In addition to baking, Ulf has a deep appreciation for traditional Polish cuisine, music, and storytelling. He enjoys listening to folk melodies on his old record player and sharing tales of his homeland's rich history with customers at the bakery. As he became more confident in his new identity, Ulf began experimenting with novel recipes that blended classic flavors with modern twists. His passion for baking became an integral part of his daily life, providing solace and a sense of purpose in his post-"Red Hand" existence.

While Ulf's bakery is the main focus of his life in Lelichev, he also has a secret fascination with surveillance and security systems, skills honed from his former life as an enforcer. This interest remains unknown to the public, but those who know him well are aware that Ulf is always on high alert, watching and listening for any signs of trouble.
