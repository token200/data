**Physical Attributes:** Ulf stands at 6'2" (188 cm) tall, with a broad-shouldered build that speaks to his years of hunting in the unforgiving Arctic landscape. His hair is dark brown and flecked with threads of silver, hinting at his age and experience. His eyes are a piercing blue, almost indigo, with an intensity that misses nothing. A scattering of scars on his cheeks and forehead attest to his many adventures and close calls.

He has an encyclopedic knowledge of the land, its habits, and its creatures. In his quieter moments, Ulf enjoys sharing tales of his adventures with fellow villagers, weaving intricate stories that capture the essence of the wilderness. He is also a skilled weaver of traditional Nordic patterns on his loom, using the same skill that once helped him track his prey.
