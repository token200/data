**Interests:** Edith's interests are diverse and varied. As mentioned in the story, she is drawn to animals, particularly strays and underdogs (both human and animal). She also has a passion for listening to stories about life experiences and learning from others. Edith enjoys spending time outdoors, exploring her neighborhood, and observing the world around her.

However, there are some additional interests that can be inferred based on the story:

* Music: Although not explicitly mentioned in the passage, it's likely that Edith has a fondness for music, as she is described as having sparkling eyes when listening to stories.

It's worth noting that the passage does not provide a comprehensive picture of Edith's interests beyond what can be inferred.
