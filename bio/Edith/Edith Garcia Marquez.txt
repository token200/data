**Personality:**
Edith is an enigmatic figure with a mysterious past. She possesses a quiet confidence that commands attention, but her true nature remains hidden beneath the surface. Her instincts tell her she's being watched, and she has a sense of self-preservation. Despite this, there's a sense of vulnerability and introspection in Edith, particularly when it comes to sharing her secrets.

**Interests:**
Edith enjoys writing as an outlet for her emotions and a way to express herself. She also seems to have a passion for botany, which she uses to connect with the natural world and perhaps find solace from her past. The fact that she keeps a leather journal suggests she values introspection and is willing to confront her inner demons.

It's worth noting that Edith has reinvented herself as "Emily Wilson," a simple schoolteacher, suggesting that she has a more reserved personality when interacting with others in this new life. However, the spark of connection she feels with the young boy watching her from his family's bakery suggests there may be more to her nature than meets the eye.

Overall, Edith appears to be a complex and multi-faceted character with a rich inner life, driven by both a desire for self-discovery and a need for secrecy.
