**Physical Attributes:** Edith Meier stands at 5'6" (168 cm) tall and has long, curly brown hair that falls down her back like a cascade of chestnut waves. Her eyes are a deep shade of hazel, with flecks of green that seem to sparkle in the right light. She is slender and petite, with a quiet elegance that belies her creative passion.

**Interests:** Edith Meier's true passion lies in storytelling, with a particular focus on ancient myths and legends. As a child, she was fascinated by these stories, which sparked her love of writing and creativity.
