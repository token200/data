**Personality:** Edith is a kind, patient, and meticulous person who wears her heart on her sleeve. She has a deep love for antique restoration and takes great pride in bringing new life to forgotten treasures. Despite being introverted, she has a way of putting others at ease with her gentle nature and infectious enthusiasm. Edith is also fiercely independent and values her alone time, but once you've earned her trust, she'll be there for you through thick and thin.

It's worth noting that Edith is also someone who values connections and relationships, as evidenced by her delight when Mrs. Jenkins reappeared in her life. She's been on a journey of self-discovery, exploring the importance of shared experiences and memories, which led her to welcome Mrs. Jenkins into her life with open arms.
