Writing has long been a passion of Edith's, and when Kåre encourages her to write again, she pours her heart and soul into creating a unique collection of poetry that showcases her voice and perspective.

**Additional Details:** Edith Stensson values simplicity and quiet contemplation in life. She is drawn to the natural world, often finding peace in the midst of chaos, and has a deep appreciation for the beauty of everyday moments.
