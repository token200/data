Based on the short story provided, here is a summary of Ikeda Avendaño's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ikeda Avendaño appears to be a thoughtful and introspective individual, often lost in her own thoughts as she gazes out at nature. She is deeply concerned with the well-being of those around her, particularly her sister Luna, and will follow their guidance even into the unknown. Her calm demeanor belies a deep sense of foreboding and unease, especially when faced with the uncertainty of the world's fragility.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Ikeda stands at about 5'8" (173 cm), which allows her to survey the landscape from a vantage point that is both commanding and intimate.
* Eye Color: Her eyes are an unnerving shade of indigo, almost like the deep blue of a clear night sky. They seem to hold a depth of wisdom and mystery that belies their bright color.
* Hair: Ikeda's dark hair is often whipping about her face in the wind, revealing the piercing intensity of her gaze.

**Interests:** Based on this brief encounter with Luna, it can be inferred that Ikeda has an interest in:

1. The mystical or metaphysical aspects of life, as hinted at by the mention of the Dreamer and the cosmos.
2. Exploration and discovery, particularly when it comes to understanding the world's fragility and the secrets of the universe.
3. Family and relationships, given her close bond with Luna and willingness to follow their guidance.

It is also possible that Ikeda has an interest in:

1. Navigation and cartography, as she seems to be traversing uncharted territories alongside Luna.
2. Environmentalism or conservation, as Luna's warning about the world's fragility suggests a deep concern for the natural world.

Of course, these are just speculative interests based on this brief glimpse into Ikeda Avendaño's character.
