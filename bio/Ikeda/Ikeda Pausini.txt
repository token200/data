He is kind, patient, and willing to take on challenging projects, as seen in his willingness to create the large wooden Buddha statue for Tanaka's estate. His passion for woodcarving is evident in every piece he creates, and he takes great pride in his work. He is also an excellent listener and has a deep understanding of the people around him.
