Here is a summary of Ikeda Lemoine's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ikeda Lemoine is a complex and enigmatic individual. She has a deep-seated desire for creative expression and is fiercely independent. Her tough exterior hides a vulnerable soul, driven by a traumatic past that she keeps hidden from the world. Despite her troubled history, Ikeda possesses a captivating charisma that draws people to her like moths to a flame. She is a free spirit, always chasing the next thrill and never staying in one place for too long.

**Physical Attributes:** Ikeda stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet lithe build, honed from years of living on the streets. Her hair is a rich, dark brown that often falls in loose waves down her back, and her eyes are an arresting shade of indigo, almost black, but with hints of gold that sparkle like diamonds in the right light.

**Interests:** Ikeda's passions are diverse and multifaceted. She is an art lover and has a deep appreciation for the works of Aur√©lien Dumont, whom she met in her early thieving days. Her love for art is matched only by her passion for thievery, which becomes an outlet for her pent-up emotions and desires. Ikeda also has a fascination with the night, feeling most alive under the cover of darkness, when the world seems to belong to her alone.

Other interests include:

* **Cryptography**: Ikeda has an innate understanding of codes and ciphers, which she uses to decipher hidden messages in artworks and treasures.
* **Mystery solving**: Her years of thievery have given her a keen eye for detail and a knack for unraveling puzzles.
* **Poetry and writing**: In quiet moments, Ikeda enjoys scribbling poetry in her notebook or jotting down fragments of stories that inspire her.

Despite these interests, Ikeda's primary focus remains on art, love, and transformation. She is forever chasing the light, even as she struggles to illuminate the shadows within herself.
