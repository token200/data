Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Martin Kovacs:

**Physical Attributes:**
Martin Kovacs is a tall and lean figure, standing at around 6'4" (193 cm) with an athletic build. His hair is dark brown and often unkempt, framing his chiseled features. His eyes are piercing blue, a trait that seems out of place among those who might expect to find him with golden or green eyes, given the passage about the young woman's green eyes in the story. His face is etched with lines of wisdom, experience, and perhaps a hint of sadness.

**Personality:**
Martin Kovacs is an introspective and melancholic individual. As an immortal vampire, he has witnessed centuries of history, which weighs heavily on his mind. He feels detached from the world around him, struggling to form meaningful connections due to the constant loss of loved ones throughout his long life. Despite this, there's a hint of hope in his eyes when he finds someone who captures his attention, and for the first time, he feels like he might be able to experience true human connection.

**Interests:**
Martin Kovacs is likely drawn to art, music, literature, or other creative pursuits that allow him to express himself without burdening others with his immortal nature. He may also find fascination in urban landscapes, architecture, and the way people interact with their environment. As someone who has lived through centuries, Martin might be an avid collector of rare books, artifacts, or historical objects that hold secrets to the past.

Given his immortal existence, he is likely drawn to moments of solitude, contemplation, and self-reflection. He may find himself captivated by stars, moonlight, or candlelight as he ponders life's mysteries. For someone who has seen so much, Martin might also have a deep appreciation for nature - the way sunrises break through the cityscape, or the songs of birds that bring him back to life.

While these details are fictional and created based on the provided short story, they provide an idea of what Martin Kovacs's personality and interests could be like.
