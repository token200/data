Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Martin King:

**Personality:** Martin is an unorthodox and determined individual with a keen mind for solving puzzles and crimes. He's described as eccentric, which may be attributed to his rough start in life on the wrong side of the tracks in Brooklyn. Despite this, he remains driven and focused, often working tirelessly without sleep or meals.

**Physical Attributes:** 
- **Height:** Martin is not specified as being particularly tall or short.
- **Eye Color:** His eye color is not mentioned in the story.
- **Age:** Martin's age is also not provided in the text.

Since no physical attributes are mentioned, I've chosen to leave them open to interpretation. It's possible that his height and eye color may be described in future stories or details.

**Interests:**
Martin has an affinity for puzzles, brain teasers, and codes, which started as a child solving cryptograms and decoding hidden messages. This fascination with codes led him to become an expert in forensic analysis, showcasing his unique perspective and attention to detail.

These interests likely drive Martin's passion for detective work and contribute to his success as the lead investigator of the city's Cold Case Unit.
