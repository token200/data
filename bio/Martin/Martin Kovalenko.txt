Here's a summary of Martin Kovalenko's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Martin is a complex individual with a sharp wit and quick tongue. Beneath his charismatic exterior lies a deeply troubled individual struggling to form genuine connections with others due to his online persona as "Zero Cool." He has a tendency to internalize his emotions, often channeling them into hacking as a coping mechanism.

**Physical Attributes:** Martin stands at around 6'1" (185 cm) with a lean build. His hair is dark brown, and his eyes are a piercing blue. He has a scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident. Despite his refined features, Martin's appearance often gives away his troubled past.

**Interests:** As a brilliant hacker and cybersecurity expert, Martin's primary interest lies in the world of cybercrime and information security. He is an avid reader of hacking forums and online communities, constantly seeking to improve his skills and stay ahead of the curve.

Martin is also passionate about music and has been known to spend hours playing guitar or listening to electronic music. This creative outlet helps him express emotions he struggles to convey in real-life interactions.

Beyond hacking and music, Martin's interests are relatively few and far between due to his reclusive nature. He spends most of his time working on solo projects, taking on high-stakes gigs for top clients, and navigating the dark net under his pseudonym "Zero Cool."

In contrast, when he meets Sophia, Martin finds himself drawn to her kindness, warmth, and genuine interest in getting to know him. This newfound connection sparks a desire for human connection and a chance to explore what it means to be vulnerable and authentic with someone else.
