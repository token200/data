**Personality:**
Martin Trevisan is a charismatic and calculating individual with a quick wit and silver tongue. He is a master manipulator who can effortlessly charm those around him, often to get what he wants. Despite his questionable past as a thief and con artist, Martin has a dry sense of humor and a tendency to self-deprecate, which makes him more relatable to those who know him. However, this fa√ßade also hides a sharp intellect and a ruthless determination to succeed.

**Interests:**
Martin's interests lie in the gray areas between right and wrong. He is fascinated by the intricacies of human psychology, particularly how people justify their own morally dubious actions. This fascination stems from his own experiences in the shadows of society, where he had to rely on his wits and charm to survive.

When not working as an accountant or taking on clandestine jobs for clients like Marcus, Martin enjoys collecting rare books and art pieces that reflect his eclectic interests. He is also a skilled player of chess, often using the game to exercise his strategic mind and plan ahead.

As he navigates this complex web of deceit and corruption, Martin finds himself torn between his desire to redeem himself and prove his worth as an honest individual versus his old instincts and temptation by the thrill of the game.
