Here's a summary of the fictional character Martin Mikhailov:

Physical Attributes: 
Martin stands at around 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm) tall, with an athletic yet lean build that belies his cunning nature. His piercing green eyes seem to gleam with intelligence and mischief, making him unsettlingly charismatic. His dark hair is often perfectly styled, adding to his air of sophistication.

Personality: 
Martin Mikhailov exudes confidence and charm, effortlessly navigating social situations to extract information or manipulate others to do his bidding. He has a silver tongue that can talk his way out of (or into) almost any situation. With an innate sense of deception, Martin is always on the lookout for potential marks or adversaries, making him a formidable opponent in the world of con artistry.

Interests: 
As a master con artist, Martin's interests lie in the art of deception itself, with a particular fascination for high-stakes targets and complex scams. He is an aficionado of fine wine (especially expensive labels), luxury cars, and high-society events. Despite his polished exterior, however, it appears that beneath his charm lies a driving need to outsmart and manipulate others â€“ both in the game of cat and mouse with Julian Styles.

In terms of hidden details, let's assume that Martin has a sharp intellect, quick reflexes, and is naturally skilled at disguise and deception. He may also have an extensive network of underworld contacts and a talent for persuasion.
