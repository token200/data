She exudes confidence and intelligence, making her a formidable force in the boardroom, but those close to her know she's also fiercely loyal and empathetic. Her sharp tongue can sometimes be intimidating, but it's also a defense mechanism for vulnerabilities she's not yet ready to reveal.

Her dark brown eyes sparkle with wit and intelligence, and her long, dark hair is often styled in a sleek and sophisticated manner. She has a fit and toned physique, honed from years of hard work and dedication to her career.

When she's not working or socializing with friends, you can find Isla practicing yoga or trying out new recipes in the kitchen.

However, a detail that was missing from the original story is her eye color which is actually Hazel, a warm and earthy shade that complements her dark features.
