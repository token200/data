Based on the short story, here is a summary of Isla Pedersen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Isla Pedersen appears to be a introspective and emotional person. She struggles with feelings of loneliness and emptiness after a painful breakup and family crisis, which causes her to withdraw from social interactions. However, she also shows resilience and hope for the future, as seen when she finds solace in her favorite café and begins to reconnect with others.

**Physical Attributes:** Isla is described as a person who trudges through muddy streets, suggesting that she may have a more laid-back or casual physical presence. Unfortunately, there are no specific details about her height or eye color provided in the story.

However, I can make an educated guess based on the author's description of her as someone who feels drawn to a warm and cozy café on a cold and grey day. Based on this contrast between her emotional state and the warmth she finds in the café, it seems likely that Isla may have a slightly petite build or slender physique.

Assuming a height range for a young adult woman, I would estimate Isla's height to be around 5'4"-5'6" (162-168 cm), but this is purely speculative.

**Interests:** Photography appears to be one of Isla's passions and interests. She is described as someone who "couldn't shake the feeling of emptiness" despite trying to fill it with work, suggesting that photography is an important source of comfort and expression for her. Her interest in capturing beauty in the gloom suggests that she may also appreciate more melancholic or atmospheric subjects.

In general, Isla seems to value solitude and introspection, but is drawn to social interactions when they feel meaningful or supportive.
