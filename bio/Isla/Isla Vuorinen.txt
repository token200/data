Based on the provided short story, I've created a summary of the fictional character Isla Vuorinen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**

Isla appears to be intelligent and resourceful, as evident from her successful undercover agent stint. She seems confident in her abilities and is not afraid to take calculated risks. However, she also has a cautious side, as demonstrated by her hesitation to leave the encounter with Lasse after discovering his true intentions. This suggests that Isla may have some emotional scars or past traumas that make her more guarded.

**Physical Attributes:**

- **Height:** Isla's height is not specified, but based on the context of navigating Helsinki streets and having a brief, intense interaction with Lasse, she might be around 5'6" to 5'8".
  
- **Eye Color:** Her eye color is not described, but given her intelligence and resourcefulness, it could likely be a neutral shade such as brown or gray.

**Interests:**

Given Isla's background as an undercover agent, it can be inferred that she has interests in:
- Espionage and international operations
- Investigative journalism or data analysis (as evident from the USB drive she hands to Lasse)
- Possibly, activism or advocacy related to her past experiences

Additionally, her encounter with Lasse suggests that Isla might have a fascination with history or conspiracy theories, as Lasse's interests seem centered around uncovering hidden information and understanding complex systems.
