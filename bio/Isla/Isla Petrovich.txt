Her relationships with others are often transactional, but as she discovers the true value of art and connection, her approach begins to shift.

**Physical Attributes:** Isla Petrovich is a striking figure, both physically and emotionally. She stands at 5'8" (173 cm) tall, with piercing sapphire eyes that seem to bore into those around her.

**Interests:** Isla's primary interest is in acquiring and selling rare and valuable art pieces. She has a keen eye for spotting forgeries and is renowned for her expertise in the field. However, as she delves deeper into the mystery of the painting that speaks to her, her interests expand to include the emotional and psychological connections between art and its creators. She begins to see art as more than just a commodity, but as a means of understanding oneself and others.

**Additional Details:** In terms of physical attributes beyond height and eye color, Isla's hair is raven-black and falls in loose waves down her back. Her skin is pale and smooth, often accentuated by the bold colors and patterns of her designer clothing and accessories. She has a slender yet athletic build, honed from years of living a fast-paced lifestyle as an art dealer.

It can be said that Isla's height (5'8") gives her an air of confidence and presence in crowded spaces, which is enhanced by her piercing blue eyes and striking black hair.
