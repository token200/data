Here's a summary of Renata Larsson's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Renata Larsson is a determined and resourceful private investigator with a sharp mind and an uncanny ability to read people. She has a reputation for being ruthless but also fair, which commands respect from those who hire her. Her years of experience have hardened her, but she still has a compassionate side, as evident in the way she comforts Anna during their night-long ordeal.

**Physical Attributes:** Renata is likely in her mid-to-late 30s, with an athletic build that suggests regular physical activity. Her height and eye color are not explicitly mentioned, but for this summary, let's assume she stands around 5'8" (173 cm) with piercing blue eyes, which seems to be a common trait among Nordic females.

**Interests:** Renata is fascinated by human behavior and psychology, which helps her in her line of work. She has an insatiable curiosity about people and their motivations, often going out of her way to gather information that might seem insignificant at first but can ultimately crack the case. Her love for solving puzzles and unraveling mysteries drives her forward.

Outside of her professional life, Renata likely enjoys activities that allow her to stay active and connected to the city she loves, such as walking or jogging in the early morning hours (as seen in the story), observing people in coffee shops or cafes, or reading about psychology, criminology, or sociology. Her ritual of smoking a cigarette on misty mornings hints at a somewhat melancholic streak, but it's also possible that this is simply her way of calming herself before diving into another challenging case.

Overall, Renata Larsson appears to be a complex and multi-faceted individual with a unique blend of skills, interests, and experiences that make her an excellent private investigator in the heart of Stockholm.
