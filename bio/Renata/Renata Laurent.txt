**Personality:**

Renata is a deeply emotional and empathetic person, with a passion for capturing the essence of life's experiences through art. She has a strong connection to the city of Montmartre, which seems to inspire and nurture her creativity. Her artistic expression is not just about technical skill, but also about conveying the emotions and feelings that drive her. Renata is fiercely independent and values her alone time, often finding solace in the quiet streets of Montmartre.

**Interests:**

* Painting (especially capturing the city's architecture, people, and atmosphere)

Her fingers are stained with paint, and she frequently carries a battered sketchbook or portfolio with her wherever she goes.

Despite her creative intensity, Renata is not afraid to be vulnerable and open about her emotions. She has a quiet sense of humor and can often be found laughing at the absurdity of life's experiences.
