Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Renata Persson:

**Personality:** Renata appears to be a loyal and supportive friend, as evidenced by her frustration when Sofia doesn't show up on time. However, she also has a bit of a competitive streak, as seen in her annoyance towards Alex for having been on the verge of getting back together with Sofia just last week. Despite this, she seems like someone who can laugh and move on from setbacks.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue
* Hair Color: Dark brown
* Build: Slim and fit

Note: The story doesn't provide much information about Renata's physical appearance beyond her eye color, but I've used the height, hair color, and build as inferences based on a typical Western female population.

**Interests:** Given that Renata is an artistic person who enjoys drawing, it seems likely that she has a creative streak. She also appears to be someone who values social connections and friendships, which is evident from her excitement when Sofia shows up late and their conversation about their plans for the day and night ahead.
