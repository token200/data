Here's a summary of Alarik Piotrowski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Alarik stands at 6'1" (185 cm) with an athletic build, honed from years of physical activity as a spy. His dark hair is flecked with gray, betraying his age and the weight of his experiences. His piercing blue eyes seem to hold a deep sadness, a reflection of the inner turmoil he's faced throughout his life. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, likely from a past encounter.

**Personality:** Alarik is an introverted and stoic individual who prefers silence over conversation. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him. However, beneath this reserved exterior lies a complex and introspective person, haunted by the ghosts of his past. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, with a strong desire to break free from the expectations of others.

**Interests:** Alarik's interests are eclectic and centered around art, literature, and music. He has a deep appreciation for literature, particularly 19th-century Polish authors like Adam Mickiewicz and Henryk Sienkiewicz. Art is also a source of comfort and solace for him, with a particular fondness for the works of Polish artists such as Wacław Szymanowski and Helena Łoponowska. Music plays a significant role in his life as well, with a preference for classical composers like Chopin and Debussy.

As he leaves his spy days behind, Alarik hopes to devote himself to more creative pursuits, such as writing or painting. He is drawn to the calming effect of nature, particularly the water lilies on the Grand Canal in Venice, which serve as a reminder of his newfound sense of peace and tranquility.
