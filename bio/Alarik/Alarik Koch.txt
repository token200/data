Based on the short story, here's a summary of Alarik Koch's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Alarik appears to be a introspective and possibly melancholic person. He struggles with feelings of jealousy, anger, and resentment, which suggests that he may have difficulty opening up to others or trusting new relationships. His emotions are raw and intense, as seen in his reaction to his brother's post on social media. Despite this, Alarik seems to be determined to move forward with his own life, albeit with a hint of frustration and disappointment.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no specific physical attributes were mentioned in the story, so I'll fill in some details:

* Height: Alarik is likely around 5'10" (178 cm) or 6'0" (183 cm), based on his ability to notice subtle changes in his brother's appearance from across the room.
* Eye Color: His eyes are a deep shade of brown, which seems to complement his dark hair.

**Interests:** While we don't have an exhaustive list of Alarik's interests, we can make some educated guesses:

* Social media and online platforms seem to be an important part of his life, as he regularly scrolls through feeds and checks in with old friends.
* He appears to enjoy casual, low-key activities like visiting cafes and sipping coffee, as seen in the story where he waits for his brother at a bar.
* Alarik may also value nostalgia and sentimental connections, given his reaction to seeing his brother's post on social media. This suggests that he cherishes memories of the past and values his relationships with others.
