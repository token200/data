**Physical Attributes:** Alarik stands at 6'2" (188 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His piercing blue eyes seem to bore into those he meets, as if sizing them up for potential vulnerabilities. His dark hair is often slicked back, revealing a sharp jawline and prominent cheekbones that give him a chiseled appearance.

**Personality:** Alarik is a complex individual with a multifaceted personality. On the surface, he appears to be charming and suave, able to effortlessly navigate high-society events and manipulate others to do his bidding. However, beneath this façade lies a ruthless pragmatist who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals. He has a keen strategic mind and is always planning several steps ahead of his adversaries.

**Interests:** Alarik's interests are centered around art, history, and the thrill of the heist. As an expert thief, he has a deep appreciation for rare artifacts and masterpieces, often stealing them to fund his own twisted creations. He is also fascinated by the concept of legacy and the impact one person can have on the world.

**Hobbies:** When not busy plotting his next move or executing daring heists, Alarik enjoys practicing martial arts and studying psychology, which helps him understand human behavior and predict potential outcomes. He is also an avid collector of rare books and artifacts, often purchasing them through unconventional means to add to his collection.

**Goals:** Alarik's ultimate goal is to cement his reputation as the greatest thief of all time, leaving behind a legacy that will be remembered for generations to come.

**Motivations:** Alarik's motivations are rooted in his desire for autonomy and financial freedom. As a member of a street gang in Riga, Latvia, he grew tired of living under the thumb of his peers and the constraints of the city's underworld.
