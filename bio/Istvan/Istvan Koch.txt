Note that some details are not explicitly mentioned in the story, so I've filled in gaps with my own interpretation. For example, Istvan's hair color is assumed to be dark brown based on the description of his suit jacket being "smoothed out" - it suggests a high level of grooming and attention to detail. Similarly, his build is inferred as lean and athletic due to his ability to work late into the night with intensity.
