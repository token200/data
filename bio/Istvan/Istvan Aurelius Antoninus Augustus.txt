He is driven by a desire to prove himself as a leader worthy of his family's legacy and make a name for himself in Palmyra. Despite being groomed from a young age for public service, Istvan is restless and longs for adventure and action. His determination and courage inspire loyalty in those around him, earning him the nickname "The Lion of Palmyra." However, this same fire within him also fuels his impulsiveness and willingness to take risks.

**Physical Attributes:** Istvan stands at 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm) tall, with an athletic build honed from years of riding horses and engaging in martial training. His eyes are a piercing blue, a trait passed down from his family lineage. His hair is dark brown, often styled in a way that accentuates his angular features.
