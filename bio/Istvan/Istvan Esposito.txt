**Personality:**
Istvan Esposito is a complex individual with a rich inner life. On the surface, he presents himself as a rugged, reserved person who values his alone time above all else. However, beneath this fa√ßade lies a man of great intellect, passion for history, and deep-rooted traditions. He is fiercely protective of his heritage and tends to be guarded when it comes to those closest to him, preferring to keep the past locked away from prying eyes. Despite this reserve, Istvan has a dry sense of humor and can come across as witty and charming, particularly when discussing topics he is passionate about.

**Interests:**
Istvan's love for history, language, and culture stems deeply from his Italian immigrant heritage. He is well-versed in the languages of Italy, including Italian, Latin, and various dialects, which he often uses to immerse himself in the rich cultural tapestry of his forebears. His vast knowledge of Renaissance art, feudal politics, and Italian traditions has earned him a reputation as a font of wisdom on these subjects. Tending to his overgrown garden serves as an escape for Istvan from the outside world, allowing him to connect with nature and channel his thoughts back into the world of ideas.

These attributes work in harmony to create the enigmatic figure that Sophia comes across when she stumbles upon Istvan Esposito in the woods.
