Max Toth is a skilled and resourceful young hacker with a strong sense of determination and curiosity. She is fiercely independent and has a natural instinct to investigate and uncover hidden secrets. Her past involvement in the elite hacking group "The Shadow Syndicate" has honed her skills, but also left her with a strong sense of loyalty and caution.

Max is also intensely private and guarded, preferring to keep her personal life and relationships closely controlled. This is reflected in her decision to delete incriminating files from her laptop and wipe away any evidence of her involvement with The Shadow Syndicate.
