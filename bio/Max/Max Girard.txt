Here is a summary of Max Girard's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
- Eye Color: A deep, piercing blue that seems to see right through you
- Hair Color: Dark brown, often worn messy and unkempt
- Build: Lean and athletic, with broad shoulders and a wiry physique
- Facial Features: Strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood scrape

**Personality:**
Max is a complex and multifaceted individual. On the surface, he appears tough and intimidating, with a rough exterior that hides a deep vulnerability. He has a strong sense of self-reliance and independence, having grown up on the streets and relied only on himself to survive. However, this toughness also makes him wary of getting close to others, fearing that they will ultimately let him down.

Despite his tough exterior, Max has a romantic streak and is deeply emotional when it comes to those he cares about. He is fiercely loyal and protective of those he loves, and will stop at nothing to defend them. His sense of vulnerability and openness was revealed when he confronted the rival musician on behalf of Luna, showcasing a softer side that he had kept hidden for so long.

**Interests:**
Max has a deep passion for music, particularly jazz and blues. He is drawn to the raw energy and emotion of these genres, and often finds solace in their rhythms and melodies when feeling overwhelmed or uncertain. His love of music also extends to his appreciation of art, literature, and poetry, which he finds helps him connect with others on a deeper level.

As someone who has spent years navigating the darker corners of life, Max is drawn to the raw and unbridled nature of these artistic expressions. He sees them as a way to tap into something more primal and authentic than the monotony of everyday life.

When not exploring the city's underbelly or lost in his own thoughts, Max enjoys spending time with Luna, laughing, and getting lost in the sounds of the city together.
