Based on the short story, here is a summary of Max Lei's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Max Lei is a highly skilled and resourceful individual with exceptional analytical abilities, making him a top-notch private investigator. He has a sharp mind, which allows him to piece together seemingly unrelated clues and make connections that others miss. His quick reflexes also suggest that he's physically fit and able to handle himself in intense situations. Additionally, Max appears to be perceptive and observant, as evidenced by his ability to read people, including Sophia's subtle body language. He's also fiercely independent and has a strong sense of justice, which drives him to take on cases like the one with Sophia.

**Physical Attributes:** Max Lei is described as a man on a mission, but no specific physical attributes are provided in the original story. However, based on his occupation as a private investigator and his ability to navigate Los Angeles's darker alleys, I'll make an educated guess that:

* Height: Around 6'0" (183 cm), allowing him to move comfortably through crowded spaces.
* Eye Color: A piercing blue or gray color, suggesting a sharp and analytical mind. However, in the original story, Sophia describes Max as having "piercing green eyes," which might be his distinguishing feature.
* Hair Color and Style: I'll assume that Max has dark hair, possibly with some grey streaks to indicate age or experience.
* Build: Lean and athletic, suggesting a fit physique from years of physical activity.

**Interests:** As a former CIA operative turned private investigator, Max Lei's interests likely include:

* Investigating complex cases and solving puzzles
* Gathering intelligence and piecing together seemingly unrelated clues
* Reading people and understanding their motivations
* Staying physically fit and capable to handle himself in intense situations
* Maintaining a sense of justice and independence

As the story progresses, it becomes clear that Max has a strong interest in uncovering hidden secrets and lies. His ability to listen attentively and piece together disparate information suggests that he's drawn to the thrill of the chase and the satisfaction of solving complex mysteries.

In addition to his professional interests, I imagine that Max Lei is also driven by a desire for personal fulfillment and a sense of control over his own life. As he takes on cases like Sophia's, he likely finds himself invested in the people involved and motivated to protect them from harm.
