Here's a summary of Max Szyma≈Ñski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Max is a tall man in his mid-40s, standing at around 6'2" with an athletic build. His piercing blue eyes seem to hold a deep intensity, but also convey a sense of vulnerability. His dark hair is usually neatly trimmed, framing his angular face.

**Personality:**
Max is a man of few words, preferring to listen and observe rather than speak. This trait stems from his experience as a soldier, where he learned the value of silence in high-pressure situations. Despite this, when he does open up, his eyes reveal a depth of emotion that suggests he's been through much more than meets the eye.

**Interests:**
Max has found solace in carpentry, using the repetitive motion to calm his restless mind and escape the memories that haunt him. He enjoys working with his hands, creating something from nothing, and taking pride in building furniture and fixing houses. This therapeutic outlet allows him to focus on the present moment and find a sense of control over his life.

Outside of work, Max seems to appreciate the quiet moments, often spending time alone on his porch at night, watching the stars or simply observing the world around him. He has a deep connection with nature and appreciates its beauty and peace.
