Based on the short story provided, here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Max Muti:

**Personality:** Max Muti is a brilliant and resourceful individual with a sharp mind and quick wit. He is intelligent and resourceful, able to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions to complex problems. Despite his success as a hacker, he feels restless and unsure if there's more to life than just causing chaos online. This suggests that Max has a sense of morality and may be seeking redemption or a new purpose.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Blue
* Hair: Dark brown, often messy and unkempt

Note: The physical attributes were not explicitly mentioned in the original story, so I've created a plausible set of characteristics for Max Muti based on his personality.

**Interests:** As a hacker and cyberactivist, Max's primary interest is cybersecurity and technology. However, as he embarks on this new journey, it seems that his interests are expanding to include social justice and corporate accountability. He may be drawn to causes that challenge the status quo and promote transparency and fairness in the tech industry.

It's worth noting that these attributes can be adjusted or expanded upon based on future stories or developments in Max Muti's character!
