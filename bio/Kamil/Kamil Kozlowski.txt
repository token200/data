However, beneath his polished exterior, Kamil is also driven by a desire to connect with others on a deeper level, to feel the warmth of genuine relationships and experiences that bring joy and fulfillment. This vulnerability is slowly starting to surface as he reconnects with Sophia, suggesting a capacity for growth and self-discovery in the face of adversity.
