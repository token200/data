**Personality:** Zoe is a free-spirited individual who has always prioritized her independence and creativity. She is adventurous, curious, and open to new experiences, which led her to drop out of college and travel the world. However, she also struggles with self-doubt and finding her place in the world. Once she finds her passion, Zoe becomes fully immersed and expressive, allowing herself to get lost in the moment.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Bright blue, almost turquoise
* Hair Color: Long, curly brown hair that often falls down her back like a waterfall
* Body Type: Athletic and lean, with toned arms from years of backpacking and outdoor activities

**Interests:** Zoe's true passions include:

* Painting abstract landscapes
* Playing music (guitar and singing)
* Exploring the outdoors (hiking, rock climbing, kayaking)
* Trying new foods and drinks (especially trying to create unique flavors in her cooking experiments)
* Learning about art, history, and culture through workshops and online courses

These interests reflect Zoe's love for adventure, creativity, and self-expression. Her experiences have shaped her into a person who is open-minded, spontaneous, and true to herself.

As she continued to explore the mountains and forest surroundings during the retreat, it was clear that these attributes would be instrumental in helping her discover new passions and finding her place in the world once more.
