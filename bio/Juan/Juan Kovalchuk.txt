Here is a summary of Juan Kovalchuk's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Juan is a brilliant but reclusive physicist who has spent most of his career studying the mysteries of dark matter. He is initially introverted and isolated, having lost touch with the world outside his laboratory due to his intense focus on his work. However, as he collaborates with Maria, he begins to open up and reveal a more vulnerable side, showcasing a deep sense of kindness, compassion, and hope.

**Physical Attributes:** Juan has a slender build, stands at around 5'9" (175 cm), and has short, dark brown hair that is often unkempt. His eyes are a deep shade of brown, almost black, which complements his intense focus on his work. He has a few scratches on his hands from years of working with complex equipment, giving him a slightly rugged appearance.

**Interests:** Juan's primary interest is in the study of dark matter and its mysteries. However, as he spends more time with Maria, he develops a new appreciation for various aspects of life beyond science, including philosophy, pop culture, and exploring the world around him. He finds joy in taking long walks through the park, discussing topics both intellectual and lighthearted.
