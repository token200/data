I must correct you again - there is no fictional character named Juan Navratilova in the original story. However, I can create a fictional character based on Martina Navratilova.

Here's a summary of the fictional character Juan Navratilova:

**Physical Attributes:**
Juan Navratilova is a 5'9" (175 cm) tall tennis player with striking blue eyes and dark brown hair. He has a lean, athletic build that allows him to move quickly around the court.

**Personality:**
Juan is a confident and determined individual who embodies the same passion for tennis as Martina Navratilova. He is unapologetically himself, refusing to compromise on his values or style of play. Juan is known for his sharp wit, infectious smile, and fierce competitiveness on the court.

**Interests:**
Juan's interests align with those of Martina Navratilova, including tennis, social justice causes, education, LGBTQ+ rights, and women's empowerment. He is also an avid supporter of environmental conservation efforts and community outreach programs.

Please note that Juan Navratilova is not a real person and does not have the same achievements or accomplishments as Martina Navratilova. This character is purely fictional, created for the purpose of this exercise.
