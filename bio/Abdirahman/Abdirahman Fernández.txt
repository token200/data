Here is a summary of Abdirahman Fern√°ndez's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Abdirahman is a quiet and unassuming individual, but when on the soccer field, he transforms into a force to be reckoned with. He is fiercely loyal to his countrymen and teammates, and plays with passion, dedication, and a strong sense of justice. Despite his tough exterior, he struggles with feelings of guilt and anger stemming from the loss of his parents at a young age.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'10" (178 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown
* Hair Color: Black

**Interests:** Abdirahman's primary interest is soccer, which has become an integral part of his life and identity. He finds solace in the game and uses it as a way to channel his emotions and find purpose. Off the field, he values his family above all else and strives to make them proud through his accomplishments.

In addition to soccer, Abdirahman may also enjoy spending time outdoors, reflecting on his life experiences, and learning about Somali culture and history. He is likely a private person who keeps to himself, but once you get to know him, he reveals a kind and humble individual who is deeply rooted in his community.

It's worth noting that these attributes are not explicitly stated in the original short story, so I had to make some educated guesses based on the context and themes presented.
