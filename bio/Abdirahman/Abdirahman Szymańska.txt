Based on the inspiration from the short story, I have created a new character profile for Abdirahman Szymańska:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing green with a hint of gold, reminiscent of a warm Mediterranean sunset
* Hair: Jet-black, thick, and always falling across his forehead in a messy swoop
* Build: Lean and athletic, with broad shoulders that speak to his dedication to physical activity
* Facial Features: Chiseled jawline, sharp cheekbones, and a nose that has been broken at least once

**Personality:**

* Abdirahman Szymańska is a brilliant strategist, always thinking several steps ahead of those around him.
* He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging the status quo to uncover the truth.
* Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for those in need and will go to great lengths to protect his allies.
* Szymańska is intensely curious and driven by a desire to uncover the secrets that lie beneath the surface of the world around him.

**Interests:**

* Computer science and programming, with a particular interest in cryptography and artificial intelligence
* Reading historical texts on espionage, counter-intelligence, and cyber warfare
* Practicing martial arts and hand-to-hand combat as a means of self-defense and mental discipline
* Playing classical music on the violin to relax and clear his mind

**Background:**

Szymańska's past is shrouded in mystery, but it is rumored that he has spent years working undercover for various organizations, honing his skills as a spy and a hacker. He has an extensive network of underground contacts and sources, which he uses to gather information and stay one step ahead of his adversaries.

Despite his expertise in these fields, Szymańska remains humble and unassuming, preferring to work behind the scenes rather than seeking to draw attention to himself. His dedication to uncovering the truth about Eclipse is matched only by his determination to protect those he cares about from harm.
