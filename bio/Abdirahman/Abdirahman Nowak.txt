Since there is no information about the fictional character Abdirahman Nowak, I'll create a profile based on some common characteristics found in fiction. Here's a summary:

Abdirahman Nowak is a 35-year-old Somali-American protagonist who appears in an upcoming science fiction novel set in a futuristic, intergalactic society. He stands at about 5'10" with a lean and athletic build, reflecting his disciplined lifestyle as a skilled hacker and engineer.

His eyes are a deep shade of brown, a common trait among people of Somali descent. His dark hair is often styled in a neat, modern fashion, often with a subtle hint of texture from the traditional Somali braids he keeps for special occasions.

Abdirahman has an intellectual personality, deeply analytical and introspective, which makes him excel at solving complex problems as a tech expert. He's fiercely independent but values loyalty above all else, having been raised by a close-knit family in Minneapolis who instilled these traits from a young age.

In terms of interests, Abdirahman is passionate about space exploration, particularly those that offer insights into human evolution and the potential for new life beyond Earth. His love for astronomy stems from his childhood spent gazing up at the stars on quiet nights with his grandfather in Somalia, discussing the myths and legends that once captivated African cultures.

His hobbies include coding, reading, and hiking, often finding solace in these activities when overwhelmed by the fast-paced nature of life as a hacker.
