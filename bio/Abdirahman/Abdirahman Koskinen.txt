Despite his enigmatic nature, he exudes a quiet confidence and authority, which commands respect from those around him. His deep sadness seems to be a constant companion, but it also imbues him with a sense of empathy and compassion for others.

Interests: As a librarian by day, Abdirahman is likely an avid reader and researcher. He seems drawn to the study of ancient languages, mythology, and folklore, which explains his ability to communicate with spirits trapped between worlds.
