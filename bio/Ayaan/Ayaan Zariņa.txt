Ayaan Zariņa is a 25-year-old Lithuanian-Swedish artist and musician. She has an athletic yet slender build, standing at around 5'8" (173 cm) with a wiry physique that belies her creative intensity. Her eyes are a striking shade of indigo, almost purplish in hue, which seem to sparkle with artistic passion.

Personality-wise, Ayaan is a free-spirited and introspective individual with a dry sense of humor. She is fiercely independent and values her personal space, often getting lost in her own thoughts and creative pursuits. Despite this, she has a compassionate heart and is deeply empathetic towards others, which makes her an excellent listener.

As for interests, Ayaan is an avid musician and plays the electric guitar with great skill. She draws inspiration from various genres, including electronic music, folk rock, and experimental soundscapes. In addition to music, she enjoys sketching, painting, and writing poetry – often incorporating elements of mythology and folklore into her work.

Ayaan's artistic journey is influenced by her mixed cultural heritage and her love for the natural world around her. She finds solace in exploring the intersection of technology and nature, which often informs her creative expressions. Her artistry has earned her a growing online following, with fans drawn to her unique blend of sonic experimentation and emotive storytelling.
