Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Ayaan Kowalska:

**Personality:** Ayaan is a brilliant and resourceful young hacker with a strong sense of justice. She is fiercely independent and has a soft spot for underdogs and those who are oppressed. Despite her tough exterior, she has a compassionate heart and will go to great lengths to protect the vulnerable. Her reputation as "ZeroCool" is built on her skills in disguise and deception, but beneath that fa√ßade lies a determined and courageous individual.

**Physical Attributes:** Ayaan stands at 5'8" (172 cm) with a lean and athletic build, likely honed from years of intense physical activity and mental focus. Her long, curly brown hair falls around her face like a curtain, framing her bright green eyes that shine with intensity. Her slender nose and small lips give her an angular, almost heart-shaped appearance.

**Interests:** Ayaan's primary interests are in hacking, computer science, and social justice. She is passionate about using her skills to expose corruption and bring about positive change in the world. She also has a fascination with cryptography, digital security, and the darker corners of the internet. When not working on cases or fighting for justice, Ayaan enjoys long walks in the park, reading science fiction novels, and listening to music by independent artists.

Additional details that were not mentioned in the original story but could be added:

* Ayaan has a collection of vintage typewriters and antique books on computer history, which she keeps hidden away in her makeshift lair.
* She is an expert in hand-to-hand combat and martial arts, skills she honed during her teenage years to defend herself against bullying.
* Despite her affinity for darkness and the shadows, Ayaan has a secret love of baking and makes intricate pastries and cakes in her spare time.
* Her parents are activists who were wrongly accused by the corporation she is fighting against. This personal connection fuels her crusade against corruption.
