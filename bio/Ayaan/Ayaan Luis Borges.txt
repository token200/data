Based on the provided short story, I have created a fictional profile for Ayaan Luis Borges:

**Physical Attributes:**
Ayaan stands at approximately 5'9" (175 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. His hair is black and unruly, often falling across his forehead in a way that adds to his introspective demeanor. His eyes are the most striking feature of his face - they twinkle like stars on a clear night sky, shining with an intensity that misses nothing. His nose is slightly aquiline, giving him a subtle air of refinement.

**Personality:**
Ayaan is a deeply introspective and analytical individual. He is driven by a passion for understanding the mysteries of reality and the nature of time itself. His fascination with metaphysics, philosophy, and literature often leads him down rabbit holes of self-discovery and existential contemplation. Despite his introspective nature, Ayaan has an infectious enthusiasm and curiosity that draws people to him like magnets.

**Interests:**
Ayaan's interests are centered around the intersection of philosophy, literature, and metaphysics. He is a voracious reader and devourer of knowledge, with a particular affinity for works by Jorge Luis Borges. His love for his literary idol has led him on a quest to decipher cryptic messages and puzzles hidden within his writings. Ayaan is also drawn to the labyrinthine streets of Buenos Aires, often wandering aimlessly through the city's historic center in search of new ideas and inspiration.

**Additional Details:**
Ayaan has an unassuming presence that belies his intellectual ferocity. He is comfortable with silence and can spend hours lost in thought, his eyes gazing into the distance as if deciphering the secrets of the universe. Despite this introspection, Ayaan is not anti-social and is known to engage in lively debates with fellow intellectuals over cups of coffee at quaint Buenos Aires cafes. His love for strong coffee is rivalled only by his love for philosophical discussions.
