**Personality:** Ayaan is an intrepid and determined individual with a passion for uncovering the secrets of the past. She is driven by curiosity and a thirst for knowledge, often taking risks to pursue her goals. Her experience as an archaeologist has taught her to be resourceful and adaptable, but she also has a keen sense of intuition that guides her in her searches. Despite her focus on finding lost artifacts, Ayaan seems to possess a deeper understanding of the cultural and historical context surrounding these relics.

However, she also seems to appreciate the cultural and historical context surrounding these relics, often seeking out expert knowledge and insight from vendors like the old man in the Grand Bazaar. Additionally, Ayaan appears to have a fascination with mysticism and the mysterious, as evidenced by her reaction to the unusual tea that revealed her intentions. This might indicate that she has a spiritual or metaphysical side, which she explores alongside her archaeological pursuits.
