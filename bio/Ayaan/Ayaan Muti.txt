Based on the inspiration provided by the short story "The Island of Echoes," I've created a fictional character profile for Ayaan Muti:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
- Eye Color: Deep, piercing green with flecks of gold
- Hair Color: Long, dark black hair that falls down her back like a waterfall
- Skin Tone: Olive-toned with a subtle golden undertone, reflecting her Indian heritage
- Build: Slender yet athletic, with toned limbs from years of exploring the outdoors

**Personality:**
Ayaan is an enigmatic and introspective individual with a deep connection to nature. She's fiercely independent and has a strong sense of self-discovery, often relying on her intuition to guide her through uncertain situations. Ayaan is also intensely curious and has a passion for unraveling mysteries, which drives her to explore the uncharted territories of the world.

**Interests:**
- Marine biology and oceanography, inherited from her scientist parents
- Ancient languages and dialects, particularly the dialect spoken on the Island of Echoes
- Mysticism and spirituality, seeking to understand the interconnectedness of all things
- Music and poetry, often finding solace in creative expression
- Exploration and adventure, always eager to venture into the unknown

**Additional Details:**
Ayaan's mixed heritage has contributed to her unique perspective on the world. Growing up, she felt like an outsider in both Indian and Scottish cultures, which led her to develop a strong sense of identity that blends different traditions and experiences. Her parents' cryptic stories about their research and the Island of Echoes have fueled her curiosity, driving her to uncover the secrets hidden beneath its surface.

Ayaan's sensitivity to energy and vibrations has become increasingly pronounced over time, making her attuned to subtle changes in her environment. This allows her to perceive patterns and connections that others might miss, drawing her closer to understanding the mysteries of the Island of Echoes and beyond.
