Outside of combat, Meinstein is intrigued by philosophy, particularly the ancient teachings of Taoism and Confucianism. He sees parallels between these philosophies and his own code of honor, recognizing that both seek balance and harmony within the world.

Meinstein's fascination with human psychology also drives his pursuit of justice: he seeks to understand the motivations and desires of those who would harm others, so that he may better prevent such wrongdoing from occurring.
