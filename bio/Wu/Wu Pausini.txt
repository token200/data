I'd be happy to help create a character profile for Wu Pausini and provide some background details. Here are my suggestions:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Age: 25
* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Dark brown with hints of gold, reflecting her Chinese heritage
* Hair: Black, shoulder-length, and often worn in a simple braid or tied back
* Build: Athletic and toned from years of martial training

**Personality Traits:**

* Wu is a free spirit, always seeking adventure and independence. She values her freedom above all else.
* Despite her fierce determination, she has a compassionate heart and will go to great lengths to protect those she cares about.
* She is fiercely intelligent and resourceful, often relying on her wits to get out of sticky situations.
* Wu has a dry sense of humor and enjoys poking fun at herself when things get too serious.

**Background:**

* Born into a family of renowned warriors, Wu was trained in the art of combat from a young age. However, she has always felt stifled by her parents' expectations and longs to forge her own path.
* She comes from a small village on the outskirts of ancient China, where tradition and honor are deeply ingrained.
* Wu's family is known for their bravery and martial prowess, but they also have a dark secret: they are hiding a powerful artifact that has been passed down through generations.

**Interests:**

* Martial arts (of course!)
* Exploration and discovery
* Reading ancient texts and studying the history of her people
* Collecting rare artifacts and relics
* Music (Wu plays the erhu, a traditional Chinese instrument)

Now that we have Wu Pausini's character profile, I'd be happy to continue the story or start a new one. Would you like me to:

A) Continue the original story where Wu discovers the secret temple
B) Start a new story with Wu as the main character
C) Explore other scenarios or plotlines featuring Wu Pausini

Let me know your preference!
