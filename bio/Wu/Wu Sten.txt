Here is a summary of Wu Sten's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Wu Sten is a complex and introspective individual. He is haunted by the memories of his past life as a warrior and struggles to find purpose in his present life. Despite this, he is fiercely independent and has a strong sense of self-reliance. As he embarks on a new journey with Aria, he begins to open up and reveal a softer side, showing glimpses of his compassionate and empathetic nature.

**Physical Attributes:** Wu Sten stands at approximately 6'2" (188 cm) tall, with a rugged and weathered appearance that reflects his years of wandering in the desert. His eyes are a deep shade of brown, flecked with hints of gold that seem to sparkle in the light. He has a strong jawline and piercing gaze that commands attention. His hair is dark and unkempt, often falling across his forehead in a messy fringe.

**Interests:** Wu Sten's interests lie in the realm of history, particularly the art of warfare and the strategies employed by great warriors throughout the ages. He is also fascinated by the natural world and has a deep respect for the desert landscapes he calls home. As he travels with Aria, he begins to explore new interests, including music (he plays a simple flute) and poetry (he writes verse in his spare moments).

Despite his introspective nature, Wu Sten is drawn to action and adventure, and as he embarks on this new journey with Aria, he finds himself rekindling old passions for exploration and discovery. His experiences as a warrior have given him a strong sense of loyalty and duty, which he seeks to honor through his actions and decisions in the present.
