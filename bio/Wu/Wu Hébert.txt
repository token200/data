**Background:**
Wu Hébert was born in Beijing, China, to a family of modest means. From a young age, he showed a keen interest in history and archaeology, spending hours pouring over books and documents at the local library. He went on to study archaeology at university, where he developed his skills as a researcher and excavator. After completing his studies, Wu Hébert embarked on a series of expeditions across the world, seeking out lost cities and ancient artifacts.
