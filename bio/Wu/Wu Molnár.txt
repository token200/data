Here is a summary of Wu Molnár's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Wu Molnár is enigmatic, intelligent, and confident.

She is driven by a sense of restlessness and discontent with her predetermined life, which motivates her to push boundaries and challenge expectations.

**Physical Attributes:** Wu Molnár stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build. Her eyes are a piercing green, reflecting her sharp intellect and analytical nature. Her dark hair is often styled in a sleek, low bun, and she has a small tattoo of a dragon on her left wrist, symbolizing her connection to the Chinese mafia.

**Interests:** Wu Molnár's interests lie at the intersection of art, history, and thrill-seeking. She is fascinated by ancient artifacts and cultural relics, which draws her to high-stakes heists like the Shanghai Museum job. Her love for art and history fuels her passion for acquiring and protecting valuable pieces, making her a formidable opponent in the world of espionage and counterfeiting.

Additionally, Wu Molnár has a keen interest in martial arts and acrobatics, honed from years of practice and training with skilled instructors in the Chinese mafia's shadowy networks. She is also an expert in lockpicking, safe-cracking, and other forms of stealthy maneuvering that have made her the ghostly thief of Shanghai.

In her free time (a luxury she can ill afford), Wu Molnár enjoys exploring hidden alleyways and secret gardens in Shanghai, sipping jasmine tea in quiet cafes, and engaging in late-night conversations with fellow outsiders who share her passion for art, history, and rebellion.
