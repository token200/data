Based on the short story, here is a summary of Wu Trevisan's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Wu Trevisan appears to be a responsible, duty-bound individual with a strong sense of responsibility. He feels the weight of his duties as the leader of the Dragon Guard, and this burden motivates him to protect the city and its energies. Despite his serious demeanor, he shows compassion and empathy towards others, as evident in his softening expression when interacting with the worried villagers.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Wu Trevisan is likely a tall individual, given his ability to navigate the winding streets and narrow alleys of the city without seeming out of breath. His exact height is not specified, but for the sake of completion, let's assume he stands at around 6'2" (188 cm).
* Eye Color: Wu Trevisan's eye color is not explicitly mentioned in the story, so I will make an educated guess that his eyes are a deep, piercing brown, which seems fitting for a leader tasked with safeguarding ancient secrets and battling dark forces.

**Interests:** As the leader of the Dragon Guard, Wu Trevisan's primary interest lies in protecting the balance of yin and yang within the city's energies. He is deeply invested in understanding the intricacies of this balance and maintaining its equilibrium. Outside of his duties as a guardian, it can be inferred that Wu Trevisan values knowledge and wisdom, given his ability to decipher subtle signs and whispers that lead him to the source of disturbances.

Additionally, as an elite warrior and swordsman, Wu Trevisan likely enjoys martial arts, strategy, and tactics, which are essential skills for his role in maintaining balance within the city's energies. His proficiency with yin-yang energy and sword fighting suggests a deep passion for these areas.

It is also possible that Wu Trevisan has a personal interest in understanding the secrets of the ancients, as hinted at by the whispers carried on the wind and the ancient power he wields as a Dragon Guard member.
