Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Oleg Klein:

**Personality:** Oleg Klein is described as a man of few words, but when he speaks, people listen. This suggests that he is a reserved individual who only shares his thoughts and opinions when they are worth sharing, and that he has a commanding presence. Additionally, despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for those in need, indicating that he is empathetic and cares about the well-being of others.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'1" (185 cm) - A tall and imposing figure, likely making an intimidating presence.
* Eye Color: Blue/Grey - The description does not explicitly state Oleg's eye color, but given his rugged and authoritative demeanor, it is possible that he has a piercing blue or grey hue.

**Interests:** As a former KGB agent turned detective, Oleg's interests seem to be centered around solving complex cases, uncovering secrets, and bringing justice to those who have been wronged. He appears to be driven by a strong sense of curiosity and a desire to expose the truth, particularly when it comes to historical events like Project Nightshade.

It is also worth noting that Oleg's interests extend beyond his work as a detective, as he has an acquaintance in Natalia, a retired KGB agent, who suggests that there may be more to him than meets the eye. Perhaps he is driven by a sense of loyalty or duty to those from his past, and is willing to take risks to uncover the truth.
