Here is a summary of Oleg Kaminski's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Oleg Kaminski exudes quiet confidence and has a strong sense of morality. He is fearless, determined, and driven to uncover the truth, often putting his own integrity ahead of those who pay him for his services. His air of mystery commands attention without demanding it, suggesting he is a man of depth and complexity.

**Physical Attributes:** Oleg stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. His features are sharp and angular, giving him an intense and brooding presence. His dark hair is often neatly trimmed, suggesting a level of professionalism and attention to detail.

**Interests:** As a freelance journalist, Oleg's primary interest lies in uncovering secrets and exposing corruption. He has a passion for investigative reporting and is driven by a desire to bring truth to light. This pursuit has earned him a reputation as one of the most fearless and dogged journalists in Berlin. When not working on a story, it can be assumed that Oleg enjoys a good whiskey (as evidenced by his current drink at the dingy bar) and may have a taste for adventure and risk-taking.

It is also worth noting that Oleg's experiences as a former KGB agent have likely shaped his interests and worldview. He has seen firsthand the dangers of espionage and deception, which may have fueled his desire to use his skills for good rather than nefarious purposes. His encounter with Sophia, a Russian dissident, suggests he is open to taking on high-risk stories that could potentially expose powerful officials, indicating a strong sense of justice and a willingness to challenge authority when necessary.
