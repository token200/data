His dark brown hair is often messy and unkempt, adding to his rough-around-the-edges demeanor.

**Personality:** Oleg exudes an aura of confidence and charisma, which serves him well in his line of work as a freelance mercenary. He is fiercely independent and non-conformist, preferring to operate outside the boundaries of traditional law enforcement or government agencies. His years as a Spetsnaz operative have honed his skills in infiltration, sabotage, and hand-to-hand combat, making him a formidable opponent. Despite his tough exterior, Oleg has a dry sense of humor and can be charming when the situation calls for it.

**Interests:** As a former Spetsnaz operative turned mercenary, Oleg's interests tend towards high-risk activities such as infiltration, sabotage, and tactical operations. He is driven by a desire for financial gain and adventure, often taking on missions that push him to his limits. Outside of work, Oleg is drawn to the thrill of the unknown, frequently exploring the darker corners of Moscow in search of new experiences. He has a particular fondness for whiskey and fine cigars, using these vices as a way to unwind after a long day of work.

**Other Traits:** Oleg's years in the Spetsnaz have instilled in him a strong sense of loyalty and duty, particularly towards those he considers allies or friends. However, his independent nature makes it difficult for him to form lasting attachments with anyone. Despite this, he has a certain code of honor that drives him to take on missions where he can make a real difference, even if the pay is minimal.
