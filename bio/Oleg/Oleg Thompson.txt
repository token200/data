Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Oleg Thompson:

**Personality:** Oleg is a introspective and analytical individual with a strong sense of unease. As a journalist, he has developed a keen eye for detail and is naturally curious about the world around him. However, his experience in Moscow has left him feeling uneasy and disoriented, as if he's been living under the constant scrutiny of others. He appears to be cautious and guarded, but also intensely private, preferring to keep his thoughts and feelings to himself.

**Physical Attributes:** Oleg is a tall and lean individual, standing at around 6'2" (188 cm). His eyes are a deep shade of brown, with an intense and piercing quality that misses nothing. He has short, dark hair that's often unkempt, giving him a slightly disheveled appearance.

**Interests:** As a journalist, Oleg is deeply interested in politics, international relations, and social justice. He's passionate about uncovering the truth and telling stories that need to be told, often taking risks to get to the bottom of his investigations. Outside of work, he enjoys reading literary fiction and poetry, and is likely an avid fan of British authors like Orwell and Hemingway.

It's worth noting that Oleg's past as a foreign correspondent has left him with some emotional scars, and it's unclear how much of himself he's willing to reveal or share with others. The arrival of the mysterious notebook sets him on a path of self-discovery, and it remains to be seen what secrets will be revealed about his true identity and motivations.
