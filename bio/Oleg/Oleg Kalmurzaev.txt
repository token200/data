Here is a summary of Oleg Kalmurzaev's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Oleg is a man of few words, preferring to let his actions speak for him. He exudes confidence and control, but beneath this façade lies a complex web of emotions and motivations. As a former Soviet spy, he has honed his skills in deception and manipulation, making him an expert at hiding his true intentions. Despite his tough exterior, there is a hint of curiosity and even amusement in his eyes when interacting with Sofia.

**Physical Attributes:** Oleg stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with a slender yet athletic build, a testament to his years of physical training as a spy. His hair is gray and short, often neatly trimmed, framing a face that is both weathered and worn. His eyes, though once piercing and intense, have lost some of their luster, now appearing dull and tired. However, when he looks at Sofia, the spark of curiosity in his eyes reignites, betraying his reserve.

**Interests:** As a former Soviet spy, Oleg's interests are likely centered around matters of national security, counter-intelligence, and espionage. He is well-versed in cryptography, surveillance techniques, and manipulation, skills he has honed over decades of service. In his retirement, he may have taken up hobbies that allow him to channel these skills into something more creative or personal. Some possibilities include:

* Collecting rare books on military history, intelligence theory, or cryptography
* Playing chess or other strategy games as a way to maintain his mental edge
* Gardening or horticulture, which could be a therapeutic outlet for his experiences
* Reading and writing poetry or short stories, potentially as a form of catharsis

Despite his reclusive nature, Oleg's interests likely revolve around understanding human psychology, behavior, and motivations – skills he has developed during his years as a spy.
