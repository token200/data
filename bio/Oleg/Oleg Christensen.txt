Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Oleg Christensen's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**

* Complex and multi-layered, with a tendency to hide his true nature behind a fa√ßade of normalcy.
* Haunted by his past mistakes and the weight of his secrets, which can evoke feelings of anxiety and unease.
* Struggles with loyalty and deception, having worked for the KGB and left Russia with a price on his head.
* Deeply introspective and self-aware, recognizing the blurred lines between his old life and new one.
* Possibly struggling with a sense of identity, caught between his past actions and his current attempt to start anew.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6 feet (183 cm) - a reasonable height for a Russian male of average build.
* Eye Color: Brown - a common eye color in Eastern European populations, which suits Oleg's Russian heritage.
* Age: Late 30s/Early 40s - likely in his mid-to-late 40s based on the description of him as having built a new life and having children.

**Interests:**

* It is unclear what specific interests Oleg has beyond his attempt to build a new life in London. However, given his background as a former KGB agent, he may have a strong interest in:
 + Politics and international relations
 + Surveillance and counter-intelligence techniques (from his past experience)
 + Deception and manipulation (as a skill he developed during his time with the KGB)
 + Escape and evasion strategies (based on his narrow escape from capture)

Note that these interests are speculative and may not be explicitly mentioned in the short story.
