Based on the short story provided, here is a summary of the fictional character Oleg Del Toro's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Oleg Del Toro is described as brilliant, reclusive, and private. He is highly focused and determined in his pursuit of scientific discovery, often to the point where it has led some of his colleagues to joke that he is obsessed with his work. Despite this, he remains undeterred by skepticism or criticism, and is driven by a sense of curiosity and wonder.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, there are no physical attributes mentioned in the story beyond Oleg's face, which is not described at all. However, it can be inferred that he is likely to have a somewhat introspective or absent-minded appearance, given his tendency to become lost in thought while staring at the stars.

Unfortunately, I could not find any details on height and eye color for Oleg Del Toro in this short story.
