Oleg is also shown to be resourceful and quick-witted, able to think on his feet and adapt to new information as it becomes available.

**Physical Attributes:**

His eyes are a deep shade of brown that seem to bore into those he's speaking to, suggesting a sharp mind and keen observational skills. His dark hair is often mussed, giving him a slightly disheveled appearance that belies his sharp intellect.
