Here is a summary of Oleg Ivanov's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Oleg Ivanov is a man of few words, with an unreadable expression behind his thick eyebrows. He exudes confidence and authority, but also has a hint of vulnerability beneath the surface. Despite being a former KGB agent turned private investigator, he is driven by a strong sense of justice and empathy for those in need. His years of working in the shadows have made him calculating and strategic, but also deeply compassionate.

**Physical Attributes:** Oleg stands at around 6'1" (185 cm) tall, with a ruggedly handsome face and piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he looks at. His dark hair is often messy and unkempt, framing his angular features. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow, likely from an old injury or a rough night on the streets. Oleg's style is practical and understated, favoring worn jeans, leather jackets, and scuffed boots that speak to his love of the city's underbelly.

**Interests:** As a former KGB agent turned private investigator, Oleg has a keen interest in politics, corruption, and the dark corners of human nature. He is well-versed in the inner workings of Russia's government and intelligence agencies, as well as its underworld of organized crime and black marketeers. Outside of work, Oleg enjoys long walks through Moscow's snowy streets at dawn, sipping coffee in quiet cafes, and listening to old Soviet folk music on his worn records player.

Despite his tough exterior, Oleg has a deep love for the beauty and resilience of everyday people, like Sofia and Anastasia, who are driven by courage and conviction in the face of overwhelming odds.
