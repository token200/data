Here is a summary of Oleg Ken's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Oleg Ken is a man of few words, but his piercing blue eyes reveal a deep well of emotions. He has a tough exterior that conceals a vulnerable soul, particularly when it comes to his wife, Natalia, whose murder still haunts him. Despite this vulnerability, he is fiercely determined and will stop at nothing to uncover the truth and bring justice to those who have been wronged.

**Physical Attributes:** Oleg Ken stands at around 5'10" (178 cm) with a lean and rugged build, honed from years of physical activity as a KGB agent. His piercing blue eyes are his most striking feature, able to convey a thousand stories and emotions. His dark brown hair is often slicked back, revealing a sharp jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his many close calls.

**Interests:** As a former KGB agent turned private investigator, Oleg Ken has a keen interest in espionage, counter-intelligence, and the darker aspects of human nature. He is also an avid researcher, spending countless hours poring over dusty archives and interviewing old contacts to uncover new leads. Outside of his work, Oleg is a solitary figure, preferring the quiet comforts of his own company to the bustle of city life. However, he does have a deep affection for classic Russian literature and music, often finding solace in the works of Tolstoy and Tchaikovsky during times of uncertainty.
