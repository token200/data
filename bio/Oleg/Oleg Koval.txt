Here is a summary of Oleg Koval's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Oleg is an enigmatic and driven individual who is fiercely dedicated to uncovering the truth. He has a curious nature and is not afraid to venture into dark or uncomfortable areas to get to the bottom of a story. His determination and strong sense of justice make him a formidable journalist, but also leave room for suspicion about his true motivations.

**Physical Attributes:** Oleg stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with a lean build, suggesting a relatively slender frame despite his rugged profession as a journalist. His eyes are a deep, piercing blue that seems to bore into those he meets, giving him an unnerving intensity. His hair is dark brown and often unkempt, adding to his rough-around-the-edges persona.

**Interests:** As a freelance journalist, Oleg's interests revolve around investigative journalism and uncovering hidden truths. He has a particular fascination with the darker corners of society, which drives him to explore themes such as corruption, conspiracy, and social injustice. His curiosity is insatiable, and he is always on the lookout for new leads or clues that might take him down a rabbit hole of discovery.

Additional details: Oleg's past is shrouded in mystery, with few people knowing much about his early life or motivations. He appears to be self-taught, with little formal education beyond journalism school. His skills as a researcher and interviewer are unmatched, but his willingness to take risks sometimes puts him at odds with those around him.

Given the mysterious nature of Oleg's past, some might speculate that he has personal connections to the secrets hidden in the warehouse archive. This could suggest that he is driven by more than just a desire for truth, possibly hinting at a deeper connection to the mystery itself.
