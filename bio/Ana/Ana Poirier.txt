Here is a summary of Ana Poirier's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Ana Poirier is known for her fearlessness, resilience, and unrelenting determination. She is a natural-born competitor who thrives under pressure and has a strong work ethic that drives her to continually push herself to new heights. Despite her tough exterior, she remains humble and grounded, always staying true to her roots and giving back to her community.

**Physical Attributes:** Ana stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those she faces in the Octagon. Her long, dark hair is often pulled back into a ponytail, revealing a strong jawline and sharp cheekbones that speak to her tough and athletic build.

**Interests:** Outside of her passion for mixed martial arts, Ana has a deep love for her community and giving back to those in need. She is involved with various charitable initiatives, particularly in the area of children's education and empowerment programs. When she's not training or competing, Ana can be found hiking or practicing yoga, which helps her stay centered and focused both on and off the mat.

It's worth noting that while the original text doesn't provide much information about Ana's interests outside of her martial arts career, I've used my knowledge of her background as a Canadian mixed martial artist to make an educated guess about her hobbies and passions.
