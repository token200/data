They possess a deep understanding of human psychology and manipulation, making them a master strategist in their line of work.

**Interests:**

Riley Hideki has an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and a passion for the ancient art of ninjutsu.

Their affinity for the night sky is also a notable interest – they often steal away from their high-rise hideout to gaze up at the Tokyo skyline, finding solace in the city's rhythm and the mystery of its streets.
