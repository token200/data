**Personality:** Riley is known for her fiery personality and sharp tongue, which has earned her a reputation as a tough and relentless journalist. She is confident and determined, with a strong sense of conviction that drives her to uncover the truth, no matter how difficult or unpopular it may be.

However, beneath her tough exterior, Riley has a soft spot for underdogs and is always on the lookout for stories that need to be told. This compassion and empathy make her a relatable and admirable figure, both in her personal and professional life.

**Physical Attributes:** Riley González is described as having an unmentioned age, but it can be assumed to be late 20s or early 30s based on the context of her career. Her physical height is not mentioned, but let's assume she stands at around 5'8" (173 cm) with a lean and athletic build.

Her eye color is not specified in the story, but I would imagine it to be a bright, piercing brown that seems to bore into those she interviews or confronts.

**Interests:** As a journalist, Riley's primary interest is uncovering the truth and telling stories that need to be told. She is fiercely driven and has a strong sense of justice, which motivates her to seek out corruption and deceit in all forms.

Outside of work, I imagine Riley enjoys reading, writing, and staying informed about current events and social issues. Her passion for storytelling and journalism is evident in the way she approaches each new investigation, always seeking to uncover new facts and shed light on dark secrets.

Overall, Riley González is a complex and dynamic individual with a rich inner life and a strong sense of purpose. Her combination of tenacity, compassion, and journalistic acumen makes her a compelling and admirable character.
