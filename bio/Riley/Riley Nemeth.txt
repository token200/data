Here's a summary of Riley Nemeth's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Physical Attributes:** Riley is likely in her mid-to-late 20s, with a slender build. She has long, dark brown hair that falls down her back, framing her heart-shaped face. Her bright hazel eyes sparkle when she smiles, and her nose is slightly upturned, giving her an endearing and friendly appearance. She stands at around 5'8" (173 cm), which allows her to move easily through crowded spaces like the coffee shop.

**Personality:** Riley appears to be a creative and introspective person who values close relationships. She's deeply appreciative of Alex's support and encouragement, and she seems to feel comfortable opening up to him about her struggles with anxiety. Despite her artistic talents, she also has self-doubt about pursuing writing as a new passion, which suggests that she may be more reserved or uncertain at times. However, when surrounded by supportive friends like Alex, she's able to let her guard down and explore new ideas.

**Interests:** Riley is an avid artist and designer, with a particular interest in graphic design (as evidenced by her graphic design class and the intricate patterns in her sketchbook). She also seems to enjoy writing, although this is not as familiar territory for her. Her conversation with Alex about exploring writing suggests that she's curious about the possibilities and willing to take risks. Additionally, Riley appears to be someone who values self-care and personal growth, as evident from her desire to take a break from design to explore new interests.

Some additional details that might flesh out Riley's character:

* She may have a quirky sense of humor or enjoy sarcasm, as hinted at by the nickname "Riles" that Alex uses.
* Her artistic talents may be honed through years of practice and study, although she might not consider herself a master artist just yet.
* Despite her creative pursuits, Riley could have a more introverted side and prefer quieter activities to large social gatherings or loud events.
