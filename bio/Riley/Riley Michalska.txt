Here's a summary of Riley Michalska's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel with golden flecks
* Hair: Dark brown, straight, and slightly wavy
* Skin Tone: Porcelain doll-like complexion with a subtle sprinkle of freckles across her cheeks

**Personality:**
Riley is an introverted yet creative soul who has grown accustomed to the isolation that comes with pursuing her passion for art. She's fiercely independent and values her alone time, but this doesn't mean she's antisocial; she just needs space to recharge and focus on her craft. As she opens up to Max, we see glimpses of a vulnerable and sensitive side, indicating a depth of emotion that might not be immediately apparent.

**Interests:**

* Art (painting, specifically)
* Music (jazz and indie folk)
* Literature (poetry and short stories)
* Photography
* Travel (especially city exploration and experiencing different cultures)

Riley's interests are closely tied to her artistic pursuits and a desire to explore the world around her. She's drawn to experiences that allow her to observe, reflect, and create, often finding inspiration in the everyday moments and beauty of urban landscapes.

In contrast to Max, Riley is more tactile, relying on colors, textures, and emotions evoked by her art rather than words. Her connection with Max allows her to explore the intersection of their creative worlds, leading to a unique understanding and connection that goes beyond typical artistic dialogue.
