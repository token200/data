Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Levi Lei's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

Personality:
Levi is a passionate and ambitious young chef with a deep love for traditional Cantonese cuisine. He is driven by his desire to share the flavors and stories of his childhood with the world, and is committed to staying true to his roots despite achieving success in the culinary industry. Levi appears to be humble, as evidenced by his nervous presentation to the food critic from The San Francisco Chronicle, but also confident in his abilities and vision for his restaurant.

Physical Attributes:
Levi's height is not explicitly mentioned in the story, so I have chosen a plausible value based on average Cantonese male heights (around 5'6"). His eye color is likely brown or dark brown, as is common among people of East Asian descent.

Interests:
In addition to cooking and sharing traditional Cantonese cuisine, Levi appears to be interested in:

* Experimenting with innovative techniques to keep his dishes fresh and exciting
* Sourcing rare ingredients from local markets
* Preserving the stories and traditions behind his recipes
* Balancing flavors and textures in his cooking

It is worth noting that these interests are inferred based on the story, but may not be explicitly stated as part of Levi's character.
