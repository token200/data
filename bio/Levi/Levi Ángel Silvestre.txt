Here is a summary of Levi √Ångel Silvestre's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Levi is a highly skilled and efficient individual with a tough exterior that hides a deep sense of vulnerability. He has been shaped by tragedy, having lost his parents as a child, and this experience has left him with emotional scars. Despite his tough exterior, he is fiercely loyal to those he trusts, particularly Captain Makoto Yukimura, and will go to great lengths to protect them. Levi's past experiences have made him a lone wolf, content to operate on the fringes of society, but his growing connection with Captain Yukimura may be starting to chip away at this facade.

**Physical Attributes:** Levi stands at approximately 6'2" (188 cm) tall, with an athletic yet lean build that belies his deadly efficiency in combat. His eyes are a piercing blue color that seem to bore into those he looks at, and they convey a sense of intensity and focus that is unnerving to his enemies.

**Interests:** Levi's interests are largely centered around his work as a member of the Special Operations Squad within the Military Police Corps. He is highly skilled with firearms and hand-to-hand combat, and is feared by his enemies for his ruthless efficiency in taking down targets. Outside of work, it appears that Levi has few close relationships or hobbies beyond those related to self-improvement and personal development. However, as he begins to form a connection with Captain Yukimura, it seems that there may be more to him than initially meets the eye.

It is worth noting that Levi's past experiences have left emotional scars that are still present today. He struggles with trust issues and intimacy, having been abandoned by his brother after their parents' death. His relationship with Captain Yukimura is a tentative one, but it offers Levi a sense of belonging and purpose that he has been missing for so long.
