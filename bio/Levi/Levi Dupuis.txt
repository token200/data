Here's a summary of Levi Dupuis' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Levi is a practical and pragmatic individual who values independence and solitude. As a lighthouse keeper, she has grown accustomed to being alone with her thoughts, but beneath her reserved exterior lies a curious and intuitive person who is attuned to the rhythms of nature. She is fiercely protective of her home and the people she cares about, and will not hesitate to take on challenges that come her way. Despite her initial skepticism towards ghost stories, Levi has a deep connection to the sea and its mysteries.

**Physical Attributes:** Levi stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with an athletic yet slender build, honed from years of working outdoors in the coastal environment. Her hair is dark brown, often tied back in a practical ponytail, and her eyes are a deep shade of blue that seems to hold a hint of sea salt and mystery. Her skin has a warm, golden undertone from spending countless hours basking in the sunlight and tending to the lighthouse.

**Interests:** Levi's primary interests lie with the natural world and the sea. She is deeply passionate about marine life and the ecosystems that exist along the coastlines she watches over. As a lighthouse keeper, her duties involve maintaining the light, monitoring weather patterns, and ensuring the safety of ships navigating treacherous waters. Outside of work, Levi enjoys spending time alone on the shore, observing the tides, and listening to the whispers of the ocean. She is also an avid reader and researcher, often devouring books on folklore, mythology, and historical events that have shaped the coastline she calls home.

As for the strange occurrences mentioned in the story, it's possible that Levi has a more intuitive sense of the supernatural than initially meets the eye. Perhaps her connection to the sea runs deeper than mere practicality, and she is beginning to uncover hidden truths about her surroundings that have been buried beneath the surface for years.
