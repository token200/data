**Personality:**
Levi Weissner appears to be an introverted person who values solitude and creativity. He is passionate about writing and has spent countless hours developing his craft. Despite being anxious about meeting with his agent, Rachel, he remains open to feedback and encouragement. Levi also seems to have a strong sense of self-doubt, often questioning the commercial viability of his work. However, with the support of Rachel, he begins to gain confidence in himself as a writer.

Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of Levi's physical attributes in the story. To fill this gap, let's imagine that:

* He stands at around 5'9" (175 cm) tall.
* His eye color is a deep brown, almost black, which gives him a reserved and introspective appearance.
* His hair is dark brown and unkempt, with hints of messy texture.

**Interests:**
Levi's interests are centered around writing and storytelling. He spends most of his free time scribbling in notebooks, lost in the world of words. As a freelance writer, he has developed a keen sense of observation and creativity, which serves him well in crafting compelling stories.

In addition to writing, Levi seems to have an appreciation for nature, growing up in a small town surrounded by rolling hills and dense forests. This upbringing likely influenced his love of solitude and his connection to the natural world.
