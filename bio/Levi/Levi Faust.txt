Based on the short story, here is a summary of Levi Faust's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Levi appears to be a introspective and brooding individual. He has grown tired of the ruthless tactics of the Order of the Red Hand and is seeking a fresh start in a new community. This suggests that he values independence and autonomy, but also may struggle with feelings of isolation or disconnection from others.

**Physical Attributes:** Levi's physical appearance is not extensively described, but we can infer some details from his actions and interactions:

* Height: Levi is likely tall, given the fact that he towers over a woman in the shadows. His exact height is unknown, but he seems to be above average.
* Eye Color: There is no explicit mention of eye color, but we are told that his eyes "adjusted to the darkness" which implies that they may be dark or have a significant amount of pupils, making them appear more prominent in low light conditions. Green eyes would fit this description and would also match the piercing green eyes described for the mysterious woman.
