Here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Levi Nilsson:

**Personality:** Levi Nilsson appears to be a introspective and nostalgic person who values tradition and heritage. He has a strong sense of longing for home and feels a deep connection to his past, particularly his great-aunt who taught him about sailing. This suggests that he is a sentimental and emotional individual who holds onto memories and experiences from his childhood.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Levi's height is not specified in the text, but based on his physical presence as described, it can be inferred that he is likely a tall and lean individual.
* Eye Color: Levi's eye color is not mentioned in the story, so I will assume it to be blue or green, colors commonly associated with Scandinavian cultures.

**Interests:** As a former sailor, Levi Nilsson clearly has a strong affinity for sailing and the ocean. He is also deeply rooted in his heritage and has a connection to his hometown of Ravenswood. His interests seem to revolve around nostalgia, family history, and the sense of home and belonging.

It's worth noting that the text does not provide explicit details about Levi's personality, physical attributes, or interests, but based on the story, I have inferred these traits from his actions, thoughts, and surroundings.
