Here is a summary of Levi Wei-lun's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Levi is a fiercely ambitious and determined individual with a strong sense of justice. Her sharp instincts and quick wit have earned her a reputation as a fearless and incisive reporter. She is not afraid to challenge powerful interests or confront difficult truths, and her dedication to telling the stories that need to be told has made her a champion of truth and justice.

**Physical Attributes:** Levi is 5'8" (173 cm) tall with long, dark brown hair that often falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are a bright, piercing green, a trait inherited from her Taiwanese heritage. She has a small nose ring and a scattering of freckles across her cheeks, which she obtained during one of her many adventures abroad.

**Interests:** Levi is passionate about storytelling, investigative journalism, and social justice. As a child, she was captivated by her grandmother's tales of resistance against the Japanese occupation, and this sparked her interest in exploring the complexities of history and its impact on contemporary society. She is also fascinated by the stories of everyday people and their struggles to make ends meet in a rapidly changing world.

In addition to her love of journalism, Levi enjoys hiking, reading, and practicing yoga. When she's not working, you can find her sipping tea at a small caf√© or exploring the bustling streets of Taipei with friends. Despite her many responsibilities as a journalist, Levi still finds time for the simple pleasures in life that bring her joy and inspiration.

It's worth noting that, since the original story doesn't provide any information on Levi's interests beyond storytelling, I've filled in some additional details to flesh out her character.
