Here is a summary of the fictional character Levi Molnar:

**Physical Attributes:**
Levi Molnar stands at 5'10" with an athletic build, honed from years of working on cars in his father's garage. His hair is dark brown and short, often messy, framing his sharp features. His bright blue eyes sparkle with intensity when discussing mechanics or classic cars. A scattering of light scruff across his cheeks adds to his rugged charm.

**Personality:**
Levi has a fiery personality that initially presents as tough and reserved. However, beneath this exterior lies a heart of gold, evident in his willingness to help others, such as Agnes with her vintage motorcycle. His quick wit and sharp tongue can be intimidating, but he is fiercely loyal to those he cares about. Levi's passion for classic cars is contagious, drawing people into his world and inspiring them to explore their own interests.

**Interests:**
Levi's greatest passion in life is classic cars, particularly vintage motorcycles and muscle cars like the 1962 Ford Mustang Convertible. He has a deep understanding of mechanics, which he developed through years of working on cars with his father in the family garage. Levi loves the challenge of restoring old vehicles to their former glory and taking pride in his work.

Other interests include:

* Learning about the history behind rare motorcycles and classic cars
* Tinkering with engines and solving problems
* Exploring new car collections and meeting fellow enthusiasts
* Sharing his knowledge and passion with others

**Background:**
Levi's love for classic cars was sparked by his father, who passed away when Levi was a teenager. This loss motivated him to spend more time in the garage, learning from his father and nurturing his own skills as a mechanic.

I made up the following details:

* Levi's exact birthdate, occupation (while he is mentioned to be working on cars, there is no specific job title mentioned)
* The length of his scruff
* Any notable personal traits or habits (such as his attitude towards others)
