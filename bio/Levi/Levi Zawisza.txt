She has a lean, athletic build honed from years of living off scraps in the prison's cramped corridors and navigating the harsh environments of Titan.

**Personality:** Levi is a cunning and resourceful individual with a reputation for being ruthless when necessary. However, beneath her tough exterior lies a fiercely intelligent and determined person who will stop at nothing to achieve her goals. She is charismatic and has an uncanny ability to manipulate those around her, making her a formidable ally or adversary.

**Interests:** As a skilled thief and escape artist, Levi's interests lie in cat burgling, infiltration, and manipulation. She enjoys studying the security systems of high-profile targets and identifying vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Her other passions include martial arts, survival skills, and navigating the darker corners of Titan's underworld.

It is worth noting that while Jax's character is not explicitly described in the passage, we know he's a skilled hacker and tech expert, which may add another layer to his interests, such as cybersecurity, hacktivism, or digital forensics.
