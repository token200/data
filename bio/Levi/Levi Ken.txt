Here is a summary of Levi Ken's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Levi Ken is a complex and multi-faceted individual, marked by both toughness and vulnerability. He has a deep-seated desire for revenge against those who took the lives of his family when he was a child, which drives him to protect the innocent and fight against injustice. Despite his fearsome reputation as a killer, Levi harbors a deep sense of loneliness and vulnerability, stemming from his solitary existence.

**Physical Attributes:** Levi Ken stands at approximately 6'1" (185 cm) tall, with an athletic yet lean build. His piercing green eyes are a striking feature, and his dark brown hair is often messy and unkempt. He has a scar above his left eyebrow, which he obtained during one of his many battles. Levi's skin is tanned from years of living in the harsh environment of Blood Requiem.

**Interests:** Levi Ken is deeply interested in martial arts and combat, with a particular focus on sword fighting. He is an expert in multiple styles, including the deadly techniques that have earned him his reputation as a merciless killer. Outside of combat, Levi has little interest in other pursuits or relationships, preferring to dedicate himself fully to his quest for justice and vengeance.

It's worth noting that these details are inspired by the character from the "Blood Requiem" world, but may not be entirely consistent with the original story.
