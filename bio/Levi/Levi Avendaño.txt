However, his personal interests or hobbies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. Considering his profession and the darkness he deals with on a daily basis, it is likely that his personal life may be somewhat solitary or centered around intense mental stimulation, such as reading or studying to further improve his detective skills.

It's also possible that Levi might have a personal connection or drive fueled by the desire for justice in cases involving social workers, given Sophia's profession and the cryptic message left on her phone.
