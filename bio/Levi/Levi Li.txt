Here is a summary of Levi Li's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Levi Li is a complex and deeply vulnerable person with an intimidating demeanor. He has a stoic exterior that hides his emotional scars and inner turmoil. Despite his tough exterior, he is haunted by guilt, fear, and uncertainty, which are fueled by past traumas and the weight of responsibility for his teammates' safety.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Piercing blue (a trait that hints at his intensity and focus)
* Body Type: Lean and athletic, with a rugged physique honed from years of intense physical training
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and piercing eyes that seem to bore into those he meets

**Interests:** Levi's interests are largely centered around his work as a member of the elite Special Operations Unit. However, beneath the surface, he has a deep love for classical music (specifically, Chopin) and plays the piano as a means of relaxation and expression. He also has a fascination with philosophy and psychology, which helps him make sense of the darkness that haunts his mind.
