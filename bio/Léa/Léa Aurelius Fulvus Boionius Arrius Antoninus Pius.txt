As a fictional character, Léa's name is a combination of Roman nomenclature traditions, with each part reflecting her family heritage. The name "Léa" is derived from the Latin name "Lucia," meaning "light," while "Aurelius" reflects her family's association with the sun god, Apollo. "Fulvus" means "fluffy-haired" or "blonde," which may have been a nod to Léa's striking blue eyes and dark hair. The additional names of "Boionius" and "Arrius" are drawn from Roman naming conventions, while "Antoninus Pius" is a testament to her dedication to the ideals of justice and fairness that guided her leadership.
