Based on the provided short story, I've created a fictional profile for Léa Hughes:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel
* Hair Color: Dark Brown

Léa's physical appearance seems to be understated yet elegant. Her height and hazel eyes give her an intelligent and introspective presence, while her dark brown hair adds warmth and depth to her features.

**Personality:**

* Léa is a complex and introspective individual, with a mix of emotions that often make her feel like she's walking on thin ice.

* Despite this resilience, Léa still struggles with feelings of shame and resentment from her past, which can sometimes overwhelm her.
* There's a deep sense of nostalgia in Léa's eyes, suggesting that she values memories and the connections they bring. She's drawn to people and places that hold significance for her.

**Interests:**

* Léa appears to have a strong connection to nature, with an affinity for the outdoors (as indicated by her ability to recognize the scent of damp earth).
* Her experiences in Ashwood have left her with a love for baking and cooking, as evident from her appreciation for Madame Dupont's bakery.
* Given her background and her struggles with shame and resentment, Léa may be drawn to creative outlets like writing or art as a way to process her emotions and heal.

**Background:**

* As mentioned in the story, Léa grew up in Ashwood as the daughter of a family that experienced significant financial difficulties.
* She's now an adult with a built new life for herself, but still grapples with the legacy of her childhood struggles.
