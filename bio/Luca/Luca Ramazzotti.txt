**Personality:** Luca is a creative and introspective person who has lost his spark after a string of unfulfilling shoots. However, as seen in his encounter with Alessandro, he is passionate about photography and the world around him. He is also a romantic at heart, as evident from his love for Rome and its beauty. Despite feeling overwhelmed by his problems, Luca remains optimistic and hopeful, as evidenced by his renewed sense of purpose after spending time with Alessandro.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Luca's height is not specified in the story, but based on the description of him standing next to the Trevi Fountain, it can be inferred that he is a bit above average height.
* Eye Color: Unfortunately, Luca's eye color is not mentioned in the story. However, given his Italian heritage and the nickname "Lupo" (meaning wolf), one might assume that his eyes are likely brown or dark blue.

**Interests:** As a photographer, Luca has a deep love for capturing beauty in everyday moments. He is passionate about telling stories through his images and is drawn to the small details that often get overlooked. Outside of photography, Luca also enjoys spending time in nature, appreciating the beauty of Rome's ancient stones and narrow alleys.
