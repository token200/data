His warm smile and friendly demeanor suggest that he is approachable and easy-going, as evidenced by his interactions with the barista at the café.

In addition to his love of photography, Luca appears to have an interest in jazz music, which is reflected in the café's atmosphere and soundtrack. He may also appreciate the arts scene in Riga, given his frequent visits to local galleries and exhibitions.
