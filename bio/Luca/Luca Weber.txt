Here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of Luca Weber:

**Personality:** Luca is a hardworking and dedicated individual who takes pride in his family's old bakery. He is fiercely loyal to his mother and father's legacy, and struggles to come to terms with the loss of his father's guidance after he passed away. Despite this, Luca is resilient and determined, willing to learn from his mistakes and work through the challenges that come with running a small business. He is also shown to be humorous and able to laugh at himself, particularly when working with his friend Sofia.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, only a few details are mentioned in the original story, but we can fill in some gaps:

* Luca's height: around 5'10" (178 cm) - this would make him slightly above average height for a German man.
* Eye color: brown eyes - this is not explicitly stated in the story, but it's a common eye color for people of German descent.

**Interests:** Based on the story, we can infer that Luca has a strong passion for baking and working with his family's bakery. He clearly values tradition and heritage, as evidenced by his desire to continue his father's legacy and keep the old recipes alive. Outside of work, it's likely that Luca enjoys spending time with his mother, exploring their hometown of Mainz, and engaging in culinary-related activities (such as experimenting with new recipes or attending food festivals).

It's also worth noting that Luca seems to have a strong connection to nature, particularly when he's working with fresh herbs brought by Sofia. This might suggest that he has an appreciation for the importance of using high-quality, locally-sourced ingredients in his baking.
