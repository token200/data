Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Luca Wei-lun:

**Physical Attributes:**
- Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
- Eye Color: Piercing green
- Hair Color: Jet-black
- Facial Features: Chiseled, with high cheekbones and a sharp jawline
- Body Type: Lean and athletic, suggesting a strong build

**Personality:**
Luca is an enigmatic figure shrouded in mystery. He appears calm, collected, and intensely focused on those around him, as if sizing them up for a specific purpose. His piercing green eyes seem to bore into others' souls, leaving few unimpressed or untouched by his presence. Despite being surrounded by whispers of his true nature – some claiming he's a psychic, mystic, god, or former soldier – Luca seems unfazed, choosing instead to hide behind a mask of detachment.

**Interests:**
- Luca is a keen observer, watching people and environments with an air of detachment.
- He enjoys whiskey, which is revealed when it's mentioned that he was sipping on a drink at a crowded bar.
- As depicted in his interaction with Yu-Ling, Luca seems to be searching for or connected to others who possess unique qualities or energies. The exact nature of this pursuit remains unclear.

While the story doesn't explicitly outline all interests beyond observation and perhaps a deeper exploration of human connections, Luca's ability to observe people like a cat moving through crowds suggests he values understanding and possibly connection, albeit on his own terms.
