**Personality:** Luca appears to be a creative and enthusiastic individual with a passion for literature. He is drawn to collaboration and working with others, as evident from his excitement about the potential project with Alex. His neutral tone when interacting with Emma suggests that he may also be introspective or reserved at times, but he is not afraid to show enthusiasm when it comes to something he cares about.
