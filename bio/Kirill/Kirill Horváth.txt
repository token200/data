**Personality:**
Kirill Horváth is a complex individual with a rich history. As a former KGB agent, he has developed a strong sense of loyalty and duty, which sometimes makes it difficult for him to let go of the past. However, after leaving the world of espionage behind, he has learned to prioritize his personal life and find peace in the quiet rhythms of librarianship. Kirill is introspective and analytical, often lost in thought as he navigates the complexities of human nature. Despite this, he remains fiercely independent and resourceful, always ready to adapt to new situations.

**Interests:**
As a librarian, Kirill has developed a deep appreciation for literature and history. He is particularly fond of rare books and manuscripts, which often transport him back to his KGB days.

He also has a passion for Eastern European cuisine, particularly traditional dishes from Hungary and Russia.

It is worth noting that as an alias, Kirill's personal life remains somewhat of a mystery. Few people know about his past life as a KGB agent, and those who do are sworn to secrecy.
