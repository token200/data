Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Kirill Szyma≈Ñski's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Kirill appears to be a complex individual with a troubled past. He has a strong sense of identity crisis as he struggles to reconcile his old life as a spy with his new one in Warsaw. He is fiercely independent and determined, which suggests that he is a resilient person who can adapt to challenging situations. At the same time, his emotional response to the revelation by Vitaly indicates that he is vulnerable and grappling with deep-seated insecurities.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Kirill's height is not specified in the story, but based on the context of the setting (Warsaw), it can be inferred that he is likely a tall, Eastern European male.
* Eye Color: The eye color is not mentioned in the text, so I will make an educated guess and assume that Kirill has dark brown or blue eyes, which are common among people from Eastern Europe.

**Interests:** As a former spy and assassin, it can be assumed that Kirill's past interests were focused on espionage and stealth. However, as he tried to leave his old life behind, his new interests might have shifted towards building a quiet life in Warsaw, possibly including:

* Learning about the history and culture of Poland
* Exploring the city and its surroundings
* Finding ways to connect with others and build meaningful relationships
* Perhaps even taking up a new hobby or interest that helps him cope with his past

Keep in mind that these are just educated guesses based on limited information. The character's interests and personality can be further developed as more context is added to the story.
