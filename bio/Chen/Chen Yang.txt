Here's a summary of Chen Yang's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Chen Yang is a man of few words, but his actions speak volumes. He is fiercely independent and resourceful, having honed these skills on the streets as a former soldier turned black market trader. His years of experience have taught him to trust no one and to rely only on himself. Despite this, he has a strong sense of justice, which motivates him to take risks and challenge those in power.

**Physical Attributes:** Chen Yang is likely around 5'9" (175 cm) tall, with a lean and athletic build that comes from his days as a soldier. His piercing brown eyes seem to hold a world of pain and regret, reflecting the harsh realities he has faced throughout his life. His dark hair is often messy and unkempt, and his sharp jawline gives him a rugged, imposing presence.

**Interests:** Chen Yang's interests are centered around survival, trade, and justice. As a black market trader, he has honed his skills in negotiation, bartering, and strategic thinking. He is always on the lookout for rare and valuable items, such as the golden pendant with supposed healing properties that sets him on this particular quest. When not trading or navigating the underworld, Chen Yang likely enjoys solitary activities like meditation, reading, or taking long walks to clear his mind.

It's worth noting that The Collector himself is not well-developed in terms of personality and interests, so we can't draw much from him beyond his sinister demeanor and obsession with rare artifacts.
