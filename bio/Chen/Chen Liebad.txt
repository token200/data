**Personality:**

* Despite his reserved nature, he has a strong sense of justice and will fiercely protect those he cares about.

**Background:**

Unfortunately, I don't have enough information about Chen Liebad's background or world to provide a more detailed description. If you'd like, we could explore his history together through the process of storytelling!

Would you like me to generate a new story based on this character profile?
