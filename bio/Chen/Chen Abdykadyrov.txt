Based on the inspiration from the story about Aykayev, I've created a fictional character profile for Chen Abdykadyrov:

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Deep blue, almost indigo
* Hair Color: Dark brown with subtle hints of auburn, often worn in a short, neatly styled beard

**Personality:**

Chen Abdykadyrov is a introspective and thoughtful individual, with a strong sense of loyalty to his family and community. He is deeply rooted in his Kazakh heritage and is passionate about preserving traditional practices and customs. Chen has a dry sense of humor and can come across as reserved or aloof to those who don't know him, but once you gain his trust, he is fiercely loyal and will go to great lengths to support those he cares about.

**Interests:**

Chen is an avid reader, particularly when it comes to the history and literature of Central Asia. He enjoys spending time outdoors, whether it's hiking in the mountains or practicing traditional Kazakh archery. Chen is also a skilled musician, often playing the traditional Kazakh instrument, the tanpura.

**Background:**

Chen Abdykadyrov grew up in a small village in Kazakhstan, where he was raised by his family to respect and honor their heritage. After completing his education, he moved to the city for work, but eventually returned to his village after feeling unfulfilled and disconnected from his roots. Now, Chen is determined to rebuild his life and reconnect with the traditions that have been passed down through generations.

**Goals:**

Chen's primary goal is to revitalize the traditional Kazakh practices and customs in his community, while also finding a sense of purpose and belonging. He hopes to one day establish a cultural center or museum to showcase the rich history and heritage of Central Asia, and to share his knowledge with others who are interested.

**Quirks:**

Chen has a habit of wearing traditional Kazakh clothing on special occasions, even if it's not entirely comfortable. He is also a bit of a tea enthusiast, often brewing strong cups for himself and those he trusts.
