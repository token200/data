Chen Hébert is 5'8" (173 cm) tall with an athletic build. Their hair is dark brown and wavy, often worn in a messy, piecey style. Their eyes are a striking shade of indigo, almost purple, which seem to sparkle with curiosity. Chen's skin has a warm, golden undertone from spending time outdoors.

**Personality:**
Chen is an adventurous and free-spirited individual with a passion for exploration and discovery. They have a quick wit and a sharp mind, often approaching problems from unexpected angles. Chen is fiercely independent but values loyalty and friendship deeply. They have a strong sense of justice and will not hesitate to stand up for what they believe in.

**Interests:**
Chen has a love for hiking, rock climbing, and exploring new outdoor destinations. They are also an avid reader and collector of rare books on history, philosophy, and science. In their free time, Chen enjoys practicing martial arts and playing the guitar. They have a particular fascination with ancient cultures and mysticism, often finding themselves drawn to mysterious artifacts and unexplained phenomena.

Feel free to use this character in your own story or provide more context so I can tailor the information to suit your needs!
