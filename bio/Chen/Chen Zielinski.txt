* Quantum physics and its applications
* Parallel universes and multiverse theory
* The behavior of quantum particles and their properties
* Scientific research and experimentation
* Reading scientific papers and attending conferences
* Hiking and nature exploration (she still finds time to visit the woods near her home, where she spent many hours as a child)

**Additional Details:** Chen Zielinski has a quiet sense of humor and can often be found smiling wryly when discussing the absurdities of science. She is fiercely independent and values her alone time, but will occasionally share her insights with those who earn her trust.
