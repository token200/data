**Personality:**

Damian is a complex and multifaceted individual, with a tough exterior that hides a soft spot for those in need. He has a natural charisma and leadership quality that served him well in his gang days, but he has also developed a strong sense of vulnerability and empathy as he's navigated his new life outside the gang. Damian is fiercely independent and non-conformist, always striving to do things his own way and avoid authority whenever possible.

However, he is also deeply loyal to those he cares about, particularly Max, his trusty sidekick. He has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic at times, but deep down, he's a romantic who values authenticity and kindness above all else.

* Philosophy and personal growth

Despite his tough exterior, Damian has a deep desire to create something meaningful with his life. He's drawn to the idea of leaving a lasting legacy that goes beyond just fixing cars or making money. The mural he created is a testament to this desire, and it brings him a sense of fulfillment and purpose that he's never known before.
