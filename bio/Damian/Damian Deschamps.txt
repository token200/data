**Interests:** Damian is a photographer at heart, with a passion that borders on obsession. He spends most of his days wandering the streets of Montmartre, camera slung over his shoulder, searching for the next great shot. In addition to photography, Damian has a deep appreciation for French culture and history, which often influences his work. He's particularly drawn to the works of Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Capa, who inspired him to pursue his own path as a street photographer.

In his quieter moments, Damian can be found sketching or reading books on philosophy and psychology, seeking to deepen his understanding of human nature and behavior. Above all, he's driven by a desire to capture life itself – in all its beauty, complexity, and nuance – through the lens of his camera.
