**Personality:**

* Damian is known for his quick wit, sharp tongue, and charming demeanor. He has an effortless air of confidence that draws people to him.
* Despite his polished exterior, Damian struggles with feelings of inadequacy and insecurity stemming from being overshadowed by his family's name.
