Based on the character of Damian Alcudia Corberó, also known as Mateo Peña from the Netflix series "Sex Education", I'll create a summary of his personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Mateo is a sensitive and artistic individual who struggles with self-acceptance. He has a dry sense of humor and can come across as sarcastic or awkward in social situations. However, he is also deeply empathetic and caring, often finding himself caught between his own desires and the needs of those around him.

**Physical Attributes:** Mateo Corberó is approximately 5'10" (178 cm) tall with a slender build. His hair is dark brown and messy, often falling across his forehead in a way that makes him look perpetually disheveled. His eyes are a deep brown color, often filled with a mixture of emotion and intensity.

**Interests:** Mateo is passionate about music, photography, and art. He spends much of his free time expressing himself through these creative outlets, often using them as a means of coping with the challenges of high school life. He is also an avid reader, devouring books on various subjects including philosophy, psychology, and literature.

In addition to these interests, Mateo has a deep love for 90s music and fashion, which often influences his style and attitude. Despite his struggles with self-acceptance, he has a strong sense of identity and is determined to stay true to himself amidst the pressures of high school life.
