Here is a summary of Amelie Totti's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Amelie is a free-spirited and artistic individual with a carefree demeanor. However, beneath her quirky exterior lies a complex and sensitive soul who has been haunted by a past tragedy. She is introverted and withdrawn, often shutting herself away in her studio apartment to cope with her emotions. Despite this, she has a deep capacity for love and connection, which she slowly reveals to those closest to her.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: Amelie stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with a slender yet athletic build.
* Hair: Her signature wild mane of curly brown hair falls down her back in loose waves, often framing her heart-shaped face.
* Eyes: Although the story doesn't explicitly state her eye color, it's mentioned that Marco notices her bright blue eyes sparkling like the stars on a clear night. Assuming she shares the same eye color as Marco, Amelie likely has piercing blue eyes that seem to sparkle with creativity and emotion.

**Interests:** As an artist, Amelie is passionate about sketching and capturing the beauty of Rome's ancient architecture through her art. She finds solace in losing herself in her creations and exploring the city's hidden corners. Her love for art serves as a form of therapy, allowing her to process her emotions and find healing.

In addition to her artistic pursuits, Amelie is also drawn to cooking and sharing meals with others. Marco's passion for cooking brings out her own enthusiasm for trying new recipes and flavors, and she finds joy in the simple act of savoring a delicious meal with someone special.

As Amelie navigates her feelings for Marco, she begins to rediscover her love for life, art, and connection â€“ finding beauty in the broken pieces of her past and embracing the hope that a new beginning brings.
