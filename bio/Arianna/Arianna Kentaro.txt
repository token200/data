Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Arianna Kentaro's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Arianna appears to be a introspective and emotional person. She has a tendency to keep her emotions at bay, often using habits like swirling her hair around her face to cope with her feelings. However, when she allows herself to feel, she can experience a deep sense of longing, grief, and acceptance. This suggests that she is someone who wears their heart on their sleeve, but may also struggle to express themselves openly.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'7" (170 cm)
* Eye Color: Brown with golden flecks, a trait inherited from her Japanese-American mother.
* Hair Color and Style: Long, dark hair that swirls around her face when she's stressed or anxious.
* Skin Tone: Possibly lighter than average, as mentioned in the passage where it's described that Arianna is "Japanese-American."

**Interests:** It can be inferred that Arianna values introspection, self-discovery, and emotional connection. She seems to be someone who finds comfort in solitude and quiet contemplation. Her return to her childhood home suggests a strong sense of nostalgia and a desire to reconnect with her past.

Additionally, it's possible that Arianna is drawn to learning and personal growth. The mention of an old Victorian house filled with dusty books implies that she may have a love for reading or literature.
