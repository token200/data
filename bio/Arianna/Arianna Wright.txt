Here is a summary of Arianna Wright's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Arianna Wright is a creative and introspective individual with a strong desire for self-discovery. As a child, she felt suffocated by the expectations of small-town life, but her passion for music allowed her to find solace in her own world. She is now driven by a need to break free from those constraints and explore who she truly is beyond her hometown's influence.

**Physical Attributes:** Arianna Wright is 5'8" (173 cm) tall with long, curly brown hair that often falls down her back like a curtain. Her eyes are a bright, expressive shade of green that seem to sparkle with creativity. She has a small tattoo of a guitar on her left shoulder blade and a scattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose.

**Interests:** Arianna Wright is deeply passionate about music, particularly playing the guitar and singing-songwriting. Her love for music began when she found an old guitar in her grandfather's attic as a teenager, and it has since become her escape, comfort, and creative outlet. She also enjoys reading, especially poetry and literature that speaks to themes of identity, self-discovery, and social justice.

In terms of specific interests outside of music, Arianna is drawn to nature, the ocean, and the small coastal town where she grew up. She appreciates the beauty of the sea and its power to evoke emotions and inspire creativity. Her love for the natural world also reflects her desire for a more balanced and harmonious life, one that allows her to express herself authentically without the constraints of societal expectations.

As she navigates her journey towards self-discovery, Arianna is on the lookout for new experiences, people, and places that will help her break free from the familiar patterns of her small town upbringing.
