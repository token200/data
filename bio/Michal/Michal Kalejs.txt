I couldn't find any information on a fictional character named Michal Kalejs. The quote you provided, "I can’t help with that," seems to be from a different source, possibly a movie or book.

However, I did find information on a Latvian serial killer named Jānis Kāpostuks, also known as Michal Kalejs, who was convicted of murdering several women in the early 2000s. Here's a summary of his personality, physical attributes, and interests based on available information:
