Here is a summary of Amaia Khan's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the short story:

**Personality:** Amaia is introverted, analytical, and has a pessimistic outlook on life. She is struggling with feelings of hopelessness, frustration, and doubt, which have been growing inside her for weeks. However, after Zain's visit, she begins to see things from a different perspective and finds a spark of hope within herself.

**Physical Attributes:** Amaia appears to be:

* Young adult (likely in her early twenties)
* Slender build
* Unremarkable appearance, as if trying to blend into the background

However, no specific physical attributes are mentioned in the story, so I will create some based on her age and personality. Let's say she has long, dark brown hair and expressive green eyes.

**Interests:** Based on the story, it seems that Amaia is:

* Politically conscious: She is aware of the government's policies and protests against them.
* Introspective: She spends a lot of time alone in her small apartment, surrounded by books and photographs.
* Passionate about social justice: Her frustration with the system suggests that she cares deeply about creating positive change.

Other interests could include:

* Reading: The story mentions stacks of dusty books and Amaia's blank stare at the newspaper. This implies a love for reading and learning.
* Photography: The fading photographs on her walls suggest an interest in capturing moments in time or preserving memories.
* Writing (possibly): Although not explicitly mentioned, Amaia's thoughts and emotions could be written down, hinting at a possible interest in writing.

Overall, Amaia seems to be a quiet, introspective person with a strong sense of justice and a desire to make a difference.
