**Personality:** Amaia is a driven and determined individual with a strong sense of curiosity and passion for discovery. She is fiercely independent and has a strong will, which allows her to make tough decisions and stand by what she believes in. Her dedication to her work is unwavering, and she is willing to take risks to uncover the truth. Amaia also possesses a deep sense of connection to her family's legacy and heritage, which motivates her to continue their work and honor their memory.

**Physical Attributes:** 

* Height: 5'9" (175 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel with golden flecks
* Hair Color: Dark brown, often styled in a neat bob that frames her heart-shaped face
* Skin Tone: Olive, indicating a mix of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern ancestry

**Interests:** Amaia is deeply passionate about archaeology, history, and cultural preservation. She has a special interest in studying ancient civilizations, particularly those with previously unknown or underappreciated contributions to human knowledge. Outside of her work, Amaia enjoys reading historical texts, practicing yoga, and exploring the outdoors.

In addition to these attributes, Amaia also possesses a sense of humility and compassion for those who may not have had access to the same opportunities as she did. Her dedication to making history accessible to everyone is evident in her refusal to sell or display the artifacts from her latest discovery.

It's worth noting that the story doesn't explicitly mention Amaia's specific interests beyond archaeology, but based on the context and the passion with which she approaches her work, it can be inferred that she has a broader interest in history, cultural preservation, and education.
