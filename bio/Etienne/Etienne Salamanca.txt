Based on the short story, here is a summary of the personality, physical attributes, and interests of the fictional character Etienne "Patsy" Salamanca:

**Physical Attributes:**
Etienne stands at around 5'9" with a lean and agile build. His eyes are a piercing brown color that seems to bore into those he meets, conveying an air of intensity and calculation. His hair is dark and unkempt, often appearing disheveled as if he has just rolled out of bed. A sharp jawline and prominent nose give him a chiseled appearance that belies his cunning nature.

**Personality:**
Etienne is a master manipulator with a quick wit and an air of confidence that borders on arrogance. He is driven by self-preservation and always seems to be one step ahead of those around him. Despite this, he has a dry sense of humor and can come across as detached or aloof, which can sometimes make it difficult for others to read his intentions. His past experiences have taught him to be constantly vigilant and to never trust anyone too easily.

**Interests:**
Etienne's interests are largely centered around his own survival and success in the world of organized crime. He is a pragmatist who sees alliances and relationships as mere tools to be used for his benefit, rather than emotional connections. He is fiercely independent and values his freedom above all else. In his free time (which is rare), Etienne might enjoy a good whiskey or a game of cards with acquaintances he can trust.

Overall, Etienne "Patsy" Salamanca is a complex and enigmatic figure whose true loyalties and motivations are impossible to discern. His ability to navigate the treacherous landscape of organized crime and come out on top has earned him a reputation as one of the most cunning players in the game.
