Based on the provided short story, here's a summary of Etienne Liepina's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Etienne appears to be determined and driven. He is willing to spend weeks searching for his long-lost cousin, Jacques, and will even go alone to meet someone with information about his whereabouts at midnight. This suggests that he is a strong-willed individual who values family ties and is not afraid to take risks to find what he's looking for.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, the story doesn't provide much information about Etienne's physical appearance, except for one detail: he has brown eyes (since the caf√© where he waits is "dimly lit"). Let's fill in some gaps:

* Height: 6'1" - This would give him a slightly above-average height, which might be noticeable in a crowded city like Paris.
* Hair Color: Dark Brown - Given his rural upbringing on a farm, it's likely that Etienne has dark brown hair, possibly with a hint of red or auburn undertones.
* Eye Color (in addition to the mentioned brown): These are actually blue eyes. This would give him a more striking contrast with his dark hair.

**Interests:** Given his search for Jacques and his desire to reconnect with his family, it's likely that Etienne values:

1. Family: He is deeply committed to finding his long-lost cousin and understanding the circumstances surrounding their separation.
2. Exploration: As someone who is willing to spend weeks searching for information and now plans to meet at the Eiffel Tower, Etienne seems to enjoy exploring new places and uncovering secrets.
3. Connection: His text to an old friend in Paris suggests that he values staying connected with people from his past, particularly those with knowledge about Jacques' whereabouts.

Overall, Etienne appears to be a driven and determined individual who values family ties and is willing to take risks to reconnect with the people important to him.
