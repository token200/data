Here is a summary of Etienne Sten's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Etienne Sten is an enigmatic and introverted individual with a dry sense of humor. He has a strong sense of self-assurance and confidence in his art, which can sometimes be misinterpreted as arrogance. Despite this, he has a deep sense of vulnerability and sensitivity, particularly when it comes to his personal life and the emotions that drive his creative work.

**Physical Attributes:** Etienne Sten stands at 6'2" (188 cm) with an athletic yet lean build. His hair is dark brown and messy, often falling across his forehead in a way that adds to his air of mystery. His eyes are an intense shade of blue, almost grey, which seems to bore into those he looks at. He has a sharp jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, giving him a slightly rugged appearance.

**Interests:** Etienne Sten is deeply interested in exploring the darker aspects of human nature through his art. His work often delves into themes of existentialism, mortality, and the complexities of human emotions. He is also fascinated by the psychological effects of isolation and confinement on the human mind, which is reflected in many of his installations.

In addition to his artistic pursuits, Etienne Sten has a passion for old literature, particularly 19th-century French writers such as Baudelaire and Verlaine. He is also an avid collector of antique mirrors, which often serve as inspiration for his work.

Etienne Sten's interests are centered around exploring the boundaries between art and life, pushing the limits of what is acceptable in public discourse, and challenging himself (and others) to confront the complexities of human nature.
