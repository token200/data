Here is a summary of Mikołaj Hao's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:** Mikołaj stands at 5'10" (178 cm) with piercing blue eyes that seem to gleam with mischief. His dark brown hair is often unkempt, and his sharp jawline is accentuated by a scruffy beard. He has a lean build from years of physical activity and agility, honed from his life as a thief.

**Personality:** Mikołaj is an enigmatic figure, shrouded in mystery and intrigue, just like the world he inhabits. He is highly intelligent and resourceful, with a quick wit and a silver tongue that has helped him talk his way out of countless tight spots. Despite his cunning nature, there is a vulnerable side to Mikołaj, one that he keeps hidden from the world.

**Interests:** Mikołaj's passion for art began as a child, when his parents would take him to visit the museums and galleries of Warsaw. He has always been fascinated by the works of the Renaissance masters, particularly Jan Matejko's "The Battle of Grunwald," which he had the misfortune of attempting to steal. Mikołaj is also drawn to the thrill of the chase, the rush of adrenaline that comes with outsmarting his marks and pulling off a daring heist.

As he grew older, Mikołaj's interests expanded to include forgery techniques and art history, which he uses to create elaborate forgeries of priceless works. He has a deep respect for artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, who pushed the boundaries of what was possible with their craft.

Despite his love of art and thievery, Mikołaj is torn by the question of whether he is an artist or a thief. Is he using his talents to create masterpieces that bring joy to people's lives, or is he simply passing off others' work as his own? This inner conflict drives him to seek out Helena's guidance and join forces with her secret organization, one that aims to use the skills of forgers like Mikołaj for good rather than personal gain.
