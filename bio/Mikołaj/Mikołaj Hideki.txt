Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of the fictional character Mikołaj Hideki's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Physical Attributes:**
Mikołaj Hideki stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) with an slender yet athletic build. His hair is jet black, often styled in a simple, effortless manner that accentuates his striking features. His eyes are an unnerving shade of indigo, almost purplish, which seems to draw people in and intrigue them. He has a scattering of light freckles across the bridge of his nose, adding a touch of whimsy to his otherwise enigmatic presence.

**Personality:**
Mikołaj Hideki is a deeply introverted and reserved individual, preferring the comfort of his own thoughts over social interactions. This quiet nature can be misinterpreted as aloofness or detachment, but in reality, he is simply a creative soul who finds solace in the world of art. His reclusive nature is not a choice, but rather a result of his introspective personality and the turmoil that often brews within him. Despite this, there is an undercurrent of intensity and passion beneath his reserved exterior, which is reflected in his art.

**Interests:**
Mikołaj Hideki's primary interest lies in the world of art itself – specifically, traditional Japanese motifs and modern abstract elements. He finds solace in the night, often working on his sketches under streetlamp light, where he can lose himself in the creative process. His fascination with art is not merely a hobby, but an all-consuming passion that drives him to create works of unparalleled beauty and emotional depth.
