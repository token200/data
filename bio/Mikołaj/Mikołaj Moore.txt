Here is a summary of the fictional character Mikołaj Moore:

Physical Attributes: 
Mikołaj Moore is described as having a long frame, which suggests that he stands at an above-average height. Unfortunately, his height is not explicitly stated in the story, but based on the description of his "long frame", I would estimate him to be around 6'2"-6'4" (188-193 cm). His messy brown hair and eye color are also mentioned in the story.

Personality: 
Mikołaj seems to be a driven and determined individual. He is not easily swayed by people's opinions and trusts others very cautiously, as evident from his wariness of the townsfolk. However, he is also shown to be open-minded and curious, as demonstrated by his interest in local legends and folklore.

Interests: 
As a historian specializing in Eastern European folklore, Mikołaj has a deep fascination with myths and legends, particularly those related to witches and supernatural powers. His particular interest in the hidden society of witches living just beyond Ravenswood suggests that he is passionate about uncovering hidden truths and understanding the complexities of human culture.

Additional Details: 
While not explicitly stated in the story, I can add some additional details based on Mikołaj's character:

* Age: Late 20s to early 30s (not specified in the story)
* Education: Master's degree or Ph.D. in history with a specialization in Eastern European folklore
* Personality traits: analytical, reserved, and fiercely independent

Overall, Mikołaj Moore appears to be a sharp-witted and resourceful individual driven by his passion for discovery and understanding the mysteries of human culture.
