However, beneath his reserved exterior lies a deep empathetic nature that allows him to connect with people on a deeper level.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 6'2" (188 cm)
* Eye Color: Hazel
* Hair Color: Dark brown
* Build: Lean and athletic, suggesting a background in physical activity.
* Facial Features: Strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and piercing hazel eyes that seem to see right through you.

**Interests:** As a detective, Mikołaj Dolera is naturally interested in solving mysteries and uncovering hidden truths. He has a keen mind for observation and analysis, which serves him well in his line of work. Outside of his profession, he seems to enjoy quiet moments of contemplation and is drawn to the beauty of nature, particularly in rural settings like Czerniewo.
