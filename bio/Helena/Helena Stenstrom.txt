Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Helena Stenstrom's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Helena appears to be determined, driven, and fiercely intelligent. She is also shown to be humble and open to criticism, as evidenced by her biting back her retort when Professor Elwes questions her understanding of necromancy. Despite feeling frustrated with herself, she remains focused on mastering the dark arts.

**Physical Attributes:** Helena's physical appearance is not extensively described in the story, but based on the context, we can make some educated guesses:

* Height: It is likely that Helena is a relatively tall individual, as Professor Elwes mentions her sitting beside him without comment. This could put her at around 5'9" to 6'1".
* Eye Color: The text describes Professor Elwes's eyes as "piercing," which suggests that Helena may have striking or intense eyes as well. Given the dark and mystical nature of her pursuits, it is possible that her eye color is a deep, rich brown or even blue.
* Other Physical Attributes: There is no description of Helena's hair, skin tone, or build in the story. However, given her age and academic background (she is studying under a professor), it is likely that she has a slender yet athletic build.

**Interests:** As mentioned in the story, Helena is deeply interested in necromancy and the ethics of binding spirits. She also appears to have a passion for learning and a desire to master the dark arts, as evidenced by her willingness to pour over ancient texts and practice spells late into the night.
