Here's a summary of Helena Eglite's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Helena Eglite is a complex individual with a tough exterior that hides a heart of gold. She has a razor-sharp wit and is confident in her abilities, which often leads her to take risks. However, she also has a vulnerable side that she only reveals to those closest to her. Despite her questionable past as a skilled thief, Helena is capable of forming deep connections with others, particularly Sophia.

**Physical Attributes:** Helena stands at 5'8" (173 cm) tall, with an athletic yet toned build from years of physical activity on the streets. Her hair is dark brown and shoulder-length, often worn in a messy bun. Her eyes are an striking feature - they are a deep shade of blue that seem almost grayish in certain lighting conditions. This color, however, was mentioned to be green.

**Interests:** Helena has a passion for art and music, which she discovered through her friendship with Sophia. She finds solace in the creative world, where she can express herself freely without fear of judgment. Her love for art and music is likely rooted in her desire for self-expression and her need for emotional release. Prior to her friendship with Sophia, Helena's interests were more focused on self-preservation and survival, as a skilled thief, but after meeting Sophia her interests began to shift towards a new way of life.

It seems that Helena Eglite was originally described with the eye color as gray, however since green was mentioned in the story for her friend, and Helena is being compared to this description.
