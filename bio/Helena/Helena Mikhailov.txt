Here's a summary of Helena Mikhailov's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Helena is a determined and analytical individual with a strong sense of justice. She has a no-nonsense attitude and is not afraid to take risks when pursuing a case. Despite her tough exterior, she has a compassionate side, particularly when dealing with victims or those who have been wronged by the system. Her years of experience as a detective have also given her a sharp instinct for reading people and situations, making her a formidable investigator.

**Physical Attributes:** Helena stands at 5'8" (173 cm) with a lean and athletic build, honed from years of physical activity. Her eyes are a deep shade of brown that seem to bore into those she interviews or interrogates. Her dark hair is often pulled back into a tight ponytail, revealing sharp facial features and high cheekbones. She has a small tattoo of a snake coiled around her right wrist, which she obtained during a particularly difficult case several years ago.

**Interests:** Helena's interests are centered around her work as a detective, but outside of the office, she is an avid reader and collector of rare books on history and philosophy. She is particularly fascinated by 19th-century Russian literature and often finds solace in the works of Dostoevsky or Tolstoy when dealing with particularly complex cases. In her free time, Helena enjoys practicing yoga and meditation to clear her mind and stay focused.
