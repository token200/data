Here's a summary of the fictional character Helena Jankowska:

**Physical Attributes:** Helena is a woman in her mid-to-late 30s, with an unassuming yet striking presence. She stands at approximately 5'6" (168 cm) tall and has long, dark brown hair that falls down her back like a waterfall. Her eyes are a deep shade of brown, almost espresso-colored, which seem to hold a world of emotion behind them. Her features are delicate yet strong, with high cheekbones, a small nose, and full lips that curve into a perpetual smile.

**Personality:** Helena is a complex and multi-layered individual, with a personality that's both vulnerable and resilient. She's a natural people person, with a quick wit and an infectious laugh that puts everyone at ease. However, beneath her charming exterior lies a woman who's been hurt and has built walls to protect herself from further pain. Despite this, she's fiercely loyal and protective of those she cares about, often putting others before herself.

**Interests:** Helena is a creative soul, with a deep love for writing, baking, and music. As a child in Poland, she would spend hours listening to her mother's stories and helping with the family bakery, where she developed a passion for traditional Polish recipes and desserts. When she arrived in New York City, she poured her heart into building a life of her own, working tirelessly at the bakery and slowly rebuilding her dreams. As she began writing again with Max's support, Helena discovered a new sense of purpose and creative expression. She's also drawn to art, particularly the works of artists who explore themes of identity, trauma, and resilience.

**Background:** Helena is a Polish immigrant who arrived in New York City with little more than a suitcase full of dreams and determination. She worked hard to build a life for herself, pouring her heart and soul into the family-owned bakery on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Despite her success, she struggled to reconcile her past and present selves, hiding secrets and scars that only Max's love and support helped her confront.
