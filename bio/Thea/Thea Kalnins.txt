**Personality:** Thea Kalnins appears to be a confident, sharp-witted, and fiercely independent individual. She has a strong sense of determination and a knack for getting to the bottom of complex cases. Her private investigator skills have honed her instincts, making her highly attuned to subtle details that others might miss.

As evidenced by the moment of recognition with the figure on the rooftop, Thea seems to be driven by more than just professional curiosity. There's a hint of vulnerability beneath her tough exterior, suggesting that she has been hurt or betrayed in the past, which fuels her determination to uncover the truth.

Her dark hair is likely cut in a practical style for her line of work, possibly reaching down to her shoulders or chin.

Outside of her work, Thea may have interests related to urban exploration, forensic analysis, or hacking (given her apparent familiarity with the city's underbelly). Her sharp intellect and resourcefulness might also lead her to collect rare artifacts or rare books on various subjects, possibly as a way to unwind or expand her knowledge.

It's worth noting that Thea's connection to the mysterious figure on the rooftop implies that she may have secrets of her own, potentially related to her past or identity. This could be an intriguing aspect of her character to explore further in future stories.
