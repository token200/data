Here is a summary of Thea Nieminen's personality, physical attributes, and interests based on the provided short story:

**Personality:** Thea is a creative and imaginative individual with a fascination for the darker side of life. She is drawn to the gritty realism of urban fiction and poetry, which likely stems from her upbringing in a small town surrounded by nature. Despite her passion for writing, she remains humble and true to her roots. Her connection to the land and its people fuels her creativity, and she has a keen eye for uncovering hidden stories and forgotten histories.

**Physical Attributes:** Unfortunately, no physical attributes were mentioned in the original story, so I'll make some educated guesses:

* Age: 25 (as stated in the story)
* Height: Thea's height is not specified, but based on the description of her sitting at a caf√©, it's likely that she stands around 5'6" to 5'8" (168-173 cm), which would be average for a Finnish woman.
* Eye Color: Dark brown or hazel eyes are often associated with Finns, so I'll assume Thea has one of these eye colors.

**Interests:** As mentioned in the story:

* Writing (specifically urban fiction and poetry)
* Finnish folklore and fairy tales
* Urban exploration and observing hidden stories
* Researching forgotten histories

In addition to these interests, it's likely that Thea is also drawn to:

* Nature and the outdoors, as she spent her childhood in a small town surrounded by forests
* Spirituality or mysticism, given her connection to ancient mythology and the sense of power she feels when reading the black leather tome
