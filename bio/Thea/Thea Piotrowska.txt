Based on the inspiration from the short story, here is a summary of Thea Piotrowska's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Thea Piotrowska is a determined and sharp-minded individual. As the lead detective at Scotland Yard, she has seen it all and remains unaffected by the gruesome cases she investigates. Her experience has given her a sense of confidence and authority, but also a hint of introversion, which makes her observe rather than dominate conversations. Despite this, she has a natural ability to connect with people, especially those who are hesitant to speak up.

**Physical Attributes:**

* **Height:** Thea stands at 5'8" (173 cm), an athletic build honed from years of working out in the chaos of her job.
* **Eye Color:** Her piercing green eyes seem to bore into those she questions, as if searching for hidden truths.
* **Hair:** Her dark brown hair is often pulled back into a tight ponytail, revealing a determined jawline.

**Interests:**

* Thea's passion lies in solving complex cases that involve deception and corruption. She has an uncanny ability to unravel the threads of seemingly intricate puzzles.
* Outside of work, she enjoys reading crime fiction novels and taking long walks along the Thames River, where she reflects on her cases and thinks through new strategies.
* Thea is also a skilled martial artist, having trained in various disciplines during her university days. She finds that this discipline helps her stay focused and calm under pressure.

Despite her tough exterior, Thea has a deep sense of empathy for those who have been wronged by the system or are trapped in situations they can't escape. Her drive to uncover the truth is motivated by a desire to bring justice to victims and their families, even if it means navigating treacherous waters herself.
