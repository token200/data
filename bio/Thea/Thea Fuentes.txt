Based on the short story, here is a summary of Thea Fuentes' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:**
Thea appears to be a creative and introspective person who values self-expression and individuality. She has a strong sense of determination and purpose, as evident from her unwavering dedication to her art. Despite being exhausted and overwhelmed by the demands of social interactions (as seen when she was tempted to join her friends for a night out), Thea is able to put on a brave face and mask her true feelings. She seems to be someone who can be emotionally reserved, but once she finds something that resonates with her, she becomes fully invested and passionate about it.

**Physical Attributes:**
Unfortunately, the text does not provide explicit information about Thea's physical attributes, such as her height or eye color. However, based on the writing style and descriptive language used in the story, I will make some educated guesses:

* Height: 5'8" (172 cm) - This is a plausible height for an adult woman, given the context of the story.
* Eye Color: Hazel or Brown - The writer's use of warm and muted color descriptions (e.g., "turpentine and paint") suggests that Thea might have hazel or brown eyes.

**Interests:**
Thea's primary interest is her art. She finds solace and inspiration in the creative process, using her emotions as a guide to shape her brushstrokes and colors. Her love of art is not just a hobby but an integral part of who she is. She values independence, individuality, and self-expression, which are all reflected in her artistic pursuits.

Additional insights:

* Thea's personality traits suggest that she might be an introvert or someone who prefers quieter, more low-key environments.
* Her creativity and passion for art may indicate a strong connection to her emotions and the world around her.
* Thea's relationship with Rachel, her roommate, implies that she values close relationships and may have supportive friendships in her life.
