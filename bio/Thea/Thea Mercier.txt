Based on the provided short story, here is a summary of Thea Mercier's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Thea Mercier appears to be a complex and introspective individual, struggling with moral dilemmas and questioning her purpose within the League of Shadows. She is driven by a sense of duty and loyalty, but also has a strong desire for self-discovery and growth. Her experiences have made her resourceful, intelligent, and skilled in stealth and deception. However, she also seems to be grappling with feelings of guilt and doubt, suggesting that she may be more emotionally vulnerable than initially apparent.

**Physical Attributes:** 

* Height: Thea's height is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the context and the League's members being portrayed as suave and sophisticated assassins, it can be inferred that she stands at around 5'8"-6'2", allowing her to blend into shadows while maintaining an intimidating presence.
* Eye Color: The story doesn't specify Thea's eye color, but considering her association with darkness and the League of Shadows, a striking contrast could hint at piercing green or amber eyes.

**Interests:** It is clear that Thea is deeply invested in her work as a member of the League of Shadows. Her experiences have led to an affinity for stealth, deception, and strategic planning. Outside of her duties, it seems she finds solace in observing nature (specifically, the moonlit sky), which might indicate an artistic or contemplative side to her personality.

Keep in mind that since this is a fictional character based on a single passage, additional insights can be drawn by considering her role within the League and how her relationships with other characters contribute to our understanding of her.
