However, beneath this exterior lies a deep-seated need for connection and purpose.

Despite her tough exterior, she has a soft spot for those in need and is fiercely empathetic.

* Eye Color: Bright blue

**Interests:** Thea's interests are diverse and reflect her passion for living life on her own terms. She enjoys:

* Exploring abandoned buildings and attending underground raves (although she's starting to find more meaningful ways to channel this energy into positive change)
* Volunteering at local charities and community organizations, where she can use her charisma to inspire positive change
* Supporting local causes and advocating for social justice
* Spending time in nature and finding solace in the outdoors
* Learning new skills and taking risks (although she's starting to prioritize personal growth over thrill-seeking)

It's worth noting that Thea is still figuring out who she is and what she wants to achieve in life. She's at a crossroads, having found a new sense of purpose with Sophie by her side.
