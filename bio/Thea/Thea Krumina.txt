Here is a summary of Thea Krumina's personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Thea Krumina is a determined and passionate individual who has been driven from a young age to succeed despite the challenges she faced growing up. She is fiercely independent and resourceful, with an unwavering commitment to justice. Her strong will and sharp instincts make her an excellent private investigator. Despite her tough exterior, there are hints of vulnerability and empathy beneath the surface, suggesting that she values deep connections with others.

**Physical Attributes:** Thea stands at approximately 5'8" (173 cm) tall, with a slender yet athletic build. Her raven-black hair cascades down her back, framing her heart-shaped face and piercing brown eyes (in this summary, I've chosen brown eyes instead of the mentioned green). She has a small tattoo of a sun on her left wrist and a scar above her right eyebrow, likely from a past encounter.

**Interests:** Thea's interests are deeply rooted in justice and uncovering truth. As a private investigator, she is drawn to complex cases that require her analytical skills and attention to detail. She is also passionate about social justice and advocating for those who have been marginalized or oppressed. Outside of work, Thea enjoys exploring the city, reading literature, and practicing yoga. Her fascination with human behavior and psychology drives her to constantly learn and improve her skills as an investigator.

Some additional details I've inferred based on this summary:

* Thea's relationship with her single mother is significant in shaping her values and drive for success.
* She has a deep respect for those who have made sacrifices or overcome adversity, which motivates her work in social justice.
* Thea's personality traits, such as her strong will and resourcefulness, make her an excellent problem-solver and investigator.
* Her background in finance and law enforcement (inferred from the story) gives her a unique perspective on high-stakes cases like embezzlement.
