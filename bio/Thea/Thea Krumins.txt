Based on the short story, here's a summary of Thea Krumins' personality, physical attributes, and interests:

**Personality:** Thea Krumins is a thrill-seeker with a penchant for adventure and a willingness to take risks. She's always been drawn to the unknown and the unpredictable, which led her to discover the ancient artifact that changed her life forever. However, this trait also makes her impulsive and reckless at times, leading her to neglect her own well-being in pursuit of excitement.

Despite her newfound powers, Thea struggles with self-control and moderation. She's constantly torn between embracing her new abilities and trying to maintain a sense of humanity. This inner conflict leaves her feeling isolated and uncertain about her future.

**Physical Attributes:**

* Height: 5'8" (173 cm)
* Eye Color: Glowing indigo-blue, which seems to shift depending on the light
* Skin Tone: A deep shade of indigo that's almost purplish in certain areas
* Body Type: Thea's body has undergone significant changes due to the Devourer's Heart. Her limbs have elongated, allowing her to twist and contort in ways that were previously impossible.

**Interests:** Before discovering the artifact, Thea Krumins was a skilled contortionist and acrobat. She loved performing and pushing herself to new limits. However, after gaining powers from the Devourer's Heart, she's developed an intense fascination with ancient mythology, magic, and the occult.

Thea is also driven by a desire to understand her newfound abilities and how to control them. She spends most of her time researching and experimenting, often taking great risks in the process. Her obsession with reversing the effects of the artifact has led her to become increasingly focused on finding a solution, even if it means putting herself in danger.

Despite this fixation, Thea still holds onto a deep love for performance and creativity. She dreams of one day returning to her life as a contortionist and acrobat, but for now, she's willing to do whatever it takes to reclaim her humanity.
